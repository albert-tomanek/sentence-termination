1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,380
Hey Chris, watcha doing?

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,540
Just playing with my stackable plastic bricks

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,700
from China.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,700
You know...

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,900
Captain America, on a motorcycle.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,500
Iron Man, on a motorcycle.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,820
Thor, on a motorcycle.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,900
Hulk, on a motorcycle.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,390
And Superman, on a motorcycle.

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,390
Wait...

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,330
what is Superman doing here?

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,900
He's on a motorcycle, Matt.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,099
I mean, he's not part of...

14
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:29,099
nevermind.

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,360
Where did you get these?

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,360
Asia.

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,480
That’s hilarious.

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,680
Oh, you don’t know the half of it.

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,270
These aren’t even in my top 10.

20
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,990
Wait - you have a top 10 list of LEGO knockoffs?

21
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,390
Oh yeah…

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,820
Number 10

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,870
From Chinese toymaker XINH

24
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,010
comes this lovely set of

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,630
Superman fighting Lex Luthor.

26
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,110
With a gun.

27
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,660
That shoots...kryptonite?

28
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,390
Why would Superman have this gun?

29
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,430
He wouldn't even be able to touch kryptonite!

30
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,720
Speaking of things that make very little sense...

31
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,630
Number 9

32
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,640
Heroes Assemble!

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,470
It’s Superman with robot limbs!

34
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,380
Wait, would robot limbs make Superman

35
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,080
more power or less powerful than normal?

36
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,580
Oh, wait.

37
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,930
This isn’t Superman.

38
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,930
It’s...

39
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,070
Super Batman.

40
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,730
But that super Batman is not nearly as cool
as...

41
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,979
Number 8

42
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,100
Bat Hero!

43
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,260
And his arch-nemesis...

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Clown!

45
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,640
Look, you can’t just change the name slightly—

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,119
and that somehow makes it not copyright infringement!

47
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,630
Like...

48
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,630
Number 7

49
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,630
LAGO.

50
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,630
OK.

51
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,490
That’s a little too close to the LEGO logo.

52
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,979
But since the real LEGO brand

53
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,240
doesn’t make Ultraman minifigures,

54
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,060
someone’s gotta do it, right?

55
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,369
I mean, he is “The Embodiment of Justice
Hero.”

56
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:56,540
Number 6

57
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,909
Now those LAGOs were pretty cool.

58
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,469
But this Chinese knockoff is just...

59
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:03,860
OK.

60
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,080
Not nearly as cool as...

61
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,170
Number 5

62
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,470
Fear the powerful Empire!

63
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,560
It’s...

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,969
Star Wabs.

65
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:15,260
Number 4

66
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,200
Super Weapon Submarine.

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,580
I think it’s a Chinese knockoff

68
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,639
of America’s underwater scientific drone.

69
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,480
But judging from those blaster weapons,

70
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,200
it’s definitely not there to simply measure

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,269
oceanic conditions, am I right?

72
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,269
Number 3

73
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,959
The Simpsons.

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,040
I don’t think they got permission from LEGO

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,090
or Matt Groening.

76
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,269
Yeah, Maggie looks concerned

77
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,409
about a possible copyright lawsuit.

78
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:42,469
Number 2

79
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:43,989
But this one should be fine, right?

80
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,790
It’s totally not a knockoff of Disney’s

81
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,959
Sleeping Beauty!

82
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,059
It’s “Dream: Sleeping Girl”!

83
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,529
Complete with a giant dull spindle.

84
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,109
And Number 1

85
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,959
Why buy LEGO Minecraft,

86
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,469
complete with Steve and Zombie,

87
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:01,860
when you can buy LELE My World,

88
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,499
complete with Steve and Zmbie.

89
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,900
Look, you can even build your own “oreations”

90
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,079
with inspiration “inoluded.”

91
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,489
While all those may simply be amusing

92
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,599
to most of us,

93
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,449
LEGO is taking knockoffs very seriously.

94
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,299
The LEGO Group has sued

95
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,029
a number of competitors,

96
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,650
including most recently a Chinese company

97
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,480
called LEPIN.

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,260
Which really should be sued by Star Wars instead,
right?

99
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,590
Unless Star Wnrs is a totally different movie.

100
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,890
So what do you think?

101
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,480
Leave your comments below.

102
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,580
And if you want to see more crazy and fun
stuff

103
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,450
from China that doesn’t make it into our
episodes,

104
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,269
follow us on Facebook.

105
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,060
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

106
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
And I'm Matt Gnaizda.

107
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,120
See you next time!
