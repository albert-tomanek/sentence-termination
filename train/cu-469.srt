1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:02,840
According to recent wargames.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,950
The US Military gets crushed by China and
Russia

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,550
It’s a Major anniversary for Tibet

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,510
And the Chinese regime is cracking down on

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,250
more religious believers

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,060
That and more fun stuff

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,600
on this week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,040
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,080
I’m Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,050
each time we publish a new episode.

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,480
This week’s China news headlines!

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,929
The US spends about 600 billion dollars a
year on the military.

17
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,000
More than the next 7 biggest spending countries
combined.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,410
All right!

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,440
USA number one!!!

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,519
So that means the US can win any war, right?

21
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:52,409
The answer is...uhh, maybe not?

22
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:56,359
That’s at least according to recent wargames.

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,280
The simulation was US, or blue forces,

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,499
against China and Russia, or red forces.

25
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,320
Very appropriate color choices.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,149
In our games when we fight China or Russia

27
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:13,009
and we've written about this in unclassified
forms,

28
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,689
blue gets its ass handed to it,

29
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,789
not to put too fine a point on it.

30
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:17,789
We lose a lot of people,

31
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,860
we lose a lot of equipment and we usually

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,469
fail to achieve our objective

33
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,280
of preventing aggression by the adversary,

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,820
which is a headline.

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,130
Uhh, yeah, it is.

36
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,150
In fact, here’s that headline.

37
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,240
Now I know you might be shocked by this.

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,130
Don’t worry, you wouldn’t be the only
one.

39
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,570
The House Armed Services Committee was also
shocked.

40
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,219
“The members of Congress who are on

41
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:44,759
the House Armed Services Committee in the
SAS

42
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,500
they were shocked they were going holy moly

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,689
I didn't have any idea it was this bad.”

44
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,619
“Holy moly I didn’t have any idea it was
this bad?!”

45
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,299
I mean, “I didn’t have any idea it was
this bad”

46
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,179
is not what I want the House Armed Services
Committee saying!

47
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:02,640
So why is it so bad?

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,909
It turns out, if the US were to get into

49
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,819
a conventional war with Russia or China,

50
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,800
US bases, and in particular

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,440
their satellite and communications network,

52
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,900
are vulnerable in ways the US is not prepared
to deal with.

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,120
Take, for example, the F-35.

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,630
It’s an unstoppable 100 million dollar warplane...

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,690
that becomes pretty much useless

56
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,360
if a Russian or Chinese ballistic missile

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,780
blows up the aircraft carrier it’s sitting
on.

58
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,050
In every case that I know of the F-35

59
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,450
rules the sky when it's in the sky

60
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,060
but it gets killed on the ground in large
numbers.

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,600
So in the first five days of the campaign

62
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,150
we're looking really good

63
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,790
but after the second five days

64
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,450
it's not looking so hot.

65
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,620
Those are the things that the wargames show

66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,650
over and over and over

67
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,750
and so we need a new American Way of war,

68
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,070
without question.”

69
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,950
At this point I’d just like to say,

70
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,310
I for one, welcome our Russian and/or Chinese
overlords.

71
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,820
I’d like to remind them that as a trusted
TV personality,

72
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,760
I can be helpful in rounding up others

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,420
to toil in their underground uranium mines.

74
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,870
So what would this new American way of war
look like?

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,420
Well, for the low, low price

76
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,760
of just $24 billion dollars more a year,

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,480
you can find out!

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,840
For twenty four billion dollars a year

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,630
I will assert that if we focus that on the
right stuff

80
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,780
we can move the needle against China and Russia.

81
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,760
What’s the right stuff?

82
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,650
Mostly missiles apparently.

83
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,260
Including missiles to shoot down enemy missiles
and drones.

84
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,380
But it would also include research and development,

85
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,500
as well as hardening US communications networks.

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,730
Because, as was pointed out,

87
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,880
you can spend all you want to get

88
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,730
as many planes in the air and ships in the
sea,

89
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,020
but a billion dollar ship that sinks

90
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,960
because you didn’t cough up for a million
dollar decoy

91
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,990
is probably not good.

92
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,990
But I get it,

93
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,020
$24 billion dollars is a lot to add to our
defense budget.

94
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,380
That’s why I have my own foolproof plan.

95
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,460
I can simply use my security blanket.

96
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,750
Since I was a little boy,

97
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,460
all I’ve had to do was hide under it

98
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,810
and then the bad things can’t get me.

99
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,810
Which is why I’m going to do

100
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,320
the rest of the show underneath it.

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,700
This week marks...

102
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,530
what’s that Shelley?

103
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,570
Fine, I’ll take it off.

104
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,400
For a few minutes.

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,620
This week marks the 60th anniversary

106
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,010
of the Dalai Lama’s escape from China in
1959.

107
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,620
Obviously this anniversary was marked

108
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,120
by protests and demonstrations from Tibetans

109
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,500
all over the world.

110
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,120
And the Communist Party continues to say

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
it did nothing wrong in Tibet.

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,240
State-run Xinhua said life is so much better
in Tibet now

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,620
since the Communist Party took power,

114
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,150
and that the Dalai Lama’s “separatist
plots

115
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,190
are doomed to total failure.”

116
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,550
Shelley, are you sure I can’t do the episode

117
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,890
under my blankie?

118
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,760
Fine.

119
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,280
The US Ambassador-at-Large

120
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,290
for International Religious Freedom

121
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,060
says the Chinese regime is at war with faith.

122
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,370
In a recent visit to Hong Kong,

123
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,510
Sam Brownback criticized the Chinese regime’s

124
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,610
persecution of the Uighur ethnic minority
of Xinjiang.

125
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,940
“The Trump administration is deeply concerned

126
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,850
and considered it a deliberate attempt by
Beijing

127
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,510
to redefine and control these Muslim minority
groups,

128
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,020
[their] identity, culture and faith.”

129
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,670
Brownback also called out the situation in
concentration camps

130
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,480
where more than a million Uighurs are being
held.

131
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,200
“We’ve been putting out very clearly that
this is

132
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,180
a horrific situation that’s taking place
in Xinjiang,”

133
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,240
But that’s ridiculous,

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
according to Chinese state-run media.

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,590
They’re not concentration camps.

136
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,040
They’re concentration camps!

137
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,130
Where Uighurs can concentrate,

138
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,800
on learning job skills!

139
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,520
“The centers are targeting the source of
Xinjiang's

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,190
violent incidents with jobs and education.”

141
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,450
Hmm, looks more like a sweatshop.

142
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,150
But yes, these vocational training skills

143
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,920
are combating Muslim extremism.

144
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,340
I mean, you don’t know how bad it was in
Xinjiang

145
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,370
before these camps.

146
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,370
“In southern areas of the Xinjiang Uighur
Autonomous region,

147
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,200
women were not even allowed to wear

148
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,890
a dress or wear makeup.”

149
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,640
Wow, sounds just like the rest of China

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,600
during the Cultural Revolution.

151
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,860
That wasn’t extremism!

152
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,650
So clearly the West is just twisting things

153
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,550
to undermine China.

154
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,550
In his speech, Brownback also talked about

155
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,750
the persecution of Christians.

156
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,400
But that’s justified, because Western powers

157
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,320
are trying to use Christianity to subvert
China.

158
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,510
At least, according to the head of

159
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,730
the Communist Party-run official Protestant
church.

160
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,530
And for Christians who don’t belong to state
approved churches—

161
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,220
the Communist Party is shutting their churches
down,

162
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,510
jailing their pastors,

163
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,610
and even rewriting the Bible.

164
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,850
Brownback basically called out the fact that

165
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,590
“The Chinese government attacks

166
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,169
believers of nearly every faith,

167
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,020
in every region of China.”

168
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,900
But that’s just because the Communist Party

169
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,449
is trying to fill out their religious persecution
Bingo card.

170
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,830
In addition to the Uighurs and Christians,

171
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,480
Brownback talked about how the Party

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,169
is persecuting Tibetans and Falun Gong practitioners.

173
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,330
Only one more and they get Bingo!

174
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,270
Who will the lucky group be?

175
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,270
What?

176
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,270
Zoroastrianism?

177
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,640
Well that’s not going to work.

178
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,699
I guess they’ll just have to start over

179
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,540
and keep persecuting until they win.

180
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,580
Of course you won’t hear about that

181
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,389
on Chinese state-run media.

182
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,669
Especially if you’re in the US.

183
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,639
Because the US head of China’s

184
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,949
state-run CCTV has left the US.

185
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:40,949
Her name is Ma Jing.

186
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,919
I think it’s time to update her LinkedIn
profile

187
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,800
to “fled the country”

188
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,610
On CCTV’s American TV broadcast,

189
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,229
it goes by CGTN—

190
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,680
or China Global Television Network.

191
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Change the name,

192
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,610
and no one will find out what it really is,
mwhaha.

193
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,540
The CGTN headquarters in the US is in Washington
DC,

194
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,020
about 7 blocks from the White House

195
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,979
CGTN reaches 30 million households in the
US.

196
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,340
But the Justice Department has been asking
CGTN

197
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,419
some pretty uncomfortable questions

198
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,430
about its links to the Chinese state.

199
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,010
CGTN has maintained the Chinese government

200
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,460
absolutely does not tell them what to broadcast!

201
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,520
Sure, their news stories have to meet

202
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,850
the state censorship guidelines,

203
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,419
and they have no independence,

204
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:33,219
but technically that’s not the same thing!

205
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,430
The issue is,

206
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,099
according to the Foreign Agents Registration
Act,

207
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,889
Ma Jing needed to disclose

208
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:42,219
her working relationship with the Communist
Party.

209
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,369
But that’s hard, because the Communist Party

210
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:47,240
likes to keep those relationships kind of
secret.

211
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,269
I mean, it’s not soft power

212
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,649
if it's all exposed to the sun light

213
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:52,930
for everyone to see.

214
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,610
It kind of, dries out and gets crumbly.

215
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,290
So the answer is simple.

216
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,730
Flee the country.

217
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,509
Works every time.

218
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,600
And before you go, now is the time I answer
a question

219
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,629
from a member of the China Uncensored 50-Cent
Army—

220
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:10,329
fans who support the show with a dollar or
more per episode

221
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:13,160
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

222
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,730
BlueFox asks,

223
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,629
“Chris, does the US have any counters

224
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,839
to the Chinese and Russian as well as other
countries

225
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,610
threat of EMP weapons?”

226
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,220
Well, as we learned today,

227
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,399
the US may not be so prepared for that.

228
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,829
China and Russia are building electromagnetic
pulse,

229
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,050
or EMP, weapons.

230
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,350
Basically they disrupt electronic equipment.

231
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,200
Which is why this American only relies on
his guns.

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,940
And I’ve got excellent gun control.

233
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,200
But for the rest of the US military,

234
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,170
or even the entire infrastructure of the United
States,

235
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,760
EMP weapons present a serious potential problem.

236
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,290
Obviously I don’t know the details

237
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,839
of the inner workings of the US military.

238
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,220
But since this is such a widely known issue,

239
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,970
I can only assume some kind of steps are being
taken.

240
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,100
But we won’t know how successful they are

241
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,920
until as they say, push comes to shove.

242
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,800
Which is why,

243
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,740
in the worst case scenario,

244
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
I have a surefire fallback.

245
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,740
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

246
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,160
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

247
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,640
See you next time.
