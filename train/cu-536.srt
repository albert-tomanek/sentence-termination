00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,780
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,760
namaste or nama go now?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,340
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,660
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,660
Over the last few months,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,740
I’ve been covering the military standoff

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,390
between Chinese and Indian troops

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,090
along their border.

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,690
Chinese state-run media had been threatening
war,

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,220
saying the conflict will get worse

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,950
if India doesn’t back off.

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,300
And that if not, war is inevitable.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, something terrible has just happened.

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,620
India’s new defense minister is wrecking
the inevitable war

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,170
by directly approaching Chinese troops at
the border—

16
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,479
with kindness and understanding.

17
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,870
Just look at this video!

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,540
Do you know what Namaste means?

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,020
What would you say in Chinese?

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,940
We just say Ni Hao.

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,800
So I say Namaste.

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,900
Ni Hao.

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,540
It’s as if she views Chinese soldiers

24
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:02,889
as fellow human beings

25
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:05,519
equally deserving of love and respect!

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,119
How are they going to kill each other now?

27
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,530
No one is more upset, I think,

28
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,750
than my favorite Chinese state-run media,

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,750
the Global Times.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,840
It’s hard to say namaste to war.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,509
Fortunately, damage was contained.

32
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,000
That video was posted on Twitter, after all.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,280
And Twitter is banned in China.

34
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,980
What’s that, Shelley?

35
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,119
Chinese people saw it anyway?

36
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,179
And according to the Times of India,

37
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:32,280
they went “gaga” over it.

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,979
Which seems like maybe overstating it slightly.

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,310
Since they quoted all of two people on the
internet.

40
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,729
But the Global Times didn’t let this positive
reaction

41
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,460
trip them up for long!

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,549
They referred to the namaste incident,

43
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,460
as a an expression of her “goodwill.”

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,110
If you look at what the expert said, it’s
actually pretty positive.

45
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,579
But putting it in scare quotes sure makes
it seem sinister, doesn’t it?

46
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,560
Because let me tell you something about

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,259
Indian Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

48
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,700
She’d like you to think she’s all “namaste.”

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,259
But while she was on the border,

50
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,280
she also inspected a nearby airport.

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,620
Yeah!

52
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,780
Which was totally...

53
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,300
what was it again Global Times?

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
An “aggressive gesture,”

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,790
right, got it.

56
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,660
And how about an accusation of some kind?

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,740
Ah, perfect.

58
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,700
I mean, yeah India?

59
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,780
Why are you so paranoid?

60
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,340
Is it because a thousand Chinese troops

61
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,290
just returned to the site of that border dispute?

62
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,450
To continue working on the road

63
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,819
that could help the Chinese army invade India
someday?

64
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,400
The road that was the cause of the border
standoff

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,610
in the first place?

66
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,400
I mean, to be fair,

67
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,159
they’re only widening the existing road,

68
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,769
not making it longer.

69
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,780
Totally different.

70
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,140
Or are you paranoid because the Chinese regime

71
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,170
is withholding monsoon data that could be
critical

72
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,709
to saving the lives of Indian citizens?

73
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,629
Or, are you paranoid

74
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,560
because the Chinese regime is selling weapons

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
to your long-time rival Pakistan?

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,709
Or is it because they’re setting up ports

77
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,290
that could give the Chinese navy

78
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,299
easy access to the Indian Ocean?

79
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,200
Surely it’s none of those things.

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,209
Because you’ve got to trust the Global Times
when it says,

81
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,140
“India is not a major focus

82
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,160
for China’s strategic ambition.”

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,720
Yup.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,900
Not at all.

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,500
Because it’s not like China and India

86
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,360
are in a competition or anything.

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,790
Even though they both are the most populous

88
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,489
economic powerhouses in Asia.

89
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,930
Okay, well...

90
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,240
the Chinese regime may be a bit jealous that

91
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,090
Chinese people seem to love Indian culture
so much.

92
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,610
Since “One of the most popular movies

93
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,560
in China over the summer,”

94
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,260
was the Bollywood hit Dangal.

95
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,489
And obviously there’s a little bit of competition

96
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,489
in the Indian Ocean.

97
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,430
India is looking to buy US drones

98
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,590
to counter all the Chinese navy activity there.

99
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,189
And President Trump does seem to favor

100
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,989
selling weapons to India.

101
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,629
And who could forget the competition

102
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,520
of which world leader would go first?

103
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,640
After you!

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,400
No, after you!

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,939
You know, maybe state-run Chinese media

106
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,280
don’t have much to worry about.

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Namaste.

108
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,630
And coming up after the break,

109
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,950
China is ramping up its weapons sales,

110
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,780
but the result isn’t quite what you would
expect.

111
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,560
You know I hear Chinese leader Xi Jinping

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,830
is actually really into yoga.

113
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,590
He’s favorite pose?

114
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,750
The downward Pooh Bear.

115
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,310
If you want more great jokes like that one,

117
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,560
It’s a laugh riot!
