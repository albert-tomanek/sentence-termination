00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,080
and welcome to China Uncensored.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,460
This is the third fan meet-up we have ever had,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,820
and we're doing it now at YouTube Space New York.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,140
This is a little more professional than that

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,820
hole-in-the-wall dumpling place we did in Hong Kong,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,420
Mama Deng's Dumplings,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,860
which was fantastic,

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,780
but things are coming along.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,580
Matt has gone mad with power.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,100
he's printed everyone name tags.

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,700
Muahahahahaha!!!

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,400
I'll try to fire him...

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,400
He even printed me out a custom name tag.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,720
Thank you, Matt.

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,420
Thank you, we're very professional here.

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,680
So, with this level of professionalism and respect being given to me,

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,380
I'm sure this fan meet-up will go swimmingly.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,760
What's it like to be a undercover CIA operative

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,360
trying to undermine China?

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,080
I'm very happy to answer that,

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,760
but I will have to kill all of you here if I answer that.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,500
So is that okay?

24
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,760
Bloopers? I've never made a mistake...

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,720
I mean, people shouldn't say, you know,

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,660
"Free Tibet, or free Taiwan, Hong Kong..."

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,420
It's all of China that needs to be freed from the Communist Party.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,280
The U.S. lifted a 50-year arms embargo

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,680
on which of China's neighbors?

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,600
Vietnam.

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,980
Great. Which would you like?

32
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,500
Poster.

33
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,000
Poster!

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,580
Whoever gets this will have a real collector's item.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,160
It's even autographed by me.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,720
You can use that to forge my signature,

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,040
steal my identity if you'd like...

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,720
Seamus Light!

39
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
Since these are never gonna see the light of day,

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,460
I might as well just read a few...

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
"Horror at China's Human Meat Market!"

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,980
This is one I personally find the most terrifying...

43
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,400
"Inside Jiang Zemin's Mouth."

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,820
Just so you know, the prompter is not up yet.

45
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,180
So if we could just keep the applause going until...

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,960
On this episode of China Uncensored,

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,500
I am rubber and you are...

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,060
one of the most powerful politicians in the world...

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,740
Uh, actually Chris...

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
What's that, Shelley?
