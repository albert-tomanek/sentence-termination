1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,000
The US-China Trade Deal is getting postponed...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
again.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,930
Battle at the UN

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,500
And all your favorite Chinese knock off toys!

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,840
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,460
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,460
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,630
This week’s China news headlines!

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,670
Hey, you know that trade deal President Trump
said

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,589
he wanted to sign with China?

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,210
Well...it still needs a little work.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,300
According to a US official,

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,430
the deal just isn’t ready to even be put
on the table.

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,340
Which is a good thing because the APEC meeting

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,490
where the deal was going to be signed has
been cancelled.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,810
I’m surprised.

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:50,050
I wonder why Chile canceled it.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,780
But hey, this isn’t Chile Uncensored.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,640
So back to China.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,790
The US and 22 other countries are criticizing
China in the UN.

21
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,500
It’s mainly about the Chinese regime

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,280
building concentration camps for the Uighurs,

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,620
a Muslim ethnic minority.

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,819
But do you really think getting criticized
by 23 countries

25
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,679
is going to faze China?

26
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:10,679
Ha!

27
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,659
China’s fought back with 54 countries

28
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,829
who praised their counter terrorism efforts.

29
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,780
It’s like the UN version of the Sharks and
the Jets.

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,159
But hey, those 54 countries have a point.

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,729
The Chinese regime is obviously locking people
up

32
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,360
in order to safeguard their human rights.

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,399
I mean, is there anywhere you could be

34
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,969
more safeguarded than in prisons?!

35
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,649
Unsurprisingly many of these 54 countries

36
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:39,490
are known for their own stellar human rights.

37
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,490
Like Russia.

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,490
And Egypt.

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,490
And Pakistan.

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,299
China then also reminded the US

41
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,130
that talking about human rights

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,539
is really not helpful for a trade deal.

43
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,770
Really, I don’t think the Communist Party

44
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,630
gets the change the US government’s China
policy.

45
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,959
Whatever happened to the good old days

46
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,599
of don't criticize us and you’ll make lots
of money?

47
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,329
Speaking of lots of money,

48
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,329
China wants it!

49
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,990
It might have something to do with

50
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,119
China’s lowest GDP growth in 27 years.

51
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,860
And that’s why the Chinese Vice Minister
of Commerce

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,380
is saying China is open for business!

53
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,790
He says China will allow more foreign investment,

54
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,970
and hey, we won’t steal your technology
anymore.

55
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,350
Which is kind of like saying,

56
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,250
“Yeah we stole from you in the past,

57
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,480
even though we lied and said we wouldn’t—

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,690
but this time we’re not gonna.

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,040
Pinky swear.

60
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,780
So hand over the money.”

61
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,420
Which means now's the time to do business
in China.

62
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,790
Seriously, there’s like a billion people
there,

63
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,860
think about how much money you can make!

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,430
And this time there’s no downside!

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:51,760
Fool me once...shame on... shame on you.

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
Fool me, can’t get fooled again.

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,870
In related news, Senator Marco Rubio

68
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,340
and other lawmakers are hitting China hard!

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,790
With a bill to block government pensions

70
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,820
from investing in China.

71
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,841
To be clear, US government pensions

72
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:08,330
are not currently investing in China...

73
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,180
but they’re thinking about it.

74
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,680
Rubio’s bill is...not so much a bill yet,

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,390
as it is a promise to introduce a bill...

76
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,180
which will then would be debated for months
in committee,

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,230
and then it might get voted on,

78
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,490
and possibly even passed,

79
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,860
and then it’ll have to go through

80
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,860
the House of Representatives for a rewrite

81
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,780
and then another vote...but I tell ya,

82
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,980
a year or two from now

83
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,850
it’s possible it could become a law.

84
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,800
So watch out, China!

85
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,180
Our government’s got fangs.

86
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,690
But from another perspective,

87
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,560
IT’S ABSOLUTELY INSANE

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,261
THAT US GOVERNMENT PENSIONS

89
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,410
WOULD INVEST IN CHINA.

90
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,150
Who thought that would be a good idea?!

91
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,400
What’s that, Shelley?

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,980
Oh, the same brilliant financial minds

93
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,690
that told everyone else to invest in China.

94
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,310
What could go wrong.

95
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,250
Yesterday was Halloween.

96
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,280
And in Hong Kong,

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,830
the scariest things on the streets were the
Hong Kong police.

98
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,560
Yeah, I’ll take zombies over that any day.

99
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,150
Over the last four months,

100
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,960
Hong Kong police have gotten so scary,

101
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,070
that the Apple Daily even printed a cut-out
police mask

102
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,500
so you can traumatize all of your friends.

103
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,750
But Hongkongers learned a valuable lesson
this Halloween.

104
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,960
Never try to trick or treat in front of the
police.

105
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
Because it’s always gonna be a trick.

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Ouch.

107
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
You might be wondering how

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,220
all those anti-authoritarian protests in Hong
Kong

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,720
actually get organized,

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,930
since the movement seems to have no leaders.

111
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,160
Well, it’s often done through online forums

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,340
and messaging apps.

113
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,640
The most popular app being used is Telegram,

114
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,090
while the most popular online forum is called
LIHKG,

115
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,060
which is like Reddit.

116
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,520
Parts of Reddit.

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,790
The Hong Kong government is now

118
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,410
targeting Telegram and LIHKG.

119
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,410
By giving itself the power

120
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,190
to “stop online users from publishing any
material

121
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,070
deemed to be promoting or inciting violence.”

122
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,750
I imagine “promoting or inciting violence”

123
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,440
would include, for example, organizing a peaceful
protest

124
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,510
where police decide to pepper spray innocent
people in the face.

125
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,320
That man clearly incited the police officer
to violence.

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,750
China is doing its part to clean up the oceans.

127
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,370
By filling them up with plastic.

128
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,040
China’s ocean waste surged last year.

129
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,730
And that’s according to official data,

130
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,960
so it might be even more.

131
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,370
How is that cleaning up the ocean?

132
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,470
Simple.

133
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,940
If the ocean is filled up,

134
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,530
you can just sweep the excess off the top.

135
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,530
Hey, look!

136
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,530
It’s my favorite DZB Character, Gokok.

137
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,790
Wait a minute, something’s not right.

138
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,160
Oh no, it’s a Chinese knockoff!

139
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,800
Just one of a million fake toys seized in
Shanghai.

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,360
There was a whole factory devoted to making
knockoffs

141
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,070
of Pokemon, One Piece, Gundams and more.

142
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,270
At least they didn’t rip off my favorite
videogame character,

143
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,270
Korby.

144
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,590
The raid seized 42 million dollars worth of
knock offs.

145
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,140
Now this actually happened back in August,

146
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,300
but this is the first I heard of it,

147
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,500
so I’m sharing it with you.

148
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,190
Bandai Namco was so happy about it,

149
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,130
they even rewarded Shanghai police with this—

150
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,160
a golden unicorn Gundam.

151
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,210
About the only thing rarer than a golden unicorn
Gundam,

152
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,470
is a 67 year old woman giving birth.

153
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,840
Yawn.

154
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,930
Last month an Indian woman gave birth to twins
at 73.

155
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,610
And with that stunning conclusion,

156
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,320
it’s now time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

157
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,169
a fan who support China Uncensored

158
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,930
with a dollar or more per episode,

159
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,639
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

160
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,169
Emmitt A Ray asks,

161
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:54,080
“When do you think China's massive imbalance
of boys to girls

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,150
is going to hit the boiling point?

163
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,120
It seems they are putting men around the world

164
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,889
on construction projects to keep them out
of China

165
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,470
and not thinking about their chances

166
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,740
of getting married and having a family.

167
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,970
At some point that seems like a rebellion
waiting to happen.”

168
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,580
Oh boy, what a question.

169
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,280
So in case you hadn’t heard,

170
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,110
there are 30 million more men in China than
women.

171
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,210
It’s such an issue even state-run media
talk about it

172
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,320
That my friends is the result of government
population planning

173
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,550
known as the One Child Policy.

174
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,120
Don’t worry,

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,150
China is trying to deal with this in a variety
of, well,

176
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,500
shortsighted or terrible ways.

177
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
As you mention,

178
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,940
shipping off a lot of Chinese men

179
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,540
as part of construction projects around the
world

180
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,919
as part of the Belt and Road initiative.

181
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,710
Then there’s things like forcing Uighur
women

182
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,040
to marry Han Chinese men.

183
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,740
And this shortage of women is also a big part
of why

184
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,120
China is a world leader in human trafficking.

185
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,479
North Korean refugees in particular are victims.

186
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,520
As are women from Southeast Asia.

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,290
So as horrible as it is to say,

188
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,110
the Communist Party may have found ways

189
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,850
to avoid the problem hitting a boiling point.

190
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,690
In the way they handle most things.

191
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,550
By creating other problems

192
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,560
that will one day hit a boiling point.

193
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,060
But don’t worry!

194
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,940
Those are problems for another day.

195
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,590
Thanks for your question, Emmitt.

196
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,100
Most of China Uncensord’s income

197
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,180
comes from direct viewer support through Patreon.

198
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,120
So as a reward to our supporters,

199
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,850
I answer a question from our Patrons

200
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,880
at the end of some of my episodes.

201
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,500
Visit patreon.com/chinauncensored to find

202
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,520
Thanks for watching.

203
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,080
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

204
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,820
See you next time.
