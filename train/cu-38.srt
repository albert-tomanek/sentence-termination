00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,720
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,420
China’s on the rise!

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,920
I mean, look at all the glittering skyscrapers!

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,460
There couldn’t possibly be some horrible,

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,080
horrible downside...

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,760
Hi. Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,580
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,910
China loves building skyscrapers.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,390
Because nothing screams communist utopia

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,010
like the giant gap between rich and poor.

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,860
China is now the world leader in skyscraper
construction.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,489
About fifteen years ago, China started

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,440
filling up with 10-to-30-story buildings—

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
mostly residential—

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,519
in first, second, and third-tier cities.

16
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:43,549
But in recent years, skyscraper construction

17
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,979
has gone through the roof,

18
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,019
or the clouds, or whatever.

19
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:51,440
According to the Council on Tall Buildings
and Urban Habitat,

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,409
China has constructed more tall buildings
than

21
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,839
any other country every year for nearly a
decade.

22
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,839
They just can’t quit!

23
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,579
And as of 2018, among the 10 tallest buildings
in the world,

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,769
half of them are in China.

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,000
In fact, that first one, the Shanghai Tower,

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,729
is second in height only to that

27
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,960
Mission Impossible building in Dubai.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,640
It’s called the Shanghai Tower and it’s
located in—

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,469
well the name kind of gives it away.

30
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,390
Any similarity to the Eye of Sauron is purely
coincidental.

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,390
But there’s another similarity

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,439
between Sauron’s tower and the Shanghai
Tower.

33
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,370
While both are impressive sights to behold
at a distance—

34
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,420
not many people actually want to rent space
there.

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,850
The Financial Review had called the Shanghai
tower

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,079
a “ghost tower with 55 vacant floors”

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,790
...because less than two years after it was
unveiled,

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,990
only about 60% of the office space had been
rented out.

39
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,590
After four years, it’s now just 80% occupied—

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,000
and has still failed to attract multinational
companies.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,869
According to CNBC, the Shanghai Tower’s
rental woes

42
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:56,909
reflect wider problems in China’s real estate
market.

43
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,100
Just because you build it,

44
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,100
doesn’t mean they will come.

45
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
“With more and more skyscrapers in Shanghai,

46
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
in cities in China,

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,179
the vacancy will remain very high for some
time,”

48
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,149
says Anny Zhang, who does office leasing

49
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,769
for one of the agents for Shanghai Tower.

50
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,700
But there’s more at stake than just the
prospect

51
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,620
of a few real estate developers going belly
up.

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,209
Vikram Mansharamani,

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,400
author of the book “Boombustology:

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,930
Spotting Financial Bubbles Before They Burst,”

55
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,459
says that building very tall skyscrapers

56
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,760
is strongly correlated with investment bubbles.

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
He analysed historical trends and concluded

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,940
that skyscraper-building is

59
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,819
“one of the most robust bubble indicators
over long time periods.”

60
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:37,409
Especially the construction of supertall skyscrapers.

61
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,620
China already has half of the world’s tallest
skyscrapers

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,240
and doesn’t look like it’s slowing down
in its ambitions.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Construction has already begun

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,540
on Shimao Shenzhen-Hong Kong International
Center,

65
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,870
which could upstage the Shanghai Tower.

66
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,400
The Boombustology author says

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,970
“you can think of the world's tallest skyscrapers

68
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,140
as indicators of lofty overconfidence”

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,110
and “a spectacular indicator of bubbly conditions.”

70
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,970
And not the good kind of bubbly conditions.

71
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,030
Dinny McMahon, author of “China’s Great
Wall of Debt,”

72
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,849
says Chinese officials pumped the bubble

73
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,459
up to ginormous proportions—

74
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,879
that’s the technical term—

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,329
using money borrowed from state-owned banks.

76
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,620
“Local governments around the country tried
to

77
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,849
juice and stimulate their economies

78
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:21,470
by building more infrastructure

79
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,510
and stimulating the property market,” he
said.

80
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,799
But while the growth model may not be sustainable
forever,

81
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,189
there are powerful incentives

82
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,430
to keep it going as long as possible.

83
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,790
Because this kind of construction is commonly

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,930
the result of cronyism in which investors,

85
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,230
builders, and other players are ‘insiders’
who profit from it.

86
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,459
And just like karaoke and Maotai liquor,

87
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,170
it’s a tough habit for corrupt Chinese officials
to give up.

88
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,569
But even if you can overlook crony capitalism
and bad investments,

89
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,269
there’s a whole other problem with China’s
building boom:

90
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,909
Low quality construction.

91
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,840
It shouldn’t surprise you that the same
environment

92
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,620
famous for cheap knockoffs like Crust toothpaste...

93
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,159
...Nintendo Polystation

94
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,549
and of course every child’s favorite toy,
Robert Cop!

95
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,730
...is also home to cheap quality construction.

96
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,739
Like this building in Shenyang,

97
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,110
where part of a building just...peels off.Or
this one in Shanghai that simply...fell over

98
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,110
one day.

99
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,210
I’m glad I didn’t buy a condo in that
building.

100
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,580
Now this may not have happened so far

101
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,060
in any of China’s supertall skyscrapers,

102
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,470
but low-quality construction is a major problem
all across China.

103
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,190
Developers cut corners, and a lack of proper
oversight

104
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,110
means builders can often bribe their way

105
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,230
through official inspections.

106
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,290
Like this 65-story high-rise in Tianjin.

107
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,580
The developer had built it through bribes
and corruption,

108
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,470
without getting proper permits.

109
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,860
He had illegally added 30 floors of apartment
units

110
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,780
without factoring in important considerations,
like,

111
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,700
you know, how to deal with the sewage.

112
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,180
But in a crackdown during Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption
campaign,

113
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,070
authorities demolished it.

114
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,790
So ok, China is building too many skyscrapers

115
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,980
that are often unoccupied, potentially unsafe,

116
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,910
and frequently designed to line officials’
pockets.

117
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,140
But do they at least fuel innovation?

118
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,190
Officials in Beijing have talked a lot about

119
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,840
needing to move up the value chain

120
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,970
into more technologically advanced industries.

121
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,730
And they’ve said that the key to sustainable

122
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,290
realignment of the Chinese economy is innovation.

123
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,300
Does building technologically advanced skyscrapers
help?

124
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,310
Not if you believe CityLab.

125
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,750
They write that “skyscraper ‘canyons’
found in Asia’s cities

126
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,150
can create a type of vertical sprawl

127
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,740
that suppresses the innovation

128
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,670
that comes from street-level interaction.”

129
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,240
CityLab says that the most innovative districts
in the world

130
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
are older industrial neighborhoods,

131
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,960
like Cambridge—near M.I.T.—

132
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,210
and areas adjacent to downtown San Francisco,

133
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,030
where there’s an abundance of mid-rise,

134
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,180
historic buildings that create street-level
human interaction.

135
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,200
Well, I guess it’s back to the drawing board.

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,610
Too bad Chinese cities destroyed

137
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,730
all their old neighborhoods to build new skyscrapers.

138
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,080
So what do you think about the dark side

139
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,590
of China’s skyscraper boom?

140
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,310
Leave your comments below.

141
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,340
And before you go,

142
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,970
it’s time for me to answer a question

143
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,330
from one of you who supports China Uncensored

144
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,260
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

145
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,070
Timothy Paustian asks:

146
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,050
“Do the Chinese have a large debt bubble?

147
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,050
What do you think will happen

148
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,530
when that debt bubble bursts?”

149
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,500
Good question, Timothy.

150
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,950
Yes, China does have a little bit of debt.

151
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,050
Like, around 10 trillion dollars worth.

152
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,450
And that’s just national debt.

153
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,470
It doesn’t included an additional 6 trillion
in local debt

154
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,750
that doesn’t usually get counted.

155
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,750
Which does make me feel

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,840
slightly better about my student loans.

157
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,730
A lot of local debt goes to finance things
like,

158
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,730
I don’t know, skyscrapers!

159
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,770
But in modern economies,

160
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,500
debt doesn’t necessarily mean imminent economic
collapse.

161
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,130
The US has even more national debt than China,

162
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,730
and our economy is probably not in any serious
bubble.

163
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,830
Will China have a financial crisis?

164
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,810
Probably yes, at some point.

165
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,530
But it’s impossible to predict when,

166
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,650
or what event will knock over the first domino.

167
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,270
It could be the bursting of the real estate
bubble.

168
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,270
And if that happens,

169
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,000
China’s economy might end up looking like
this.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or this.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,840
