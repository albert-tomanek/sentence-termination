00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,150
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,280
Trade War tit for tat,

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,930
Who says re-education is a bad thing?

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,450
And finally, everyone sells out Taiwan!

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,960
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,720
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,660
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,500
There was an explosion on Thursday afternoon

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,670
outside the US Embassy in Beijing. According
to the Embassy,

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,090
it was set off by one guy with a bomb,

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,750
and he only injured himself.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,570
There’s no word yet on what motive

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,190
the 26-year-old bomber might have had,

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,190
but one thing’s clear:

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,789
He’d didn’t do a very good job of getting
his point across.

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,920
Beijing police are calling it an “isolated
security incident,”

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,809
which means you definitely should not try
to look into it any further.

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,339
But you know who the real threat is?

19
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,889
Chinese citizens who attempt to share information
with journalists.

20
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:54,320
For example, this woman who’s sharing photos

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,019
and video of the incident with journalists
on We Chat.

22
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,809
And now here she is being gently

23
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,079
dragged away by plainclothes police,

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
in\hthis video posted by AFP journalist Becky
Davis.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,890
But don’t worry. Within a few hours,

26
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,280
Chinese censors removed nearly all mentions
of

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,940
the explosion from Chinese social media.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,760
And that solves that.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,360
Anything you might have heard about some kind
of a

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,940
vaccine scandal going on right now in China—

31
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
ignore it!

32
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,060
It’s being totally overblown,

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,300
according to Chinese state-run media.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,350
That’s obviously why Chinese censors have
purged

35
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,030
the word “vaccine” from the entire Chinese
Internet.

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,500
Because again, there’s no story here.

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,000
The editor-in-chief of my favorite Chinese
state-run media,

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,250
the Global Times, criticized the small number
of people

39
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,090
who aren’t focusing on how well the government
is doing

40
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,450
in the face of the scandal.

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,190
I mean, “incident”.

42
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,780
Yeah, like these lame Chinese parents calling

43
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,590
vaccine-makers devils.

44
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,120
A quarter of a million defective vaccines
were given to children

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,150
in China’s Shandong province.

46
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,600
I mean, mistakes happen, right?

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,570
The trade war between the US and China is
in full swing.

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,370
And the Chinese Communist Party is going tit
for tat.

49
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,260
President Trump announces 34 billion dollars
in tariffs.

50
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,010
The Chinese Communist Party announces 34 billion
dollars in tariffs.

51
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,349
Trump hits back with an additional 200 billion
dollars in tariffs.

52
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,770
And the Chinese Communist Party hits back
with...

53
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,329
well, ok, 200 billion dollars is more than
China buys from the US,

54
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,499
so they can’t really match that.

55
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,970
But they still want to hit the US back.

56
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,879
That’s why China’s current 34 billion
in tariffs

57
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,250
aims to specifically punish American farmers.

58
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,980
Not because the Communist Party hates farmers—

59
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,519
but because US farmers tend to be Trump voters.

60
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,010
The Communist Party may not have democracy,

61
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,599
but they sure understand how it works.

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,889
So to counteract the effects of Chinese tariffs,

63
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,310
Trump has announced 12 billion dollars worth
of subsidies.

64
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,489
“The size of the aid package is in line
with the estimated

65
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,629
$11 billion cost of the tariffs to American
farmers.”

66
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,159
And guess what? The Communist Party has its
own aid packages

67
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,750
for Chinese companies hurt by US tariffs.

68
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,999
That would be in addition to all the illegal
subsidies

69
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:19,900
the communist Party already gives to Chinese
companies.

70
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,019
What this all means is,

71
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,599
both sides are hunkering down for a long trade
war.

72
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,629
In other trade war news,

73
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,279
the US and EU are working on a trade deal.

74
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,829
If the US and the EU do strike a deal,

75
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,409
that would give them both more leverage

76
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,730
to focus on trade disputes with China.

77
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,109
As you can imagine, the Chinese regime is
thrilled.

78
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,719
Especially after all the effort they made
to get the EU on their side.

79
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,829
Eat your heart out, Xi Jinping.

80
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,129
Speaking of long, protracted battles,

81
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,480
Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to get Facebook
into China for years.

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,870
And frankly, it’s gotten embarrassing.

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,080
Whether it’s his casual jog through the
Beijing smog,

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,949
or casually leaving a copy of Xi Jinping’s
book

85
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:08,069
prominently on his desk when a Chinese official
comes to visit,

86
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,989
or casually asking Xi Jinping to name his
first-born child...

87
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,790
well, it finally paid off!

88
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,590
Facebook was given permission to open a subsidiary
in China.

89
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,260
It marks a huge breakthrough for the tech
company.

90
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,440
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

91
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,380
It got shut down after one day?!

92
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,920
It turns out that Facebook had gotten permission

93
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,440
from the local provincial government,

94
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,910
but not from the Cyberspace Administration
of China,

95
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,340
which was like...no.

96
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,870
It might be time for Mark Zuckerberg

97
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,000
to realize that Xi Jinping is just not that
into him.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,470
Wow, Xi Jinping and I actually agree on something.

99
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,120
Um... and be sure to follow China Uncensored
on Facebook!

100
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,810
Hey, that’s not hypocritical.

101
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,940
Hypocritical is Chinese state-run media

102
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,010
running their own Facebook pages,

103
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,260
even while Facebook is banned in China.

104
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,850
Speaking of state-run media,

105
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,150
The Global Times has finally confirmed something

106
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,650
we’ve already known for a long time.

107
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,950
The Communist Party has opened re-education
camps in Xinjiang.

108
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,770
But according to the Global Times,

109
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,470
those camps are a good thing!

110
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,310
You see, Xinjiang in western China is home

111
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,170
to the mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority.

112
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:25,030
And anytime the Chinese Communist Party, say,

113
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,190
collects biometric data from millions of people
there,

114
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,740
or forces people to install software on their
phones

115
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,840
that monitors their text messages,

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,080
...and people complain about it,

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,890
it’s because they’re Muslim extremists!

118
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,960
And definitely not because they have

119
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,740
legitimate privacy concerns.

120
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,280
I mean, if you’re not a terrorist,

121
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,140
why would you care about privacy?

122
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,880
That’s why, if you complain, they put you
in prison.

123
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,560
As the Global Times puts it,

124
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,940
“Extremists in prison need to transform
their thoughts.

125
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,830
We have invited experts on religion

126
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,690
to rectify their extremist thinking.”

127
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,400
These “extremists” are told to repeat
phrases like,

128
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,050
“My soul is infected with serious diseases.

129
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,440
There is no God. I don’t believe in God.

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,530
I believe in the Communist Party.”

131
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,530
Now you might think,

132
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,110
with Chinese Muslims being forced to

133
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,110
abandon Allah for Xi Jinping Thought,

134
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,400
the Islamic leaders of the world

135
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,740
would have something to say about it.

136
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,160
Except, they don’t.

137
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,380
Perhaps it’s because “Many Muslim governments

138
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,060
have strengthened their relationship with
China

139
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,220
or even gone out of their way to support China’s
persecution.”

140
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,030
The Chinese Communist Party gave a July 25
deadline

141
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,900
to foreign airlines to stop listing Taiwan

142
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,870
as a separate country-slash-region on their
websites,

143
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,350
or else.

144
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,790
But do you think airlines bowed down to that
Orwellian Nonsense?

145
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,470
Yes. Yes they did.

146
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,940
But apparently, they didn’t bow deeply enough.

147
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,870
According to the Civil Aviation Administration
of China,

148
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,510
40 out of 44 airlines have successfully complied
with their wishes.

149
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,160
The four airlines who didn’t get 100% on
their geography test?

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,240
They were all American.

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,090
You see, instead of listing Taipei as part
of China,

152
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,330
these airlines just took off the country designation,

153
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,420
listing Taipei by itself.

154
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,380
Well, Taipei comma...nothing.

155
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,970
There was never anything else there, ok?

156
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,400
But that’s just not A-plus work,

157
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,380
according to the Chinese Communist Party.

158
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,150
You see these US airlines have started to
rectify the issue,

159
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,480
but their “rectification is still incomplete.”

160
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,600
Which does not sound creepy and authoritarian
at all.

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,640
What will happen next?

162
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,680
Well, the airlines get a two-week extension,

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,650
but China’s Civil Aviation Administration
will be paying close attention.

164
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,560
After all, these US airlines wouldn’t want
to be grounded, would they?

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,830
Not only has the Chinese regime’s pressure
affected airlines,

166
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,670
it’s also pushed Taiwan out of hosting the
kids version of the Olympics,

167
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,550
the East Asian Youth Games.

168
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,280
That’s so childish.

169
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,670
Reportedly, it’s because Taiwan wanted to
change the banner

170
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,780
of its official sports teams from “Chinese
Taipei” to “Taiwan”.

171
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,360
Unfortunately this could set a dangerous precedent
for Taiwan—

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,630
and democracy in general.

173
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,780
It could make it very hard for Taiwan

174
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,580
to ever host an international sporting event
again.

175
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,139
So don’t hold out for the Taipei Olympics
in 2036.

176
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,150
Unless Taipei is controlled by the Communist
Party by then.

177
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,950
Well, that’s it for this week’s uplifting
headlines.

178
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,020
What do you think?

179
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,510
Leave your comments below.

180
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,120
And before you go, now is the time when we
answer

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,760
a question from fans who support China Uncensored

182
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,190
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

183
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,420
Joe Knox asks,

184
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,990
“Jiang Zemin, Toad master,

185
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,080
will he ever be brought to justice?

186
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,480
and what form or retribution would be appropriate?”

187
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
Good question Joe.

188
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
On the one hand,

189
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,840
Jiang Zemin is a very old man—

190
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,620
almost 92 and he’s not in great health.

191
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
As you can see,

192
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,620
he can barely stand.

193
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,800
And I can barely stand him.

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,410
But I hope he lives long enough to see the
day justice comes.

195
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,960
But it’s not just about bringing Jiang Zemin
to justice.

196
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,160
The entire faction tied to him is guilty of
crimes against humanity.

197
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,380
Like the system he oversaw where Falun Gong
practitioners,

198
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,050
house Christians, Tibetans, and Uighurs

199
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,350
are killed for their organs in state-run hospitals.

200
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,910
So justice demands more than just his head.

201
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,310
The problem is, putting Jiang Zemin on trial

202
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,430
will expose corruption so massive

203
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,100
and deep within the Chinese Communist Party,

204
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,080
that it could bring the entire system down.

205
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,370
Obviously, that’s not going to be a popular
move

206
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,540
as long as the Communist Party stays in power.

207
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,520
The Party has never admitted wrongdoing for
pretty much anything.

208
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,110
Ok, they admitted that Chairman Mao was 30
percent wrong.

209
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,740
But hey, he was still 70 percent right!

210
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,640
I hope that what eventually happens

211
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,650
is some communist equivalent of the Nuremberg
Trials.

212
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,450
Those were the Nazi trials after World War
2.

213
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,180
Basically, the entire history of Communism

214
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,250
will need to be put on trial,

215
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,460
with the world collectively deciding,

216
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,480
you know what:

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,260
100 million dead people later,

218
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,970
communism is probably not a good idea.

219
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,970
Thanks for your question, Joe.

220
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,980

we have a new podcast, China Unscripted.

231
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Myself, Shelley, and Matt the producer,

232
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,490
go into way more detail than we ever could
on the show,

233
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,750
which means more jokes too.

234
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,800
So subscribe to us on iTunes.

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,140
