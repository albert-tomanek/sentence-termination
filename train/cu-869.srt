1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,620
A WHO expert warns that the Coronavirus Outbreak

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,390
Is just beginning

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,060
As an authoritarian crackdown in China

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,480
Only gets worse.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,000
This is China Uncensored,

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,460
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,339
It’s time for an update on the deadly coronavirus.

8
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,090
First some good news.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,589
This coronavirus now officially has a name:

10
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:27,589
COVID-19.

11
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,260
And naming something gives you power over
it.

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,880
At least according to Rumpelstiltskin.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,140
I mean, COVID-19 sounds much better than

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,570
“that mysterious deadly disease we can’t
stop”!

15
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,390
Now we can say with confidence that COVID-19

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,300
is that deadly disease we can’t stop!!!

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,020
Yeah, doesn’t that sound much nicer?

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,870
And don’t worry, they put a lot of thought
into that name

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,970
to make sure it was totally woke and non-offensive.

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:56,360
“We had to find a name that did not refer
to a geographical location,

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,300
an animal, an individual or group of people

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,390
and which is also pronounceable

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,670
and related to the disease.

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,670
Having a name matters to prevent the use of
other names

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,469
that can be inaccurate or stigmatising.”

26
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:16,920
I’m still offended.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,840
They should have called it the Kung Flu.

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,140
Still, you should be terrified.

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,310
A WHO expert said the outbreak is just beginning!

30
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,539
He means the outbreak outside China.

31
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,740
And if the coronavirus is left unchecked,

32
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,670
60% of the world could be infected.

33
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,509
“With 99 percent of cases in China,

34
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,240
this remains very much an emergency for that
country

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,389
but one that holds a very grave threat to
the rest of the world,

36
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:49,540
unless we use the window of opportunity that
we have now.”

37
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,689
Which is why COVID-19 should be treated as
public enemy number 1.

38
00:01:53,689 --> 00:02:00,670
“A virus can have more powerful consequences
than any terrorist action,

39
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,689
and that's true.

40
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,350
And if the world doesn't want to wake up

41
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:12,190
and consider this enemy virus as public enemy
number one,

42
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,610
I don't think we will learn from our lessons."

43
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,540
Man, and China claims it’s the US that’s
spreading fear.

44
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,290
As of recording, there have been more than
1,300 deaths

45
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,040
and almost 60,000 cases of infection in China.

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,489
There was a huge jump in the number of cases
this week.

47
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,420
That’s because Hubei Province,

48
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,440
which is the hardest hit by the virus,

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,430
has changed how they count cases.

50
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,470
They’re now counting patients who have symptoms

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,530
and CT scans that look like COVID-19,

52
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,819
but haven’t tested positive for it.

53
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,769
One reason for that is a shortage of test
kits.

54
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,459
Of course those are only the official statistics.

55
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:50,989
Even with the jump in cases,

56
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,769
most experts think the numbers are actually
much higher.

57
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,250
Which is why it’s a little funny that the
Chinese regime

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,160
keeps refusing international help.

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,860
Chinese doctors really want the help.

60
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,450
But the Chinese Communist Party seems resistant
for some reason.

61
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,200
I guess the Party probably feels they’ve
got the situation covered.

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,920
I mean, authorities have started seizing,

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,079
“private hospitals, hotels, apartments,

64
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,680
cars and even face masks”.

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,500
You know, I wouldn’t want to seize the face
mask

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,050
of someone who could have the coronavirus.

67
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,700
But I’m sure seizing someone's car is definitely
a quarantine protocol,

68
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,170
but I’m not sure why all of the seized cars
are Ferraris.

69
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,340
Weird.

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
By the way,

71
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,730
the doctor who uncovered the SARS coverup
in 2003—

72
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,370
he’s under house arrest.

73
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,290
Don’t worry, he’s in good hands.

74
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,700
Last year, they put him in a military hospital
for a month.

75
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,400
According to friends and family,

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,069
“The doctor...was given medication,

77
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:49,440
which led to severe memory loss.”

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,959
Well, that’s one way to cover up a coverup.

79
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,109
I told you last week about Wuhan citizen journalist
Fang Bin.

80
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,640
Police in hazmat suits came to his house,

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,060
confiscated his electronics,

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,219
and forcibly detained him.

83
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,200
He was released after being told to report

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,590
more “positive” news about the coronavirus
outbreak.

85
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,599
But this week, he wasn’t so lucky.

86
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,420
Fang Bin has gone missing again.

87
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,420
According to Quartz,

88
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,870
he was arrested the same day he posted this
video to YouTube.

89
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,410
“Resist, all citizens!

90
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,060
Hand the power of the government back to the
people!”

91
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,440
I wonder if that’s connected.

92
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,690
Fang’s disappearance comes less than a week
after

93
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,180
another citizen journalist, Chen Qiushi,

94
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,710
who traveled to Wuhan to cover the outbreak,

95
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,710
disappeared.

96
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,710
According to his family,

97
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,669
he may have been forcibly quarantined by local
authorities,

98
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:42,490
even though he wasn’t sick.

99
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,350
Here’s part of a video Chen posted shortly
before he disappeared.

100
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,389
I’m afraid.

101
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,039
In front of me is the virus,

102
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,080
and behind me is the legal and administrative
power of China.

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,840
As long as I live in this city,

104
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,199
I will continue to report.

105
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,900
I only report what I see and what I hear.

106
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,039
I really want to be blunt, right?

107
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,130
Today, I’m going to say something blunt.

108
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,130
Mfer,

109
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,240
I’m not even afraid of death.

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,120
You think I’m afraid of the Communist Party?

111
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
I can see why the Communist Party

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,250
felt that Chen needed to be quarantined.

113
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,360
They don’t want him to spread his dangerous...ideas.

114
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,271
But I wouldn’t want you to think the Chinese
Communist Party

115
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:30,289
is only dealing with the coronavirus through
cover ups,

116
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,530
property theft, and detaining journalists.

117
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,550
They’re also firing people.

118
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,099
In a classic move,

119
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,310
the Communist Party secretaries of Hubei province

120
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,040
and Wuhan are being purged.

121
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,270
Everyone saw that one coming.

122
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,590
But Chinese officials who aren’t yet purged

123
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,010
are still fighting the coronavirus!

124
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,530
The state-run China News Service released
this footage.

125
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,550
It shows a sterilizing wheel in the city of
Qongqing

126
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,379
that can disinfect a person in 20 seconds.

127
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,780
Wow, the Party is great!

128
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,510
They built two of these, which, combined,
they say,

129
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,810
can meet the needs of a thousand people!

130
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,990
That sounds great, unless you can do math.

131
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,900
Then you realize that in a city of 30 million
people,

132
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:22,480
this meets the needs of just 0.003% of the
population.

133
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,710
Taiwan has crashed a WHO meeting.

134
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,830
Who needs permission when you’re a BALLER!

135
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,449
Actually, it was way less cool than that.

136
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,879
It was just an online technical conference.

137
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,520
Also, Taiwan worked it out ahead of time with
the WHO.

138
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,830
But Taiwan crashing the world’s lamest party

139
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,039
was still a big deal for the world’s most
authoritarian Party.

140
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,140
The Chinese Communist Party gets angry when
any organization—

141
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,000
including the WHO—

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,580
treats Taiwan in any way

143
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,669
that implies Taiwan is an independent country.

144
00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:00,099
Even if that means risking the lives of 23
million Taiwanese people.

145
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:04,479
But there is one party that I’m sure is
worth everyone’s time.

146
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,819
In the Chinese city of Chongqing,

147
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,970
a man wrapped himself with firecrackers,

148
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,770
doused himself in gasoline

149
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,759
and threatened to set himself alight

150
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,300
unless village officials approved his birthday
party amid the outbreak.

151
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,810
That’s a man who takes his birthday a little
too seriously.

152
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,380
And that’s it for this update on the coronavirus.

153
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
And as you may have heard me mention YouTube

154
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,220
is targeting coronavirus coverage

155
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,340
as “too controversial for advertisers.”

156
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,889
All our episodes about the coronavirus have
been demonetized—

157
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,570
either temporarily or permanently.

158
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,139
If a news show can’t generate income while
reporting the news,

159
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,210
it can’t survive.

160
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,690
YouTube would have shut down China Uncensored
years ago like this.

161
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,039
But fortunately,

162
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,759
we have the support of viewers like you,

163
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,940
who I call the China Uncensored 50 cent army.

164
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,259
Through your contributions on the crowd funding
website Patreon,

165
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,729
China Uncensored has survived to today,

166
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,120
so we can let you know about important China
issues that affect you,

167
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,909
like a deadly global pandemic.

168
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,360
So as a thank you to supporters,

169
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,919
I answer a question from them at the end of
some of my episodes.

170
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,660
Today’s question comes from Jump Dawg:

171
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,139
“Chris, is there any information on Coronavirus
infection

172
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,479
in China's rural areas?”

173
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,370
Now that’s a good question,

174
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,040
but answering it is going to be difficult.

175
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,840
If the Chinese regime can successfully cover
up the statistics of Wuhan,

176
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,990
a city of 11 million people,

177
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,080
it’s going to be even easier to cover it
up in more rural areas of China.

178
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,419
But I think we can guess that the coronavirus,

179
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,419
sorry COVID-19,

180
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,800
is hitting the poorest people in China the
hardest.

181
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,510
Those insanely rich Politburo members are
probably doing just fine.

182
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,010
The rural poor, however,

183
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,790
don’t have access to good hospitals,

184
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,600
or in some cases even mediocre hospitals.

185
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,740
Things may not end well for them.

186
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,769
But don’t worry,

187
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,560
top officials will be fine.

188
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,209
Thanks for your question, Jump Dawg.

189
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,529

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,160
