1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,800
The Chinese Communist Party

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,130
Is helping some African dictators

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,620
Crack down on political opposition

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,980
Using mass surveillance

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,280
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,490
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,150
This episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,590
Because if your government is trying to spy
on you,

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,200
you can use Surfshark to help protect your
identity online.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
So, Africa.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,140
Most African countries have a lot of needs:

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,079
Safe drinking water, mass transit, better
healthcare...

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,240
But you know what these African governments

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,010
*really* ought to spend their money on?

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,010
Surveillance.

16
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,530
Yeah, that’s the ticket to a bright future.

17
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,280
Which brings us to China.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,789
The Chinese Communist Party

19
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,489
has been accused of colonizing Africa.

20
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,130
They’re not interested in occupying

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,350
and ruling African countries directly.

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,559
But the Chinese Communist Party is helping

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,469
prop up some of the worst dictators in Africa.

24
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,110
There are many, many ways China does this.

25
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,590
But today I’m going to focus on one way:

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Mass surveillance.

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,130
You’ve probably heard of the Chinese telecom
company Huawei.

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,130
It’s technically a private company...maybe...

29
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,000
but it has strong connections to the Chinese
government

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,510
and the Chinese Communist Party.

31
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,510
Huawei

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,640
is being used to build a vast surveillance
network in African countries.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,090
They’re even training police in how to use
their technology

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,200
to crack down on anyone who questions that
country’s government.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,520
A lot of African dictators simply don’t
have the resources

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,630
to build their own surveillance infrastructure
from scratch.

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,210
So they turn to China for help.

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,740
Through multi-million dollar deals with Huawei,

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,540
they’re bringing China’s techno-autocracy

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,600
to one of the poorest continents on Earth.

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,770
Because sure, people may not have clean drinking
water,

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,210
but at least they have Huawei security cameras
on every corner!

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,220
The Chinese giant supplies most of the 3g
and 4G cell towers...

44
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,380
and Surveillance cameras equipped with facial
recognition.

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,189
Even in this village where a lot of homes
don't even have\h electricity

46
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,700
there's a brand new set of surveillance cameras
behind me.

47
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,950
That was from this Wall Street Journal Investigation.

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,640
Huawei is building the backbone of future
5G networks.

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,320
But it’s also building surveillance systems
around the world.

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,420
The Wall Street Journal investigation looked
at police documents

51
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,780
and parliamentary committee documents.

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,130
They interviewed diplomats, cyber-defense
officials,

53
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,300
and opposition activists who have been targeted,

54
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,700
plus more than a dozen senior security officials

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,920
working with Huawei in African countries.

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,640
They found that Huawei is actively making
countries in Africa

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,770
a worse place to live.

58
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,530
At least if you’re not part of the ruling
elite.

59
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,420
The Wall Street Journal investigation says,

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,750
“According to senior security officials,

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,490
embedded, hands-on Huawei technicians

62
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,800
train security forces and cyber-surveillance
units

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,970
that regularly snoop on political opposition.”

64
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,070
For example, “In Zambia...

65
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,130
Huawei technicians helped the government access

66
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,740
the phones and Facebook pages of a team

67
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,470
of opposition bloggers running a pro-opposition
news site.”

68
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,360
Good, so Huawei is helping African dictators
silence political opponents.

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,890
Then, there’s also what Huawei calls Safe
Cities,

70
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,270
or Smart Cities, that they’re trying to
build in Africa.

71
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,020
What’s a smart city?

72
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,540
Let’s ask our friendly Huawei representative.

73
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,660
What is Smart City.

74
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,090
To speak briefly...it helps governments

75
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,910
enhance city management quality and efficiency.

76
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,810
Wow, incredibly vague yet terrifying.

77
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,660
I want to know more!

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,020
With the development of city construction
video surveillance

79
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,130
is widely used in various scenarios.

80
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,160
Such as city security surveillance,

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,180
transportation surveillance,

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,030
and campus surveillance.

83
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,220
Oh good, campus surveillance.

84
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,690
Now countries around the world can be more
like China,

85
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,450
spying on students.

86
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,630
You wouldn’t want students thinking too
freely.

87
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,750
Huawei says it has built systems in 700 cities

88
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,350
spread across more than 100 countries and
regions.

89
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,850
Not all 700 are smart cities, but in these
cities,

90
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,590
some of the smart city components are gradually
being installed—

91
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,810
often starting with things like surveillance
cameras.

92
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,730
And then there’s the Internet.

93
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,530
China is exporting its model of the Internet
to Africa.

94
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,150
In China, the Internet is not a forum

95
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,760
for the free exchange of thoughts and ideas.

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,660
It’s a way for the government to monitor
and control people.

97
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,150
And the Chinese Communist Party

98
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,400
wants to export its authoritarian model of
the internet

99
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,480
around the world.

100
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,650
Africa is a prime testing ground.

101
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,650
Why?

102
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,450
Because most African countries are poor,

103
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,070
meaning they don’t have a lot of

104
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,060
homegrown technology companies to compete.

105
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,910
And many African countries are authoritarian,

106
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,040
meaning they prefer China’s model

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,940
of a highly controlled internet.

108
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,750
Chinese government officials have helped secure
internet deals

109
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,240
for Huawei throughout Africa,

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,480
starting as far back as 1998 in Kenya.

111
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,140
20 years later, Huawei has been responsible

112
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,170
for connecting hundreds of millions of Africans.

113
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,000
“It has built telecom networks in some 40
African nations

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,530
by offering inexpensive deals often financed
by loans

115
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,610
with favorable terms and by providing

116
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,660
on-the-ground customer service.”

117
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,510
Because of that, Huawei now dominates the
African internet market.

118
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,920
And on one hand, that’s a good thing.

119
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,640
More people in Africa now have access to the
Internet,

120
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,040
especially through their mobile phones.

121
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,850
But the Chinese Communist Party had a long
term plan.

122
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,670
According to the NGO Freedom House,

123
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,910
most of Sub-Saharan Africa is not free.

124
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,120
When those dictators realized the threat Internet
access

125
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,840
posed to their regimes,

126
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,810
they again turned to Huawei, for solutions.

127
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,880
And things got worse.

128
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,320
As the Wall Street Journal says,

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,270
“A few years ago, the East and Southern
African nations

130
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,560
appeared to be regional models for web freedom.”

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,820
But thanks to Huawei, that’s begun to change.

132
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,190
Huawei is bringing China’s model of a

133
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,490
highly controlled and censored internet to
Africa.

134
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,080
And let’s just say, Africa’s dictators
are very happy.

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,560
So what do you think about China and Huawei’s
plan for the internet?

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,590
Tell me what you think in the comments below.

137
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,780
And this episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

138
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,240
When you go online,

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,710
everything you do is being tracked and logged—

140
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,260
by the websites you visit and your internet
service provider.

141
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,380
And in many cases, by the government.

142
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,280
Especially if you’re in, say, Africa—

143
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,889
where this kind of tracking can put you

144
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,050
at risk of surveillance and even arrest.

145
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,230
That's why you should use a VPN like Surfshark
