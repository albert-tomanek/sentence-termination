1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:03,130
A Chinese art project goes terribly wrong

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,810
The Party preps for its 100th birthday

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,510
And, you won’t read about this in Hong Kong
newspapers

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:22,060
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:35,190
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,070
This episode is sponsored by Daily Pnut.

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,120
The news can be a tough pill to swallow.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,540
That's why Daily Pnut gives you a daily dose
of news in equal parts humor and substance.

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,710
This week in China,

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:54,260
An art gallery in Shanghai is in hot water
for a recent exhibition called Campus Flowers,

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,650
by Chinese artist Song Ta.

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,879
He secretly recorded 5000 women on a Chinese
university campus.

13
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,970
And ranked them quote “from the prettiest
to the ugliest”.

14
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,180
And get this, the Chinese title of this so
called art piece was Campus Flowers.

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,930
But the English title was Uglier and Uglier.

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,570
After a huge backlash, the Shanghai museum
shut down the exhibit and issued an apology.

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,000
“After receiving criticism, we re-evaluated
the content of this artwork and the artist’s

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,880
explanation, we found it disrespected women,
and the way it was shot has copyright infringement

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
issues.”

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,280
That’s because the women were filmed secretly.

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,310
How dare some guy do that!

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,730
In China, secretly filming people is the government’s
job.

23
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,880
This actually wasn’t the first time artist
Song Tadisplayed this piece.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,390
It debuted back in 2013 and there was no outcry.

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,090
In 2019, he gave an interview to the Chinese
language version of Vice about it.

26
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,780
He and three assistants sorted through hours
of footage and sorted the women from “most

27
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,579
beautiful” to “absolutely unforgivably
ugly.”

28
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,679
He also said the final cut didn’t include
the two women he ranked the most beautiful.

29
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,480
He said he kept those for himself to enjoy.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,200
That’s also, um, part of the art?

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,760
According to the New York Times, “To the
accusation that he was objectifying women,

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,480
he responded by saying that everyone objectifies
everyone else, regardless of gender.

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,370
He also said he saw himself as a feminist,
though he admitted to not fully understanding

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,780
‘women’s issues.’”

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,609
You know, women’s issues like men secretly
recording them and ranking them based on their

36
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,139
looks.

37
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,370
And this wasn’t even Song’s first “feminist”
art piece.

38
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,010
This piece from 2013 is called “One is not
as good as the other.”

39
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,239
He ranked 30 women from beautiful to ugly
and had them walk down a runaway in that order.

40
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,639
“The work was part of a broader project
by Mr. Song called ‘The Origin of Inequality.’”

41
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,540
Well, maybe not the origin, but certainly
the continuation.

42
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,159
Next week, on July 1, the Chinese Communist
Party will be celebrating its 100-year anniversary.

43
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,640
And like any 100 year old, it's decrepit and
falling apart.

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,499
But to make sure the anniversary goes off
without a hitch, China is beefing up security.

45
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,290
Meaning—they’re cracking down extra hard
on dissidents.

46
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,529
Back in March, 18 of China’s top security
and propaganda departments, “jointly launched

47
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:34,199
a three-and-a-half-month special campaign
to suppress “illegal social organizations.”

48
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,651
State-run media Xinhua reported that over
500 “illegal social organizations” were

49
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,529
identified and placed under investigation.”

50
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:47,370
My favorite state-run media, the Global Times,
says radio signals will be blocked on the

51
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,560
anniversary.

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,209
And airport security will be extra tight.

53
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,019
That airport security is good, because according
to this new report...

54
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,619
China tops the list of countries for most
millionaires moving abroad.

55
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,400
These millionaires must be confused.

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,310
China is obviously the best country in the
world.

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,669
Anyone who says otherwise must have some serious
problems.

58
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:10,189
And if they don’t, they will soon.

59
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:18,229
And after the break, China should get what
it deserves for the coronavirus pandemic.

60
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:19,229
Welcome back.

61
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:23,960
So, I think it’s time we talk about China’s
role in the coronavirus pandemic.

62
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,430
They need to be held accountable.

63
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,180
And by accountable, I mean, they should be
awarded the Nobel Prize!

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,860
At least that’s what Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhao Lijian believes.

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,389
At a press conference he said, “The team
in Wuhan should be awarded the Nobel Prize

66
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,490
in medicine for their research on COVID-19,
instead of being criticized.”

67
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,500
Yeah!

68
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,729
Instead of criticizing China for potentially
engineering a virus that killed millions around

69
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:57,840
the world and spending a year covering it
up, we should be honoring the contributions

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,330
the Chinese regime has made to fighting the
pandemic they caused.

71
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,340
According to research from Oxford University
, more than half of the 10 worst hit countries

72
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,000
by the coronavirus use Chinese vaccines!

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,670
Keep in mind, China is not donating these
vaccines.

74
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,539
They’re selling them.

75
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:17,830
Unlike the US.

76
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,540
Which for instance just donated 2.5 million
vaccines to Taiwan, tripling their promised

77
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,610
amount.

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,169
But I mean Taiwan’s not even a country.

79
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,610
That doesn’t even count, right?

80
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,150
There is also a slight problem with the effectiveness
of the Chinese vaccines.

81
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,430
One of their main vaccines, Sinovac, has been
shown in some studies to be barely over 50%

82
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,430
effective.

83
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,889
And 90 countries using Chinese vaccines are
now battling Covid outbreaks.

84
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,849
In fact, the Chinese vaccines don’t seem
to be doing much for China either, since they

85
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,940
just announced they’re keeping Covid border
restrictions in place for another year.

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,789
And that’s partially causing a huge backlog
at Chinese ports.

87
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,300
Which means Christmas may come late this year!

88
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,949
So...about that Nobel Prize.

89
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,520
Earlier this week I did an episode about how
the Chinese Communist Party used money and

90
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,970
connections to influence “the science”
on the coronavirus.

91
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,620
And now there’s a new twist.

92
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,270
By now you know about the badly, badly compromised
scientist Dr. Peter Daszak.

93
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,370
He was the one largely responsible for convincing
the world the coronavirus lab leak hypothesis

94
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,840
was a conspiracy theory.

95
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,749
He was also working with the Wuhan Institute
of Virology on making coronaviruses more dangerous

96
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,159
to humans.

97
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:46,860
That was through the non-profit EcoHealth
Alliance, which studies how animal viruses

98
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,900
can jump to humans.

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:54,439
Well it turns out, Google has been funding
EcoHealth Alliance for over a decade.

100
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:59,770
Here’s a 2010 study on bat flaviviruses
by Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance.

101
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,960
It was partially funded by Google.org, Google’s
charitable foundation.

102
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,419
And here’s one from 2014.

103
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,069
And 2015.

104
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,719
Now I just want to be clear, I haven’t seen
any evidence Google was specifically funding

105
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:18,840
the EcoHealth Alliance work at the Wuhan Institute
of Virology.

106
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,389
But it’s not surprising that Google was
funding EcoHealth Alliance in general.

107
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:28,169
Because researching animal viruses that could
jump to humans was largely seen as a good

108
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:32,789
thing that could prevent the next global pandemic.

109
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,419
So if the global coronavirus pandemic was
*caused by* a lab doing this type of research,

110
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,469
there’s going to be a reckoning in the scientific
community.

111
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:46,740
But it doesn’t help that YouTube, owned
by Google, was labeling certain ideas about

112
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,879
the origin of the coronavirus as “conspiracy
theories”, and cracking down on them.

113
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,710
Like the theory it leaked from a lab.

114
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,860
A lab that was working with EcoHealth Alliance.

115
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,139
YouTube was demonetizing, age restricting,
and sometimes removing episodes we made about

116
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:04,669
the coronavirus.

117
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,069
Even if we weren’t talking about a lab leak.

118
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,620
Clearly, they didn’t like us talking about
the coronavirus.

119
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:19,009
Speaking of demonetization, it’s time for
an ad break—that hopefully has an ad.

120
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:20,250
Welcome back.

121
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,550
If you didn’t see an ad, you know why we
need your direct support to keep making episodes

122
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,550
like this.

124
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,880
More bad news out of Hong Kong.

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,551
I feel like I’m saying that a lot lately.

126
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:40,380
And by lately I mean over the past 7 years.

127
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,570
Pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily has been
forced to shut down.

128
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,510
Hong Kong authorities froze their assets.

129
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,510
The paper couldn’t continue.

130
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,130
Their crime?

131
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,089
Violating the national security law.

132
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,949
Authorities allege that Apple Daily “called
for foreign sanctions against both China and

133
00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:02,500
Hong Kong's leaders over the government crackdown
on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.”

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,550
Sure, the Hong Kong government was unwilling
to specify which Apple Daily articles violated

135
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,180
the National Security Law.

136
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,290
But we all know they didn’t need a specific
reason to shut down Apple Daily.

137
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,959
It also comes after 500 Hong Kong police officers
raided Apple Daily’s offices, arresting

138
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,779
several of the staff.

139
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:28,149
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam defended
those arrests and the shutdown.

140
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,670
She said the national security law needs to
have a, “preventative and deterrent effect.

141
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,870
It has to have a deterrent effect if it is
to achieve its objective.”

142
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,850
The objective is annihilating press freedom
and making everyone too terrified of speaking

143
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,850
up.

144
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,800
But it may not be working as well as the authorities
hope.

145
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,930
Because Apple Daily printed 1 million copies
of its last paper, ten times more than normal.

146
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,490
And Hong Kongers bought them all, in one last
show of support for the paper.

147
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,800
They can’t march in the streets anymore,
but Hongkongers are still finding a way to

148
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,350
protest.

149
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,900
In another sign of the Communist Party’s
crackdown on Hong Kong, staff at Taiwan’s

150
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,660
de facto embassy in Hong Kong are also leaving
the city.

151
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,300
They’ve been forced to.

152
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,110
The Hong Kong government “demanded [the
Taiwanese] officials sign a document supporting

153
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,959
Beijing’s claim to Taiwan.”

154
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,149
They refused.

155
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:27,690
So the Hong Kong government refused to renew
their visas.

156
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,740
Now the Taiwan office has just 1 staffer left.

157
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,730
And his visa will expire next month.

158
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,350
And if demanding diplomats sign away Taiwan’s
sovereignty seems out of this world, just

159
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,940
wait till this next story.

160
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,940
Chinese astronauts are now living in China’s
first space station.

161
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,100
The space station is still under construction.

162

program is run by the Communist Party’s

163
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,149
military.

164
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,190

country’s feats in space.”
