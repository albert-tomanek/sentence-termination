1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,480
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,130
China has just built a ginormous bridge connecting

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,500
the Chinese mainland with Hong Kong and Macau.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,570
Good for drivers,

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,190
so-so for freedom.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,140
Actually, not that good for drivers either.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Welcome to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,820
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,660
The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,930
officially opened to the public on Tuesday.

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,380
Chinese leader Xi Jinping even made

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,850
a special trip to attend the ceremony,

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,270
coming all the way from the Hundred Acre Wood.

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,649
“Yay for me.”

15
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:37,399
Now the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,050
is the world’s longest sea bridge:

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,060
34 miles end to end.

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,420
It’s been dubbed the “bridge of death”.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,460
Sorry—that’s not as metal as it sounds.

20
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,460
They call it that because

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,170
so many construction workers died making it.

22
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,140
At least 19 people were killed and hundreds
seriously injured.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,739
Also, the bridge was completed two years past
deadline

24
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,150
and nearly 1.5 billion dollars over budget.

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,390
But never mind all the financial problems
and dead people!

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,499
The bridge will be good for the economy.

27
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:15,700
"It is envisaged that the collaboration between
Guangdong,

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,130
Hong Kong and Macau,

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,399
in terms of trade, finance, logistics,

30
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,520
and tourism will be strengthened.

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,789
Hong Kong will assume a more proactive role

32
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:31,209
in the development of the Greater Bay area.”

33
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:34,090
The Greater Bay Area is a hub made up of nine
cities

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,399
in mainland China’s Guangdong province:

35
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,479
Shenzhen, Huizhou, Dongguan, Guangzhou,

36
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,799
Foshan, Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, Zhongshan, and
Zhuhai,

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,599
along with the two Special Administrative
Regions

38
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,649
of Macau and Hong Kong.

39
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,979
Compared to other “Bay Areas”—

40
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,959
like Tokyo, New York and San Francisco—

41
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,969
China’s Greater Bay Area has by far the
largest population,

42
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:58,090
but the lowest GDP per capita.

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,419
Speaking of the economy, the cost of the bridge

44
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:04,099
was originally estimated to break even after
36 years.

45
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,320
But like I said earlier, it’s just a tad
over budget,

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,769
plus it looks like they may have overestimated

47
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:12,260
how many people would be using the bridge,

48
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,989
so it will take a little longer.

49
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,900
One Chinese professor says it could take more
than 72 years.

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,450
72 years!

51
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,450
By that time,

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,349
I’ll almost have finished paying off my
student loans.

53
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,260
The official reason for the bridge is to reduce
trade barriers

54
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,489
by being a faster and simpler way to travel

55
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,220
between cities in the region.

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,840
Granted, it’s not quite as simple as crossing
a bridge in,

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,680
say, the San Francisco Bay Area—

58
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,129
where all you need is one of those

59
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,159
FasTrak devices behind your windshield.

60
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,380
Because to cross the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau
Bridge,

61
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,510
you need three separate permits,

62
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,620
each of which has a completely different application
process.

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,700
The process is so convoluted that the government

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,819
had to make this two-and-a-half minute animated
video

65
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,680
just to explain it.

66
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,209
Oh, and did I mention that in addition to

67
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,950
the the three separate permits,

68
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,400
you also need separate vehicle insurance

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,459
for each of the three regions,

70
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,180
and you have to reserve a parking space

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,749
at least 12 hours in advance?

72
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:13,799
“It’s simple and convenient.”

73
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,790
But the good news is that most people won’t
even have

74
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,790
to deal with all of those permits and insurance
issues.

75
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,010
Because in Hong Kong,

76
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,090
they’re capping the number of private cars

77
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,470
that can use the bridge at 10,000.

78
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,980
Who’s eligible to apply?

79
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,849
Hong Kong tech companies who pay

80
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,140
a certain amount of taxes in mainland China.

81
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,239
If you’re a Hong Kong resident,

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,370
you can also either donate 5 million yuan—

83
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,469
that’s more than 700,000 dollars—

84
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,010
in mainland China,

85
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,530
or you can be a member of the National People’s
Congress

86
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,829
or the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference

87
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,370
“at national, provincial, prefecture

88
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,920
and county levels of Guangdong province.”

89
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,420
I guess the People’s Republic

90
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,970
didn’t exactly build the people’s bridge.

91
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,230
For other, less elite, Hongkongers,

92
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,609
you can still take the shuttle buses

93
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,920
that will be going across the bridge.

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
But you might be better off just taking the
ferry.

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,329
Especially when you factor in

96
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,930
all the bridge-related construction scandals.

97
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,459
Like the one in which a former technician
admitted to

98
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,919
faking the quality test results of concrete
because...

99
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,120
he “was just lazy.”

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Or when in 2016 officials admitted that

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
“technical problems had caused

102
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,979
drifting of an artificial island

103
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,620
that housed facilities for the bridge.”

104
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Or when “aerial photos emerged showing

105
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,740
that interlocking concrete blocks

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,840
placed around the edges of the island

107
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,590
had drifted away.”

108
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,759
But you know what they say in China:

109
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,590
“Safety, schmafety.”

110
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,360
What’s that, Shelley?

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,729
OK, I’m being told no one in China says
that.

112
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,700
At least not out loud.

113
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,780
But they do have a common saying: “chàbuduō”—

114
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,150
which means “good enough.”

115
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,500
And for the sake of all the people

116
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,020
who’ll be crossing that bridge,

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,979
I hope it is.

118
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,810
But despite all the things that make

119
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,370
the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge so, so great,

120
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,940
some people still have concerns.

121
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,440
And Hong Kongers, with their dangerous freedom
of speech,

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,060
are even so reckless as to express their concerns
in public.

123
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,510
Like Hong Kong lawmaker Claudia Mo.

124
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,400
“The bridge is a waste of money,” she
told CNN.

125
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,169
“When it comes to linking the mainland to
Hong Kong,

126
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,860
we have air, sea and land linkages already.

127
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,340
Why do we need this extra project?”

128
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,660
I mean, sure those billions of dollars could
have been

129
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,320
spent on things like affordable housing,

130
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,720
or fixing Hong Kong’s outdated water management
system.

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,500
But I think the answer to Mo’s question
is pretty obvious...

132
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,910
because she goes on to explain it herself.

133
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,050
“[The bridge] links Hong Kong to China

134
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,270
almost like an umbilical cord.

135
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,270
You see it,

136
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,849
and you know you're linked up to the motherland.”

137
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,389
And motherland always knows best!

138
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,860
What better way to integrate Hong Kong and
Macau

139
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,909
into the political system of mainland China
than

140
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:04,610
by making it easy and seamless to travel between
them!

141
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,210
Soon, borders will disappear.

142
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,659
Along with Hong Kong’s pesky freedoms.

143
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,190
I guess it’s a good thing they still have

144
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,319
some work to do on the ease-of-use front.

145
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,319
So what do you think about

146
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,210
the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge?

147
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,319
Leave your comments below.

148
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,440
And before we go,

149
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,050
it’s time to answer a question

150
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,800
from a fan of China Uncensored

151
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
who contributes to us

152
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,190
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

153
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,669
Karl Diaz asks:

154
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:33,680
“What is China’s best outcome from the
midterm elections?”

155
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,030
Interesting question, Karl.

156
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,210
I’d say the Chinese Communist Party wants

157
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,220
Democrats to win majorities in the House

158
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,560
and Senate in the US midterms.

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,020
But it’s not because they like Democrats
better.

160
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,470
They just believe it would make it harder

161
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,270
for Trump to get things done.

162
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,060
They’re right, but not in the way that matters
most to them.

163
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,720
Because while Trump would have to fight a
Democratic Congress

164
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,889
harder on most of his domestic policies,

165
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,550
there’s already wide bipartisan support
for most of

166
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,490
Trump’s tactics for dealing with the Chinese
regime—

167
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,639
including those trade tariffs.

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,909
In fact, criticizing the Chinese regime

169
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:11,270
has become one of the few unifying positions
in US politics.

170
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,990
The fact is, the Chinese Communist Party is...

171
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,629
confused by Trump.

172
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,640
They expected him to talk tough on China

173
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,400
as a presidential candidate,

174
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,979
like other past candidates,

175
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,990
but then soften his stance when he became
the president,

176
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,770
like other past presidents.

177
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,210
And at first, it looked like that might happen.

178
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,070
But now it’s pretty clear that the Trump
administration

179

but they sure want to undermine him.

00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,530
