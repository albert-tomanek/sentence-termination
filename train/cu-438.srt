1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,570
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,319
State-run media says sexual harassment

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,840
is only a problem in the West.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840
And racism?

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,260
Oh, it’s not a problem in China, either.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,260
And finally,

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,420
Game of Thrones has nothing on the Chinese
Communist Party.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,320
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,210
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,259
This week, the hashtag #MeToo

12
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,529
took social media by storm,

13
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,529
raising awareness about the massive problem

14
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,120
of sexual assault and sexual harassment

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,480
that pretty much every single woman

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,240
has had to deal with.

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,519
Well, I shouldn’t say every woman.

18
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,899
Because according to Chinese state-run media
China Daily,

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,700
sexual harassment is just a Western problem.

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,539
Now, sure,

21
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,320
the occasional survey may give alternative
facts,

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,530
like that it happens to 30 percent of Chinese
college students.

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,679
Or to 70 percent of female Chinese factory
workers.

24
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,890
And there was that video

25
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,409
of a woman being assaulted that went viral.

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,869
In fact, in response to that China Daily article,

27
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,520
a lot of women came forward specifically

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,110
to say they were sexually harassed in China.

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,780
But when have facts ever stopped state-run
media

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,790
from saying anything?

31
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,200
As the Guardian puts it,

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,850
“Chinese state media often works to portray
problems in the west

33
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,890
as nonexistent in China,

34
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,110
highlighting cases of police brutality,

35
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,409
mass protests and high-profile cases

36
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,329
of violence against women overseas.”

37
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,250
But after such a fierce backlash,

38
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,840
China Daily did finally respond...

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,210
by mysteriously losing the article.

40
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,979
Fortunately, nothing is ever truly deleted
from the internet.

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,890
The original article claims that,

42
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,100
“Chinese men are taught to be protective
of their women.”

43
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,310
Of course they are!

44
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,000
When your country has a severe shortage

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,109
of women because millions of baby girls get
aborted...

46
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:02,570
...you need to be protective of the ones you
have left.

47
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,170
In other news, run!

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,170
Run for your lives!

49
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,289
I’m just kidding, there’s no escape.

50
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,509
Because China’s very first space station,

51
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,080
the eight-and-a-half-ton Tiangong-1,

52
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,230
will be crash-landing somewhere on Earth

53
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,890
in the next few months.

54
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,430
And we have no idea where or when.

55
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,750
Most of it will burn up upon reentry.

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,190
Though there will be some 200-pound chunks

57
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,680
that might crash on the surface of the planet.

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,269
But don’t worry,

59
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:31,840
71% of that surface is water!

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,540
In other news, just kidding;

61
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,470
don’t run for your lives!

62
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,340
Because any reports you may have seen

63
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,690
comparing the inner workings of the Chinese
Communist Party

64
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,780
with Game of Thrones are completely exaggerated.

65
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,310
My favorite Chinese state-run media the Global
Times

66
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,290
wants you to know very specifically

67
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,450
that those biased Western media are wrong,

68
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,300
and that the Party Congress going on right
now

69
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,090
has nothing in common with everyone’s favorite

70
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,489
ruthless political brutal bloodbath.

71
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,870
Don’t tell that to Students for a Free Tibet
though.

72
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,520
They held a protest outside the Chinese consulate
in New York

73
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,330
ahead of the Party Congress.

74
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,959
And specifically, there was a bloodbath.

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,930
Let’s just say not all Tibetans are celebrating

76
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,090
the CCP’s “liberation” 60 years ago.

77
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,970
They’re demanding the CCP stop killing Tibetans

78
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,299
and destroying their culture.

79
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,180
But I don’t know about that.

80
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,959
I mean, it seems to me the CCP loves Tibetan
culture...

81
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,030
when they can parade it around as an example

82
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,510
of China’s eternally happy ethnic minorities.

83
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,849
Or maybe they’re just happy to have escaped

84
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,599
The Great Hall of the People.

85
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,090
Speaking of unironically celebrating culture,

86
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,220
there’s a museum in Wuhan, that—

87
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,730
according to Shanghaiist—

88
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,319
had an exhibit comparing black people to animals!

89
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,580
You know, because the photographer

90
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,670
thought their faces looked the same.

91
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,930
The exhibit has been removed

92
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,050
following complaints of racism.

93
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,879
But this is just the most recent

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,870
in a long string of casual racism in China.

95
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,880
Just last Friday,

96
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,200
WeChat had to apologize for translating

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,370
the Chinese word for “black foreigner”

98
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,030
to...well, I’m not going to say it.

99
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,920
It reminds me of that laundry detergent commercial
last year.

100
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,079
The one that showed how well it cleaned,

101
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,470
by turning a dirty black man

102
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,990
into a clean Chinese man.

103
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,510
I’m sure they had the best of intentions.

104
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,510
And coming up after the break,

105
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,770
we’ll take you live to Beijing for our

106
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,160

Congress!
