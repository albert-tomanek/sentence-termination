1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,009
China’s got a new economic plan.

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,390
Designed to counter\h

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,029
the threat of decoupling from the US.

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,830
What does it mean for the rest of the world?\h

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,429
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,429
I’m Chris Chappell.\h

7
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:25,180
We’ve just been through an historic event
that will set the direction of one of the

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,739
world's biggest economies for years to come.\h

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,300
And that historic event is... the Fifth Plenum
of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,239
Communist Party!

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,699
Why, what did you think I was going to say?\h\h

12
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:43,460
China's top leaders have wrapped up a four-day
gathering unveiling the country's critical

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,790
blueprint for the next five years.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,579
The communist party of china today released
the 14th five-year plan.

15
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,559
You know what they say about Communists.

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,570
They always have a 5-year plan.\h

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,749
Unfortunately, this year the Communist Party
did not commission a catchy theme song to

18
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:04,309
explain their 14th five-year plan to foreigners.

19
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,900
So we’re just going to have to play the
one from five years ago about the 13th 5-year

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,970
plan, the shi san wu.

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,360
If you know what’s coming, sing along.\h\h

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,060
If you wanna know what China’s gonna do,
best pay attention to the shi san wu.

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,540
The shi san wu.

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,020
The shi san wu.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,500
The shi san what?

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,980
The shi san wu.\h

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:32,010
Look, back in 2015, Chinese propaganda was
going through an...experimentation...phase.\h

28
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,810
The point is, every five years, the Chinese
Communist Party unveils a new economic plan.

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,860
This time, the five-year plan focuses a lot
on what’s being called China’s “dual

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,329
circulation” economy.

31
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,270
I’ll let Chinese state-run media explain.\h

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,180
But what exactly is a dual circulation economy?

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,909
The concept has two equally strong components:
"internal circulation," which refers to domestic

34
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,540
economic activities, and "external circulation,"
which relates to China's economic links with

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,090
the outside world.

36
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,830
It signals that China wants to reduce the
role of international trade in its economy,

37
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,640
and strengthen its domestic economy.\h

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,230
You know, Chinese propaganda was more fun
when they were experimenting.\h

39
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,900
So why is the Chinese Communist Party trying
to strengthen China’s domestic economy?

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,980
Because of the coronavirus that was totally
not the Communist Party’s fault, and also

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,260
because America is a big fat meanie.

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,879
As the COVID-19 pandemic sends shudders across
the world, the economic outlook outside China

43
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,310
does not look particularly optimistic at the
moment.

44
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,260
Worsening China-U.S. relations have also loomed
large in China's consideration, as the U.S.

45
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,970
contemplates decoupling and seems bent on
crippling China's economic and technological

46
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,970
development.

47
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,970
Right.

48
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,250
That’s what’s happening.

49
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,739
The US is targeting Chinese companies to cripple
China’s development.

50
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:08,481
It’s totally not because companies like
Huawei, WeChat, and TikTok pose national security

51
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,260
threats to the US.\h

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,269
Just remember, everyone: China is the victim
here.\h

53
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:20,440
But it’s true that there’s been a lot
of talk in the last year or so about the US

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,190
decoupling from China economically.\h

55
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,799
That includes reducing America’s reliance
on Chinese manufacturing, moving supply chains

56
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,000
out of China, and moving financial dealings
out of Hong Kong.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,420
And the coronavirus is speeding up the process
of decoupling.

58
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,040
It was a shock to many countries when they
couldn’t get medical supplies because they

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
were all made in China.

60
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,709
And when they finally were able to get medical
supplies from China, there were concerns that

61
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,980
some of those medical supplies were poor quality.\h

62
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,170
Or made with forced labor.

63
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,790
Here’s a crazy idea: Maybe other countries
can make medical supplies that aren’t poor

64
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,170
quality or made from slave labor.\h

65
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,840
Now despite that wake-up call, the idea of
the US decoupling from China has been controversial.\h

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,700
While some people think decoupling can happen...

67
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,010
Others say it will backfire.

68
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,620
But one thing’s for sure: the Chinese Communist
Party is terrified of decoupling.

69
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,300
And I’ll show you why after the break.

70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,800
Welcome back.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,050
The Chinese Communist Party is terrified of
the US decoupling from China.

72
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:37,080
That’s why Chinese state-run media have
run dozens of articles about why decoupling

73
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,860
is bad.

74
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,110
The US decoupling with China is a misjudgment.\h

75
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,140
Decoupling is not feasible.\h

76
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,080
It’s unrealistic and harmful.\h

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,760
But it will only harm the US.\h

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,980
And anyway, it’s doomed to fail.\h

79
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
You get the idea.\h

80
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,730
So Chinese officials are a tad bit concerned
about the US decoupling from China.

81
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:06,510
Which is why in this new 14th five-year plan,
they are seeking complete economic self-reliance.

82
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,760
According to my favorite state-run media,
the Global Times, China will “focus on boosting

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,360
the domestic supply chain and homegrown innovation
to become completely self-reliant in economy

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,260
and core technologies.”

85
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:28,581
Now you might think, hold on, doesn’t complete
economic self-reliance sound like China is

86
00:05:28,581 --> 00:05:30,720
decoupling from other countries?\h

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,070
Well that’s where you’re wrong!\h

88
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,130
It’s totally not decoupling.

89
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,870
Economic self-reliance through this “dual
circulation” strategy is one that the Chinese

90
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,680
Communist Party has been talking about since
May.

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,930
“This model entails engaging international
capital, financial, and technological markets

92
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:56,490
when advantages can be gained while simultaneously
bolstering indigenous capabilities to avoid

93
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,810
over-reliance on the global economy.”

94
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,090
So don’t worry, foreign investors.

95
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,100
The Chinese Communist Party still wants your
money.

96
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,250
Over the weekend, the Party published a speech
from Chinese leader Xi Jinping in their official

97
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,720
policy journal, Qiushi.

98
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,820
Which in English means “Seeking Truth”.

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,190
It makes sense because the Communist Party
needs to seek the truth in order to find it..

100
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,550
and then hide it better.\h\h

101
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,280
Xi Jinping actually gave this speech back
in April, but the fact that Qiushi published

102
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,340
it now means it’s directly related to the
Communist Party’s new 5-year plan.\h

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,160
So what did Xi talk about?

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,580
A lot of it was about everybody’s favorite
topic: supply chains.

105
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Wait!

106
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,580
Don’t change the channel.

107
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
This is important.\h

108
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,050
“Xi Jinping called for setting up independent
and controllable supply chains to ensure industrial

109
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,940
and national security.”

110
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,620
You know, this is one of those rare occasions
when I say, maybe we could learn something

111
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,490
from the Chinese Communist Party here.

112
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,650
I mean, sure they’re great at starting personality
cults and purging their enemies, but they

113
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,590
definitely know their supply chains, too.

114
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,250
So when Xi Jinping calls for supply chains
that are “independent, controllable, safe,

115
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,800
and reliable,” that’s not a bad idea.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,620
After all, a large part of the US decoupling
from China is also about having supply chains

117
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,520
in the US that are “independent, controllable,
safe and reliable.”

118
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,450
Which from America’s perspective means supply
chains that are not controlled by China.

119
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,430
In Xi Jinping’s speech, he also said that
the Communist Party must “tighten the dependence

120
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,850
of the international industrial supply chain
on China, and form a strong counter-measure

121
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,610
and deterrent ability for foreign parties
to artificially cut off supply.”

122
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,850
 Basically, Xi wants China to be able to
counter any attempts to cut off China’s

123
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,050
imports of necessary goods through sanctions.\h

124
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,700
Here’s an example of what he’s afraid
of: Last year the US tightened sanctions on

125
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,440
Chinese telecom company Huawei.

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,790
Those sanctions prevented companies from selling
Huawei US technology.

127
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,990
Or selling Huawei things that were made with
US technology, even if those things were not

128
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,430
made in the US.

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,940
Like semiconductor chips.

130
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,340
Those sanctions slowed Huawei’s sales growth.

131
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,370
But even worse for Huawei, they started running
out of smartphone chips because of the sanctions.\h

132
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,540
So now Huawei is trying to set up a chip plant
in China that would not use any US technology.

133
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,229
So that’s one reason why Chinese officials
are afraid of US decoupling.

134
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,220
They don’t want the US to be able to cut
off goods to China.\h

135
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,320
But the other part of Xi Jinping’s statement
is also illuminating.

136
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,730
In addition to preventing other countries
from cutting off China’s supply, Xi said

137
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,070
that the Communist Party must “tighten the
dependence of the international industrial

138
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,340
supply chain on China.”

139
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,420
So while China is becoming less dependent
on the rest of the world, they also want to

140
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,460
make the rest of the world *more* dependent
on China.

141
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,560
I’ll explain how after the break.

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,360
Welcome back.

143
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,710
China wants to be less dependent on other
countries, while making other countries more

144
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,630
dependent on China.

145
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,310
By doing things like dominating medical supplies.

146
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,250
Or becoming the biggest trading partner for
countries and making them dependent on buying

147
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,360
stuff from China, and selling stuff to China.\h

148
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,670
Even if other countries are not completely
dependent on China, it’s enough to make

149
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,940
them believe that it would be too painful
and costly to lose China as a trade partner.

150
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:49,920
A good example is Australia, which exports
a lot of goods to China.

151
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,930
China and Australia are in the middle of a
diplomatic and trade dispute.

152
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,320
It picked up steam back in April after Australia
called for an independent investigation into

153
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,370
the origins of the coronavirus.

154
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:09,970
Since then, Chinese officials have placed
import bans on a bunch of Australian goods.\h

155
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:15,050
Those bans could stop 6 billion Australian
dollars worth of goods.

156
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:22,390
This week, tons of live Australian lobsters
were left stranded at an airport in China.

157
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,140
Won’t somebody think of the lobsters?!

158
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,470
Meanwhile, Chinese state-run media have directly
said that China is importing less from Australia

159
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,890
because of Australia’s political stance.

160
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:40,781
So with the Chinese Communist Party essentially
trying to use trade to bully Australia, maybe

161
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:45,450
Australia should think of ways to diversify
its exports to other countries.\h

162
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,570
Doesn’t anyone else want Australian lobsters?

163
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:55,670
But according to a former Australian ambassador
to China, Australia’s economic dependency

164
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,260
on China will not change.

165
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,170
He said that Australia needs to find a way
to reset the relationship with China.\h

166
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:08,320
Because “talk about Australia significantly
diversifying its economic relationship with

167
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,430
China by turning to other markets is ‘nothing
other than wishful thinking.’”

168
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,910
So the former ambassador’s message is that
Australia is always going to be dependent

169
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,860
on China and there’s nothing Australia can
do about it except be nicer to China.

170
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,010
At this point you might be thinking, is this
guy working for China?

171
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,040
Close.

172
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,650
He runs a China business advisory firm.

173
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,090
And he’s on the board of a Chinese-owned
coal mining company in Australia.\h

174
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,820
With former ambassadors like these, who needs
enemies?

175
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,770
But the point is that the Chinese Communist
Party’s strategy in the five year plan,

176
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,080
as directly stated by Xi Jinping, is to make
China a self-reliant economy while keeping

177
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,680
the rest of the world’s economy dependent
on China.

178
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,750
You know, sometimes, when Party leaders tell
us what they’re going to do, we should believe

179
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,020
them.

180
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,200
Especially since it looks like Chinese officials
are already doing it to Australia.

181
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,460
And the US will be next.\h

182
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,450
Because remember, America is the real bully.

183
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,620
And now, it’s time for me to answer another
question from one of you, a fan who supports

184
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,570
China Uncensored on the crowd funding website
Patreon.

185
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,890
Jason says, “Chris, Matt, and Shelly should
build the Zhongnanhai in minecraft, fill it

186
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:37,110
with commies, and then they drop millions
upon millions of tons of TnT on it.

187
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,480
That's the quality content i pay monthly to
see

188
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,820
Well that’s good to know Jason.

189
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,279
So in a recent episode called China Is Targeting
Americans about how China is threatening to

190
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,110
kidnap Americans, I lament that people seem
more interested in watching Minecraft lets

191
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,650
plays than China Uncensored.\h

192
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,950
That’s a video from Mumbo Jumbo, one of
my favorite Minecrafters.

193
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,930
And so many of you have been suggesting Matt,
Shelley and I start our own Minecraft lets

194
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,450
play.

195
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,300
That is something we *could* do.

196
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,360
But is that something you *want* us to do?

197
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,560
Let me know in the comments.

198
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,440
And Jason, if enough people agree with you,
maybe you will be seeing us build Zhongnanhai

199
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,710
in Minecraft.

200
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,240
I have no idea how long that would take.

201
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,450
Probably way too long.\h

202
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,870
Thanks for the suggestion Jason.

203
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,030
And if you like the show, be like Jason and
support China Uncensored through the crowdfunding

204
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,030
website Patreon.

205
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,490
And I might answer your question at the end
of an episode.

206
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,720
Or build your face in Minecraft.

207
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,990
Thank you for watching.

208
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,060
And did you know, 60% of you who watch China
Uncensored are not subscribed to our channel?

209
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,040
If you’re watching, please, hit the subscribe
button.

210
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,300
It’s a huge help to the show.

211
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,770
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

212
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,350
See you next time.
