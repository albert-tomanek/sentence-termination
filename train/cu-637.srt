1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,680
China has been gearing up to invade Taiwan.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,320
And the US has failed to act.

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:08,400
Is time running out?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,840
The Chinese Communist Party has become more\h
and more aggressive with Taiwan. For instance,\h\h

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,320
sending warplanes near the island nation.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,120
Like, a lot of warplanes.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Especially when high level\h
US officials are visiting.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,280
And that’s because the Chinese Communist Party is\h
in a bit of a fix. In the past it had said, by the\h\h

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,680
year 2020, the Chinese Communist Party should be\h
prepared to invade Taiwan. It basically made the\h\h

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,920
mistake of all those old science fiction movies\h
that were set in the far, far future of 1999.

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,720
But the Chinese regime faces another challenge, in\h
what it calls “reuniting” Taiwan. That challenge\h\h

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,240
is the US. The US is showing\h
unprecedented levels of support of Taiwan.\h\h

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,080
Including selling them weapons.\h

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
Like, a lot of weapons.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
All the weapons.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,560
So how has this changed China’s invasion\h
plans? I know the person I need to talk to.\h\h

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,960
Joining me once again is Ian Easton, senior\h
director at the Project 2049 Institute.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,600
Thanks for joining me Ian.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
Ian, it's always a pleasure to have you on.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,160
Chris, it's a great pleasure to\h
see you. Thanks for having me.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Definitely. So the Chinese Communist Party said\h
it would be ready to retake Taiwan by 2020.\h\h

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,840
I mean, I guess there's a few months left,\h
but how likely do you think that is now?

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:49,440
Well, I think happily they're not ready or if they\h
are, they've decided that they're going to delay a\h\h

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:57,120
potential attack on Taiwan, certainly by this time\h
of the year, if they have not already mobilized,\h\h

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,720
if they're not already prepared to launch\h
amphibious fleets, and they're not, then their\h\h

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,800
window of opportunity has closed. And so Taiwan\h
is not safe from a potential conflict, of course,\h\h

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,560
because there's a lot of other things\h
that the Chinese Communist Party could do,\h\h

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,200
but they are safe from invasion because\h
from the end of this month forward, the\h\h

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,680
sea states that the wind and the wave conditions\h
and the Taiwan Strait make an invasion virtually\h\h

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,520
impossible. And that won't change until\h
the middle of late March of next year.

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,480
So last time you were on the show, we talked\h
about how Hong Kong in some ways had saved Taiwan\h\h

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
because the communist party\h
was so focused on Hong Kong,\h\h

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,240
that it wasn't spending as\h
much effort to threaten Taiwan.\h\h

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,840
Now that the CCP has cracked down on Hong\h
Kong, are things more dangerous for Taiwan?

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,840
Yeah, I think it's much more dangerous now. To\h
your point, the only good thing that has happened\h\h

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,440
is that folks in Taiwan, and I think here in\h
Washington, have started to wake up to the\h\h

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,240
threat. They've seen what happened to Hong Kong.\h
They've seen the backsliding on commitments that\h\h

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,840
the Chinese Communist Party made. And they've\h
seen this really terrible human right atrocity\h\h

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,360
with the national security law, which is this\h
draconian law, which really prevents any real\h\h

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,160
freedom of press freedom of assembly. Any of the\h
freedoms promised to the people of Hong Kong.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,000
I think that served as a wake-up call, and\h
that's all to the good. The problem is,\h\h

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,720
now that the world has been shocked by Hong Kong\h
and really staggered by what has happened and\h\h

44
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,280
not actually done anything to raise the costs for\h
some of the Chinese Communist Party's outrageous\h\h

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:54,800
behavior, I'm afraid that it could be the case\h
that the CCP elite have drawn a conclusion from\h\h

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,320
their experience that we really don't want them\h
to draw. And that conclusion is that they can do\h\h

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,520
almost anything. They can have concentration camps\h
in Xinjiang. They can do this massive crackdown,\h\h

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,400
which again, I think really shocked a lot of\h
people in Hong Kong, and now they can threaten\h\h

49
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,600
Taiwan and no one is going to stand up against\h
them. And so I'm afraid that for those reasons\h\h

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,520
and others, that it's going to be very difficult\h
to prevent a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
So even though the window of opportunity\h
for an invasion this year has passed,\h\h

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
would you say that we should be more or\h
less worried about an invasion of Taiwan\h\h

53
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
in the next year versus this past year?

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Well, I think with every year that\h
passes the balance of military power, and\h\h

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,360
this is not my own assessment, but this is from\h
the department of defense. And you can read\h\h

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,120
the recently published report to Congress on\h
Chinese military power. They released it last\h\h

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,240
month. According to their assessments, China's\h
military reform and reorganization program,\h\h

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,240
which Xi Jinping started in early 2016,\h
has really changed the nature of the threat\h\h

59
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,720
that the United States faces and that Taiwan faces\h
from the PLA, the People's Liberation Army. And\h\h

60
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,080
because China really has engaged in this sweeping\h
military buildup, I mean, it's really remarkable.\h\h

61
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,760
It's actually stunning what they've been\h
able to do just in the past five years.\h\h

62
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,840
And if those trend lines continue into the\h
future, as I think we have to expect them to\h\h

63
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,920
do the balance will continue to tip in the favor\h
of China and that will encourage them to do what\h\h

64
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,040
they've said very publicly they aim to do, and\h
that is to attack and eventually conquer Taiwan.\h\h

65
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
And that's something that could drag us into\h
a superpower war. So it's very dangerous.

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,160
Well, so let's talk about the Chinese war planes\h
flying over the median line in the Taiwan Strait.\h\h

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
Before this year, they had done it very\h
rarely, and now they send something like\h\h

68
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,520
over 40 war planes across the line in\h
the last few weeks. Why are they doing\h\h

69
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,760
that? Is it to intimidate Taiwan? Or is\h
there a tactical reason they're doing it?

70
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,640
Well, there's a lot of benefits from them. And you\h
could look at it from the tactical perspective.\h\h

71
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,680
Every time they do that, they're able to gain\h
intelligence that whenever they send fighters\h\h

72
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,480
across the Taiwan Strait media line, which they\h
no longer recognize that now they've officially\h\h

73
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,720
denied that it ever existed. Even though everybody\h
respected it for really the past two decades,\h\h

74
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,280
every time they do that, they have intelligence\h
gathering aircraft airborne, which are collecting\h\h

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,960
signals and they have Taiwan on a stopwatch.\h
And they're seeing how long it takes Taiwan\h\h

76
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
to scramble its fighters. They're looking at\h
their characteristics if the Taiwanese turn on\h\h

77
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,480
their air defense radars, which I think might be\h
tempting for them to do in certain circumstances,\h\h

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,400
the Chinese can collect all of that electronic\h
data and then they can use it in the future for\h\h

79
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,880
deception purposes. They can use it to jam\h
those radars if they know what frequencies\h\h

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
they run on. And they can learn more\h
about their electronic order of battle.

81
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
There's a lot of tactical things they can do.\h
They can also wear down the pilots in Taiwan.\h\h

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,000
They can wear down the airframes in Taiwan because\h
of the time we use military now is to constantly\h\h

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,760
be on strip alert, and they constantly have\h
to have fighter aircraft actually orbiting\h\h

84
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,360
around Taiwan to respond to these incursions\h
which are happening constantly now. That means\h\h

85
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,720
that those are pilots and those are aircraft\h
that are not available for training. They're not\h\h

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,080
available for professional military education.\h
They're not available for their other duties.\h\h

87
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,040
And it really wears them down over time. I think\h
there's been some mixed numbers that have come\h\h

88
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:05,520
out. One report said that Taiwan now was doing\h
3,000 sorties a year. Another said 4,000 sorties\h\h

89
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,560
a year in response to, well, over 2,000 Chinese\h
military sorties around the Taiwan Strait area.

90
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm not sure what the actual numbers are,\h
but if that's true, that is just staggering,\h\h

91
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,760
because that really is going to overtime.\h
That is going to wear out the pilots. It's\h\h

92
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,000
going to wear out the airframes and it's going\h
to reduce readiness in Taiwan. Now, of course,\h\h

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,480
that's just the tactical issue. There's also the\h
strategic issue. And the strategic issue is that\h\h

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,720
the Chinese Communist Party has decided to\h
create a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. And\h\h

95
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,760
they have done everything in their power with\h
their propaganda services, with their military\h\h

96
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,160
exercises across from Taiwan. I mean, there's\h
recently amphibious landing exercises, which\h\h

97
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,400
they highlighted. And they said explicitly\h
that they're preparing to invade Taiwan\h\h

98
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,320
in addition to all that aircraft activity.\h
And in addition to cyber attacks. Taiwan's\h\h

99
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,960
constantly being hit by cyber attacks. And so\h
there's a lot of provocations going on right now.\h\h

100
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,080
And one of the questions is why. And\h
that's a question I think that remains open\h\h

101
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,960
to some debate and interpretation,\h
but it's an important one.

102
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,920
Well, I know China was also previously very\h
interested in economic or political infiltration\h\h

103
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,360
in Taiwan. And I was in Taiwan earlier this year\h
for the election and my impression was that China\h\h

104
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,160
was genuinely surprised that Tsai Ing-wen won\h
re-election. How does that affect their strategy?

105
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,040
Well, it certainly made it much more\h
difficult for them to infiltrate Taiwan\h\h

106
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,440
and to subvert Taiwan's democratic government\h
from within. If the opposition candidate had won,\h\h

107
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,480
or if the DPP had not won such a sweeping victory,\h
because they really did win this crushing victory\h\h

108
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,440
in their parliament in addition to the presidency,\h
obviously president Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected.\h\h

109
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,400
If that had not happened, if that election had\h
gone another way, I think that would have been\h\h

110
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:14,480
very dangerous for Taiwan's national security\h
because the opposition party has so many\h\h

111
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,760
members whose own behavior in the past, a lot of\h
which has now come to light, is very questionable.\h\h

112
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,600
And it's very questionable why certain\h
KMT politicians decided to go to Beijing\h\h

113
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,320
and to sing the national anthem of the people's\h
Republic of China. Very questionable why one\h\h

114
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,600
of their leading political candidates\h
is soon to go to the China youth forum\h\h

115
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,400
organized by the Chinese Communist Party,\h
but refuses to come visit the United States.

116
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,520
And even before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were\h
refusing to come to the United States and they\h\h

117
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,560
would just constantly go to China instead. I\h
think those are some worrying signs. Locally\h\h

118
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,880
to your earlier point, what happened in\h
Hong Kong did wake people up in Taiwan.\h\h

119
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,800
They didn't see the threat of subversion. They\h
saw what might happen if they elected pro Beijing\h\h

120
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,960
politicians or politicians who might be under\h
the influence of the Chinese Communist Party and\h\h

121
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,840
could be coerced. And so they voted a different\h
way. And I think we're very lucky that they did\h\h

122
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,240
because ensuring Taiwan survival as a democracy,\h
it's not only in the interest, of course,\h\h

123
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,760
of the Taiwanese people, it's also in the interest\h
of the American people, that if we lose Taiwan,\h\h

124
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,200
our entire strategic posture in Asia will\h
be devastated by that. It would be the worst\h\h

125
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,680
thing to happen to the United States in terms\h
of geo-politics. It'd be a worst thing to happen\h\h

126
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,080
since world war II. And so it's really,\h
I think fortunate for us that Taiwan is\h\h

127
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,640
governed now by administration, which takes\h
the challenges that they have very seriously.

128
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,560
Well, so on that point. Many countries around the\h
world are changing their stands toward the CCP.\h\h

129
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
And now there are even alliances like\h
the quad that are forming to counter\h\h

130
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,840
the Chinese Communist Party.\h
How does Taiwan fit into that?

131
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,760
Well, unfortunately, Taiwan doesn't fit in because\h
our government policy in many ways is still\h\h

132
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,080
mired in the past. That the way we treat\h
Taiwan is the same way that we've treated\h\h

133
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,600
Taiwan since the late 1970s, when we\h
decided to close our embassy in Taipei\h\h

134
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,560
and to de-recognize Taiwan's legitimate\h
government. And then to recognize the\h\h

135
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,480
Chinese Communist Party government, the People's\h
Republic of China in Beijing. And since then,\h\h

136
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,120
unfortunately, we've really treated Taiwan in many\h
ways like a pariah. In some ways we treat North\h\h

137
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Korea better than we treat Taiwan. And it's really\h
hypocritical because of course, Taiwan is this\h\h

138
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,600
flourishing democracy. It's a very pro-American\h
country. I've traveled to a lot of places in\h\h

139
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,080
Asia and I can tell you that the Taiwanese\h
people are about as pro-American as they come,\h\h

140
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:10,640
and it really is a shame that so far, the\h
Trump administration has not done a fundamental\h\h

141
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,880
re-look at our Taiwan policy. But having said\h
that, they have done a lot of good things.

142
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,840
There's been a significant improvement in the\h
amount of respect that Taiwan has given. There's\h\h

143
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,240
been some high-level state department visits\h
to Taiwan and of course, arm sales to try to\h\h

144
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,160
support Taiwan's ability to maintain a credible\h
self-defense. But I'm afraid it's really not\h\h

145
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,640
enough. And if we continue to hold Taiwan at arms\h
length, Taiwan will just become weaker over time.\h\h

146
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120
There's a lot more that we could do. I mean,\h
we could have shipped businesses to Taiwan.\h\h

147
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,560
We could do joint military exercises with the\h
Taiwanese military to make sure that they're\h\h

148
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,160
actually able to stand side-by-side with\h
our forces in the Pacific. And if needs be\h\h

149
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,600
defend our common interests from the Chinese\h
attack. We could have a small number of U.S.\h\h

150
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,720
troops or Marines stationed in Taiwan as\h
a strategic trip line to make sure that\h\h

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,120
Beijing is clear about our intentions\h
if they invade. There's really a lot\h\h

152
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,360
more that can be done. There's a lot of\h
opportunities for the future in that regard.

153
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Why do you think those\h
things haven't happened yet?

154
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Well, they haven't happened\h
because people are afraid.

155
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Mm-hmm .

156
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,440
Any time there is an election in Taiwan, anytime\h
there's an arm sales notification to Taiwan,\h\h

157
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,840
anytime there's a U.S. government visit to Taiwan,\h
or even a tweet about Taiwan, people are terrified\h\h

158
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,960
that that is going to be the trigger\h
for a war because the Chinese Communist\h\h

159
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:53,120
Party is constantly making these really radical\h
threats in that regard. And no one wants to be\h\h

160
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,560
the decision maker, the leader that's responsible\h
for triggering a potential great power war. The\h\h

161
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,480
problem with that type of reactive policy\h
is that if you're constantly reacting\h\h

162
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,840
to what the Chinese Communist Party wants, then\h
you're not advancing towards what you want.

163
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,840
And what we should want, I think is to treat\h
a fellow democracy like a legitimate country,\h\h

164
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,840
if it is, and Taiwan certainly is. And so then the\h
question becomes, well, if we're going to do that,\h\h

165
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,440
how do we do that in an innovative way?\h
How do we do that in a creative way,\h\h

166
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,480
such that we can maintain deterrence? We can make\h
sure that China doesn't actually come to a place\h\h

167
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,840
where they can consider an invasion of Taiwan a\h
realistic option or a favorable option for them.\h\h

168
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:50,880
And we can do it in such a way where we don't\h
provide them a pretext for actually declaring war\h\h

169
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,560
or just attacking out of the blue. I think\h
it's going to require a lot more thought.

170
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,080
So essentially the United States could do what\h
China always does and use short of war tactics.

171
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
Yeah. There's no question that\h
if the United States government\h\h

172
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,760
got a group of strategists together from the\h
national security council, the state department,\h\h

173
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:20,320
the Pentagon treasury, if they sat together\h
and they said, "How can we recognize Taiwan's\h\h

174
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
government in the next five years?" Obviously\h
it's not something you want to do overnight,\h\h

175
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
because again, that could actually provoke\h
the very thing you want to prevent,\h\h

176
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,040
but how could we do in five years?\h
How can we stair-step it? How can we\h\h

177
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,480
take small, incremental, but consistent steps\h
into the future in such a way where five years\h\h

178
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,280
from now we'll be in a much better place to\h
dramatically, and in terms of deterrence,\h\h

179
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,560
because we know that strategic ambiguity, which\h
is our current policy, we know that doesn't work.

180
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,960
We would never do that with Japan, South Korea and\h
the Philippines. We would never do that with any\h\h

181
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,760
other. And in fact, we don't do that. We have not\h
for the past seven years done that with any other\h\h

182
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:04,240
democratic country that faces the type of\h
existential threat that Taiwan does. And so then\h\h

183
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:13,280
the question becomes, "How can we do it in the\h
right way?" What are the creative solutions that\h\h

184
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,920
might exist that no one's thought about before,\h
because no one has asked the question before.

185
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,840
Do you have any sense how Joe Biden\h
administration might treat Taiwan?

186
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,920
I don't know. This is something that I know\h
a lot of people are very interested in,\h\h

187
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:36,960
but of course we don't have evidence yet of what\h
a potential future administration might do because\h\h

188
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,560
they're not empowered yet. And so we don't know\h
who is going to be his top advisors. There's\h\h

189
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,800
some speculation out there, but we don't know for\h
sure who his foreign policy team is going to be.\h\h

190
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,200
And until you know who the team is going\h
to be, it's really difficult to assess\h\h

191
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,640
what their views are on any particular issue.\h
But certainly whether it's president Biden come\h\h

192
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:09,200
January 2021, or president Trump part two, this is\h
probably going to be the most important question\h\h

193
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,240
that they're going to have to grapple with in\h
the coming four years. If they get it right,\h\h

194
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:22,240
we'll be able to maintain peace in the region.\h
If they get it wrong, I think we're going into\h\h

195
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
a very dangerous future. And so it's really\h
important that folks take it seriously.\h

196
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,160
 Well, thank you again for joining me and\h
it's always a pleasure to have you on.

197
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,560
Chris, it's my pleasure. Thanks so much.

198
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,240
Thank you.\h

199
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,920
And Ian Easton also joined us on the China\h
Unscripted podcast this week to talk about the\h\h

200
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,640
rise of the Chinese military—and whether war with\h
the US is inevitable. I’ll put the link below.\h

201
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:55,840
Thanks for watching China Uncensored. Once\h
again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.\h
