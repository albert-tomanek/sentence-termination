00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,149
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,300
long may Xi Jinping reign!

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,720
Seriously, he might be reigning

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,000
for a long time.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,680
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,530
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,830
Big news for Chinese leader Xi Jinping!

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,740
He could become China’s “president”
for life.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,740
“The Communist Party this weekend

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,740
announcing a proposal to scrap

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,240
the two-term limit for presidents,

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,050
meaning Xi Jinping could stay on indefinitely.”

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,800
“Changes to the constitution in the last
year

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,230
have made Xi the most powerful Chinese leader

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,800
since Mao Zedong—

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,680
the founder of the People’s Republic—

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,870
who died in office,

18
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,100
having never retired.”

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,579
Retirement?

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,910
Xi is only 64!

21
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,559
It’s way too early to think about retirement.

22
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:48,129
Yes, as Chinese netizens have point it out,

23
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,140
Xi Jinping has found what he loves

24
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,840
and is sticking with it.

25
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,940
Netizens have always noticed

26
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:55,559
a more than passing similarity

27
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,219
between Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh.

28
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,940
But after this latest news,

29
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,219
some of the Pooh bear memes

30
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,219
on China’s internet

31
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,380
are difficult to decipher.

32
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,940
Hmm, I wonder what this one means...

33
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,950
But weirdly,

34
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,370
Chinese authorities don’t seem to have

35
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,800
a sense of humor about this.

36
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,010
Censors have once again banned references

37
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,110
to Winnie the Pooh on China’s internet.

38
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,990
You know what else they’ve banned?

39
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,020
The phrase “I disagree.”

40
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,870
So fellas, if you’re in China,

41
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,710
now’s the time to hit up your crush on WeChat

42
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,730
and ask her out.

43
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,730


44
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,730
She can’t disagree.

45
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,730
Of course,

46
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,310
if we’re talking Winnie the Pooh,

47
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,490
I’m definitely the wise Owl,

48
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,360
since I predicted this in 2016.

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,840
“There’s still more power Xi can grab.

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,820
And if he gets it,

51
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,860
then what?

52
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,990
Well, he may use it to stay in power

53
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,610
beyond the year 2022,

54
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,750
when, according to supposed precedent,

55
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,750
he would to step down

56
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,910
because he will have served two five-year
terms.”

57
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,350
“You know, not quite a president,

58
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,020
or a dictator.

59
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,760
More of a presitator.”

60
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
You know, there are times

61
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,890
when saying “I told you so”

62
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,090
leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.

63
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,170
This, is not one of those times!

64
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,300
I told you so!

65
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,540
Presitator for life baby!

66
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,420
Pass me some of that honey.

67
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,920
I believe we have a clip

68
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,800
of Xi Jinping’s response.

69
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,480
“Oh I just can’t wait to be king!”

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Wow, it’s amazing how much of our childhood

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,650
is a metaphor for tyranny.

72
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,739
Now the end to presidential term limits

73
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,260
is not set in stone.

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,680
It’s a constitutional amendment proposed

75
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,849
by the Central Party Committee.

76
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,080
It still needs to be approved

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,780
later this month by a vote

78
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,329
from China’s National People’s Congress.

79
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,409
So there’s still a good chance that...

80
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,130
haha, no, this is set in stone.

81
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,769
“The National People’s Congress

82
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,959
has never rejected a law that the party

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
or government has put before it.”

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
Now that’s called loyalty!

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,889
Or maybe Congress is just banned

86
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,290
from using the phrase “I disagree.”

87
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,810
But from a larger perspective,

88
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,099
this move shouldn’t really come as a surprise.

89
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,239
See, this removal of term limits

90
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,730
doesn’t really change the Chinese political
system.

91
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,650
It just exposes what the system

92
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,530
has been all along.

93
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,209
There’s a myth that after Mao died,

94
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,219
the Chinese Communist Party

95
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,629
ruled China through consensus.

96
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,430
No, they actually ruled China

97
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,639
using power struggles.

98
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,999
The goal has always been to

99
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,889
hold onto power as long as you can.

100
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,420
And the guy in charge is the one

101
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,420
who actually has control—

102
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,290
not necessarily the guy with the title.

103
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,109
In the 1980s and 90s,

104
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,260
Deng Xiaoping never held the top title,

105
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,590
but he was supreme leader—

106
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,870
even while Jiang Zemin was nominally

107
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,099
head of the CCP.

108
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,069
And then after Jiang Zemin technically

109
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,079
stepped down as president in 2003,

110
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,669
Jiang hung onto power behind the scenes

111
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,510
throughout the entire ten-year presidency

112
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,129
of the next guy, Hu Jintao.

113
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,700
In fact, 15 years later,

114
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,610
Jiang Zemin is still so powerful

115
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,120
behind the scenes

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,599
that Xi Jinping has been using his

117
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,879
anti-corruption campaign to purge

118
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,420
Jiang Zemin’s power base.

119
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,730
So Xi Jinping getting rid of

120
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,139
presidential term limits

121
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,480
is basically just him being transparent

122
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,260
about his plans to stay in power.

123
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,930
CCP politics is often called a “black box.”

124
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,380
It’s like the power struggle within the
CCP

125
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,460
is a wrestling match going on

126
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,380
in a completely dark room.

127
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,000
It’s really hard to see what’s going on.

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,460
Now, Xi Jinping is turning on the lights.

129
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,300
On second thought, maybe turn them off again.

130
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,420
I’m not sure anyone wants to see that.

131
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,440
So anyway, the constitutional amendment

132
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,780
that gets rid of presidential term limits

133
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,130
is going to pass,

134
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,700
with a likelihood of roughly 100 percent.

135
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,940
The amendment also gets rid

136
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,250
of vice presidential term limits.

137
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,410
Remember this guy, Wang Qishan?

138
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,550
He’s Eeyore.

139
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,090
Wang was Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption czar.

140
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,780
He was forced to retire from the top Party
leadership,

141
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,090
the Politburo Standing Committee,

142
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,290
last October because of his age.

143
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,010
That seemed like a big loss for Xi.

144
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,320
But it was actually a slick move.

145
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,980
Because technically you don’t have to

146
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,440
be in the Politburo

147
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,350
to hold a high position in government.

148
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,760
So Xi is going to bring Wang back to power...

149
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,840
this time as the new Vice President of the
government.

150
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,160
Or as you might call him, Vice Presitator.

151
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,030
And now, he and Xi Jinping

152
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,760
never have to say goodbye.

153
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,790
There are other changes to

154
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,510
the country’s constitution, too—

155
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,840
besides getting rid of term limits

156
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,140
for president and vice president.

157
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,550
Xi Jinping Thought will also be added—

158
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,790
just like it got added to

159
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,600
the Communist Party’s constitution in October.

160
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,300
The rule of the Communist Party is emphasized,

161
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,040
just to remind everyone that the government

162
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,830
isn’t really the one in charge.

163
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,520
And it also will establish

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,830
the National Supervision Commission.

165
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,440
The National Supervision Commission

166
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,470
is basically Xi Jinping and Wang Qishan’s

167
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,970
anti-corruption campaign on steroids.

168
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,970
Already, his campaign has purged more than

169
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,910
1.5 million corrupt Communist Party officials.

170
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,190
Wait, and now it’s time to add the steroids?

171
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,840
How many corrupt officials could possibly
be left to purge?!

172
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,900
Haha, don’t worry, there’s still several
million more.

173
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,400
And this corruption-purging

174
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,280
National Supervision Commission

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,150
will have the added benefit

176
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,240
of being above Chinese legal system.

177
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes, having it be subject to the rule of law

178
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,020
would just slow it down.

179
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,320
Being outside the law,

180
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,380
it has power to detain people

181
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,050
without having to waste time holding show
trials.

182
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,690
In fact, Xi Jinping has invented

183
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,570
a new kind of detention

184
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,110
just for Party officials.

185
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,400
He’s calling it “liu zhi”.

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,990
“Liu zhi is an original creation of China,

187
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,140
which had never been used

188
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,300
in other countries in the world.”

189
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,570
And this liu zhi replaces the previous

190
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,210
illegal system of detaining Party officials,

191
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,800
which was called shuang gui.

192
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,710
The Chinese Communist Party—

193
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,440
finding new ways to throw people in jail

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,960
since 1949.

195
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,600
But again, none of this should be surprising.

196
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
When Xi Jinping came to power,

197
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,520
he immediately was in the middle

198
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,450
of a life or death power struggle

199
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,390
with former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

200
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,940
That’s why he’s spent the last five-plus
years

201
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,600
purging all his rivals tied to Jiang,

202
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,260
and amassing power.

203
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
If he didn’t,

204
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,700
he’d get purged himself.

205
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,660
So, has Xi Jinping won now?

206
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,820
Does abolishing term limits mean that

207
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,940
he’s gotten rid of Jiang’s faction

208
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,790
and is now the supreme ruler of the CCP,

209
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,320
just like Mao?

210
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,150
Well, Xi Jinping may have the kitchy merchandise,

211
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,030
but that doesn’t mean he’s just like Mao.

212
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,130
Think about it, why abolish term limits now,

213
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,990
when Xi is only at the beginning of his

214
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,860
second five-year term?

215
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,670
Why not wait for a couple more years,

216
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,220
when he has more power?

217
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,500
Here’s one reason: Xi has no successor.

218
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,630
This is a key part of the CCP’s power struggles.

219
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,490
Deng was powerful enough to appoint

220
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,510
Jiang and then Hu as his successors.

221
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,970
But neither Jiang nor Hu were powerful enough

222
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,080
to appoint the next leader.

223
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,620
So they were forced to compromise.

224
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,450
So now Xi needs a successor,

225
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,680
but if he can’t control who that is,

226
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,940
then he could lose the power struggle.

227
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,980
How?

228
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,440
Well, officials who don’t like Xi

229
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:37,149
might otherwise just try to wait him out,

230
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,529
hoping the next guy will be better.

231
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,269
But now Xi has abolished term limits.

232
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:45,970
That’s a signal that he’s in this for
the long haul,

233
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,819
so officials had better fall in line.

234
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,319
But Xi isn’t Mao.

235
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,860
He’s still in the process of consolidating
power.

236
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,800
And there are signs he’s only just getting

237
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,449
to the level of power Jiang Zemin once had.

238
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,860
In a way, the National Supervision Commission

239
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,600
is Xi Jinping’s version of Jiang Zemin’s
610 Office.

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,850
Only instead of focusing on detaining

241
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,550
innocent Falun Gong practitioners,

242
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,810
it’s detaining corrupt Party officials.

243
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,999
Which at least is a less bad use

244
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,090
of a scary illegal detention system,

245
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,399
although it would be much better

246
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,860
to not have the scary illegal detention system
at all.

247
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,209
So now that Xi Jinping has managed

248
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,760
to get unlimited terms in office,

249
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,439
and is bringing back his anti-corruption czar,

250
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,439
and is creating up the

251
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,140
National Supervision Commission,

252
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,780
what’s next?

253
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,209
Well it’s kind of hard to tell.

254
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,329
Can someone turn on the lights?

255
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,621
So what do you think of China’s new

256
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,779
presitator for life?

257
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,440
Remember you can’t disagree.
