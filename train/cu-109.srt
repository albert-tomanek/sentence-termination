1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,350
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,270
China is going through a big change.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,060
People are getting rid of their cash.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,520
Not like that.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,480
I’m Shelley Zhang—

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,910
the voice in Chris’s ear,

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,150
and your temporary host

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,840
until Chris realizes how much he misses

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,220
New York City in the winter.

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,470
Or we all move the show to Hawaii.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,640
You know, when I was a kid,

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,960
I thought the future would bring us

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,300
robot maids and flying cars.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,570
Instead, we got cats on Roombas

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,620
and the ability to pay for bus rides

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,520
with our phones.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,510
If anyone from the flying car future

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,760
wants to trade,

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
call me.

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
Unless you’re also possibly about to

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,610
go to war with North Korea.

23
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,520
Anyway, the point is,

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,050
the future is now,

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,579
and it’s in China.

26
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,399
Because China is getting rid of old-fashioned
cash—

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,800
in favor of paying for stuff with your smartphone.

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,579
Whether you’re at a vending machine;

29
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,250
a toll booth;

30
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,680
or....a literal meat market;

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
nothing makes you forget

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,030
how much you’re actually spending,

33
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,800
paying like scanning a QR code.

34
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,170
It’s faster than the speed of regret.

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,530
Mobile phone payment in China

36
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,650
has skyrocketed.

37
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,430
It was basically nothing in 2012.

38
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,600
By 2016,

39
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,420
it had reached more than 5 trillion dollars,

40
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,700
and it’s projected to be more than

41
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,340
10 trillion dollars this year.

42
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,530
One analyst predicts that China

43
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,450
will be effectively cashless in five to ten
years,

44
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,560
and that this is a positive thing for business,

45
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,100
the government, and the public.

46
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,850
China is moving really fast on this.

47
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,030
Much faster than the US.

48
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,270
I mean, we do have it here too.

49
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,890
Like you how your iPhone keeps prompting you

50
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,970
to add ApplePay,

51
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,580
which you finally did—

52
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
but you still haven’t used it

53
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,890
because your credit card works perfectly fine.

54
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,860
Well, in China, most people don’t use credit
cards.

55
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,330
The entire country basically skipped that
step.

56
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,229
It’s partly for cultural reasons,

57
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,650
like having debt was seen as a bad thing.

58
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,270
It also didn’t help that Chinese officials

59
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,840
made it really hard for Visa and MasterCard

60
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,000
to access the Chinese market.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,340
Americans still use mostly credit cards.

62
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,890
In 2016 Americans spent only $112 billion

63
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,209
through mobile payment apps like ApplePay.

64
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,599
That might sound like a lot,

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,629
but it’s not.

66
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,000
Chinese citizens spent 50 times as much

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,230
using their phones.

68
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,790
They’re not using ApplePay, though.

69
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,709
Most people are using one of only two

70
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,969
giant Chinese homegrown payment services:

71
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,819
AliPay and WeChat Pay.

72
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,599
WeChat Pay is owned by Tencent,

73
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,319
which created the WeChat app—

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,359
the all-knowing social media app

75
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,120
that’s constantly watching you,

76
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,209
as Chris showed in our episode on August 23rd.

77
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,230
AliPay is even bigger.

78
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,430
It’s owned by Ant Financial,

79
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,189
which I mentioned on Monday;

80
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:44,620
it failed in its bid to take over

81
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,249
an American company.

82
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,329
These two giant companies

83
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:51,019
have cornered China’s mobile payment market,

84
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,019
and they’re on track

85
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,959
to make billions of dollars from it.

86
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,370
Between the two of them,

87
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,120
in 2016 they processed as much as

88
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,859
$5 trillion in electronic payments,

89
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:05,040
which is equal to a third of China’s GDP.

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
Nearly all merchants in China’s biggest
cities

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,790
allow customers to pay with AliPay and WeChat.

92
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,639
It’s so common that 14% of Chinese people

93
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,209
don’t even carry cash anymore.

94
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:17,409
Such a massive shift in how people spend money

95
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,709
will affect everything from China’s overall

96
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,879
economy and society down to

97
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,329
the life of your average Zhou.

98
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,079
The biggest benefit for Mr. Zhou is

99
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,329
of course, convenience.

100
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:29,719
Forget fumbling for your wallet,

101
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,049
just pay with your phone,

102
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,069
which you’re already holding,

103
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,540
all the time.

104
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,329
But convenience does come at a cost.

105
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,329
For one,

106
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,769
people tend to spend 12 to 18 percent more

107
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,209
when they don’t use cash.

108
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,120
I mean, when you can’t see the money

109
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,790
disappearing from your wallet,

110
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,980
it’s easy to lose track of

111
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,379
how much you’re spending...

112
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,469
on books...

113
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,749
and shoes...

114
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:55,180
and...I should probably return some stuff.

115
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,099
In addition to spending more,

116
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,299
all of Mr. Zhou’s spending is now tracked.

117
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,299


118
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,510
Something one would-be robber in Ningbo

119
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,189
found out the hard way.

120
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,029
After mugging a woman in an alleyway,

121
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,400
he discovered that she didn’t really

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,869
have a lot of cash.

123
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:11,280
So he forced her to send him money

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,459
using WeChat.

125
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,499
Which was genius.

126
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,370
Except for the fact that all WeChat accounts

127
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,859
require people to register with their ID,

128
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,590
so the police caught him immediately.

129
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,669
Well, first they laughed.

130
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:23,710
A lot.

131
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,930
He would have gotten away with it too,

132
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,479
if it weren’t for his own stupidity.

133
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
Remember, by Chinese law,

134
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,080
all Chinese companies are required to

135
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,389
share user data with the government.

136
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,340
Actually, AliPay founder Jack Ma

137
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,409
is already offering it up.

138
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,720
He talked candidly about helping

139
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,150
Chinese law enforcement in ways

140
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,759
that would make Silicon Valley cringe.

141
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,220
Like by letting Chinese police look at

142
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,170
what AliPay users buy,

143
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,840
and use patterns to identify potential criminals.

144
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
Do you really want the Chinese police

145
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,889
to be able to monitor everything you buy?

146
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,300
“Mr. Zhou, is there a reason you bought

147
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,770
a pressure cooker, an alarm clock,

148
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,550
and 52 pounds of dried squid

149
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,831
at 3 in the morning?”

150
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,360
I mean, a future where the Chinese government

151
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,050
can monitor my every move is kind of scary.

152
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,919
On the other hand,

153
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,780
mobile payment is pretty convenient...

154
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,430
and I’m already holding my phone...

155
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,780
But even if you’re not worried about

156
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,550
the party-state’s all-seeing eye,

157
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,659
there is the fact that two companies

158
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,240
have all of your data,

159
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
and they’re using it in ways

160
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,020
that you can’t control.

161
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,810
Both Tencent and Alipay have

162
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,169
recently had privacy scandals,

163
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:34,419
and people are not happy.

164
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,560
Now you might be saying,

165
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,939
“Sure, Shelley, cashless payments are just

166
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,900
another way that giant corporations

167
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,050
sell us convenience in exchange for

168
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,220
all of our personal information,

169
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,639
which then becomes another piece

170
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,050
of the Communist Party’s

171
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,099
panopticon surveillance system

172
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,289
from which there will be no escape,

173
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,810
yada yada yada.”

174
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,480
But what does this mean for China’s economy?

175
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,560
Well, in the short term,

176
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,250
it’s great for China’s economy.

177
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,219
Remember, people paying with their phones

178
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:04,150
spend more.

179
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,069
More spending is good for local businesses,

180
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,620
which circulates money,

181
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,960
which fits in nicely with the Party’s agenda

182
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,830
for restructuring the economy.

183
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,430
In October, Chinese leader Xi Jinping

184
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,280
said that for China to become

185
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,729
a modern economic powerhouse,

186
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:20,729
Chinese people need to

187
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,150
increase domestic consumption.

188
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,150
That is, they need to buy local stuff,

189
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,530
not just export it to the West.

190
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,520
We gotta hit that 6.5 percent growth target
somehow.

191
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
But there are also some

192
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,389
potential pitfalls for the economy.

193
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,900
Remember how I said that Chinese people in
the past

194
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,020
did not like debt?

195
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,479
Well, there’s been a huge surge of people

196
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,050
taking on debt in the last couple years,

197
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,330
because consumers are constantly being bombarded

198
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,080
with pitches for loans and investment products

199
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,949
via their smartphones.

200
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,800
Borrowing a thousand dollars is now easier

201
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,449
than getting to level 7 in Candy Crush.

202
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,569
China’s central bank expressed concern that

203
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,039
“short-term consumer credit in China

204
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,300
soared 160% in the first eight months of 2017

205
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,800
from a year earlier.”

206
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,539
If you watched our episode on shadow banking,

207
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,800
you know that China already has

208
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,810
a problem with consumer debt.

209
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,430
And this just makes it harder to rein in.

210
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,479
And then are concerns over

211
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,460
money laundering and fraud.

212
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,650
For example, in Guangzhou,

213
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,650
$14.5 million yuan were stolen

214
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,889
in QR code scams.

215
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,159
The good news is that the government

216
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,270
is cracking down on fraud and money laundering.

217
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,139
They’re putting in new regulations this
year.

218
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,289
They want to start treating AliPay and WeChat

219
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,820
more like banks,

220
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,120
and set up a central clearing house

221
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,099
so regulators can more easily track

222
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,210
what’s actually going on with transactions.

223
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,210
That being said,

224
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,020
as mobile payments increasingly replace cash,

225
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,809
a lot of people will be left out of the system.

226
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,759
See, it’s easy to look at images

227
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,719
of middle class people in sparkling cities

228
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,419
and forget that most of China is still

229
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:57,360
really, really poor.

230
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
In the countryside,

231
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,990
the typical person lives off an average

232
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,169
of only $4 a day.

233
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,650
21% of Chinese don’t even have a bank account.

234
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,879
That’s like 300 million people

235
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,320
who have no way to access mobile payments.

236
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
That’s a lot!

237
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,629
It’s like the population of 12 Australias.

238
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,009
Or one America—

239
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,659
minus, let’s say, Texas.

240
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,320
Oh come on, Texans,

241
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,590
you keep saying you’re going to leave.

242
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,590
Back to China.

243
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,499
A lot of poor people will be left out of

244
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,190
the new cashless society.

245
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,590
But you know who else will be?

246
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,130
Tourists and other visitors.

247
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,039
Because you need to have a Chinese bank account

248
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,570
to use mobile payment services.

249
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,070
But the world is marching towards

250
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,300
a future of mobile payments.

251
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,550
China is leading the way.

252
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,870
Actually, if the US hadn’t rejected

253
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,240
AliPay’s takeover of MoneyGram

254
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,490
last week on security concerns,

255
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,840
we might have even seen it take off

256
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,790
much sooner in the US.

257
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,790
But even so,

258
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,850
the future is coming eventually.

259
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,620
I just hope it’s not the future

260
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,880
where they use it to predict crime.

261
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,620
So what do you think?

262
