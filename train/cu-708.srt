1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,210
China Promised Hong Kong One Country, Two
Systems

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,050
But the reality looks much different

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,850
How is the CCP’s broken promise

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,440
Affecting Hong Kong’s Economy?

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,630
Welcome back to China Uncensored, I'm Chris
Chappell.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,189
Joining me today is Edward Chin,

7
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,359
Hong Kong activist, hedge fund manager,

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,220
and founder of 2047 Hong Kong Monitor.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,279
Thanks for joining me Ed.

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,699
Chris it's good to see you in less than 100
days, I think?

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,040
Less than 100 days or about.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,829
Well, so these protests have been going on
for a long time now,

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,250
over 100 days.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,460
How has that affected the economy of Hong
Kong?

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,670
Some of the retail businesses definitely have
suffered,

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,489
but a lot of people are sympathetic about
the current situation

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,059
because almost it's like the last fight for
Hong Kong's core values,

18
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,320
freedom of speech, freedom of press,

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,679
and freedom to move around Hong Kong even.

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,789
Seems like Hong Kong is turning into more
like a semi police state.

21
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,860
It's something I don't want to see as a business
person.

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,110
I mean you've seen police and protestors clashing
in malls,

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,110
that's definitely not good for businesses.

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,270
No, it's not, I have seen students, very young
people,

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,280
very young age, 12, 13 years old even,

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,010
and very senior people, senior in terms of
age.

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,970
They come out in unison to defend what they
think.

29
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,120
And it's not just young people protesting.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,770
There's been lawyer protest, doctor protest.

31
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,680
This is really in all level of society.

32
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,980
I'm touched honestly,

33
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,760
like the medical profession,

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,770
they do come out,

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,240
not just the paramedics.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,640
I have seen one fifth year medical school
student

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,690
name remain anonymous.

38
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,950
He would put on full gear.

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,570
At first, he was just a paramedic.

40
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,670
But when police which is driven by money because
of the over pay,

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,890
you were paid like one and a half,

42
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,010
two times pay as a policeman to control the
situation so to speak.

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,390
When you fire so many tear gas canisters towards
demonstrators,

44
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,229
the young doctors to be, they would gear up
now.

45
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,430
I've seen them like dressed as more the Batmans,

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,970
The Avengers so to speak, right,

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,880
to defend that this is almost like the last
fight they believe in

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,460
because they were born like in the '90s or
they are millennials.

49
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,360
So they really believe like this is their
Hong Kong, they call it home.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,990
They might not have a memory of the colonial
days like us

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,460
because we benefited from the economic uprising
from 30 years ago.

52
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,000
They don't see that same type of a scenario,

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,440
but that they could only see like Hong Kong
as a more polarization.

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,930
So that's why they came out.

55
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,660
And even the older generation,

56
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,970
they come out and support.

57
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,930
Now, definitely it's extremes.

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,930
You could see the big real estate developers
who are,

59
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,709
some of them are members of the National People
Congress

60
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,430
or Political Consultative Conference.

61
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,560
Which is a mainland Chinese organization?

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Yeah.

63
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Right.

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
So they have to kowtow,

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,990
the big developers have to kowtow and say
condemn everyone.

66
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,820
They would say put up newspaper ads

67
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,940
and condemn the demonstrators from causing
so called trouble.

68
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,680
And part of the reason housing prices are
so high is

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,580
because of an influx of rich mainland Chinese
people, correct?

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
Yeah.

71
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,240
The housing prices have been up a lot

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,540
in over the last few decades.

73
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,450
But even with the protests going on in the
last 100 days or so,

74
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,180
people are concerned.

75
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,890
But it's not dropping like a rock.

76
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,480
There are still a lot of China money supporting
the real estate,

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,830
but then the Hong Kong tycoons,

78
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,970
they are also afraid that they will be replaced

79
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,500
by the mainland princelings.

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,940
So, they're extracting even the last penny

81
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,680
from the normal Hong Kong people.

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,470
That's something we wouldn't want to see.

83
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,590
So in unity for the first time,

84
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,500
the young professionals,

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,579
those people who are retiring,

86
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,699
the so called upper middle class too

87
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,759
are joining this so called movement.

88
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,629
It's beyond the extradition deal now,

89
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,710
it's like the last fight for Hong Kong.

90
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,639
Hong Kong people most of them,

91
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,449
I would say 99.999% are not asking for Hong
Kong's independence.

92
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,330
They're fighting for at least the Deng Xiaoping
motto,

93
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,069
which is that two systems has to remain intact.

94
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,419
We don't have that now.

95
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,860
The Hong Kong government has said the protests

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,889
are about economic inequality or livelihood
issues.

97
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,210
Do you think that's true?

98
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,789
I think that's part of the problem definitely.

99
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,919
Because 20 years ago,

100
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,909
you could see like a young accountant who
is making

101
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,569
10,000 Hong Kong per month,

102
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,580
20 years later, he's still making 10,000 per
month.

103
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,550
I would think if we want some more radical
changes

104
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,610
like the Hong Kong government should like
the Singapore model

105
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,270
build something like for young family at least
have

106
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,759
four to 500 square feet of living space.

107
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,360
I mean you cannot have like 150 square feet
net

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,729
having like a four person household living
in that

109
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,449
so called like chunckated home.

110
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,919
It's not as inhumane honestly,

111
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,289
you are talking about Hong Kong is so rich.

112
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,490
It's also so polarized.

113
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,259
And also for instance,

114
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:49,259
the minimum monthly salary for university
graduates,

115
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,330
it cannot be like 10,000 forever over the
last 25 years.

116
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,520
It has to be some minimum standard just like
a minimum wage,

117
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:06,830
let's say 20,000, 21, 22,000 honky make the
society more fair.

118
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,770
So far, a lot of people when they come out,

119
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,680
it's also they don't see a future.

120
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,909
The civil human rights front,

121
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,349
one of the major organizers of the protest

122
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,229
has accused Beijing of economic imperialism.

123
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,779
Has becoming a part of China helped the Hong
Kong economy?

124
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,539
Now, last time, Chris, when you were in Hong
Kong,

125
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:34,050
we already talk about liquid assets moving
overseas to Singapore,

126
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,151
Jersey Channel Island.

127
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:39,300
I have not seen this trend from stopping.

128
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
To be honest a lot of-

129
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,860
So money is still going out of Hong Kong.

130
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,999
Of course.

131
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:51,479
People won't think twice about the so-called,

132
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,189
right now is jurisdiction risks,

133
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,119
people have to think about it.

134
00:06:55,119 --> 00:07:00,169
Now with the human rights and democracy act,

135
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,669
that could be a reality in the US.

136
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:12,240
They could penalize Hong Kong or Beijing government
people

137
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,919
from entering the US or freezing their assets.

138
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,110
Would they have some retaliation to the pro-democracy
people too?

139
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,289
And also those 2 million people who come out
to the streets

140
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,819
who are fighting for their own freedoms.

141
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,939
I don't know.

142
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:31,029
That's something called a backup plan

143
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:39,180
or people have to think about logically if
Hong Kong is under duress.

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,229
First of all, Beijing could retaliate by freezing

145
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,210
some of the activism assets too.

146
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,009
Liquid assets is very important.

147
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,150
I think anyone with one million Hong Kong,

148
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,479
which is 150,000 US, they could think,

149
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,050
"Hey, if I opened a premier account in one
of the global banks,"

150
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,809
they want to offshore maybe 60% of the assets
overseas,

151
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:06,050
like a six four allocation.

152
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,000
Not in remembrance of the Tiananmen 64,

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,960
but the 64 allocation could be wise.

154
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,509
Because money movement,

155
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,559
you can do it quite easily.

156
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,909
Now I know a lot of Hong Kong companies like
Cathay Pacific

157
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,169
have come under pressure from the Chinese
Communist Party

158
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,669
to come out against the protesters.

159
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,309
Do you think more Hong Kong companies

160
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,189
will face that kind of pressure?

161
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,909
Even like BNP Paribas, which is a fringe bank,

162
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,620
which is quite controversial.

163
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,669
I think one of the activists lawyer, Jason
Eng, resigned abruptly,

164
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:47,350
just I think two weeks ago because of his
comments on his Facebook.

165
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,970
Now a lot of Hong Kong people are singing
a song called

166
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,690
May Glory be to Hong Kong.

167
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,829
I don't know whether you listened to it on
YouTube.

168
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:57,860
We've heard it there.

169
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah.

170
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,160
And then there were some mainland tourists

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,880
lash protesters were raiding IFC,

172
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,829
which is a high end shopping mall at the financial
center.

173
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,040
Like your Twin Towers, the equivalent.

174
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,019
And then Jason was commenting something

175
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,550
about the mainland protesters,

176
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,329
and then someone saw that and then has it
circulated in Waco,

177
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,449
and then he went into some trouble and then
he resigned.

178
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,850
Or he is no longer with the BMP.

179
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,850
Is unprecedented.

180
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,290
This is what I call white terror.

181
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,600
Not the word Caucasian white, but terror in
general.

182
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
We like to use that term white terror,

183
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,760
has nothing to do with that race.

184
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,580
Okay, well how would you define white terror?

185
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,870
It's horror show.

186
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,770
I mean it's like intimidation.

187
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,560
It's like what happened to me 10 months ago.

188
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:05,100
January 1st when I write a protest saying
President Xi Jingping,

189
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,779
please release the two Canadians,

190
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,820
the whole world was watching.

191
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,940
So even before I come out, they visited my
office

192
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,720
and say I detained an interviewee in my office.

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,200
And no one comes in for an interview on January
1st.

194
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,120
So, a lot of these weird things do happen
because the phones,

195
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,610
I think a lot of us, our phones are tapped.

196
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,029
So Hong Kong is becoming more and more like
as Jin Jen situation

197
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:39,509
with a lot of AI lamps, monitoring facial
recognition,

198
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,270
credit rating system in 2020.

199
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:49,069
So, a lot of things are slowly integrated
into the Chinese way.

200
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:54,649
That makes me worry because I don't see the
two systems as too valid now.

201
00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:00,630
That's why people still have to come out and
fight and to speak up.

202
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,850
Well are white collar professionals or any
companies

203
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,000
doing anything to support the protesters?

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
As individuals.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,070
A lot of them, a lot of them they do come
out,

206
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,930
but not at a corporate level.

207
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,930
You will be penalized.

208
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,190
Le Cafe was penalized, I think HSBC,

209
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,139
they replaced some of the senior executives.

210
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,170
And then I mentioned the BMP case,

211
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:33,879
and then preferably they will come out as
individuals and support.

212
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,709
Sometimes anonymous.

213
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,490
Sometimes if they go out,

214
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,279
they have to put on a mask.

215
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,430
Unfortunately, this is Hong Kong now.

216
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,430
Yeah.

217
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,880
So two credit rating agencies, Moody's and
Fitch,

218
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,470
have changed the outlook of Hong Kong to negative
recently.

219
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,670
Why is that?

220
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,589
Because they think the protests could be prolonged

221
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,829
and also the retail definitely has suffered.

222
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:07,740
Now I have a friend who is at first more like
Blue Ribbon,

223
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,000
which is more like pro-Beijing,

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
but now is more sympathetic towards the protesters

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,550
because his son is around that age too.

226
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,230
So he has a retail chain with 15 stores.

227
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,730
I won't mention what type of clothing

228
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,100
because otherwise you would know who he is.

229
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,660
So of course the sales got affected.

230
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,449
The sales drop 30, 40%, but at first five
years ago,

231
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:41,209
he blamed the Umbrella Movement that Professor
Benny Tai initiated

232
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,420
and to finance a banking group that support
Occupy Central,

233
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,459
also support Benny Tai's movement.

234
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,240
He was fiercely against it.

235
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,470
But now he becomes more sympathetic

236
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,959
because he knows that his son is around that
age too.

237
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,730
He doesn't see his son's upward mobility as
a Hong Kong-er.

238
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,870
So even his SEO suffer.

239
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,189
He negotiated with the landlord,

240
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,889
which is really in control of Hong Kong's
economy.

241
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,410
So do you think if one country,

242
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,320
two systems begins to become eroded or disappears,

243
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,930
that will be good or bad for the economy of
Hong Kong?

244
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,029
Honestly, the two systems doesn't exist anymore.

245
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:30,360
Now take a look at Macau right now, you have
Article 23,

246
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,730
you cannot have a protest.

247
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:39,290
People are very calm and so called orderly.

248
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,580
You only got one voice.

249
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,360
But Hong Kong, it's a quite multicultural
before

250
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,260
and Hong Kong has been an international city.

251
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:55,930
But this will become an international city
with a lot of constraints.

252
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,520
Now we don't have a curfew yet.

253
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,160
The government hinted that if things so got
out of control,

254
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,120
we could have curfews.

255
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,509
They would put up like ...

256
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:17,160
but we have a mini curfew going on right now.

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,550
And then the police can do searches on people
anytime,

258
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,360
and then they talk about this a retractable
baton

259
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,089
could be carried around.

260
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:36,879
There's a lot of debate on this so called
policeman

261
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,880
making excessive money I alluded to earlier,

262
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,170
they could immigrate to Taiwan

263
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,860
because the time of immigration investment
scheme

264
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,050
is only million NT dollars.

265
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,829
And so with one and a half years of work

266
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,149
with a lot of overtime pay,

267
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,319
they could immigrate to another country

268
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:01,400
by bashing of people,

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,630
which is sad.

270
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,790
I mean of course I say it half-jokingly now,

271
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,550
but actually is a very bad thing for Hong
Kong people

272
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,470
fighting Hong Kong people.

273
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,920
But this is how the CCP wants to play it.

274
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,660
So the US has the Hong Kong policy act of
1992

275
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,339
which basically as far as trade relations

276
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,029
go treats Hong Kong as something different

277
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:26,240
and separate from mainland China.

278
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,930
Now Congress is talking about passing

279
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,589
the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act,

280
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,920
which would have the US government review

281
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,540
whether or not there's reason to maintain
that difference.

282
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,730
What would happen to the Hong Kong economy

283
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:45,399
if the US treats Hong Kong the same as mainland
China?

284
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,339
That in fact remains to be seen,

285
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,379
but talk about the human rights and democracy
at first.

286
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:54,819
I think it's a good deterrent to be honest

287
00:15:54,819 --> 00:16:03,779
because people like Carrie Lam, her husband
got a UK passport,

288
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,019
same as her son.

289
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,970
But some of the tycoons who are so pro-Beijing,

290
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,050
the wife is still like an American

291
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,360
and then the kids all have US bank accounts

292
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,759
or companies in the US.

293
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,639
They have to think twice when you try to so
called

294
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,910
stabilize things in Hong Kong,

295
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,499
they have to think about the consequences

296
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:38,579
when you try to like create so much social
unrest.

297
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:44,720
I don't see if honestly when you have a rally,

298
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,529
when you don't have police, everything is
so orderly.

299
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,220
Sudden, when you have like 5,000 policemen

300
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,939
came out like a riot police

301
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,740
and then these speedy dragons

302
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,100
and then fiercely firing the tear gas and
then rubber bullets.

303
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,010
Suddenly you know the Hong Kong society goes
crazy.

304
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,960
Now go back to the human rights and democracy
act.

305
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,770
I think if the Congress pauses it,

306
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:20,950
I think it would be a good deterrent for the
Hong Kong government

307
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:26,960
to think twice about the evil deeds they try
to implement.

308
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,990
They have to think very carefully.

309
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,080
So I mean I don't know too well about the
politicians in the US,

310
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,300
but I think Marco Rubio and Nancy Pelosi,

311
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,900
they are doing a great job by helping Hong
Kong.

312
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,090
I don't want to talk about Trump,

313
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,380
it's a different story.

314
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,210
People have a love and hate on President Trump,

315
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,500
but definitely your Congressman has been helping
Hong Kong I think.

316
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
Thank you for that.

317
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,750
Yeah.

318
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,940
It's become a bipartisan issue, which is a
miracle in this day and age in the US.

319
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Yeah.

320
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,580
It is a miracle to see the US gets so united
on Hong Kong's issues.

321
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,800
All right.

322
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,590
Thank you very much for joining me today,
Ed.

323
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,840
I hope I don't see you in not too distant
future.

324
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,340
Yeah.

325
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,380
Under better circumstances.

326
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,940
Yes, of course.

327
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,440
Yeah.

328
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Thank you so much.
