00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,989
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:03,520
if you’re looking for Xi,

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
you better check under the sea.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,360
Because that is where you’ll find…

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,800
um, him.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,440
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,340
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,700
China is building an underwater sea platform

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,490
in the South China Sea.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,260
Which is a terrible idea.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,360
Didn’t they watch The Abyss?

12
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:25,860
Or Leviathan?

13
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,890
Or DeepStar Six?

14
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,890
Or the Evil Below,

15
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,989
or the Lords of the Deep?

16
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,870
Well, there sure were a lot of underwater

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,119
alien creature horror movies

18
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,739
made in 1989.

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,720
I'm sure that was just a coincidence.

20
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,550
But back to China's underwater sea platform.

21
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,620
It could be a bad idea

22
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,720
for a non-alien related reason, too.

23
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,739
This underwater platform

24
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,760
will be in disputed territory

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,260
in the South China Sea—

26
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,399
a region claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam,

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,469
the Philippines, Brunei, and Malaysia.

28
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,140
Besides the 5 trillion dollars a year in shipping

29
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,730
that goes through the region,

30
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,620
many scientists believe it could be

31
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,940
home to untold wealth in natural resources,

32
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,280
like oil and natural gas.

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
Someone should really explore that.

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,080
Oh, right.

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,610
So China is planning to build

36
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,580
an underwater observation network,

37
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,150
at a cost of roughly 290 million US Dollars.

38
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,750
It will be done as a partnership

39
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,280
with Tongji University in Shanghai.

40
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,910
According to my favorite Chinese

41
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,880
state-run media, The Global Times,

42
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,590
it will be used to “probe the undersea physical,

43
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,400
chemical, and geological dynamics”.

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,549
Well, that sounds peaceful enough.

45
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,759
Oh, and it “will also be used

46
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,020
for other purposes”.

47
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,790
Wait, what other purposes?

48
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,090
Is there something state-run media

49
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,509
maybe left out?

50
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,550
Voice of America,

51
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,729
help us out here.

52
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,259
“It could collect data for military intelligence,

53
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,549
undersea mineral gathering

54
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:51,760
or seabed oil drilling.”

55
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,670
So, “other purposes” are possibly

56
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,460
helping China’s military,

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,290
and giving China the info it needs to plan

58
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,920
underwater resource extraction

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,430
worth potentially billions of dollars.

60
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,790
Funny that The Global Times

61
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,800
left that part out.

62
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,030
This whole underwater operation

63
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,220
will take about 5 years to build.

64
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,030
So what will it look like?

65
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,840
Well this image from an official handout

66
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,499
published by South China Morning Post shows...

67
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,920
...I guess the undersea platform...

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,459
...a robot with a purple beret…

69
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:23,760
...these yellow things are...probes?

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,559
...a microwave—

71
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,980
I guess you need somewhere

72
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,129
to heat up your Hot Pockets...

73
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,099
...a giant torpedo-looking thing

74
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,379
that’s probably,

75
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,010
totally not a torpedo…

76
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,239
...and here of course

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,090
is the deep sea abyss

78
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,359
that will open up to reveal

79
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,030
the eldritch abomination,

80
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,019
the nameless nightmare

81
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:42,900
that will haunt our dreams

82
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,959
and consume our world...

83
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,519
Just kidding.

84
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm sure this is all safe and fine

85
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,019
and totally peaceful.

86
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,019
As state-run media

87
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,329
have said again and again,

88
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,849
Beijing values peace

89
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:55,649
in the South China Sea.

90
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:56,799
But Beijing also values

91
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,040
its territorial claims

92
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,909
in the South China Sea.

93
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,590
And just as important as the research

94
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,449
from this observation platform

95
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,370
is the fact that simply having a research
station

96
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,920
would strengthen China’s claims

97
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,569
to the region.

98
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,409
The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea

99
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:16,150
states that a nation controls underwater scientific
research

100
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,949
within its exclusive economic zone,

101
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,110
which is 200 nautical miles

102
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,970
off its coast.

103
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,760
Euan Graham of the Lowy Institute

104
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,900
for International Policy in Sydney

105
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,400
told Voice of America that,

106
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,959
“if a scientific operation is happening,

107
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,019
that lends it a significant air of legitimacy”

108
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,539
to territorial claims.

109
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,539
And of course,

110
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,939
the research itself could also be helpful

111
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,529
to China’s military,

112
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:40,529
because any data collected

113
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,339
could be used for both civilian

114
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:44,749
and military purposes.

115
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:46,659
And if you have doubts that the military

116
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,080
has anything to do with it—

117
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
you know,

118
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,120
because it’s being done in conjunction

119
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,900
with a university—

120
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,620
just remember the artificial islands

121
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,419
in disputed waters.

122
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,069
These artificial islands.

123
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,560
The ones that probably have

124
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,629
weapons on them.

125
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:01,849
Now you might be wondering—

126
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,869
since this is in the South China Sea—

127
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,159
what about China's other territorial waters?

128
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,629
Well don’t worry,

129
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,459
because China may also be building

130
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,680
something like this

131
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,799
in the East China Sea.

132
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,510
So maybe someday soon,

133
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,530
there’ll be no more pesky questions

134
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,010
about disputed territory with Japan, either.

135
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,209
So what do you think of China’s

136
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,979
underwater platform?

137
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,590
And how should we defeat the coming evil

138
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,979
from the deeps?

139
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,289
Leave your comments below.

140
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,259
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

141
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,900
Once again I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

142
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,100
See you next time.
