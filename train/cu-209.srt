1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,960
Joe Biden calls Xi Jinping.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
Canada’s top spy warns about China.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
Plus, China makes it to Mars.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,640

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,840
After weeks of waiting by the phone,\h\h

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,520
Chinese leader Xi Jinping finally got a\h
phone call from US President Joe Biden.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,720
He was so excited that he was on Cloud Nine!\h\h

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
At least that’s what I gather from the\h
banner image on state-run Xinhua News.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,160
So what happened on the phone\h
call? Well, we don’t know.\h\h

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,920
All we have is the manicured press releases\h
from each side. And...they don’t quite match up.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,760
According to the White House, “President Biden\h\h

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,800
affirmed his priorities of protecting the\h
American people’s security, prosperity,\h\h

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,760
health, and way of life, and preserving\h
a free and open Indo-Pacific.”

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,560
While according to Xinhua, Xi Jinping emphasized\h
on the call that China and the US should “uphold\h\h

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,960
the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation,\h
mutual respect, and win-win cooperation.”

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
Yes, non-confrontation always works out well...for\h\h

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
the Chinese Communist Party. Because it\h
means you’re not allowed to confront them.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,840
Meanwhile, according to the White\h
House, “President Biden underscored\h\h

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,040
his fundamental concerns about Beijing’s\h
coercive and unfair economic practices,\h\h

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
crackdown in Hong Kong, human\h
rights abuses in Xinjiang,\h\h

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
and increasingly assertive actions in\h
the region, including toward Taiwan.”

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,120
While Xi Jinping told Biden that “Taiwan,\h
Hong Kong, and Xinjiang-related issues\h\h

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,920
are China’s internal affairs, which are\h
related to China’s sovereignty and territorial\h\h

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,800
integrity. The United States should respect\h
China’s core interests and act cautiously.”

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,520
So it sounds like both Biden and\h
Xi spent the entire phone call\h\h

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,600
talking past each other.\h
This’ll come up at counseling.

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,360
But there is one thing that\h
both sides agreed happened.\h

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,400
“[President Biden] shared his greetings\h
and well wishes with the Chinese people\h\h

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
on the occasion of Lunar New Year.”

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,960
Happy Lunar New Year, everyone!\h\h

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,480
Remember to respect China’s core\h
interests and act cautiously.\h

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Talk is cheap. Unless you’re\h
calling China and you have AT&T.\h

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,640
But what really matters is what President Biden\h
will actually *do* when it comes to China.

38
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
And while normally Biden is\h
very sharp on all matters,\h\h

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
it seems he hasn’t quite figured\h
out his China policy yet.

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,280
According to Politico, “The worry,\h
some former officials say, is that\h\h

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
Biden is just getting organized\h
while Xi is seizing the moment:\h\h

42
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,160
ramming through a massive investment deal\h
with the European Union, for instance.”

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,560
“Beijing isn’t waiting around...China has waged\h
an influence campaign, seeking to endear itself\h\h

44
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,680
to U.S. businesses as well as the same American\h
allies that Biden and his top aides are engaging.”

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,800
And this is making a lot of\h
people worried. Biden has\h\h

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,920
been dogged by criticisms that he’s soft on China.

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,160
Last week, I told you that Senator Ted Cruz\h
blocked Biden’s pick for Commerce Secretary\h\h

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,880
over concerns she’s soft of Huawei.

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,040
Huawei is the Chinese telecom company\h\h

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,960
the US has accused of being a national\h
security threat since the Obama Administration.

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,240
And this week, there was this\h
story: Biden withdraws Trump rule\h\h

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,040
on schools disclosing ties to Chinese\h
state-run Confucius Institutes.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,760
Confucius Institutes are an arm of the Chinese\h
Communist Party’s propaganda department.\h\h

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,840
Back in August, the Trump Administration required\h
the group register as foreign agents in the US.\h\h

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,000
In January, Trump pushed a last minute\h
rule that “would require colleges and\h\h

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
K-12 schools that are certified to have foreign\h
exchange programs to disclose any contracts,\h\h

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,600
partnerships or financial transactions\h
from Confucius Institutes or Classrooms.”

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,560
So why did Biden withdraw that proposal? According\h
to a Biden Spokesperson, “On Inauguration Day,\h\h

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,000
White House chief of staff Ron Klain released\h
a memo freezing all regulatory process.”

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,920
Basically it was a blanket freeze on any last\h
minute proposals by the Trump Administration.\h\h

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,760
So it’s not as if Biden specifically undid\h
some kind of ban of the Confucius Institute.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,040
It would be nice if the Biden Administration\h
did take a stance on the Confucius Institute.\h\h

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,600
But that might put him in the awkward\h
situation of agreeing with Trump on an issue.\h

64
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,000
And coming up after the break, the Biden\h
Administration wants to sit at the table\h\h

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,840
with China, Cuba and Venezuela...when\h
it comes to human rights.

66
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,280
Welcome back.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,840
The Biden Administration wants to rejoin\h
the United Nations Human Rights Council.

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,240
Trump had pulled the US out of the council\h
in June 2018. Countries like China, Cuba,\h\h

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
and Venezuela are on it. Clearly those\h
countries got human rights under control.\h\h

70
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
Or at least they have their humans under control.

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,120
Current Secretary of State Antony Blinken\h
criticized the pull out, saying Trump’s withdrawal\h\h

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,120
“did nothing to encourage meaningful change, but\h
instead created a vacuum of U.S. leadership.”

73
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,520
He did say, “We recognize that the\h
Human Rights Council is a flawed body,\h\h

74
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
in need of reform to its\h
agenda, membership, and focus.”

75
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,400
But this shows a very different approach from the\h
Trump Administration. Biden has said he will work\h\h

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,080
with American allies and international bodies\h
to counter China. But he hasn’t made it clear\h\h

77
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,960
how that will actually work since China has a\h
lot of control over international organizations,\h\h

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,920
like the Human Rights Council,\h
and even foreign governments.

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,640
Senator Marco Rubio criticized\h
this approach in a statement,\h\h

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,760
saying President Biden “should not give any shred\h
of credibility [to the human rights council],”\h\h

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,760
because it’s “become a place for\h
despotic regimes to come together\h\h

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,720
and receive international cover to\h
continue to commit their horrific abuses.”

83
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,120
Then again, maybe this would give the\h
US a place to get international cover\h\h

84
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,600
so we can commit some horrific abuses of our own!

85
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:04,160
Speaking of international cooperation, Biden\h
has announced a new Pentagon China task force.

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
It will be focused on how the US and its\h
allies can deter China in the Pacific.\h

87
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,960
Biden said, “It will require\h
a whole of government efforts,\h\h

88
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,640
bipartisan cooperation in Congress and strong\h
alliances and partners. That is how we will meet\h\h

89
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,960
the China challenge and ensure the American\h
people win the competition of the future.”

90
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,840
The task force will be led by Ely Ratner, a\h
former deputy national security adviser to Biden.

91
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,040
Ratner is the guy who said last August that the\h
US must forget America First to counter China.

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,360
He said, “The China challenge\h
right now is about us,\h\h

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,040
it’s not about them, it’s\h
about our own competitiveness.”

94
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,120
So I’m sure, as Biden says, Ratner’s\h
task force will really help,\h\h

95
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,480
“ensure the American people win\h
the competition of the future.”

96
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,080
The World Health Organization is\h
once again reminding everyone why we\h\h

97
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,040
hate it. After months of international\h
pressure, and millions of deaths,\h\h

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,000
China finally allowed a WHO team into Wuhan\h
to investigate the origin of the coronavirus.

99
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
Was the WHO mad that it took so long?\h\h

100
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,560
No! “Instead of scorn, the W.H.O. experts on\h
Tuesday delivered praise for Chinese officials.”

101
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,080
In fact, the WHO experts backed up\h
Chinese Communist Party propaganda,\h\h

102
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,560
“saying it was possible the virus might have\h
spread to humans through shipments of frozen food,\h\h

103
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,160
an idea that has gained little traction\h
with scientists outside China. And the\h\h

104
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,080
experts pledged to investigate reports that\h
the virus might have been present outside China\h\h

105
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,720
months before the outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019,\h
a longstanding demand of Chinese officials.”

106
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,960
The head of the WHO investigation team also made\h
a point to say, “Don’t rely too much on US intel;\h\h

107
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,080
increasingly disengaged under Trump\h
& frankly wrong on many aspects.”

108
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,760
Got it. The CCP claims that the coronavirus\h
came from pig heads and frozen fish...

109
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,120
And...auto parts packaging.\h
That’s totally reasonable.

110
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,880
But US intelligence, that’s unreliable.\h

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Especially because the US State Department\h
called into question the transparency of\h\h

112
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,400
the investigation, saying “The jury is still out.”

113
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:41,280
The WHO gets most of its funding from the US.\h
So why is the WHO so deep in the CCP’s pocket?!

114
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,800
I’m just glad Biden has stopped\h
the US withdrawing from it.

115
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,840
And after the break, we’ll show you what the head\h\h

116
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,600
of Canada’s spy agency says\h
about the threat from China.

117
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,480
Welcome back.

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,280
In a rare public appearance,\h\h

119
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,120
the head of Canada’s spy agency said China\h
poses a serious strategic threat to Canada.

120
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,600
Well he didn’t actually say it in public. It\h
was an online forum. No one appears in public\h\h

121
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,640
anymore. Ever since the coronavirus spread from\h
frozen food in the US THANK YOU VERY MUCH, W.H.O.!

122
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,720
Canada’s spy chief said, “The government\h
of China ... is pursuing a strategy for\h\h

123
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
geopolitical advantage on all fronts—economic,\h\h

124
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,920
technological, political, and military—and\h
using all elements of state power to carry\h\h

125
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,360
out activities that are a direct threat\h
to our national security and sovereignty.”

126
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,840
How does China do it? Are they masters\h
of subversion and infiltration?

127
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
No, Canada just kind of lets them do it.

128
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
And then, I assume, apologizes for it.

129
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,440
You may remember back in August, China\h
detained Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist\h\h

130
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,920
working for Chinese state-run CCTV. After\h
months of detention she’s finally...been\h\h

131
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
officially arrested and charged with spying.

132
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,040
Injustice takes time in China.

133
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,240
50 members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance\h
on China—including representatives from the UK,\h\h

134
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,840
Canada, Australia, France, Germany\h
and Switzerland—are calling on HSBC\h\h

135
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,920
to unfreeze the account of a Hong Kong activist.

136
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,680
HSBC has chosen to be the bad guys in Hong Kong.\h\h

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,680
The bank has backed the national security\h
law that destroyed the freedoms of Hong Kong.

138
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,880
The global lawmakers also point out that besides\h
freezing the funds of the Hong Kong activist,\h\h

139
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,200
and his entire family—for some reason— “HSBC\h
also froze bank accounts of a Hong Kong charity\h\h

140
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,000
and Christian church that supported\h
the 2019 democracy movement in Hong\h\h

141
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Kong, as well as the bank accounts of\h
individual preachers from the same church.”

142
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
I know, it’s hard to imagine that a bank\h\h

143
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,840
could be on the side of evil, but, it just\h
goes to show you anything is possible.

144
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,400
Chinese people are starved\h
for uncensored information\h\h

145
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,080
and connection to people outside China. That was\h
probably a big part of the success in China of\h\h

146
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Clubhouse, a hip new social media platform\h
beloved by Kanye West and Elon Musk.

147
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Clubhouse uses audio chatrooms that\h
disappear when the conversations end.\h\h

148
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,000
And for a short time, it actually connected\h
Chinese netizens to the outside world.\h

149
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,080
“In recent days,\h\h

150
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,240
several Chinese-language chatrooms had\h
been filled to the 5,000-user capacity.”

151
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,920
Clubhouse is invitation only. And it became\h
so popular, that a “small black market for\h\h

152
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,240
invitation codes [emerged]...The going price\h
for one code was up to 300 yuan, or about $46.”

153
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,280
On Clubhouse Chinese netizens could hear stories\h
from Uyghurs talking about their experiences in\h\h

154
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,720
concentration camps in Xinjiang. They could\h
hear from Hong Kongers. People in Taiwan.\h

155
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,360
And that’s why after less than\h
a week of its rising popularity,\h\h

156
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Chinese censors have finally blocked it in China.

157
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,040
And as I mentioned earlier, it’s the Lunar New\h
Year! Many people celebrate by making dumplings.

158
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,080
The Chinese Communist Party celebrated by\h\h

159
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,280
arresting more than 1,000\h
Falun Gong practitioners.

160
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,080
The Chinese Communist Party harvests\h
the organs of Falun Gong practitioners\h\h

161
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:40,800
on a mass scale. So I’m sure this was just the\h
Party’s way of...making dumplings with them.

162
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,360
And to show how great everything is on\h
Lunar New Year, China Central Television\h\h

163
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,720
showcased their 39th annual propaganda\h
bacchanal! The CCTV new year gala.\h

164
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,840
Complete with what’s now become a\h
proud CCTV gala tradition: Blackface.

165
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,080
Back in 2018, CCTV aired a\h
“racist blackface” sketch.

166
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,160
And clearly they’ve learned their lesson.\h\h

167
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,480
Because this year they’ve included\h
a blackface *dance* instead.

168
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,320
Although I don’t want to be unfair. It\h
wasn’t just a blackface dance. There was\h\h

169
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,520
cultural appropriation from all around the world!

170
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,600
If you’re familiar with the CCTV gala, every\h
year they do a song about all of China’s\h\h

171
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,600
happy ethnic minorities. This was\h
basically that, but for the entire world.

172
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,400
But enough about the Lunar New\h
Year. Let’s talk about Mars.\h\h

173
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,840
China is now the 6th country in\h
history to have reached Mars.

174
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,280
If China is the first country to make\h
contact with the Martians I will be so mad.

175
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,120
And now, as I said at the start of the episode,\h\h

176
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,840
it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 cent army!

177
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,840
Leif Hendricksen says, “I think all\h
the athletes should go to the Olympics,\h\h

178
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,960
then stage a mass protest during the\h
opening ceremonies. Lets see how well\h\h

179
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,000
China's detention of the athletes\h
would go over on the world stage.”\h

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,760
Ah, Leif was responding to my recent\h
episode about a possible boycott\h\h

181
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,400
of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

182
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,680
So, China has shown it doesn’t have a problem\h
with arresting citizens of another country. So\h\h

183
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,800
definitely, any Olympic athlete who uses\h
it as a platform to protest genocide,\h\h

184
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
could find themselve in serious\h
trouble. But on the other hand,\h\h

185
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,920
it would be so bad for the Communist Party’s image\h
to go after another country’s Olympic athlete,\h\h

186
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,880
that this could actually be a very effective\h
way to protest, say, genocide in Xinjiang.\h

187
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,600
However, that’s probably not going to happen.\h
Because athletes are forbidden from political\h\h

188
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,400
protests during the Olympics. That’s according\h
to the International Olympic Committee.

189
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,040
The IOC president has said that the Olympics\h\h

190
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,680
are not about politics and that\h
athletes should be politically neutral.

191
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,520
And “Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter bans any\h
form of political protest during the Games.”

192
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,200
So don’t expect any kind of mass protest against\h
the Chinese Communist Party during the Olympics.\h\h

193
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,760
At least not from the athletes. But there\h
are opportunities for the rest of the world\h\h

194
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,040
to use the publicity from the Olympics to\h
call out the CCP’s crimes against humanity.\h

195
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,520
The lesson the CCP learned\h
from the 2008 Beijing Olympics\h\h

196
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,320
was that it didn’t matter what kind of horrible\h
human rights violations the Party committed,\h\h

197
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,280
the rest of the world wouldn’t care as\h
long as there’s a nice opening ceremony.\h\h

198
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Hopefully this Olympics, the world\h
will act a little differently.

199
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,720
Thanks for your question and your support Leif.

200
00:16:51,360 --> 00:17:03,840
And thank you for watching. Once again\h
I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
