1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,460
A once beautiful relationship

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,360
broken by the coronavirus!

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,840
Is there any future for US-China relations?

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,110
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,670
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,160
Tensions between the US and China

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,940
are at an all-time high

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,020
because of the coronavirus,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,050
which a lot of people are now calling the
“CCP Virus.”

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,560
Everyone’s doing it! Even a columnist for
the Washington Post.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,829
That’s because the Chinese Communist Party,
the CCP,

12
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,090
spent the first crucial months of the outbreak
covering it up.

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,360
That allowed the coronavirus to spread around
the world.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,750
And that’s why we’re in the situation
we’re in today...

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,270
where the world has to postpone the next Wonder
Woman movie.

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,820
And if that doesn’t affect you, maybe this
will—

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,890
the Final Fantasy 7 remake may be delayed.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,559
And thus, World War 3 began:

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,890
China vs the Weebs.

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,760
The US-China relationship was already strained,

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,420
ever since the US decided to stop rolling
over

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,180
for the Chinese regime’s intellectual property
theft,

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,830
espionage, unfair trade practices, currency
manipulation,

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,340
and well...it’s a long list.

25
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,810
But the coronavirus may have pushed

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,790
the relationship to the breaking point.

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,740
“As the world declares war on the coronavirus,

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,630
another battle has erupted between two of
its great powers—

29
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,340
China and the United States.”

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,700
President Trump has responded with fire and
fury.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,470
“But I'm a little upset with China. I’ll
be honest with you.”

32
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,070
Ok, that was less fury and more mild displeasure.

33
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,970
So far, Trump is not backing down on trade
tariffs.

34
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,549
But that could change.

35
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,370
The Trump Administration is seeking comments

36
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,400
from the American public

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,530
on whether to temporarily lift

38
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,180
some of the tariffs because of the coronavirus.

39
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,740
My public comment is: Don’t do it.

40
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,870
It’ll just make us more dependent on China
again.

41
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,860
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,720
is expelling American journalists from China.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,150
And it’s going on a propaganda offensive,

44
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,509
including trying to blame the whole coronavirus
thing

45
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,419
on the US military.

46
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,870
So President Trump decided to make it clear

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,230
the epidemic started in China

48
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,760
by calling it the “Chinese Virus.”

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,019
“The Chinese virus.”

50
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,489
Chinese state-run media called him racist.

51
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,859
And then Western media started calling him
racist.

52
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:27,529
Well, they called him racist again, but because
of this.

53
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:30,140
"Why do you keep calling this 'the Chinese
virus'?

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Why do you keep using this?"

55
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
"Because it comes from China."

56
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,140
"A lot of people say it's racist."

57
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,840
"It's not racist at all, no.

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,139
Not at all.

59
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:37,219
It comes from China.

60
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,230
That's why.

61
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,420
It comes from China.

62
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,930
I want to be accurate."

63
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,670
But now Trump has said he’ll stop using
the term “Chinese Virus.”

64
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,709
Prompting a victory lap from Chinese state-run
media.

65
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,249
Maybe that means Trump will adopt the term

66
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,349
that all the cool kids are using:

67
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:52,349
CCP Virus.

68
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:53,689
He might as well,

69
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:55,269
since things aren’t getting any smoother

70
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,129
between the two countries.

71
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:59,720
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says China

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,819
is still withholding information about the
coronavirus.

73
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,469
“My concern is that this cover-up,

74
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,200
this disinformation that the Chinese Communist
Party is engaged in,

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,409
is still denying the world the information

76
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,469
it needs so that we can prevent further cases

77
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,329
or something like this from recurring again.”

78
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,420
And Texas Congressman and Republican member

79
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,419
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee\hMichael
McCaul

80
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,739
took to Fox News to say this.

81
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,799
“In my view this was one of the worst coverups
in history.”

82
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
It’s even worse than how NASA covered up
the flat earth!

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,579
By building a round earth.

84
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,010
But the anger with the Chinese regime

85
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,760
is not just from Republicans.

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,329
This is a bipartisan effort.

87
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,749
I love how China brings us together.

88
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:47,510
But perhaps what terrifies the Chinese Communist
Party the most

89
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,729
is a growing sentiment for moving US companies
out of China.

90
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:54,230
The Chinese regime loves to act tough,

91
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,079
but it knows it needs US money to fuel its
own economy,

92
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,169
especially after the coronavirus hit.

93
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,780
Even Western universities,

94
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,599
which for years have depended on Chinese students

95
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,989
as a source of income,

96
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:08,569
are getting a little wary.

97
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,409
But the Chinese Communist Party has one ace
up its hole.

98
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,200
Wait, how does that saying go?

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,639
Anyway, they’ve found an American performer
who is able

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,510
to articulate the superiority of China’s
coronavirus fight.

101
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,060
As Chinese state-run media puts it,

102
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,620
“American rapper Cardi B shows support

103
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,550
for China's coronavirus fight.”

104
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,680
“When they put Wuhan China in quarantine

105
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,889
the coronavirus cases is going lower,

106
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,590
that's because they spray s--- over the street...

107
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,960
While we quarantine in our home,

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
what is the government doing,

109
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
like spraying s— in the streets,

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
y'all gonna start taking our temperatures,

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
you're all going to like one by one

112
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
take our temperatures and what not,

113
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
see if we got it or not.

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,580
Cause like, how am I supposed to know if i
got the coronavirus.”

115
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,740
Wait, I’m sorry. Is that showing support
for China?

116
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,449
I mean, I guess the US government could be
spraying

117
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,610
more s--- in the streets.

118
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,800
Frankly, I liked it better when Chinese state
media

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,900
were blaming the coronavirus on the US military.

120
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,150
So what do you think of

121
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,569
what’s become of the US-China relationship?

122
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,169
Leave your comments below.

123
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:16,169
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

124
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,080
thanks for watching China Uncensored.
