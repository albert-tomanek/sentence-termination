1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:03,330
A scandal on a Chinese airplane

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,330
A promise to Taiwan

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,280
And new video game regulations

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,100
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,440
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:17,670
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,710
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,330
This, for some reason one of the most trending
stories

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,540
about China this week.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,990
Truly worth of international headlines.

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,550
A pilot of Air Guilin let this woman sit in
the pilot’s seat

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,570
during a flight so she could take the selfie.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,620
The selfie went viral on Weibo,

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,859
basically China’s version of twitter.

15
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:43,559
Which is apparently as much of a dumpster
fire as our Twitter,

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,739
because people freaked out.

17
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,269
The airline fired the pilot for potentially
putting

18
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:49,710
all the passengers in danger.

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,069
Of course, he can still go get a job

20
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:53,389
with another Chinese airline.

21
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:56,270
And I really don’t know what the big deal
was.

22
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00,270
I mean, co-pilot was there in case anything
went wrong.

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,270
And now to Canada,

24
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,440
where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s party

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,280
recently won reelection.

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,300
And you know what that means.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,140
A gentle reminder from Chinese authorities

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,040
to release the CFO of Chinese telecom giant
Huawei.

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,620
“We urge the re-elected Canadian government

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:25,630
to seriously treat China's solemn stand and
concerns

31
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,110
and immediately release Meng Wanzhou,

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,100
and bring the China-Canada relationship back
on track

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,090
by taking real actions.”

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,100
Meng Wanzhou is the Huawei CFO and daughter
of Huawei founder.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,220
Aww, it’s a family business.

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,860
She was arrested at the end of last year on
charges

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,340
of violating US sanctions on Iran.

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,821
And the Chinese Communist Party

39
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,110
still hasn’t quite gotten a grasp

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,540
of how this whole rule of law thing works.

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,410
Canada can’t just release Meng as a favor
to China.

42
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,840
That would be a scandal.

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,460
And Justin Trudeau doesn’t need another
scandal.

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,750
The Chinese Communist Party is saying it will
fully respect

45
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,600
Taiwan’s way of life after it inevitably
takes over.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Now for some reason,

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,620
people are scoffing at that.

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,750
I don’t get it.

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,980
The Chinese Communist Party *promised*

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,970
it would respect Taiwan’s way of life.

51
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,540
Just like it promised in Tibet.

52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,530
Or Hong Kong.

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,630
Speaking of places where everyone’s rights
are upheld: Xinjiang.

54
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,030
Uighur women there are getting sterilized

55
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,319
and sexually abused in the Chinese regime’s
internment camps.

56
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,750
And if you’re not in an internment camp,

57
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,090
the Chinese regime will just assign a strange
man

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,540
to come and sleep next to you in your home.

59
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,040
I really don’t get why Taiwan would be nervous

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,520
about being part of the People’s Republic
of China.

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,550
So the abuse of the Uighur Muslims may *sound*
pretty horrifying.

62
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,120
But the Communist Party is working on improving
the situation.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,150
By paying Facebook and Twitter to spread anti-Muslim
propaganda

64
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,750
to justify its actions in Xinjiang.

65
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,569
That’s according to reporting from the Intercept,

66
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,540
and this one from Buzzfeed news.

67
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,200
Now this story broke back in August,

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,160
but it’s still important to talk about.

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,540
So what happened was essentially this.

70
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,840
Chinese state-run media,

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,130
including my personal favorite the Global
Times,

72
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,200
would pay Twitter or Facebook to promote their
posts.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,060
Posts specifically about how those internment
camps for Uighurs

74
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,410
are actually wonderful vocational education
and training centers.

75
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,910
Here’s a video from Global Times Editor
in Chief.

76
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,160
“They smeared the vocational education

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,540
and training centers established to help people

78
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,640
avoid extremism by calling them mass detention
camps.”

79
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,130
Wow, I had no idea!

80
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,480
I’m glad social media giants

81
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,120
and accept money in exchange for getting this
message

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,470
to hundreds of millions of people.

83
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,620
Now Twitter has said it will no longer allow
that.

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,550
Facebook...still allows it.

85
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,410
Some good news for the Chinese Communist Party:

86
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,700
The NGO Freedom House has for the fourth year
in a row

87
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,450
awarded China the...dishonor...

88
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,980
of being the world’s worst abuser of internet
freedom.

89
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,320
I believe the award looks like an Oscar,

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,570
except it’s Al Gore in handcuffs.

91
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,310
Because Al Gore says he invented the Internet.

92
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,260
And so…he’s in handcuffs…anyway

93
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,260
Congratulations!

94
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,010
The Chinese Communist Party would like to
thank the academy,

95
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,010
and also God...

96
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,000
wait, sorry, I mean Chairman Mao.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,900
And finally, China has put a curfew on video
games.

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,810
Users younger than 18 won’t be allowed to
play games

99
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,530
between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.

100
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,430
And only for a maximum of 90 minutes on weekdays,

101
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,080
and three hours on weekends and holidays.

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,840
This is also part of Xi Jinping’s push

103
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,030
to combat poor eyesight in China.

104
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,620
And thus all the problems in China have been
solved.

105
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,770
And that’s it for this weeks’ China news
headlines.

106
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,890
But before I go,

107
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,400
it’s time for me to answer a question from
one of you—

108
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,340
a fan who support China Uncensored

109
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,630
with a dollar or more per episode,

110
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,630
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

111
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,860
Franky asks,

112
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,560
“How can I support the Hong Kong protesters
(the peaceful ones)?

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,360
I can't really share on social media because
of my work,

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,110
and I support your channel and once supported
the HK Free Press....

115
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,320
which is the only way I could come up with,

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,340
even though it is indirect.

117
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,560
(Foreigner living in rural Japan.)

118
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Glad you want to help.

119
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,110
And I can tell you that means a lot to the
people of Hong Kong.

120
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,180
So, if you don’t want to talk about Hong
Kong on social media,

121
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,550
you can always talk to people face to face.

122
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,720
Especially in Japan,

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,440
I know people are concerned about

124
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,580
the Chinese Communist Party’s influence.

125
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Japan is definitely a target of the regime,

126
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,449
so I’d imagine people would be pretty open
to hearing about

127
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,410
what’s happening in Hong Kong.

128
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,449
You can also find resources online,

129
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,780
like this recently updated Reddit thread

130
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,060
with many ways to help Hong Kong protesters.

131
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,720
We’ll put a link to it in the description
below.

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
But it’s a good question.

133
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,030
So I’d like to open it up to everyone:

134
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,650
brainstorm some ideas and leave your comments
below

135
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,260
about ways we all can help the situation in
Hong Kong.

136
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,880
Maybe we all can do a little bit of good.

137
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,740
Thanks for your question, Franky.

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,419
And thanks to everyone for watching.

139
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,590
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

140
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,400
see you next time.
