00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,180
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,000
the inside story of a Chinese official

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,140
who risked his life to defect.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,760
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,280
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,430
Life is tough for Chinese communist officials.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,080
Long hours of hard work,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,500
monitoring dissidents and critical voices.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,699
But Chinese officials are only human,

10
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,440
and sometimes they simply get fed up with
it.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,750
I sat down with Chen Yonglin.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,600
He was the consul for political affairs

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,870
at the Chinese consulate here in Sydney.

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,780
But one day in 2005,

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,850
he decided he’d had enough of being forced

16
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,250
to spy on overseas Chinese.

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,420
So he walked out of the consulate forever—

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,070
and put his life on the line to tell the world
about

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,260
how the Chinese Communist Party really operates.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,920
Thank you for joining us, so tell us,

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,890
why did you defect from China

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,950
and seek political asylum in Australia?

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,149
This is complicated.

24
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,360
I'd been thinking a long time

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,140
for leaving the Chinese government.

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,730
My father was persecuted there

27
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,250
during the Cultural Revolution

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,140
by the Chinese regime,

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,250
and also when I joined the Tiananmen

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,670
Democracy Movement in 1989

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,110
and witnessed the Massacre event,

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:34,799
and also in the past several years I can see
that,

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,200
I feel there is no future for China,

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,579
and I don't want to live in that environment.

35
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:55,720
And also I don't want my child being brainwashed
as I was.

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,430
Before you defected, you were doing things
that,

37
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,939
you felt were morally questionable.

38
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,220
I used to be certain kind of proud

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,740
to being a Chinese diplomat,

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,269
it seems I'm joining the policy decision to
contribute

41
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,840
to the national interest.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,659
But when I arrived in Sydney,

43
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,669
I found this is not the case, and I found
Chinese diplomat

44
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:26,419
is a shameful career, shame sameful job,

45
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:28,280
and because what the diplomats are doing

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,819
is not trying to contribute to the country,

47
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:40,489
it's actually, try to join certain kind of
persecution

48
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:46,819
against dissidents, dissident groups.

49
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,280
Did you face any danger or retaliation

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,150
from the Communist Party?

51
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,059
Yes, actually, they are a lot of risk.

52
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:59,439
At the beginning they found us and tried to

53
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,900
take us back to the consulate.

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,069
Probably they tried to kidnap me back to China,

55
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:15,079
and said that this guy voluntarily returned
to China.

56
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:18,860
They tried to take something like this.

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,549
I believe I remember hearing you say

58
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,189
that you had a source who told you there was

59
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,829
some kind of assassination squad, sent after
you?

60
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:31,689
Yeah, so from my colleagues in Ministry of
Foreign Affairs,

61
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:41,900
and of course sometimes I can get sources
from other department,

62
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,099
which some friend I make when the delegation
visit from China.

63
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,529
What did they tell you?

64
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:53,159
They implied that there's a team of MSS,

65
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:02,219
and they are going to doing some mission so
that,

66
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,499
well targeting, my family.

67
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,859
So they went after your family?

68
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,510
They targeting my family,

69
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,959
actually of course the main target is me.

70
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:12,959
Wow.

71
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,900
Are you in danger right now?

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,639
If I do too much, it's hard to say.

73
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:27,610
If they thought that I'm playing a leading
role in some area,

74
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,870
they may try to hurt my family or harm myself
in a certain way.

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,870
And if you're too quiet?

76
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,930
If I'm too quiet, same thing.

77
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,229
Too quiet, they can also take action.

78
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,409
So you need to be just loud enough.

79
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,270
Yeah, that's right.

80
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,600
Just loud enough, and do as much as I can.

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,159
So how did your family and friends react to
you defecting?

82
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:07,759
When I left the consulate, I have prepared
that these friends

83
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:16,509
or relatives will all cut the relation, the
connection with me.

84
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:26,780
But for my family, my wife and my child,

85
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,960
we just want pursue a life here,

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,009
in the freedom world.

87
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,849
How does the Chinese consulate silence critical
voices

88
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,289
within the Chinese-Australian community?

89
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:51,629
There's many ways to silence the dissident's
voice,

90
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:57,669
there's many ways, and one is actually they
trying to infiltrate

91
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:00,370
the Chinese community organizations,

92
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,370
and it's generally via money,

93
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,820
use money to influence these communities.

94
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,939
And also try to isolate the dissident's voice...

95
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:33,120
And Falun Gong at that time, from 2001-2005,

96
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,120
when I was in the consulate, was actually
the main target,

97
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,620
and to make the Chinese community

98
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:52,889
generally resent the Falun Gong practitioner,

99
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,430
and it's very effective, obviously,

100
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:02,639
because the propaganda to defame the Falun
Gong totally.

101
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,610
And I understand after you defected,

102
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,349
you quit the Chinese Communist Party.

103
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,129
Can you tell us a bit about that?

104
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:19,759
At that time, not many Chinese 
have the courage

105
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:28,469
to declare publicly that they quit from the
CCP

106
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,279
because in the communist system,

107
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,779
you can only join, usually, or expel,

108
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,000
there's no resign or quit.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,370
It's like a bad party, and you can't leave.

110
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,770
You can't leave, you're controlled,

111
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:52,419
you joined the Party, it's like cult, evil
cult, biggest,

112
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,289
you can see the largest evil cult group.

113
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:04,289
That's funny, they usually call the Falun
Gong the evil cult.

114
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,150
Usually if you read the Chinese Communist
Party propaganda,

115
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:15,610
you should read the opposite meaning that
is correct,

116
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,379
so if CCP say that this is the evil party,

117
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,120
the evil group, Falun Gong is evil,

118
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,889
that means Falun Gong is really good.

119
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,819
How do Chinese-Australians feel about

120
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,449
the Chinese Communist Party's presence in
Australia?

121
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,199
They feel very scared, obviously...

122
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:41,599
Yeah, the feeling is awful, because many Chinese
immigrants,

123
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,720
they have very, the family, usually,

124
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,850
they suffered from persecution from the CCP.

125
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,170
They came to Australia, they feel relaxed
and feel safe,

126
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:13,139
but in the past decade, the Chinese-Australian
feel

127
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:17,800
that their lifestyle been threatened.

128
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,920
So how do you feel about the growing influence

129
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
of the Chinese Communist Party in Australia?

130
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,769
I feel very bad, extremely bad,

131
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,930
because my child will live here,

132
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,550
and this is our new home.

133
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,680
Because of Chinese influences,

134
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,230
Communist influences is here,

135
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:53,649
and we feel that, we're still in China.

136
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:05,180
This place is turning red, and it's also against
my will,

137
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,720
that I don't want my child be brainwashed
as I was.

138
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,310
And now we can see that a lot of Chinese propaganda
here,

139
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:22,339
and if you can see that the only Sam Dastyari
case,

140
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,649
even the MP's speak for China's interest...

141
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:27,649
And I feel that there could be one day that

142
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:28,649
the whole community will be controlled by
the CCP…

143
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:29,649
Is there anything that can be done to stop

144
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,010
the Communist Party's growing influence around
the world?

145
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,800
That rely on the Western democracy;

146
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,860
they should know that China has never given
up

147
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,250
the Cold War of thinking,

148
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,170
the ideological, the propaganda, they just-

149
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,720
They have the Cold War mentality.

150
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,120
Yeah, totally.

151
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,640
And they just stay low,

152
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,470
and as Deng Xiaoping said,

153
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,829
hiding our capacity, biding our time.

154
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,740
So when time is proper,

155
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,420
they will launch the fierce attack

156
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,920
at the Western ideology again.

157
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,959
What do you think is the most important thing

158
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,079
about the Chinese Communist Party

159
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,240
that the West doesn't understand?

160
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:39,560
The Chinese Communist Party is 
very cunning, deceptive.

161
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,320
All the propaganda are lies,

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:53,340
but in the disguise of a beautiful looking,

163
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,850
and it's like the Red Ballet,

164
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,290
the Red Detachment of Women.

165
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:06,430
It's fascist aesthetics, looks beautiful,

166
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,680
but it's all about hatred and brutality,

167
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:22,509
and that will actually 
influence the public

168
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:27,089
about the basic human rights values.

169
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:29,430
