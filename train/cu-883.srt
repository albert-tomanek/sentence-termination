1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,230
What did Pewdiepie do to get banned in China?

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,220
A stabbing in Hong Kong

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,590
And China sets its sights on Taiwan

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,580
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,760
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,150
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,990
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,130
In Hong Kong, protesters once again

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,240
took to the streets last weekend.

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,130
Organizers say 350,000 marched,

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,499
but because police did not give permission,

12
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:33,170
it was technically an illegal rally.

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,000
“...That means anyone who comes out

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120
will inherently be breaking the law.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,070
So that's the tactic the Hong Kong government
is using.

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:48,350
So don't think that the movement is slowing
down.

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,460
In fact, it is growing stronger and stronger.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,640
And if you pan your camera around,

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,220
every single one of the protesters today

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,630
standing around here today,

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,130
are literally breaking the law.”

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,580
The march happened just days after

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,800
a brutal attack on Jimmy Sham,

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,550
head of the Civil Human Rights Front.

25
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,610
They’re an umbrella group that’s organized

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,640
some of the biggest rallies over the past
few months.

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
They also originally organized this Sunday’s
march,

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
but backed out after police said no.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,100
But that didn’t stop protesters from marching
anyway.

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,860
And that didn’t stop police from responding
with tear gas

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,190
And water cannons shooting blue dye laced
with pepper spray.

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,530
However, protesters did light a fire.

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,270
And some did throw petrol bombs.

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,970
But as for the barricades protesters erected,

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,350
police now just drive through them.

36
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,210
And they also decided to spray this mosque
with water cannons,

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,880
even though there weren’t any protesters
there.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,500
Creating a mess that protesters then helped
clean up.

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,970
Hong Kong police later said that spraying
the mosque

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,600
with a water cannon was an accident.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,830
The kind of accident where they stopped the
water cannon.

42
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,330
Carefully took aim.

43
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,909
And then sprayed it several times.

44
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,220
Hong Kong police:

45
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,030
successfully alienating every part of Hong
Kong society.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,149
But it’s not just police Hong Kong protesters
need to worry about.

47
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,530
On Saturday, a man stabbed a teenage protester

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,519
in the neck and stomach.

49
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,569
The protester had been handing out flyers.

50
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,870
Ok, no one likes flyers, but that’s taking
it too far.

51
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,280
It was so bad that the protester’s intestines
were exposed.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
He was taken to a hospital,

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,730
where he is in serious condition.

54
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,840
So who was this guy?

55
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,760
Apparently a cook from mainland China.

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,230
After stabbing the protester,

57
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,569
he threatened others,

58
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,680
yelling that Hong Kong was part of China.

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,560
That’s really not how a chef

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,540
should be putting his knife skills to use.

61
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,739
Speaking of someone who’s job performance
hasn’t been great,

62
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,859
the Financial Times is reporting that Beijing

63
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:55,069
might replace Carrie Lam as Hong Kong’s
Chief Executive.

64
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,439
That might have been enough to stop the protests...

65
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,180
four months ago.

66
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,379
At this point, it’s kind of like when a
teacher you hate

67
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,430
is replaced by a substitute teacher who’s
even worse.

68
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,569
What I’m saying is, Carrie Lam’s replacement

69
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,610
is going to be Miss Viola Swamp.

70
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,680
But one thing that the Hong Kong government

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
did finally do this week:

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,409
the Legislative Council formally withdrew
the extradition bill

73
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,830
that sparked the protests.

74
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,390
Which might have been enough to stop the protests...

75
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,900
four months ago.

76
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,629
I’m seeing a theme here.

77
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,639
But for Hong Kong protesters,

78
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,790
the NBA is a gift that keeps on giving.

79
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,989
At a Nets vs Raptors preseason game over the
weekend,

80
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,219
hundreds showed up wearing Stand with Hong
Kong t-shirts.

81
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,749
A group of Tibetan activists also showed up.

82
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,310
As did a group of pro-honey protesters

83
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,879
dressed as Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

84
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,469
And during the season opener between the Lakers
and the Clippers,

85
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,999
protesters passed out thousands of Stand With
Hong Kong t-shirts.

86
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,779
Which led to this magical moment.

87
00:03:54,779 --> 00:04:03,209
It 
brought a tear to my eye.

88
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,120
The NBA of course has been criticized for
selling out to China

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,049
after controversy over a pro-Hong Kong tweet

90
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,760
sent out by Daryl Morey,

91
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,389
the general manager of the Houston Rockets.

92
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,599
According to NBA commissioner Adam Silver,

93
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,979
the Chinese Communist Party asked him to fire
Morey,

94
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:19,979
but he refused.

95
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,030
Of course, Chinese state-run television says
that’s a dirty lie,

96
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,340
the Party would never do that

97
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,940
and he should really watch his back

98
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,330
because retribution is coming!

99
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,639
Not only is the Chinese Communist Party

100
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,419
spreading censorship in America,

101
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,330
it’s also threatening Americans who don’t
bow before it.

102
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,210
And that’s why I’ve spent the past 7 years
of my life

103
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,210
making a show warning people

104
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,990
about the Chinese Communist Party.

105
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,080
On Monday, China’s defense minister said

106
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,479
conquering Taiwan is a national priority.

107
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,430
Of course he didn’t say conquer.

108
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,810
That sounds bad.

109
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,599
The Chinese Communist party calls it reunification.

110
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:56,210
You know, when the Communist Party

111
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,900
seizes control with military force,

112
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,610
kills a bunch of people,

113
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,530
and replaces the rule of law with authoritarianism.

114
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,189
Re-unification.

115
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,919
With an island that was never part of

116
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,870
the People’s Republic of China to begin
with.

117
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,819
Of course, taking over Taiwan will be expensive.

118
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,620
Fortunately, the Chinese regime

119
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,659
has a brilliant money making scheme.

120
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:18,720
Sue the US!

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,229
China is seeking billions in penalties against
the US

122
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,069
at the World Trade Organization.

123
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,759
Ironically, the suit relates to

124
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,800
“a case dating to before the Trump administration,

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,939
and unrelated to the tariffs it has slapped
on Chinese goods.”

126
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:35,530
“China is seeking US$2.4 billion

127
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,220
in retaliatory sanctions against the United
States

128
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,139
after it failed to comply with a WTO ruling

129
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,210
in a tariffs case dating to Barack Obama’s
presidency.”

130
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,770
There’s a problem with this money making
scheme though.

131
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,770
If the WTO could actually enforce its rules,

132
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,039
and stop countries from cheating,

133
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,629
China would have a lot more to answer for
than the US.

134
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,710
The Yang gang is in trouble!

135
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,219
No, not Andrew Yang.

136
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:02,610
Navy Lt. Fan Yang

137
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,620
and his wife, Yang Yang.

138
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,389
“Yang had top secret clearance with the
P8 squadron,

139
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,500
an anti-submarine unit.

140
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,030
The Federal Government accuses him

141
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,689
of working with two Chinese nationals

142
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,180
to get them military equipment

143
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,600
which would ultimately be funneled

144
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,789
to the Communist government.”

145
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:21,789
Great.

146
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,129
So if China ever invades Taiwan,

147
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,729
the US will have had a helping hand in it.

148
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,139
Now while selling weapons to a Communist regime

149
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,000
at odds with the United States

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,729
may sound distinctly unAmerican,

151
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:33,880
Yang makes up for it

152
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,670
by doing the most American thing possible.

153
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,270
Spreading America’s love of guns.

154
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,770
“He's also accused of taking a Chinese national

155
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,330
to a local gun range

156
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,210
and selling at least one gun illegally.”

157
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,129
Guns are banned in China for civilians,

158
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,099
so many Chinese nationals come to the US

159
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,000
to experience guns for the first time.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,960
That probably still doesn’t make up for
selling US weapons

161
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,610
to the Communist government of China.

162
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,430
But he isn’t the only one!

163
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,220
According to this press release from the Department
of Justice,

164
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,110
“Li Tao, 39, sought to export “highly
sensitive” military

165
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,620
and space technology from the United States
to China.”

166
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,669
I believe we have footage of that interrogation.

167
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,669
Have you ever stolen from an employer?

168
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:18,669
Yes.

169
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:19,669
And where were you employed?

170
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:20,669
NASA.

171
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,719
What’d you steal, a rocket ship?

172
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,150
No, just some pens.

173
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,150
And some plans.

174
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,990
Plans?

175
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,990
Space plans.

176
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,440
And that, kids, is Mr. Show.

177
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,419
I’ve now educated you on the truly important
things in life.

178
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,849
Some good news for once.

179
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,139
Uighur activist Ilham Tohti

180
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,930
has been awarded the Sakharov Prize for Human
Rights.

181
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,389
In not as good news,

182
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,580
Tohti was imprisoned for life back in 2014

183
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,460
for doing radical things like encouraging
dialogue

184
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,590
and reconciliation between Uighurs and Han
Chinese.

185
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,759
The European Union gave the prestigious award
to Tohti.

186
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,520
In response, the Chinese regime

187
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,180
announced that Europe was cancelled.

188
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,580
And finally, YouTube star Pewdiepie has been
banned in China!

189
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Now at first you might think,

190
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,610
oh that’s because YouTube is banned in China,

191
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,029
so even the world’s biggest YouTuber would
be banned.

192
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,110
But that’s not the reason.

193
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,600
Apparently the Hong Kong protests

194
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,050
have even entered the world of YouTube let’s
plays.

195
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,340
Behold, analysis of the Hong Kong situation
from Pewdiepie.

196
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,930
The next meme needs a little bit of context.

197
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,949
It involves Hong Kong and China.

198
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,190
For those of you who don't know,

199
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,210
Hong Kong is a semi autonomous state,

200
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,210
it has its own laws,

201
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,040
or law system or jurisdiction, I don't know.

202
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,340
Then outta nowhere, someone from NBA tweets
I support Hong Kong,

203
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
and then NBA is like,

204
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,170
"Oh God, we need Chinese money."

205
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,040
“China is like that one person on Twitter

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,420
that can’t take any criticism and just blocks
everyone”

207
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Deep.

208
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,220
What’s that Shelley?

209
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,620
With 100 million subscribers,

210
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,450
Pewdiepie managed to let more people

211
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,530
know about China and Hong Kong

212
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,820
than I have in 7 years on this show?!

213
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,580
I knew I should have started a let’s play
channel instead!

214
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,940
Now I’m questioning all my life choices.

215
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,970
But before I go down that rabbit hole,

216
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,190
it’s time for me to answer a question from
one of you—

217
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,720
a fan who support China Uncensored

218
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,730
with a dollar or more per episode,

219
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,820
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

220
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,270
Michael Sun asks,

221
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,400
“Are there those in mainland China

222
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,930
who are sympathetic to the protestors' cause?”

223
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,150
That’s a really interesting question.

224
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,380
Unfortunately it’s very difficult to know

225
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,360
what people inside Mainland China

226
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,560
think about the Hong Kong protests.

227
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,990
Since everything is so censored inside China,

228
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,930
it’s difficult to tell how much people actually
know.

229
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,760
Plus, the Chinese state-run media

230
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,230
have been pushing constant propaganda

231
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,460
accusing Hong Kong protesters

232
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,080
of being violent rioting separatists

233
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,400
bent on splitting apart the motherland.

234
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,010
When we were in Hong Kong in June,

235
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,980
we did interview some Mainland tourists.

236
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,150
Check it out, it’s called

237
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,820
What Chinese People Really Think about Hong
Kong Protests.

238
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,460
Most were pretty reluctant to say anything.

239
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,940
If someone in Mainland China has managed to

240
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,180
hear about the protests and develop some sympathy,

241
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,750
it would be very dangerous for them to express
it.

242
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,030
Often, we hear stories like this,

243
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,330
where Mainland Chinese viciously defend the
Party line even abroad.

244
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,490
That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if China
had plenty of people

245
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,010
who hold cynical views of the Communist Party,

246
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,860
even if they keep those views to themselves.

247
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,430
Thanks for your question, Michael.

248
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,530
And if you have a question for me

249
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,950
you want to hear answered on the show,

250
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,780
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

251
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,820
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

252
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,700
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

253
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,540
we would have to shut down the show

254
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,490
if it weren’t for your support.

255
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,430
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

256
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,000
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,740
See you next time.
