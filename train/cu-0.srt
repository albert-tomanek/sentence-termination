1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,739
China threatens to send the military into
Hong Kong

2
00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:05,690
as triads attack protesters.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,769
And China is also on the warpath...pretty
much everywhere.

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,260
Stay ahead of the curve on this week’s China
Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,700
This is China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,660
This week’s China news headlines!

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,839
Retired Chinese Communist Party official Li
Peng died on Monday night.

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,720
Li Peng was known for...

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,650
killing a lot of people.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,240
You might know him as the “Butcher of Beijing”,

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,129
one of the masterminds behind the Tiananmen
Square Massacre.

12
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,850
Or as state-run Xinhua News describes him,

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,190
“an excellent Party member.”

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,350
The Tiananmen Square Massacre is on everyone’s
mind for another reason:

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,350
Hong Kong.

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,360
Chinese authorities are maybe possibly considering

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,020
sending in the People’s Liberation Army.

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,219
If the Hong Kong government asks nicely.

19
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,660
The chief spokesman for the Ministry of National
Defense,

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,190
Senior Colonel Wu Qian, said,

21
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,379
“The behavior of some radical protesters
challenges the central government’s authority...

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,040
That absolutely cannot be tolerated.”

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,020
So you know, protesters splash black paint
on the national emblem,

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,880
we get to crush you with tanks.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
Fair’s fair.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,939
Colonel Wu went on to reference a law,

27
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,640
“that allows the People’s Liberation Army
to intervene,

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,270
when requested by Hong Kong’s leaders,

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,900
to maintain order or assist in cases of natural
disasters.”

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,680
In completely unrelated news, the People’s
Liberation Army

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,189
is running anti-riot drills in Guangdong province,

32
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,320
according to their Weibo account.

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,790
But would Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie
Lam actually call in the PLA?

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,600
Well, she may not have much choice if she’s
ah,

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,990
“requested to” by Beijing.

36
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,171
But at the end of the day, the Chinese Communist
Party

37
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:50,329
knows who’s really to blame for the protests.

38
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:55,719
It’s the fundamental incompatibility between
China’s authoritarian Party-state

39
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,930
and Hong Kong’s cherished freedoms.

40
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,110
Just kidding!

41
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,979
It’s the black hands—

42
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,610
the hostile foreign forces leading things
on the ground.

43
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,079
Which is why the Chinese regime is calling
on the US

44
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,330
to remove its black hands from Hong Kong.

45
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,220
Of course, that’s ridiculous.

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,200
We left Hong Kong weeks ago.

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
But even without the Chinese military in Hong
Kong,

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,640
things are already getting violent.

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,300
“After weeks of clashes between demonstrators
and police,

50
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,390
the spotlight has shifted to the territory's
shadowy criminal network.

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,520
Some opposition lawmakers say the men in white
were triad gangsters.”

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,330
Yes, the infamous Hong Kong triads.

53
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,910
And they’re on the side of the Chinese Communist
Party.

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,040
I mean, they do have a lot in common.

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,060
At least 45 people were injured on Sunday

56
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,640
after men in white t-shirts attacked protesters.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,750
As well as bystanders, like this guy,

58
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,530
who was just trying to get home.

59
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,330
Fortunately, despite the conflicts between
police and protesters over the past month,

60
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,740
police were quick to stop the violence.

61
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,930
“One lawmaker said it took police more than
an hour to show up after he called them.”

62
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,390
Okay, nevermind.

63
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,380
Now some of the footage was pretty graphic.

64
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,611
Of course we can’t show you that,

65
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:15,040
because the last time we showed footage of
a violent police response

66
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,110
to a protest in the Chinese city of Wuhan,

67
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,830
YouTube age-restricted the video so hardly
anyone saw it.

68
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,040
It’s important to protect people from facts.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,470
So far police have arrested several men with
triad links related to the attack.

70
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,550
But the police have also banned a planned
protest against mob violence.

71
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,780
Well, I’m sure that no one would dare protest
now.

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,200
But there might be a few hundred thousand
people who show up on Saturday

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,750
to hold a religious gathering because...

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,410
they’re really, really sad that Li Peng
died.

75
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,890
Yeah, that’s why.

76
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,860
But I wouldn’t want you to think the Chinese
Communist Party

77
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,200
is on the warpath with Hong Kong.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,011
There are plenty of other countries/regions
where the Communist Party

79
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,890
is also on the warpath.

80
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,540
In a newly released Chinese military white
paper,

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,540
the Party says if Taiwan ever moves towards
formal independence,

82
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,100
the Chinese Communist Party will go to war.

83
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,330
This comes in the same month the US announced

84
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,520
a 2 billion dollar weapons deal with Taiwan.

85
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,230
So this should be fun.

86
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,010
Defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said,

87
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,330
“We must firmly point out that seeking Taiwan
independence is a dead end.”

88
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,530
He added, wink wink, get it?

89
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,570
Dead end.

90
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,660
After which he chuckled a bit, before saying,

91
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,530
“Seriously, we will invade Taiwan and kill
anyone who resists.”

92
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,310
China’s new military white paper also took
aim at the Trump administration—

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,330
for standing up to the Chinese Communist Party.

94
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,970
“It claimed ‘hegemonism’ is on the rise.”

95
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,720
To which Trump responded, gotta catch ’em
all, Hegemon!

96
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,950
But I wouldn’t want you to think the Chinese
Communist Party

97
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,780
is on the warpath with only Hong Kong, Taiwan,
and the United States.

98
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,150
The white paper also is promising more military
cooperation with Russia.

99
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,670
To which South Korea responded,

100
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,790
“Oh really?

101
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,820
We hadn’t noticed.”

102
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,180
A few days before the white paper release,

103
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,130
“two Russian bombers and two Chinese warplanes—

104
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,040
both capable of dropping nuclear weapons—

105
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,320
entered South Korea’s air defense identification
zone.”

106
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,480
Which was shortly followed by another Russian
aircraft.

107
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,790
And then South Korea scrambled 18 fighter
jets,

108
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,040
which fired machine-gun rounds and released
flares.

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,090
But I wouldn’t want you to think the Chinese
Communist Party

110
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,400
is on the warpath with only Hong Kong,

111
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,300
Taiwan, the United States, and South Korea.

112
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,930
Japan said that Chinese and Russian aircraft

113
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,820
also flew over disputed Japanese territory.

114
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,360
Which is great news.

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,660
Don’t worry though.

116
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,140
Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan are not the
real problems.

117
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,710
It’s the United States that’s to blame—

118
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,870
for destabilizing the world.

119
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,870
The military white paper,

120
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,710
besides highlighting all the places China
is willing to go to war over,

121
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,130
singled out the US for undermining global
strategic stability.

122
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,760
And China, “resolutely opposes the wrong
practices

123
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,710
and provocative activities of the U.S.”

124
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,300
For example, last week,

125
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,410
President Trump met with victims of religious
persecution around the world,

126
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,389
including four people from China—

127
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:14,410
a Tibetan Buddhist,

128
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,520
a Uighur Muslim,

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
a Christian,

130
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,690
and a Falun Gong practitioner.

131
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,200
Thank you so much, thank you so very much.

132
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,080
My favorite Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman

133
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,700
and Mortal Kombat character, Lu Kang was furious.

134
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,170
He said, “There is no so-called religious
persecution in China at all.

135
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,920
The Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious
belief in accordance with law.”

136
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,130
Ohhhhh, Lu Kang just pulled off a fatality
on facts!

137
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,520
Speaking of the US’s provocative activities,

138
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,090
here’s FBI director Christopher Wray clearly
antagonizing the Communist Party.

139
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,180
“China is fighting a generational fight
here.

140
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,380
And when I say China, I want to be clear,

141
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,700
this is not about the Chinese people as a
whole,

142
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
or the Chinese Americans in this country.

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:11,410
What it is about, though, is a variety of
ways the Chinese Communist Party

144
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:16,410
is using government officials, private sector
entities …

145
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,620
to steal their way up the economic ladder
at our expense.”

146
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,290
Okay, sure, Chrisotpher Wray is making it
very clear

147
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,040
this is not about Chinese people as a whole.

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,840
But when people have criticized the Communist
Party before,

149
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,510
that hasn’t ever stopped the Communist Party
from crying racism anyway.

150
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,270
After all, Lu Kang is Mr. Fact Fatality.

151
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,630
But the accusation that China was stealing
their way up the economic ladder

152
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,300
was echoed by Brigadier General DeAnna Burt
of the US Space Command.

153
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,400
She recently said,

154
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,130
China was stealing the US Space Command Blind.

155
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,910
Which I can only assume means China has stolen
Geordi’s visor.

156
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,780
But China’s space program may be having
some problems.

157
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,449
A senior official there is under investigation
for corruption.

158
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,150
Which if you’ve been paying any attention
to China Uncensored,

159
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,060
you know what it means when an official is
charged with corruption.

160
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,000
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made the military
a particular focus

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,580
of his so-called anti-corruption campaign.

162
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,720
And while in most cases,

163
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,860
the officials really are corrupt,

164
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,030
the corrupt ones Xi Jinping goes after

165
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,800
also tend to be tied to his political rivals.

166
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,570
Which is why there’s a saying in China,

167
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,430
“Shoot for the moon.

168
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,620
Even if you miss,

169
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,530
dying in the vacuum of space is still better

170
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,280
than what the Communist Party will do to you.”

171
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,190
And finally, the China-Russia cooperation
doesn’t stop at the military.

172
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,479
It’s also hitting the big screen!

173
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,630
The Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger movie

174
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,190
was directed by a Russian and filmed in Beijing.

175
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,050
It’s called The Mystery of the Dragon Seal:
Journey to China.

176
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,140
It’s a chance to recapture all that childhood
magic,

177
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,400
and then throw that magic on the ground and
stomp on it

178
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,720
after you realize your childhood heroes have
been tarnished forever.

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,950
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

180
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,560
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

181
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,710
a fan who support China Uncensored with a
dollar or more per episode,

182
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,000
by contributing through Patreon.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
Joe King asks,

184
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,560
“Chris, does the CCP target the ancient
eastern religions

185
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,250
with the same fervor delivered unto Western
and Middle Eastern religions?”

186
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,110
Well, just ask the Tibetan Buddhists.

187
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,450
But beyond the Tibetans,

188
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,770
Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism

189
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,520
have also been heavily persecuted.

190
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,680
Especially during the Cultural Revolution,

191
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,890
when their ancient religious iconography got
smashed.

192
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,050
Under Mao, there was even a specific campaign
to criticize Confucius.

193
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,460
But once Buddhists, Daoists, and Confucians
were brought to heel,

194
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,650
the Chinese Communist Party set up the State
Administration for Religious Affairs,

195
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,430
so religion could flourish as a well controlled
part

196
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,980
of the officially atheist Chinese Communist
Party.

197
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,790
Each of the 5 major religions in China has
been controlled

198
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,470
by the Party under this organization.

199
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,670
But in 2018, Xi Jinping said the State Administration
for Religious Affairs would be dissolved,

200
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,490
and religion would come directly under the
control of the United Front Work Department.

201
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,490
Because remember, as Lu Kang said,

202
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,170
“There is no so-called religious persecution
in China at all.

203
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,300
The Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious
belief in accordance with law.”

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,060
And Lu Kang is an expert at sending people
to the afterlife.

205
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,410
Thanks for your question.

206
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,950
And thanks to everyone watching!

207
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,150
We could not make this show without your support.

208
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,839
Whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

209
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,890
or just watching and sharing the show with
your friends and family.

210
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,040
So thank you from me and everyone on the China
Uncensored team.

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,340
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

212
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,380
see you next time.
