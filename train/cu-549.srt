1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,140
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,600
Hoooly See!

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,220
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,879
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,040
The Vatican.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,960
Known for priceless works of art,

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,540
top secret archives,

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,360
and Jude Law's pet kangaroo.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,540
At least one of those things is not real.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,540
Probably.

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,080
Anyway, last week,

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,350
the Vatican held a summit on organ trafficking

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,439
and transplant tourism.

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,449
And the real-life, not young pope has called
these things

15
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,890
a new form of slavery

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,960
and a crime against humanity.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,260
So everyone was a little surprised

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,730
when the Vatican invited this man to speak,

19
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,300
China’s transplant chief,

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,940
Dr. Huang Jiefu.

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,940
Why?

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,010
Well, it’s kind of like holding a summit

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,609
on how to stop people from stealing food,

24
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,489
and inviting the Hamburglar

25
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,739
as your keynote speaker.

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,089
Dr. Huang Jiefu has been accused of being
a part of,

27
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:04,160
and covering up,

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,720
the Chinese regime's prolific organ trafficking

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,160
and transplant tourism.

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,660
Holy See?

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,800
More like Holy NOT See.

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,410
No, not Nazi!

33
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,510
Not See, like, they're not seeing the obvious!

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,460
Uh, moving on.

35
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,410
The Catholic Church approves of organ donation
and transplantation,

36
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,920
a tradition dating back to this guy.

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,140
But I’m pretty sure there’s some kind
of prohibition

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,610
against a government killing people for their
organs.

39
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,420
I think might be covered by one of the commandments.

40
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,240
I mean, it’s been a long time since I went
to Bible school,

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,710
but that makes sense, right?

42
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,990
Except that’s exactly what the Chinese regime
has been doing.

43
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,720
There is a mountain of evidence

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,310
that China has a large and complex system

45
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,350
to kill prisoners of conscience and harvest
their organs

46
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,640
for transplant.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,560
A single organ can fetch 6 figures,

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,140
so a lot of people in China are profiting
from this.

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,700
This report released last year

50
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,070
estimates that between 60,000 and 100,000 organs

51
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,630
are taken from innocent people in China every
year.

52
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,380
Now for years,

53
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,319
the Communist Party was able to hide what
they were doing,

54
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,129
but it's not as easy now as it used to be.

55
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,799
People are wising up.

56
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:18,799
For instance,

57
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,450
this declaration last year by the European
Parliament

58
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,560
condemned China's organ harvesting.

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,200
Then there’s this one from the US House
of Representatives.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,540
A major liver transplant journal,

61
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,780
Liver International,

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,159
just retracted a study by Chinese liver surgeons

63
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,939
because it seemed like the donors weren’t
so voluntary.

64
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,489
And mainstream media are actually reporting
on it as well.

65
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,239
Without using words like "allegedly."

66
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,629
Dr. Huang Jiefu,

67
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:48,750
despite trying to paint himself as a reformer,

68
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,499
has personally been involved in some sketchy
things.

69
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,970
In 2005,

70
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,010
he performed a high profile public demonstration
of a liver transplant.

71
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,209
Just to be on the safe side,

72
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,209
he ordered two extra matching livers as back
ups.

73
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,829
They were never used.

74
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,489
For those of you who aren’t transplant surgeons,

75
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,380
let me explain the problem with that.

76
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,810
As the Guardian puts it,

77
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,519
“Livers are extremely sensitive and need
to be removed quickly,

78
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,049
and are often unsuitable for transplantation

79
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,549
by the time the patient dies.”

80
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,790
So to be able to order two extra livers

81
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,879
means Chinese hospitals must have had a pool
of people

82
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,999
already set aside,

83
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,260
with all their blood work done

84
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,700
so they could match the organs,

85
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
and still alive,

86
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,689
so their livers could be harvested.

87
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,689
So where do China’s 60,000 to 100,000 organs

88
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,750
every year come from?

89
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,279
According to the report I mentioned,

90
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,069
they come from Falun Gong adherents,

91
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,579
the Uyghur ethnic group,

92
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,579
Tibetans,

93
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,129
and House Christians.

94
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,629
So the Chinese regime is killing Christians
for their organs,

95
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,049
and then sending their representative to a
conference in the Vatican

96
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,640
on how to stop organ trafficking and transplant
tourism.

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,750
For the past few years,

98
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,510
Dr. Huang has been traveling around the world,

99
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,579
trying to convince everyone that China's organ
transplant system

100
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,000
is fine now and made up of voluntary donors.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,259
No one said that prisoners couldn't volunteer,
right?

102
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,289
As you can see in that quote,

103
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,549
there's another sneaky thing Dr. Huang does.

104
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,840
He's trying to make it sound like the Communist
Party

105
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,770
only uses death-row criminals for organs.

106
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,050
When it really is mostly using prisoners of
conscience--

107
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,900
people who the Party is persecuting for their
beliefs.

108
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,370
You can understand why so many people people
were mad.

109
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,490
The Chinese regime wanted to use its presence
at this summit

110
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,860
to show that hey,

111
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,610
our organ transplant system is totally legit

112
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,430
and accepted by the rest of the world.

113
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,900
You might argue maybe the Vatican

114
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,790
made an innocent mistake by inviting Dr. Huang.

115
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,310
They didn’t know.

116
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,710
But when the international outcry went out
about this,

117
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,400
their official response left something to
be desired.

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,060
They said the summit was meant to be an

119
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,349
“academic exercise,

120
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,360
and not a reprise of contentious political
assertions.”

121
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah, the Vatican.

122
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,680
They never get involved in politics.

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,620
But seriously,

124
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,330
why would the Vatican invite the guy not only
involved in,

125
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,919
but trying to cover up the same crimes against
humanity

126
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,900
the Pope has called out?

127
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,919
The guy who’s also very likely indirectly
involved

128
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,030
in killing Christians inside of China?

129
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,910
Well it could be a coincidence.

130
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,400
But the Vatican is trying to work out a deal

131
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,949
with the Chinese Communist Party

132
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,650
over the appointment of bishops.

133
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,650
Around the world,

134
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,150
the Roman Catholic Church is responsible

135
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,540
for appointing its bishops.

136
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,760
But in the 1950s,

137
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,840
the Chinese Communist Party set up its own
organization

138
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,080
to do that.

139
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,199
It’s called the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association.

140
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,669
Because you can believe in God,

141
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,310
after you believe in the Party.

142
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,840
I'm being serious.

143
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,139
The Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association

144
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,550
is under the jurisdiction of the Communist
Party.

145
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,620
So if you want to be Catholic in China,

146
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,530
you have two choices:

147
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,680
One: Belong to the “patriotic” church,

148
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,099
where your highest authority is not Father,

149
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,689
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

150
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:17,939
but the officially atheist Communist Party.

151
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,210
Or Two: belong to an underground church,

152
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,449
and risk being arrested or having your organs
harvested.

153
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,120
Neither of these are great options.

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,370
And when the Catholic Church has tried

155
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,470
to appoint their own bishops or priests in
China,

156
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,870
they tend to get kidnapped and arrested.

157
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,900
So that's a problem.

158
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,770
But recently the Cardinal of Hong Kong

159
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,120
said that the Holy See and China have reached

160
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,630
“a preliminary consensus...

161
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,970
that will lead to an agreement over the appointment

162
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,189
of bishops [in China].”

163
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,800
So basically the Catholic church is considering

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,789
making a deal with the Communist Party.

165
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,319
The agreement is ostensibly over the appointment
of bishops,

166
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,400
but ultimately involves the entire issue

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,180
of religious freedom in China, because,

168
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,139
as China’s leader puts it,

169
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,110
religious groups must adhere to the leadership

170
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,639
of the Communist Party.

171
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,090
The same Party that’s harvesting Christians’
organs,

172
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,509
selling them for profit,

173
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,690
and then sending their top doctor to the Vatican

174
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,419
to lie about it.

175
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,930
That Communist Party.

176
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,509
So there’s concern that the Church

177
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,870
might be sacrificing human rights and religious
freedom

178
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,789
in order to establish diplomatic ties

179
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,719
and get more control over bishops in China.

180
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,210
Well, as Cardinal Tong put it,

181
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,990
“The moral principle of the Church teaches
