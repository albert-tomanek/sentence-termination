1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,280
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,220
Joining me today, he reads books you know, it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,340
I'm fading fast!

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,120
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,900
Well, I've brought a tanker of clotted cream,
but the pump's broke.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,680
The bounciest man on the Internet, Matt Gray!

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,120
'Ello YouTube!

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,900
Bloody 'ell.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,440
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,560
Every fact they get right is a point, and a ding [DING].

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,760
And there's a prize for particularly good answers,
which is...

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,880
And today we are talking about Victor Lustig.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,440
On French 'Top Gear',
how do they announce the Stig's won?

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,920
Victor Le Stig!

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,220
Ayy!

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,420
Can I get a vote from the gentlemen here?
Is that a 'golf clap' or is that a 'biscuits'?

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,860
--That's not a biscuit.
 --It's not a biscuit.

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,140
It's not a biscuit. It's really not a biscuit.

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,540
Oh, I'll take that, that's fine.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,000
Aww! I was kind of hoping that it was
some lusty gentleman.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,620
Victor Lust-ig!

22
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,560
Oohrg!

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,820
Lusty isn't right, but he certainly had the interesting life.

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,160
Vivacious was he?

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,520
Sorry, are you telling me someone called Victor Lustig, had an 'interesting life'?

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,020
Yeah.

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,080
I think with a name like that, doesn't it come with the card?

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,600
Oh, he had many types of cards printed up for him.
for many sorts of dealings.

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,760
Was he a spy?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ooh, no. More towards the dark end of those arts.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,360
Was he a spy at night?

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,760
--No
 --With Patrick Moore?

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,960
Impersonator?

34
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,800
Impersonator...is not quite close enough.

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,240
I need to hear something
a little bit more dastardly.

36
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,020
Was he a cad and a philanderer?

37
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,760
Con man?

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,240
Con man! [DING] Is exactly the words I wanted to hear.

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,140
Hence why he'd got the business cards for many identities.

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,200
Many of the identities, many particular jobs.

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
He was one of the
most successful con artists of all time.

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,960
Hang on a minute! 
Is this the bloke what sold the Eiffel Tower?

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,900
[DING]

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,360
Well he's won!

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,940
I say, everybody else, go home!

46
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,880
He's the bloke who sold the Eiffel Tower, isn't he? 
Yeah, that's it.

47
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,580
Yes. You are missing a key word off the end of that sentence.

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,500
Multiple times?

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,460
Twice! [DING]

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,540
Yes, absolutely right. Victor Lustig is the man who sold the Eiffel Tower twice.

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,900
Had it worn through the bottom?

52
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,400
It had worn all... I'll give you a point.

53
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,200
No..Get...

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,360
--I'm making a cobblers joke here.
 --Get out!

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,320
Get out!

56
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,980
Sold?... Soled!... Argh!

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Lift it up one side. Hammer it on...
Give it a bit of a buff as well, yeah.

58
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,320
I mean what...

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,240
What kind of grip do you want on the bottom of the Eiffel Tower? You gonna be walking on ice?

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,220
The thing is, I'm still giving you a point. [DING]

61
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,380
1925, it was disused, run down,
probably going to be demolished.

62
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,100
It was basically done for, like...

63
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,600
It was like the Millennium Dome. It was put up as a temporary thing as part of an exhibition.

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,820
To show that the French could put a giant penis into the sky or something like that.

65
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,060
Which let's face it, is what towers are.
They are 'I've got a bigger one that you!'

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,960
It was a temporary thing then, wasn't it.

67
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,060
So everyone expected it would be taken down and used for valuable... I don't know,

68
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,560
patisserie space or something like that.

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,340
Yes. What were they actually... if they took down the Eiffel Tower, what were they selling?

70
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,040
Scrap!

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,960
Blackpool!

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,020
Get yer Blackpool spares here!

73
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,620
Mayor of Blackpool, as I imagine there still is or was, stands up, full regalia.

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,900
"It has come to my attention, there is a tower larger than the tower we have on the promenade.

75
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,880
"It has come on the market. I have secured it at a reasonable price.''

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,420
"Doesn't have a ballroom!"

77
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,140
"Does not have a ballroom. Or a circus." Which I'm always disappointed, isn't actually at the top.

78
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,920
'cos I thought that would be a great idea.

79
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,520
I wanna see an elephant on a beach ball, going round the top of Blackpool Tower.

80
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,040
On the glass floor?

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,440
Yeah, that would be great entertainment, that would be.

82
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,980
Or the lift'll open and loads of clowns'll come out.

83
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,260
You're absolutely right. They would have sold it for scrap. [DING]

84
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,280
How do you go about selling the Eiffel Tower?

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,640
You approach someone, very quietly, 
who you know is a) an idiot and b) has a lot of money.

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,660
And you say...

87
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,200
"Thingy Jones was looking at this.
I think you'd want this."

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,660
You're getting a point again, Matt. [DING]

89
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,700
Because he invited six scrap metal dealers
to the same meeting. And quietly said,

90
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,020
"I'm from the French government. Here is the business cards and stationery I've had printed up.

91
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,900
"Who would like to buy the Eiffel Tower for scrap?"

92
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,320
"You don't want Michel getting this. You can have it. You can make your mint."

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
Michel the scrap dealer.

94
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,440
Some bloke from Rotherham turns up with his wagon.

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,440
"I can ge' it all on for yer. Lowest bid."

96
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,120
OK. You tell me a burly French name.

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Jacques!

98
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,020
Ah! It's true.

99
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,640
Ah, ****.

100
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,640
He put all six of them in a rented limousine.

101
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,820
Toured them round and worked out which one was most enthusiastic and gullible.

102
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,360
Can anyone guess

103
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,960
what the name of the dealer he selected was?
And this is not as difficult as you might think.

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,940
Michel!

105
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,640
--Yeah, w...
 --Jacques?

106
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,920
Andre. The last name
is just a French word you learn in school.

107
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,840
--For a...
 --Gare!

108
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,760
Bonjour?

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,800
Er, something you might eat with chips.

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,840
Frites?

111
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,400
Moules?

112
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,200
Cheval?

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Cheval?... that's horse.

114
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Horse and chips.

115
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,180
Mmmm!

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,280
La plage.

117
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,420
What? That's the beach!

118
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,920
That's where you eat them.

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
What the hell do you eat with chips?

120
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,580
Piscine?

121
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,620
That's not the right word! 
That's a swimming pool!

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
Poisson?

123
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Poisson! Have a point. [DING]

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Andre Poisson.

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,060
Andre Piscine.

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,920
"Bonjour, je suis Andrew Swimming-Pool!"

127
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,780
You OK there Gary?

128
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,480
You've killed him!

129
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Oh my God, I wondered why I couldn't get served.

130
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,020
"Le piscine! Le piscine, s'il vous plaît!"

131
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,660
I'm sorry, France.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
Andre Poisson.

133
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,800
Did indeed... not Andre Piscine.

134
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,340
Andre Poisson was absolutely all for it.

135
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,800
Someone close to him, nearly killed it off.

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,780
His wife? [DING]

137
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,100
--Yes. Poisson's wife...
 --Oh right!

138
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,900
..thought something was suspicious.

139
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,700
Clever! Clever there.

140
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,840
The deal was too quick, the deal was too secret.

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,600
Well I imagine the big thing that probably attracted her attention: there wasn't a 'For Sale' sign

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,020
on the side of the Eiffel Tower.

143
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,640
Yes.

144
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,080
It wasn't in the news...

145
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,580
So how do you deal with that? How does a con artist deal with nearly being rumbled?

146
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,880
By conning her.

147
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,180
Did he woo her?

148
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,460
What? Like a ghost?

149
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,940
Woo-oo-oo!

150
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,440
Sorry.

151
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,660
I dunno?

152
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,500
"I am ze ghost of Monsieur Eiffel,
and I want you to buy my tower!"

153
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,320
Did he tier her to the top?

154
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,140
--And get a big...
 --And twirl his moustache!

155
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,180
And run a train up the side of the Eiffel tower.

156
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,800
Have an airship approach very slowly.

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,140
--No?
 --No... no.

158
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,040
Paid her?

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,300
He confessed.

160
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,940
With an entirely fake confession

161
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,360
saying he was a government minister trying to to this on the cheap and get a bribe.

162
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,520
Ohhh!

163
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,480
What did that mean that Lustig got?

164
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
Er? A smaller cut?

165
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Quite the opposite.

166
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,720
A bigger cut?

167
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,700
Have a point [DING]

168
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,900
He got... he got the money...

169
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,200
"What colour is a red fire engine?"

170
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,880
Lustig got the money for the Eiffel Tower

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,980
and the bribe.

172
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,320
Ah! Good work, sir!

173
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,520
Took a train to Vienna, with a suitcase full of cash.

174
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,160
Ohh! That's the way to do it. None of your cheques here.

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,920
Inter-war France: how else are you going to do that? You're gonna have a suitcase full of cash.

176
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,460
And you are going to be able to get out of town
without anyone spotting you.

177
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,980
Which is, of course, the least
suspicious way of paying anyone,

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,000
is to hand over a briefcase full of millions of francs, while he goes

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,720
"well thank you very much. I'll just get on this immediately waiting train next to me, in first class..."

180
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,700
--"Here's the keys."
 --"Here's the keys to the..."

181
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,580
"To my garage!"

182
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,960
"Tow-er! 'Cos towers need keys.
You must remember that."

183
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,460
Yes.

184
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,040
"And, erm, the plans are inside. Toodles!"

185
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,020
Lights cigar with newly minted note.

186
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
So what happened next?

187
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,840
Well I imagine he turned up with his gas cutter,

188
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,300
started sawing away the bottom leg and someone ticked him off?

189
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,660
Er, no! No.

190
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,060
Did he check with the government?

191
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,280
Erm...

192
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,100
Does he sound like the kind of guy who would do a lot of due diligence at this point?

193
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,340
After he had already bought it,
having not done any due diligence.

194
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,980
--Suddenly...
 --Now's the time!

195
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,180
Well, what would you do

196
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,220
if you've been conned into giving someone an enormous amount of money?

197
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,640
I would...not...admit it?

198
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,760
Point! [DING]

199
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Nothing happened.

200
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,980
Poisson was too humiliated, he did not go to the police.

201
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,740
It's like going round saying, "I'm a ****ing idiot!"

202
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,240
Yeah.

203
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,580
"Well, this apparently credulous man came to me, said he wanted me to buy this major national structure

204
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,480
"for a ludicrously low sum."

205
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,160
"Said 'Don't ask any questions'..."

206
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,620
--"Told me to not ask any questions, so I didn't!"
--"I just didn't!"

207
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,440
"And I gave him a bribe as well!"

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,540
"Oh! I threw him a bung. And he got on a train. And he could be anywhere now!

209
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,320
"You must do something about this!"

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
So where was Lustig a month later?

211
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,880
Was he still in Paris?

212
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
Selling it again?

213
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
You can both have a point. [DING][DING].

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,000
You're absolutely right. He had six more scrap dealers, in a conference room, in Paris.

215
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Pulling the exact same con a second time.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
He didn't go for the hat trick did he?

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
No he didn't. He wasn't able to.

218
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,280
--He got nicked?
--He got caught?

219
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,040
Not quite. He managed to evade arrest.

220
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,520
But one of the scrap dealers found him
and bray'd his knees in?

221
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,760
--One of the scrap dealers...
--One of them knows the other one.

222
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,120
No. I'll give Chris the point [DING]. One of the scrap dealers went to the police

223
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,820
with the counterfeit contract
and worked out what had happened.

224
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,680
Managed to skip the town and evade arrest again.

225
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,320
Mmm. Yep.

226
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,340
Which is the story of the man
who sold the Eiffel Tower twice.

227
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,960
But there are a whole load of other cons
in here that he did.

228
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
What was his money printing machine?

229
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
A machine that printed money.

230
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,640
Wrong.

231
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,460
A person?

232
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
No. I mean, it's a machine.

233
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,000
That didn't print money.

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,180
--Have a point. [DING]
--It printed bad fakes, and he sold that to other people

235
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,360
who wanted to run the con.

236
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,920
Yeah, absolutely right. Have another point [DING]

237
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,020
--Hey!
--for that one. That's absolutely right.

238
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,420
So he probably had a machine that spat out actual notes,

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,100
sold you the machine and it just did photocopies, or something.

240
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
It was a box.

241
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,580
And how long did the box take to print a $100 note?

242
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,620
As long as it takes for a man to slide a $100 bill through from the other side.

243
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,920
--You're...
--Some sort of Turing test.

244
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,200
As long as it takes to leave the town.

245
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,560
I was going to say, as long as it takes to take the train to Vienna. Again.

246
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,320
You're going to get. He was actually on a boat at this point. So he [DING] was...

247
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,140
He was plying the transatlantic ferries.

248
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,980
So as they were sort-of coming into New York, he would

249
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,920
confess to someone, oh, he had this money printing machine.

250
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,600
And it printed a $100 bill
but it took about six hours to do it.

251
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,780
How? How can any machine take six hours to print something...

252
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,900
Because it was ages ago.

253
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,160
Really intricate, really intricate. It's got to do everything.

254
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,120
And slowly, over six hours,
a $100 bill comes out of this machine.

255
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,980
And another one starts to come out.

256
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,320
And he says, "It takes so long. You know, I'm looking to sell it."

257
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,580
It's just the two actual $100 bills, isn't it?

258
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,840
Yes. It's spitting out two $100 dollar bills,
then a load of blank paper, by the time he's left.

259
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,800
Oh for god's sake. People!

260
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,540
"Oh, it's run out of ink. I'll sell you some of that."

261
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,200
Was his surname Hewlett-Packard, by any chance?

262
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,220
What? Printing the ink out?

263
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,720
Yeah.

264
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,340
I'll flog you the ink for a ridiculously large fee.

265
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,720
There was also the black dollar scam.
Or the money wash scam.

266
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,080
Does anyone know how that works?

267
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,920
Is that like invisible ink?

268
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,440
Quite the opposite.

269
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,440
Is it like visible ink?

270
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,880
I keep giving points for really obvious things here.

271
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,340
Was it invisible, this?

272
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,420
Yes, Matt, have a point(!) [DING]

273
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,820
I'm loving this binary points thing here. Yeah.

274
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,740
He just drew another Eiffel Tower on something and tried to sell that to someone.

275
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,720
Oh, was he trying to give you notes that had been spoiled in the mint or something?

276
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,980
That's it [DING]. It's a trunk full of completely painted over money. Completely dyed money.

277
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,480
Yeah.

278
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,820
With the idea that they will sell you this, and the chemicals to clean it, for a fraction of its cost.

279
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,100
And they will demonstrate it on the few $100 notes,
that they've already...

280
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,020
to a batch they've done in those chemicals.

281
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,200
-- And it will work.
-- And the rest is...

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,080
And the rest, you're absolutely right, have a point. [DING] The rest of it is just completely... paper.

283
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,560
Or they need more funds for more of the chemical fluid, which is quite expensive.

284
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,060
Yes.

285
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,820
Once again like, printing.

286
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,040
Place I used to work, a while back,
someone tried... not something similar, like a con.

287
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,460
They lived abroad and wanted to pay for some services. So she sent us a photocopy

288
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,360
of two £5 notes.

289
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,200
As if that would pay for it.

290
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
That's...
Is that a scam? Or is that just...

291
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,580
Just like, if you could do that...
You wouldn't need money, would you?

292
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
You would need a fiver.

293
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,160
I felt like sending her back a photocopy, or a drawing of 20p change.

294
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
Yes, he was also part of a counterfeiting ring, just printed fake money

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
which is a heck of a lot easier in the 1930s.

296
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,760
He was arrested in 1935 by federal agents. Who gave him away?

297
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,160
After all this operational security. After all this...

298
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,720
--His wife!
--I was gonna say his wife.

299
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,960
His mistress. [DING]

300
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,840
Arrghhh!

301
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,500
Yes, he had similar dealings with romance as he did with business.

302
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,640
He was carrying on with multiple women and one of them got jealous and gave him away.

303
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,540
Was it the Statue of Liberty?

304
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,280
Yes, promptly arrested. They opened his suitcase, they found...?

305
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,800
Money!

306
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,120
No, just some expensive clothing.
And a key.

307
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,240
Key took them to a locker. They opened the locker.
What was in the locker?

308
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,580
--Money!
--Narnia!

309
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,840
Mr Tumnus... with money!

310
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,800
A fake Mr. Tumnus.

311
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,760
But if you wash him,
he's actually just two $100 bills in a box.

312
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,920
No, you are absolutely right, counterfeit money. [DING]

313
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,100
$51,000 worth of counterfeit money, which was more than enough to convict him.

314
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,880
Well that's because you wouldn't
get a $51,000 bill, for a start.

315
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,380
Just a single note!

316
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,880
"5, 1, 0, 0, 0..."

317
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,940
"I'll sell you this for 50 grand, mate!"

318
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,220
Only he would have notes that were dry wipe.

319
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,820
Arrested. Taken to trial, pled guilty.
What happened the day before his trial though?

320
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,420
He ran away?

321
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,140
--Yes! He managed to escape.
--I was gonna say...

322
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,940
Have a point [DING]

323
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,000
It turned out his guilty plea...was a fake.

324
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,400
They washed it. 
It said "Not guilty. I'm on the train to Vienna...

325
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280
"Again!"

326
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,280
And they said the man in court was actually some cardboard cut out of him.

327
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,660
That just flops forward at the end.

328
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,840
"How did he do this?!"

329
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,140
He managed to escape the
Federal House of Detention.

330
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,520
--Which is either a prison or some real...
--Brothel.

331
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,020
Yeah, really good night club, I was going for.

332
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,620
Or a very strict school.

333
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,280
And he skipped...he skipped town.
He took a train, presumably, to Pittsburgh.

334
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,640
And they caught him.

335
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,540
Nearly four weeks later.

336
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,480
But!

337
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah sadly, it ends with him in Alcatraz,
catching pneumonia.

338
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,520
--But what...
