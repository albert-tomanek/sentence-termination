1
00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:04,160
Two authoritarian leaders go on a playdate.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,419
The atheist Communist Party wants to adjust
Islam

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,200
to be compatible with socialism.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,749
And China lands a lunar probe on the dark
side of the moon.

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:17,560
The perfect spot for a supervillain moon base.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,500
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,939
Welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,320
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,529
How do you celebrate your birthday?

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,730
Well, if you’re anything like North Korean
god-king Kim Jong-un,

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,750
you take a luxury armored train car to China.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,790
Ah, the height of luxury.

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,020
This is Kim’s fourth trip to China in about
a year.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,960
Before that, he basically never went to China

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,090
or met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,590
That’s because Xi Jinping is the political
rival

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,880
of former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin,

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,500
and Jiang and his cronies

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,760
were major supporters of the Kim dynasty.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,420
So what changed?

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,310
Why, America’s own god-king, Donald Trump.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,830
Trump’s historic summit last year with Kim
Jong-un

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,060
was a game changer.

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,590
Not only was it the first meeting between

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,719
a sitting US president and a leader of North
Korea,

26
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,719
it also established a line of communication

27
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,880
directly between the two countries,

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,620
without China as a middleman.

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,860
That’s a problem for China.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,229
But since China is responsible

31
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,840
for about 90% of all North Korean trade

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,869
and is the only thing keeping that failed
state afloat,

33
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,569
it’s also a problem for North Korea.

34
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,930
China has tremendous leverage over North Korea.

35
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,140
And with another meeting between Trump and
Kim

36
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,299
planned in the next month or two,

37
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,929
this meeting between Kim and Xi

38
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,960
is a way to signal to the Trump administration

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,590
that Kim doesn’t belong to Trump.

40
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,119
No, it’s gonna be a love triangle,

41
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,070
China won’t be the one standing

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,170
outside Kim’s house with a boom box.

43
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,140
China has successfully landed an unmanned
lunar probe

44
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,109
on the far side of the moon.

45
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:58,750
That makes China the first nation to ever
do that.

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,740
The far side of the moon always faces away
from the Earth,

47
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,030
making it a lot harder to land a probe there.

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,420
Also, that’s where the decepticons live.

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,630
But there’s a lot we might not know about
China’s lunar rover,

50
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,730
according to the New York Times.

51
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,540
“The fear of losing face over failures,

52
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,630
as well as the sensitivity of the technology
involved,

53
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,550
has made the Chinese government reluctant

54
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,090
to discuss its programs in detail,

55
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,100
compared with the relative openness of NASA

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,290
and other space programs.”

57
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,290
But I say,

58
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,860
if you’re going to lose your craft to the
depths of space,

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,070
at least have a little fun with it.

60
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,060
Have you ever found yourself riding the subway,

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,110
thinking to yourself,

62
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,890
I’m not really feeling paranoid enough right
now.

63
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,890
Well good news,

64
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,230
I’m here to help you achieve

65
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,120
the appropriate levels of paranoia.

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,450
Security experts are concerned that a Chinese-built
Metro line

67
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,990
could spy on riders through surveillance cameras,
bugs…

68
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,950
...or just have some malware installed

69
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,320
in the controls that could make it crash.

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Nevertheless,

71
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,270
“The state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock
Corp.,

72
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,920
or CRRC,

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,850
has used bargain prices to win

74
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,760
four of five large U.S. transit rail car contracts

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,520
awarded since 2014.”

76
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,940
Undercutting your competitors is so much easier

77
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,170
when you’re sponsored by an entire country.

78
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,870
The US doesn’t manufacturer subway cars,

79
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,510
so it relies on other countries to make them.

80
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,910
And China has become a dominant force.

81
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,860
But Washington DC’s Metro line

82
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,310
is taking these concerns seriously

83
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,780
ahead of bidding for its contract in April.

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,340
It’s introducing changes to its contract
that are

85
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,490
“expected to require the winning bidder

86
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,280
get its hardware and software certified as
safe

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,450
by a third-party vendor cleared by the federal
government.”

88
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,090
Did you know Islam can be compatible with
socialism?

89
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,670
Neither did I,

90
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,220
but apparently the Communist Party

91
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,790
is going to give it a go.

92
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,730
According to my favorite Chinese state run
media,

93
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,830
the Global Times,

94
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,520
atheist communist officials

95
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,210
“agreed to guide Islam to be compatible
with socialism

96
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,700
and implement measures to sinicize the religion.”

97
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,840
This will only end well.

98
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
By the way,

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,510
when they say “sinicize the religion”
they don’t mean,

100
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,360
make the religion more Chinese.

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,330
They mean, “put religious people under

102
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,350
the control of the Chinese Communist Party.”

103
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,670
No details were given,

104
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,560
but I’m sure it involves more of those

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,259
fun vocational training camps they’re building
in Xinjiang.

106
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,949
And finally, Tesla is finally building the
China factory

107
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,660
they’ve wanted to build for so long.

108
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,610
And if you’ve been watching China Uncensored,

109
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,590
you know it always works out for Western companies

110
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,319
when they set up their Chinese factories.

111
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,360
On the bright side though,

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,100
China’s space program is in for some big
changes.

113
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,560
So what do you think?

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,740
Leave your comments below.

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
And before you go,

116
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,330
it’s time to answer a question from a fan

117
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,789
who supports China Uncensored

118
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,889
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

119
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:49,889
Forrest Goodman asks,

120
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,759
“Do you think that Google has really

121
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,919
"effectively ended" Project Dragonfly?

122
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,389
Or are they still going to follow through
with it,

123
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,770
but much more quietly?”

124
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,759
That’s a very good question, Forrest.

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,849
According to the Intercept,

126
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,759
which first leaked the story that Google

127
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,860
had been working on a censored search app

128
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,319
for the China market,

129
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,199
Google has been forced to effectively end
t

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,169
he project known as Dragonfly.

131
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,169
Now remember,

132
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,169
Google higher ups tried to keep as many people
as possible

133
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,490
from knowing about Dragonfly.

134
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,980
That included their own privacy team.

135
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,169
Which tells me that they might have some

136
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,789
sneaking suspicions that helping an authoritarian
regime

137
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:30,409
block its citizens from accessing information

138
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,550
is probably not cool.

139
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,509
But clearly, Google has major China ambitions.

140
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,189
And given that Google tried to handle Dragonfly

141
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,840
by quietly sweeping it under the rug,

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,340
I doubt this will be the end of their attempts
to get into China.

143
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,660
Thanks for you question.

144
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,499
