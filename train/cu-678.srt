1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:02,889
Italy and China are building ties

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:04,770
But for decades,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,230
Chinese people in Italy

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,440
Have been learning Italy’s secrets.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,080
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,290
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,650
In the 13th Century,

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,810
Venecian explorer Marco Polo visited China.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,340
There, he allegedly learned the secret of
making noodles—

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,840
and brought it back to Italy to make a knockoff
version called “spaghetti.”

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,550
But now China is learning something from Italy.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:44,699
Shelley Zhang went to Italy to find out more.

13
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,010
Italy and China have been friends since...

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,839
well, ancient times.

15
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:51,420
And that’s something that Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,809
emphasized during his trip to Italy back in
March of this year.

17
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:57,710
That trip was when Italian and Chinese authorities

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,709
signed a Memorandum of Understanding,

19
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,109
making Italy the first major Western economy

20
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,790
to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative...

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,620
also known as One Belt,

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,710
One Way to Get Debt-Ridden European Countries
to Do Your Bidding.

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,570
While the MOU itself was extremely vague,

24
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,000
with commitments to “work towards”

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,810
and “explore ways”

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,630
and “enhance dialogue,”

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,609
Italy and China also signed 2.5 billion euros
worth of trade deals,

28
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:27,220
linking their economies for years to come.

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,149
But over the last decade plus,

30
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,990
China has already had more and more influence
on Italy’s economy.

31
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,159
One example is the millions of Chinese tourists

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,490
who visit Venice and other Italian cities
each year.

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,729
Chinese tourists are welcomed by Italian businesses

34
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,600
for being high spenders.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,859
And the Italian government has been

36
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,140
encouraging more Chinese tourism,

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,170
including through PR stunts,

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,340
like briefly having Chinese police patrol

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,899
popular tourist destinations like Venice.

40
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,920
Although given the reputation of Chinese police
in China,

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
I’m not sure that’s going to make anyone
feel safer.

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,189
China is also affecting the economics of tourist...souvenirs.

43
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,430
As in many parts of the world,

44
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,759
the vast majority of souvenirs in Venice

45
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,509
are made in China.

46
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,580
And it’s not just cheap hats and scarves

47
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,930
It’s affecting traditional Venentian crafts...

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,470
No, traditional Venetian crafts like these
masks—

49
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,470
which have been made by hand here in Venice
for hundreds of years.

50
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,140
They’re now being replaced with Chinese-factory
made plastic\h versions

51
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,570
sold at a fraction of the price.

52
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,570
And everywhere I went,

53
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,780
I saw stores selling discount leather bags.

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,630
Except *these* discount bags say “Made in
Italy.”

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,690
Are they counterfeits?

56
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,690
No.

57
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,380
It’s much more complicated than that.

58
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,100
And the answer lies in here in Prato.

59
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,660
With almost 200,000 people,

60
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,480
Prato is the third largest city in central
Italy.

61
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,980
And it’s been famous for making textiles
since the Middle Ages.

62
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,540
Textiles and biscotti.

63
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,370
But outside Prato’s Medieval walls,

64
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,290
the face of the city’s textile industry

65
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,480
has changed rapidly in the last 20 years.

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,370
This is the Via Pistoiese,

67
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,400
home to Prato’s Chinatown.

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,430
Officially, around 20,000 Chinese people live
in Prato.

69
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,130
But the actual number may be almost triple
that due to illegal immigration.

70
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,600
Prato has the highest concentration of Chinese
immigrants in Italy.

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,990
Almost all of them from the city of Wenzhou,

72
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,090
in China’s Zhejiang province.

73
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,430
Back in the 1990s,

74
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,790
Chinese immigrants came to Prato

75
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,180
to work in the textile factories.

76
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,480
And then to buy the textile factories.

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,870
By then, a lot of Italian-owned factories
were losing

78
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,790
business to cheaper fabrics made in...well,
China.

79
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,540
But instead of making fabric,

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,290
the Chinese factories in Prato would import
fabric from China,

81
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,599
and make cheap fast fashion, undercutting
the locals.

82
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,180
They eventually got into the lucrative leather
goods market, too.

83
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,230
All technically made in Italy.

84
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,780
By Chinese workers.

85
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,570
We walked through the back streets of Prato,

86
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,760
and secretly filmed some of these Chinese
fast fashion factories.

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,760
Hidden behind unmarked steel doors,

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,920
these were small operations.

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,540
Less than a dozen people,

90
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,650
mostly at sewing machines.

91
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,340
Some of the workers we talked to were worried

92
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,600
that we might be from the Italian government.

93
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,820
The Italian government has conducted

94
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,200
a lot of raids on Chinese factories,

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,790
following reports of sweatshop conditions,

96
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,060
illegal workers, and unpaid taxes.

97
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,430
We did witness some...

98
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,730
questionable safety practices.

99
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,710
Remember kids, don’t sew and smoke.

100
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,760
And workers at the types of factories we saw

101
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,190
have talked about working long hours...

102
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,220
and sleeping in the factories.

103
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,770
But some Chinese factory owners feel unfairly
targeted,

104
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,630
especially since they have revived the economy

105
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,430
of places like Prato.

106
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,750
For example, Chinese factories may evade taxes,

107
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,090
but you could argue that in Italy,

108
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,770
tax evasion is practically a national pastime.

109
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,980
And not all Chinese factories

110
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,210
are the sweatshop-like places we visited.

111
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,800
Outside Prato’s Chinatown

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,960
are higher-end Chinese factories and showrooms.

113
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,900
Some of these make products for famous Italian
fashion houses

114
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,520
like Prada and Gucci.

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,520
That’s given rise to a Chinese middle class
in Prato.

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
Chinese immigrants have even built

117
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,070
an entire economy around the factories...

118
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,410
setting up supermarkets, restaurants,

119
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,720
even a whole street of wedding-related businesses

120
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,820
to cater to a growing Chinese community.

121
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,110
I mean, who wouldn’t want to eat at Ravioli
Liu’s?

122
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,760
But critics say that Chinese money isn’t
going into the Italian economy.

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,600
Back in 2017, the state-owned Bank of China

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,350
was forced to pay Italy more than 20 million
euros

125
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,480
connected to a money laundering case.

126
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,540
Prosecutors alleged that “more than 4.5
billion euros

127
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,870
had been smuggled to China from Italy...

128
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,360
by Chinese people living mainly in Florence

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,700
and the nearby city of Prato.”

130
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,080
Half of that was through the Bank of China.

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,160
And there’s an even darker side to this
economic growth.

132
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,740
Last year, Italian authorities busted what
they say

133
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,580
was a Chinese mafia group based in Prato.

134
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,810
One that was involved in gambling, prostitution,

135
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,550
and trucking Chinese goods across Europe.

136
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,710
As we walked around Prato,

137
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,500
we saw several gambling halls.

138
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,889
And lots of these flyers,

139
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,470
advertising “massage parlors”.

140
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,610
This one offers “very pretty 18 year old
girls

141
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,370
who’ve just come from China.”

142
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,850
Prostitution is legal in Italy,

143
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,070
but organized prostitution and brothels are
not.

144
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,150
Social workers told an Al Jazeera reporter

145
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,720
that in these cases,

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,060
there could be human trafficking involved.

147
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,250
According to the UN,

148
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,600
there are lots of Chinese victims of human
trafficking in Italy.

149
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,020
They could end up doing forced labor in textile
factories in cities like Prato,

150
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,980
or doing sex work in apartments and massage
parlours.

151
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,350
Prato, with all of its complications,

152
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,610
is a microcosm of how globalization

153
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,610
has linked the Chinese and Italian economies.

154
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,140
And that’s before Chinese and Italian officials

155
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,390
promised even more cooperation.

156
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,970
After the two countries signed the agreement
on the Belt and Road,

157
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,710
Italy’s deputy prime minister

158
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,780
praised it as “a day when Made in Italy
has won.”

159
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,770
But as a trip through Prato shows,

160
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,810
China is changing what Made in Italy means.

161
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,810
Chinese companies,

162
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,410
often exploiting workers in the same factory
conditions

163
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,090
they’d have in mainland China,

164
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,210
can legally take advantage of the high quality

165
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,870
“Made in Italy” brand.

166
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,040
Until that brand loses its meaning.

167
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,930
And the money leaves the country.

168
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,930
So ultimately,

169
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,949
the one who benefits from this “Made in
Italy” partnership

170
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,560
might just be China.

171
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,419
This is Shelley Zhang, reporting from Italy.

172
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,419
Thanks, Shelley.
