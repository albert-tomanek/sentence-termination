1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,680
Did China sink a ship in the South China Sea?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,480
Trump bans investment in companies\h
linked to the Chinese military.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,560
And Henry Kissinger is back—and he\h
wants us to “cooperate” with China.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
That and more on this week’s China news headlines.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,160
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

This episode is sponsored by Surfshark. You should\h\h

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,480
be using a VPN like Surfshark to protect\h
your identity whenever you go online.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,840
The US military may be changing\h
its operational calculations if\h\h

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
new reports about Chinese missiles are true.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,440
Back in August, China launched a barrage of\h
medium-range missiles into the South China Sea.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
It was viewed as retaliation for a US spy plane\h\h

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,400
that flew over a Chinese\h
naval drill just days before.\h

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,080
Those missiles are what China\h
calls aircraft-carrier killers.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,640
It’s all part of China’s peaceful\h
claims to the entire South China Sea.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,120
According to US defense officials,\h
those missiles landed somewhere here,\h\h

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,800
between China’s Hainan Island,\h
and the disputed Paracel islands.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,360
At first, it was believed those missiles just\h
hit water. But now, according to a PLA insider\h\h

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,560
speaking to the South China Morning Post, those\h
missiles may have actually hit a target ship.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,160
If that’s true, it’s the first time China has\h\h

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,640
actually demonstrated its anti-ship\h
missiles can actually hit a ship.\h

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
Of course there’s still a lot of unknowns. We\h
don’t know how many missiles were fired, whether\h\h

22
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,120
the target ship was moving or how fast, and\h
whether we can believe the former PLA colonel who\h\h

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,680
said this happened. Because maybe he’s just trying\h
to scare the US military. Good luck with that.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
But one thing is clear,\h\h

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,520
despite the Communist Party’s calls for US\h
China cooperation instead of decoupling...

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,120
their aim is to dominate the United\h
States by any means necessary.\h\h

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,240
And the US needs to adjust\h
its strategy accordingly.\h\h

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,000
Wait, I know how the US can fight against China’s\h
anti-ship missiles...with giant jaeger robots!

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
But economic decoupling is probably a\h
better route than military conflict.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
Speaking of the US and China decoupling,\h
despite the Trump Administration having...a\h\h

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
lot on its plate right now,\h
experts say the administration\h\h

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
is still moving forward with plans to\h
decouple the US and China’s economy.\h

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
Trump recently issued an executive order\h\h

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,840
that will ban US investments in several\h
companies tied to the Chinese military.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,240
Raising the question—why were US companies\h
investing in companies tied to China’s military?!

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,360
The Executive Order says China “is\h
increasingly exploiting United States capital\h\h

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,160
to resource and to enable the development\h
and modernization of its military,\h\h

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,640
intelligence, and other security apparatuses.”

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
That includes “weapons of mass\h
destruction, advanced conventional weapons,\h\h

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
and malicious cyber-enabled actions\h
against the United States and its people.”

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,760
According to White House trade adviser\h
Peter Navarro these 31 Chinese companies\h\h

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,160
represent at least half a trillion\h
dollars in market capitalization.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,000
Wow, that’s a lot of money! Maybe I should\h
invest in companies tied to the Chinese military!

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,160
And if that sounds stupid, don’t worry,\h
there’s a lot of stupid going around.\h\h

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,320
Despite everything we know about\h
the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,080
US companies just can’t seem\h
to quit the China market.

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
This is the actual first line to that article.\h

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,520
“For some American businesses,\h
having an office in China\h\h

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,880
may help them weather the impact\h
of the coronavirus pandemic.”

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,600
Think about that. They’re looking to the Communist\h\h

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,800
Party to help them deal with the economic\h
hit caused by the coronavirus pandemic,\h\h

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,920
which was caused by the Communist\h
Party’s lies and cover up.\h

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,160
At least that’s slightly better than this: German\h
companies saying we’re better off thanks to China.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,640
In what world could that possibly be true?

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,640
But with the US presidential\h
election outcome still...in\h\h

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,880
progress, many US elites are hoping that\h
Biden wins...and that Biden would reset US\h\h

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
China relations to what they were\h
before the Trump Administration.\h

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Which is why the specter of Henry Kissinger\h\h

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,840
has risen once again, calling on Biden\h
to restore relationships with China.

60
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,360
I mean, if the state-run People’s\h
Daily is praising Kissenger,\h\h

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
his ideas must be great! For\h
the Chinese Communist Party.

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Kissinger made his remarks at\h
the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.\h

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Fun fact, you can join the conversation\h
on the New Economy Forum using WeChat,\h\h

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,560
a Chinese mobile app that the US government\h
has called a national security threat!

65
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,840
Anyway, Henry Kissinger said,\h
unless China and the US can\h\h

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,360
cooperate, “The world will slide into a\h
catastrophe comparable to World War I.”

67
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Which...is insane. America’s engagement with\h
and investment in China are precisely what have\h\h

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,120
enabled China to fund its militarization—which\h
at this point, could lead to World War III.

69
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,880
And who was it starting in the 1970s that kept\h
pushing for closer US-China engagement? Hmmm...

70
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,080
Hey, if there’s another World War, I\h
wonder which side Germany would be on.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
This week was the one year anniversary of when\h\h

72
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,520
Hong Kong police laid siege to the\h
Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\h\h

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,640
Police were trying to arrest hundreds of\h
protesters who got trapped inside the University.

74
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
The police greeted unarmed\h
protesters with brutal force.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
And they turned the school into a war-zone.

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,960
At one point, protesters had\h
to rappel out of the campus\h\h

77
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
to be picked up by volunteers on motorbikes.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
Just one more reason why school can\h
be a dangerous place for young people.

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,440
The Chinese regime’s crackdown on Hong Kong is a\h
stern warning about what might happen in Taiwan\h\h

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,320
if the Chinese Communist Party seized power there.\h\h

81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,640
And a growing US-Taiwan alliance is making\h
such a scenario less and less likely.

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,720
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\h
made the unprecedented move\h\h

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
to come out and say Taiwan is not part of China.

84
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,320
China responded by warning of\h
action, whatever that means.

85
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,120
Only Henry Kissinger can save us!

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,240
But there is some good news for relations between\h
China and the UK at least. A British diplomat\h\h

87
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,800
saved a Chinese college student from drowning.\h
This is British consul-general in Chongqing\h\h

88
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,880
Stephen Ellison, jumping into the water to save\h
the woman. Someone throws in a floatation device,\h\h

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,960
and then Ellison swims her to that, and they’re\h
both safely pulled out of the water. The woman\h\h

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,160
later recovered. This video went viral in China,\h
and the 61 year old is being hailed a hero.

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,800
Unfortunately, all that goodwill between\h
China and the West has since been wiped out,\h\h

92
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,520
after Beyond Meat launched their\h
plant-based minced pork in China.

93
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,600
Not going to end well.

94
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,920
And this episode has been sponsored\h
by Surfshark. Whenever you go online,\h\h

95
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,080
you should be using a VPN like\h
Surfshark to protect your identity.

96
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,320
Because governments and your internet\h
service provider may be watching you.

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,920
And while protecting your identity online is\h
important, there’s also another advantage to\h\h

98
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,600
using a VPN: You can access websites that\h
are only available in other countries.

99
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,520
For example, let’s say you want to watch a\h
movie about giant jaegers. Like Pacfic Rim.

100
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
But you can’t access Pacific\h
Rim on Netflix in the US.\h\h

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,480
So, use Surfshark to switch your location\h
to Canada...log in again...and there it is.\h

102
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,040
Of course, these giant robots are\h
just futuristic science fiction.\h\h

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Which is why Pacific Rim\h
was set in the year...2020?!

104
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,920
I’m not sure whether I’d\h
want that this year or not.\h\h

105
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,920
Probably not, if it comes with an attack on\h
all of humanity by inter-dimensional monsters.

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Anyway, if for some reason you\h
don’t want to watch Pacific Rim,\h\h

107
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,400
there’s tons of other movies and\h
TV shows that you can only watch\h\h

108
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,760
if you’re logged into Netflix in another\h
country...by using a VPN like Surfshark.
