1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,819
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,040
China’s is building a dystopian future

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,340
straight out of 1984.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,029
I hope their handcuffs

5
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,930
look like hot pink leg warmers.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,269
Chinese troops are amassing

7
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:12,559
at the border near India.

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,089
I assume they’re in line for that new

9
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,240
take-out curry place.

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
And finally,

11
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,560
Agent Smith goes to Washington.

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,520
This is China Uncensored.

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,820
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,630
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,650
1984.

16
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,810
Brave New World.

17
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,020
Fahrenheit 451.

18
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,039
Grim dystopian visions of a future gone wrong.

19
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,399
But if you’re the Chinese Communist Party,

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,850
it's just really research material.

21
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,190
Remember renowned science fiction author

22
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,950
Philip K Dick’s short story,

23
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,180
The Minority Report?

24
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,719
Okay, remember the Tom Cruise summer

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,239
blockbuster movie Minority Report?

26
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,850
Crime is predicted before it happens.

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,879
And nothing goes wrong.

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,149
Well now the Chinese regime

29
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,860
wants to try its hand at precog justice.

30
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,820
Chinese companies are developing facial recognition
software

31
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,980
that analyzes hair color, facial dimensions,

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,540
and skin color to predict criminal behavior.

33
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,410
Well they don’t need computers to do that.

34
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,940
They could just ask my racist Uncle Ted.

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,810
What’s that, Shelley?

36
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,500
Oh, they’re just analyzing those things

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,600
to identify individuals.

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
And then they’re going to use it to predict
crimes.

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
That’s still terrible.

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,060
I mean, the Chinese Communist Party

41
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,020
has already been doing a pretty good job

42
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,180
of arresting people who haven’t committed
any crimes.

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
But with this technology,

44
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,850
they’ll be able to arrest people

45
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,550
before they haven’t committed any crimes.

46
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,960
China has also been setting up

47
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,470
a “nationwide ‘social credit’ system

48
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,090
that will rate every Chinese citizen

49
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,570
by collecting big data on financial,

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,460
legal or social misdeeds.”

51
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,710
And almost 7 million people

52
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,280
have already been punished.

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,360
If only they had that facial recognition software
earlier

54
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,390
they could have punished those 7 million people

55
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,670
a long time ago!

56
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,860
According to the Supreme People’s Court,

57
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,280
they were guilty of not repaying their debts.

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,400
Now, they’re banned from flying

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,720
or taking high speed rail.

60
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,230
And if they happen to live in Jiangsu Province,

61
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,780
they might get this added bonus.

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,079
If they owe the local court money,

63
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,239
everyone who calls them will get a message

64
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,940
that they owe money.

65
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,760
That’s ridiculous!

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,709
Don’t they know about WeChat?

67
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,859
Who actually calls people these days?

68
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,569
And speaking of our hand-held computing devices,

69
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,170
aka, mobile phones,

70
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,830
Big Brother is always watching.

71
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,909
Especially if you’re in Xinjiang in western
China.

72
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,540
The residents of Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi

73
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,340
are being forced to install a surveillance
app

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,830
on their mobile phones.

75
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,319
The app is called…

76
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,810
Web Cleansing.

77
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,769
Making our internet clean of any harmful information.

78
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,189
The app is designed to track everyone

79
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,380
all the time,

80
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,439
and make sure they’re not involved

81
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,599
in dangerous activities.

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,370
Like visiting dangerous websites

83
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,830
or having religious beliefs.

84
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,639
And if you don’t install the app voluntarily,

85
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,989
police officers at checkpoints may stop you

86
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,680
and force you to install it voluntarily.

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Speaking of religious beliefs,

88
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,810
don’t get any ideas

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,870
if you’re a Communist Party member.

90
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,260
Because China’s top religious affairs regulator,

91
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,870
yes, that’s a thing in China,

92
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,450
says that if you want to be in the Communist
Party,

93
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,239
you have to give up your religion

94
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,480
or face punishment.

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
Of course,

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,900
you’re not forced to join the Communist
Party.

97
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,129
But if you want to practice religion in China,

98
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,859
you are forced to belong to a state-run church
or temple,

99
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,829
which is under the authority of the Communist
Party.

100
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:48,829
Unless of course,

101
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,999
you join the Communist Party,

102
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,999
in which case

103
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,669
you just directly belong to the Communist
Party.

104
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,640
But hey, maybe you’re concerned

105
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,739
the Chinese regime’s dystopian policies

106
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,609
aren’t reaching far enough.

107
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:01,040
Well don’t worry,

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,430
because they’re about to reach

109
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,360
just a bit farther.

110
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,629
The Hong Kong government,

111
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,709
under totally no pressure from Beijing,

112
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,570
has decided to lease part of a new

113
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,840
high-speed rail station in Hong Kong

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,450
to mainland China.

115
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,450
This way,

116
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,260
Chinese police can enforce Big Brother’s
laws

117
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,610
inside Hong Kong.

118
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,410
Pro-democracy lawmakers have expressed

119
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,810
concern about it,

120
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,450
but as I reported last week,

121
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,350
enough of them have already been purged

122
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,920
so that pro-Beijing lawmakers

123
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,720
can do pretty much whatever they want.

124
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,630
And to ensure that Chinese people can watch

125
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,020
the latest dystopian hits,

126
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,600
China has built a new movie theater.

127
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,830
Right here on an artificial island

128
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,920
China built in the disputed waters

129
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,230
of the South China Sea.

130
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,230
Because everyone knows

131
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,280
when you’ve built a movie theater,

132
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,140
that means you’ve won the territorial dispute.

133
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,170
But don’t worry,

134
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,590
moviegoers will be able to

135
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,680
eat their popcorn in peace,

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,590
because this island is defended by female
soldiers

137
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,520
known as “The Fighting Sunflowers.”

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,610
Oh wait, my mistake,

139
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,740
they’re actually called,

140
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,590
“The Most Beautiful Sunflowers.”

141
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,770
Here they are,

142
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,960
striking fear into the hearts of China’s
enemies,

143
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,690
with their...accordions.

144
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,940
I’m sure Vietnam is now running scared.

145
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,680
Moving on to more serious matters,

146
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,770
as we mentioned a few weeks ago,

147
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,240
the Chinese regime is in Djibouti.

148
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,420
That’s where they’re building China’s

149
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,920
first overseas military base.

150
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,060
Their Djibouti base is so big,

151
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,780
you can see it from space.

152
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,490
It’s even bigger than we expected.

153
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,870
These satellite photos from Stratfor

154
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,670
show they’ve been literally drilling into
Djibouti

155
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,440
to expand their military base underground.

156
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,750
Speaking of the Chinese military,

157
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,150
closer to home they seem to be preparing for...

158
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,650
whatever it is that’s going to go down in
North Korea.

159
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,730
They’ve been, “establishing a new border
defense brigade,

160
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,280
24-hour video surveillance of the mountainous
frontier

161
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,270
backed by aerial drones,

162
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,050
and bunkers to protect against nuclear

163
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,480
and chemical blasts .”

164
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,610
There’ve also been reports about

165
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,700
amassing troops along the border.

166
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,080
US officials have said military action

167
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,810
is on the table to deal with the North Korean
regime,

168
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,850
and North Korea just said

169
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,820
if the US tries anything,

170
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,320
this time they really will launch a nuclear
strike

171
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
at the US.

172
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
For reals.

173
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,740
Yes, they will, quote,

174
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,500
“strike a merciless blow at the heart of
the US

175
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,860
with our powerful nuclear hammer.”

176
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,000
But the joke’s on Kim Jong-un.

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,630
You’ll never destroy down the real America!

178
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,390
We have hundreds of Cracker Barrels!

179
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,980
And finally, China has banned Justin Bieber

180
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,280
for inappropriate behavior.

181
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,150
Although the Chinese regime gave no specifics,

182
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,850
it can safely be said that this

183
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,740
makes up for anything the Communist Party

184
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,600
ever did or will do.

185
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,590
OK, not everything.

186
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,840
But maybe—I don’t know—

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,400
the Anti-Rightist Movement.

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,520

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,820
And neither side wants to back down.

192
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,720
I’m sure everything will be fine.

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,780
For the media.
