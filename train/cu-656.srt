00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,980
In communist China,

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,509
nothing says overthrowing the bourgeois capitalist
class

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,389
like Mao Zedong.

5
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:12,599
And nothing says celebrating the bourgeois
capitalist class like...

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,910
Mao Zedong?!

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,120
Wait...why is Mao on all the Chinese money?

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,540
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,370
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,910
In the rich tapestry of world history,

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,490
the most successful dictator was almost certainly
China’s Mao Zedong.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,949
At least in terms of killing people.

13
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,649
But he’s also the most successful dictator

14
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:38,170
at still being widely celebrated,

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,649
despite killing tens of millions of innocent
people.

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,190
He’s got giant statues... he’s in rural
homes...

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,589
and of course he’s still above Tiananmen
square.

18
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,149
And Mao is also on all the Chinese money.

19
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,260
Domination of every denomination.

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,479
Which is a shame.

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,479
Because in America,

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,019
if you’re All About the Benjamins,

23
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,059
you’re clearly ballin’ it like Puff Daddy.

24
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,159
But in China, you could be All About the Maos
and still be this guy.

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,490
So why have only Mao on the money, instead
of, for example,

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,350
other Chinese leaders who’ve killed somewhat
fewer people?

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,490
Or instead of, well, anything else?

28
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,810
Well, it turns out, Mao wasn’t always on
the Chinese money—

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,619
even during the era of his absolute dictatorship.

30
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,829
The official name of the Chinese dollar, or
yuan, is “Renminbi”.

31
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,250
It means “the people’s money.”

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,460
And in the early days, the banknotes reflected
that.

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,140
This 50 yuan note from 1980 shows the three
classes:

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,890
The intellectual, the farmer, and the industrial
worker.

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,780
There was no capitalist class in China 40
years ago.

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,659
Mao had killed them all.

37
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,840
In fact, there’s a joke in China about

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,920
how the banknotes reflect inflation.

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,759
They say that in the 1950s,

40
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,659
5 yuan is enough to buy food for a large group
of people.

41
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,659
In the 60s,

42
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:03,289
10 yuan is enough to buy food for half a dozen
people.

43
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,420
In the 90s,

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,329
100 yuan could still buy food for four people,

45
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,340
but nowadays 100 yuan is only enough to feed
one person.

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,220
100 yuan is about 15 US dollars.

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,250
But Chinese officials didn’t switch to a
purely Mao-based currency

48
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,370
just to perpetuate a mildly amusing joke.

49
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,640
They had another reason: to stop counterfeiting.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,300
It used to be fairly easy to counterfeit notes.

51
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,980
You could draw the peasants wrong,

52
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,800
and no one would be able to tell the difference.

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,030
But everyone knows what Mao looks like—

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,510
since his portrait is everywhere.

55
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,780
So it’s much harder to counterfeit now.

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,630
That’s not to say counterfeiting is not
still a problem.

57
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,680
It is.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,049
In 2014, officials seized more than half a
billion dollars

59
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,319
in counterfeit currency across the country.

60
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,640
And in 2013,

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,560
police arrested an elderly painter in Guangzhou
province.

62
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,330
This one guy had apparently drawn the templates

63
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,580
for 97 percent of all the fake banknotes.

64
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,680
And look, I know it’s wrong to counterfeit
money.

65
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,769
But some kid out there can legitimately say
he has

66
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,140
the coolest grandpa in China.

67
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,849
In fact, a lot of grandpa’s counterfeit
notes

68
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,250
are still floating around today.

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,000
In this article from 2017,

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,519
a Canadian tourist says he got counterfeit
cash

71
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,489
mixed in with real cash when he withdrew money

72
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,220
from an bank ATM in Beijing.

73
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,950
Which I suppose also says something about

74
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,560
how much you can trust Chinese banks.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,890
You know what they say:

76
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,560
Mao money, Mao problems.

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,200
To combat this, in 2015,

78
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,879
authorities released a new version of the
100 yuan note,

79
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,629
with features like color-changing ink.

80
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,819
But all of them have one thing in common:

81
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,209
Mao Zedong is still on one side of every Chinese
banknote—

82
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,329
even though Mao was a dictator who killed
tens of millions of people,

83
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,170
including the parents and grandparents of
a lot of the people

84
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,190
living in China today.

85
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,459
So why not instead have Xi Jinping?

86
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,239
Or something else, like...a happy flower?

87
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,250
Well, because once you put the Great Helmsman
on the currency,

88
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,860
it’s politically impossible to take him
off.

89
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,220
If they did, it would be like going against
what Mao stood for.

90
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,040
And I know, the modern Chinese economy already
goes against

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,100
everything Mao stood for.

92
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,020
But you’re supposed to pretend like Mao’s
theories

93
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,130
are still totally relevant.

94
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,360
And for Chinese leader Xi Jinping—

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,340
who’s already already being accused of grabbing
too much power—

96
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,560
it would be a major political mistake to try
to replace Mao on the money.

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,580
But you know, it’s not entirely a bad thing.

98
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,740
Because having Mao on all the banknotes is
a subtle reminder

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,260
that China’s currency is backed not by gold,

100
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,560
or by centuries of government stability,

101
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,740
but instead by the whims of a dictator.

102
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,210
And what’s a currency backed by a murderous
regime really worth?

103
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,770
And now it’s time for another fan question
from one of the folks

104
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,750
who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

105
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,010
Larry Ong Wei Zhong asks,

106
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,940
“What is the sound of one hand clapping?”

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,680
That’s actually a very deep question.

108
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,660
What is one half of a thing without the whole?

109
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,030
Can there be Yin without Yang?

110
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,490
Could China Uncensored exist without the Communist
Party?

111
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,630
It’s profound.

112
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,460
What is the sound of one hand clapping?

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,040
It’s not rocket surgery, Larry.

114
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,410
And what do the rest of you think?

115
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,220
Leave your comments below.

116
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,560
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,700
