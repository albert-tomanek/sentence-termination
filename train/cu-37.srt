1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:04,060
The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,660
Are just one year away.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:16,200
And there will be no problems whatsoever.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,760
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,310
It’s 2021, and the Olympic Games are almost
upon us!

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,960
No, I’m not talking about the 2020 summer
olympics in Tokyo that were postponed to 2021

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,230
because of Covid.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,900
And which Japanese people are mostly opposed
to holding at all now—because of Covid.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,340
No, I’m talking about the much anticipated
2022 Olympics in Beijing!

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,660
Yes, the Winter Olympics—the forgotten stepchild
of the good Olympics.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,440
This month marks one year out from the Beijing
2022 Winter Olympics.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,460
And according to Chinese state-run media,
it’s just received a vote of confidence!

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,100
Which is the only vote that’s allowed in
China.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,830
Now, sure there have been some problems.

16
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,720
Like how the mountains near Beijing don’t...have...snow.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,750
But that’s only a minor problem for Beijing—according
to this state-run media video.

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,900
"The National Alpine Skiing Center has been
built at an altitude of 2,198 meters with

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,850
great efforts."

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,530
Wait, go back.

21
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,409
See?

22
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:42,360
You can just cover your bare mountain slopes
in artificial snow, and no one will be the

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,540
wiser.

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,409
And that’s definitely not a metaphor for
anything else that happens in communist China.

25
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,420
It’s like how ahead of the 2008 Olympics,
they spray painted the grass green.

26
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,600
At least there was grass there in the first
place.\h

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:04,409
So I say, why bother to even make fake snow
for 2022—when you can just spray paint the

28
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,409
rocks white!

29
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,700
This way you can have the Winter Olympics
and the X Games all in one!

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,209
Of course, there’s one other pesky little
problem with the 2022 Winter Olympics: A lot

31
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,870
of human rights groups want to boycott it.

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,900
As Hong Kong Free Press put it last week,
“China will host the first genocide Olympics”.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,450
Which, I don’t think is fair.

34
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,040
It’s actually the second Genocide Olympics.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,400
The first one was when Beijing held the Olympics
in 2008.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,340
But at least Beijing will be the first city
in the world to host both a Summer and Winter

37
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,560
Genocide Olympics.

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,549
Truly historic.\h

39
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:48,909
And for all those who are concerned, don’t
worry: There won’t be any genocide happening

40
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,840
*at* the Olympics.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,010
It will be happening at the *same time* as
the Olympics, but in a totally different part

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,010
of China.

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,909
Where we can all ignore it while talking about
how impressive the opening ceremony is.

44
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,779
Nonetheless, the calls for a boycott are growing.\h

45
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:13,099
Last week, a group of UK Members of Parliament
from across the political spectrum called

46
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,060
for a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.

47
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:24,269
As MP Ed Davey put it, “Our brightest and
best athletes should not be forced to be part

48
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:30,529
of a propaganda exercise for the Chinese Communist
party while it tries to wipe the Uighur people

49
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,279
off the face of the planet.”

50
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:38,299
They’re calling for British athletes to
simply not participate, unless the 2022 Olympics

51
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,699
is moved to another country that doesn’t
have these kinds of human rights abuses.

52
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:46,909
I know, it’s hard to move the Olympics only
one year out.

53
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,590
But there *are* other cities that already
have all the infrastructure for the Winter

54
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,609
Olympics...and totally different kinds of
human rights abuses.

55
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,439
See, the ones in Russia were the Gulag Games.

56
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,510
I hope you realize by now that no matter how
bad human right abuses get, the International

57
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,249
Olympics Committee really doesn’t give a
hoot.

58
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:13,920
Because as the former head of the IOC once
said, “we stand for human rights...but we

59
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,289
are only a sports organization.”

60
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:22,430
That’s from the same 2007 interview where
he said he believed the upcoming 2008 Beijing

61
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,400
Olympic Games would “be a force for good.”

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,770
How’d that turn out?

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:41,030
Anyway, there are still calls for a boycott
of the Beijing 2022 Olympics.

64
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,960
And the Chinese Communist Party wants you
to know, they don’t care.

65
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,330
As my favorite state-run media The Global
Times says, the forces inciting a boycott

66
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,790
of the Winter Olympics will never succeed.

67
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,580
Because their “extreme claims...will never
be widely echoed”.

68
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,920
And to prove how little China cares, they
will ‘seriously sanction’ any country

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,389
that boycotts the Winter Olympics.\h

70
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,020
This also shows that China opposes politicizing
the Beijing Winter Olympics.

71
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,710
To be clear, it’s other countries’ boycotts
that are politicizing things, not China’s

72
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,699
revenge sanctions.

73
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,289
Those are not political.

74
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:25,110
Now I’m not saying these threats haven’t
worked to stop the boycotts.

75
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,699
But they also haven’t not worked.

76
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,470
“The US has said it had no intention of
telling its athletes not to go.”

77
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,470
Yeah.

78
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,189
Sometimes you just gotta cooperate with China,
despite the genocide.

79
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:42,460
And Canada has taken it one step further.

80
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,240
The Canadian Olympic Committee is warning
its athletes not to even criticize China.

81
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,810
Which, sadly, might be good advice—if those
athletes want to be allowed to leave China.

82
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,750
Unlike all the Canadians that have been detained
there.

83
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,830
There were calls for boycotts of the 2008
Beijing Olympics, too.

84
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,889
But in the end, no countries boycotted.

85
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:12,319
But even without an Olympic boycott, people
around the world found ways to highlight China’s

86
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,310
human rights abuses.\h

87
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,090
Like when Beijing had the brilliant idea to
bring their Olympic torch relay around the

88
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,220
world.

89
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,509
And then people protested it.

90
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,960
At every...

91
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Stop...

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
Along...

93
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
The...

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Way.

95
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,379
It was pretty embarrassing for the Chinese
Communist Party, what with people around the

96
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,280
world airing their dirty laundry.

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,409
But despite, or perhaps because of, the global
embarrassment, the Chinese Communist Party

98
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,880
promised to allow protests during the Olympics.

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,569
They even set up special zones inside three
Beijing parks, where people would be allowed

100
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,139
to protest.

101
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:56,610
All protesters had to do first was “obtain
permits from the local police”.

102
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,349
And you can guess how that worked out: really
well!

103
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:02,159
For the police.

104
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,919
Who just arrested protesters ahead of time.

105
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,810
Pre-crime—I’m telling you—it works.

106
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,720
So now that we’ve learned from the 2008
Beijing Olympics, will anything change for

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,169
the 2022 Beijing Olympics?\h

108
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,759
Although there is more awareness globally
about the Chinese Communist Party’s human

109
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,400
right abuses, and their attempt to influence
the rest of the world, it’s still unlikely

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,169
there will be an Olympics boycott.\h

111
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:35,389
Historically, there have been two major boycotts
of Olympic games.

112
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:42,020
During the Cold War, the US, Canada, and more
than 60 countries boycotted the 1980 Moscow

113
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Olympics.

114
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,539
The US boycotted because of the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.

115
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:54,300
In return, the Soviet Union and a group of
mostly communist countries boycotted the 1984

116
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,509
Los Angeles Olympics.

117
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:02,150
And since the US has said it has no plans
to boycott the Beijing Olympics, it’s unlikely

118
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,279
other countries will.

119
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,150
However, now some human rights groups are
calling for a different type of boycott—a

120
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,580
diplomatic boycott.

121
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,129
That means that countries would let their
athletes compete in the Olympics, but they

122
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,990
wouldn’t send a high-level official to attend.

123
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,199
That way, they take away some of the soft
power that the Chinese Communist Party gets

124
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,509
from hosting the event.

125
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,360
Will any countries do that?

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,099
It’s still too soon to say.\h

127
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,469
So despite all the protests ahead of the 2022
Olympics...

128
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:41,570
It looks like the 2022 Beijing Games are going
to go ahead as planned.

129
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,200
Snow or no snow.

130
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,230
And I think this is a terrible mistake.

131
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,200
Because what *should* happen, is the Chinese
Communist Party should *welcome* other countries

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,550
to boycott the Olympics.

133
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,660
Especially all the countries with the best
athletes.

134
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,800
Because then, China can win all the gold medals
for themselves.

135
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,649
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you, a viewer who directly supports

136
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,240
China Uncensored by contributing a dollar
or more per episode on the crowdfunding website

137
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,870
Patreon.

138
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,300
Casey asks:
“Are coin collectors unintentionally rewarding

139
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,760
the CCP by purchasing gold and silver panda
coins?’

140
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,050
I think the real question, Casey, is why would
anyone want to collect a panda-anything?

141
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,360
Pandas are the very symbol of Beijing’s
propaganda.

142
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,580
“Oh, we’re so cute, look at us.

143
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,920
The Communist Party is so soft and cuddly.

144
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,040
We could never forcibly harvest your organs.”

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
No!

146
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
It’s a lie!

147
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,160
Don’t fall for it!

148
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,360
Argh, stop!

149
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,950
So yes, don’t buy China’s stupid panda
coins.\h

150
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,810
Also, if you buy a gold coin from China, would
you really trust that it’s made entirely

151
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,150
of real gold?

152
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,300
Thanks for your question, Casey.
