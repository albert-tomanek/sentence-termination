00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,330
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,410
Suave.

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,490
Cultured.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,120
International man of mystery.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,090
No, I'm not talking about Bond,

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,130
James Bond.

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,610
Meet Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui.

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,360
Also known as Miles Kwok.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,250
Ok, I know that image looks like something

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,660
we did to make fun of him.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,100
But just to be clear,

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,220
Guo photoshopped his own face

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,260
onto Daniel Craig's body,

15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,770
and then posted it on Twitter.

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,800
I am not making this up.

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
So at first glance,

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,540
Guo seems like your average Twitter bro.

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,150
Posting thirsty workout selfies,

20
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,890
taking vertical video of his small dog,

21
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,460
thanking his social media followers

22
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,920
with a tragic overuse of both the raised fist

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
and the prayer hands emojis.

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,140
Yes, Guo Wengui is truly #blessed.

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,250
He lives in a 67-million-dollar apartment
in Manhattan.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,250
Which I assume means

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,559
it has at least two full-size closets.

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,540
He’s a member of the exclusive Mark’s
Club

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,200
in London’s prestigious Mayfair district.

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,340
He’s also a member of Donald Trump’s

31
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,939
exclusive Mar-a-Lago club

32
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,189
in America’s prestigious...

33
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:17,189
Florida.

34
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,369
Guo Wengui originally made his money

35
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:20,640
in real estate.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,469
He fled China in 2015

37
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:24,731
after his relationship with Chinese Communist
Party

38
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,520
officials soured.

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,729
He kept a pretty low profile

40
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:30,510
until he resurfaced in March this year.

41
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,750
Then he began giving out lengthy interviews

42
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,250
to Chinese media,

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,859
telling fantastical stories of corruption

44
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:39,939
in the highest ranks of the Chinese Communist
Party,

45
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,170
and making himself out to be

46
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,950
an anti-corruption hero.

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,240
He said he was spilling the beans to,

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,439
“protect my life,

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,619
protect my money,

50
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,759
and get my revenge.”

51
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,899
He also said it gave him an excuse to,

52
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,130
“Photoshop myself in more exciting and dramatic
ways.”

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,470
Guo said that “his information would help
Xi [Jinping]

54
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,710
and Wang [Qishan]’s anti-corruption efforts.”

55
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,710
Whoa.

56
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,710
Xi Jinping?

57
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,609
Wang Qishan?

58
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,609
Anti-Corruption Campaign?

59
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:11,540
I think it’s time for a recap of everyone’s
favorite soap opera

60
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,010
about high-level power struggles

61
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,510
within the Chinese Communist Party.

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,819
Previously on General Hostility...

63
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,060
Current leader Xi Jinping is engaged in a
life-or-death

64
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,209
political struggle with former leader Jiang
Zemin.

65
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,319
Xi has launched a national campaign

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,680
to crack down on corruption.

67
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,860
But his real target is deflated toad, Jiang
Zemin

68
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,400
and his allies.

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,680
But Xi can't do it alone.

70
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,390
Butch Cassidy needed the Sundance Kid.

71
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,489
Winnie the Pooh needed Piglet.

72
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,430
Who will be Xi Jinping’s loyal sidekick,

73
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,209
going in together with hunny pots blazing?

74
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,799
It’s Wang Qishan!

75
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,150
Zoloft “before” picture

76
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,180
and Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption czar.

77
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,640
Together, they’ve punished more than

78
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,099
a million corrupt Party officials.

79
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,690
But the Jiang faction is putting up a fight!

80
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,800
They’re trying to destroy Xi Jinping

81
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,680
and Wang Qishan first.

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,209
Will Xi and Wang take down the evil Jiang

83
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,659
before Jiang destroys them?

84
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,150
Find out after this explanatory break.

85
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,239
Ok.

86
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,610
So billionaire Guo Wengui

87
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,270
said he wanted to help Xi Jinping

88
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,019
and Wang Qishan’s anti-corruption efforts

89
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,160
by exposing corrupt individuals.

90
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,540
He also promised to reveal

91
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,480
more as the months went on.

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,510
As in, not all at once,

93
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,879
but definitely later.

94
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,519
What’s his reason for doling out information
slowly?

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,760
“To let the bullets fly for a little while.”

96
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,610
Ok, you got me.

97
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,540
We photoshopped this one.

98
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,280
Anyway, that’s an odd strategy

99
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,530
if your goal is to, you know,

100
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,299
actually make change in China.

101
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,890
But more on that later.

102
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,060
Guo first got tangled in the anti-corruption
campaign in 2014,

103
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,280
when he accused this guy, Li You,

104
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,409
of insider trading.

105
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:05,769
Thanks in part to Guo’s help,

106
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,720
Li was jailed.

107
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Li You had links

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,140
to former Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin.

109
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,800
So it seems that by exposing Li,

110
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,400
Guo has helped Xi in his battle against Jiang.

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,870
But it turns out,

112
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,490
Li You was Guo’s former business partner-turned-rival.

113
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,920
And this was actually just part of the whole

114
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,190
“get my revenge” thing Guo talked about
earlier.

115
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,160
Chinese politics is like House of Cards.

116
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,620
In fact, Wang Qishan, Xi’s anti-corruption
czar,

117
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,790
is reportedly a big fan of the show.

118
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,830
It’s the only thing that can make him smile.

119
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,690
Wang probably watches it for stress relief.

120
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,080
Look at how relaxing and uncomplicated

121
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,590
American corruption is.

122
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,190
Plus, he can’t resist Frank Underwood’s

123
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,540
Southern Charm.

124
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,480
No one can.

125
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,810
Now as you can imagine,

126
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,130
anyone navigating that environment of political
intrigue

127
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,850
can sometimes say one thing and mean another.

128
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,970
For example,

129
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,500
while it seems that Guo Wengui is supporting
Xi Jinping

130
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,570
and his anti-corruption campaign,

131
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,860
well, Guo has actually secretly been supporting
Jiang Zemin.

132
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,870
Listen to this.

133
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,600
“Over the past 20-30 years,

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,240
without Jiang Zemin,

135
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,980
China couldn’t achieve today’s accomplishments...

136
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,980
In China today,

137
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,010
Jiang Zemin holds 80% of the power.”

138
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,330
What Guo said is not exactly true.

139
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,130
I mean, it is true that without Jiang Zemin,

140
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,300
China couldn’t have achieved certain accomplishments...

141
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,340
like spending billions of dollars to build
labor camps,

142
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,450
and selling the organs of innocent Chinese
people.

143
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,990
But what’s weirder is his

144
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,560
“Jiang holds 80 percent of the power”
statement.

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
If that were true,

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,500
this guy would be China’s leader instead
of Xi Jinping.

147
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,710
Instead, he’s in prison.

148
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,240
But Guo didn’t say that as a fact.

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,920
He said it as a statement of support.

150
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,870
It’s like when you’re listening to the
radio

151
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,110
and you say, “Dude,

152
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,730
that was the best song ever,”

153
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,730
what you really mean is,

154
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,940
I liked that song a lot.

155
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,450
Because the fact is,

156
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,750
the best song ever is

157
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,430
the theme song from Duck Tales.

158
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,490
Oooh oooh!

159
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,560
Anyway, Guo’s comment is one way

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,900
China observers can see how he’s actually

161
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,050
on the side of Jiang Zemin’s political faction.

162
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,640
Now, Guo has of course denied this.

163
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,610
But Guo definitely has close ties

164
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,150
with lots of Jiang’s people.

165
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,190
According to the Epoch Times,

166
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,530
“Guo is close to disgraced spy chief Ma
Jian.”

167
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,120
Ma Jian worked closely with Jiang Zemin’s
faction.

168
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,360
That is, before Ma Jian was arrested

169
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,560
in Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,010
for taking 30 million dollars in bribes.

171
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,010
(source)

172
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,800
And then started squealing on Guo.

173
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,940
So what kind of relationship

174
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,390
does a Chinese billionaire businessman

175
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,330
have with Jiang Zemin’s former spy chief

176
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,630
Ma Jian?

177
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,690
Well, let me tell you a little story

178
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,080
about how business is done in China.

179
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,720
Before Ma Jian was sent to jail,

180
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,880
he helped Guo Wengui obtain an expensive

181
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,600
piece of real estate in Beijing.

182
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,460
This is Pangu Plaza.

183
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,840
Which looks like the inspiration

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,450
for this weird building in F-City.

185
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,990
Anyway, Pangu Plaza has a high-end hotel

186
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,100
and three luxury housing complexes.

187
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100


188
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,280
A single flat will cost you 16 million dollars.

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,680
But in 2006 it was called the Morgan Plaza,

190
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,200
and Guo Wengui wanted to develop it.

191
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,710
Instead, Beijing’s vice mayor at the time,

192
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,340
Liu Zhihua, gave the contract to a friend.

193
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,760
Vice Mayor Liu is such a jerk!

194
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,680
But fortunately for Guo,

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,520
Vice Mayor Liu had a secret mistress in Hong
Kong.

196
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
How do I know this?

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,490
Because Guo Wengui,

198
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,990
“with the help of Ma Jian,”

199
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,880
placed a hidden camera in his room

200
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,460
and caught Liu and his mistress in the act.

201
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,880
They used that tape, a

202
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,540
mong other evidence of corruption,

203
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,340
to get Liu a suspended death sentence,

204
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,540
which usually means life in prison.

205
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,301
Then suddenly Guo’s company

206
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,180
was able to buy Morgan Plaza

207
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,840
and turn it into what it is today.

208
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,420
And Ma Jian was rumored to have been

209
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,120
given one of the condo units.

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,920
So Guo Wengui colluded with China’s spy
chief

211
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,240
to take down Beijing’s vice mayor

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
so he could develop a piece of real estate.

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:35,860
And in a recent Communist Party-style confession,

214
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,639
Dangerous and illegal?

215
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,769
Absolutely.

216
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,669
But also in character for a guy who,

217
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,669
again,

218
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,120
posts this to Twitter.

219
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,250
But anyway,

220
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,459
because of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption
campaign,

221
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,550
Ma Jian is now in jail.

222
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,370
In fact, a lot of people close to Guo Wengui

223
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,060
have been getting hit in the anti-corruption
campaign lately.

224
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,279
And it seems like Xi Jinping

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,759
may be going after Guo himself.

226
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,879
So despite Guo making himself out to be

227
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,709
a hero exposing corrupt officials,

228
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,000
he’s probably not really a supporter

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign.

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,050
In fact, now Guo is going after the key person

231
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,920
he knows can hurt Xi’s anti-corruption campaign
the most:

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,949
anti-corruption czar Wang Qishan.

233
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,250
...who looks like he wants to retire soon.

234
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,040
In fact, he was original supposed to retire
this November,

235
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,019
after the 19th National People’s Congress.

236
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,660
But Xi Jinping wants to keep him right where
he is

237
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,050
for five more years,

238
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,730
so he can keep purging Jiang Zemin

239
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,100
and his toadies.

240
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,029
But Guo wants to make Wang Qishan look corrupt,

241
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,980
so it would become politically impossible
for Xi Jinping

242
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,810
to keep him on as the anti-corruption czar.

243
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,470
And Xi Jinping doesn’t have any replacement

244
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,930
that’s anywhere near as as capable.

245
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,980
So Guo Wengui has launched

246
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,759
a smear campaign at Wang Qishan.

247
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:55,759
Throwing shade on him

248
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,800
with blurry conspiracy-type diagrams on Twitter.

249
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,779
And if that’s too complicated to follow,

250
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,079
he also posted a badly photoshopped image

251
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,300
of Wang as a Joker.

252
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,730
And also as Leonardo Dicaprio on the Titanic.

253
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,050
He’s also been making unsubstantiated claims

254
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,500
that “[Wang’s] extended family has amassed

255
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,009
staggering wealth through a web of companies.”

256
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,389
...which, to be fair,

257
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,760
sounds like every official in China,

258
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,730
Guo has also said an Australian woman

259
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,389
is actually Wang’s illegitimate daughter...

260
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,470
She wasn’t too happy about that, by the
way.

261
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,829
Then Guo goes on a live interview on Voice
of America

262
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:36,550
and starts making more unsubstantiated claims

263
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,170
attacking Wang—

264
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,970
so much so that the host had to eventually
cut him off.

265
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,360
Wang Qishan’s nephew holds shares in Hainan
airlines.

266
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,199
What Guo Wengui said is only from his sources;

267
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,389
we can't verify any of that.

268
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,600
Yao Qing is the key person in Wang and Yao’s
family,

269
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,350
and he is also a shareholder of Hainan airlines;

270
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,830
everyone seems knows this...

271
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,560
We can’t verify any of that information.

272
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,070
They keep threatening my family.

273
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,890
This is why I want to spill Wang’s secrets
directly.

274
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,310
Let’s stop here today.

275
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,720
So Guo Wengui’s goal is to,

276
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,110
on one hand, praise Jiang Zemin.

277
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,139
On the other hand,

278
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,339
create doubts about Wang Qishan.

279
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:20,399
And weaken Wang so much

280
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,770
that Xi can’t keep using him to carry out

281
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,000
his anti-corruption campaign.

282
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,029
And in terms of the anti-corruption campaign,

283
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,370
Xi without Wang is like

284
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,550
Inspector Gadget without Brain.

285
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,139
Pooh without Piglet.

286
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,529
Me without Shelley.

287
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,529
Hey!

288
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,019
Who wrote this?

289
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,019
The point is,

290
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,709
Piglet is a former banker and economist—

291
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:40,709
and let’s say,

292
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,959
probably knows a bit about corruption himself—

293
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,730
and so Piglet is really the only one

294
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,850
who can carry out Pooh’s

295
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,279
anti-corruption campaign effectively.

296
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,490
Plus Piglet already knows where the bodies
are buried.

297
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,430
I believe that was the plot of The House at
Pooh Corner.

298
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,480
Anyway, the anti-corruption campaign

299
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,749
was already gunning for Guo.

300
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,230
And now that he’s shooting his mouth off
everywhere,

301
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,870
several of his associates are being investigated,

302
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,709
the Chinese Foreign Ministry is calling him
a criminal,

303
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,160
and China even got Interpol

304
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,360
to issue a red notice for his arrest.

305
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,629
And that VOA interview we showed above,

306
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,339
was threatened by China’s Foreign Ministry,

307
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,740
which said that it “would disturb

308
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,170
the 19th Communist Party Congress.”

309
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,279
Which matches up with worries

310
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,629
that Xi wouldn’t be able to keep Wang on

311
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:26,910
after the congress.

312
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,410
Now I’m not saying Wang Qishan (or his family)

313
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,410
isn’t corrupt.

314
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,999
Much of what Guo says is impossible to verify.

315
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,199
I’m just saying that when Guo Wengui

316
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,730
says things to undermine Wang, well,

317
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,190
that’s just Guo Wengui playing House of
Cards.

318
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,100
And Guo’s cards are definitely in Jiang’s
deck.

319
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,280
But we’ll have to wait for the Party Congress

320
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,330
in November this year to really know

321
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,800
if Guo has been successful or not.

322
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,329
So to sum this up....

323
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,430
Last time on General Hostility,

324
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,779
Rich jetsetter and workout enthusiast

325
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,069
Guo Wengui is the talk of the town.

326
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,930
But the closets of his million-dollar apartment

327
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,360
overlooking Central Park

328
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,899
are full of secrets.

329
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,399
Guo has a shady past with former spy chief

330
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,990
and current prison confessor, Ma Jian.

331
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,500
And both are connected with Xi Jinping’s

332
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,750
fake evil twin, Jiang Zemin.

333
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,009
As part of Jiang’s sneaky plan

334
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,309
to stop Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign,

335
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:35,329
Guo has set his sights on Xi’s sad sidekick,

336
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:36,970
Wang Qishan.

337
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,089
Will Guo get away with impugning Wang’s
honor?

338
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,540
Will Xi be forced to betray his loyal ally?

339
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,949
Find out next time, on General Hostility.

340
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:50,670
So will our self-styled James Bond succeed?

341
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,329
Or have we been watching another movie all
along?

342
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,670
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

343
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,129
As you may have noticed,

344
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,360
this is our first full-length TV episode.

345
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,370
The vast majority of the funding for this
comes from you,

346
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,490
my 50-Cent Army,

347
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,559
who supports China Uncensored by contributing
to us directly

348
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,019
via our website on Patreon.

349
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,019
And someday soon,

350
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,370
we’re going to tape in front of a live audience.

351
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,459
I hope to see you there.

352
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:17,459
But to do that,

353
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,860
we need to your continued support,

354
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,689
and some new support.

355
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,709
Please click the link below to visit Patreon,

356

where you can contribute, for example,

357
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,269
a dollar per episode.

358
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:28,970
The future of this show relies on support

359
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,019
from thousands of individuals.

360
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,680
Unless we can get sponsorship from Guo Wengui...

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,589
and I think our chances for that are pretty
much shot.

362
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:38,959
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

363
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,040
See you next time.

364
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,339
Hello? Guo Wengui?

365
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,610
You loved the episode?

366
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,560
Oh, you were being sarcastic.

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,519
But, hey, did you know,

368
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,180
if you went to China Uncensored dot tv,

369
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,579
you could have seen this full-length episode,

370
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,660
with other segments and a devastating

371
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,110
amount of jokes, last week?

372
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,360
Yes, yes that’s right.

373
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,240
Okay, I’ll see you at Mar-a-lago.
