1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,830
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,989
why buy an iPhone

3
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:04,720
when you can buy a Big Cola...

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,120
phone?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, welcome to the one and only

6
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,019
China Uncensored.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,080
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,270
I know a thing or two about knockoffs.

9
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,270
You know,

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,410
things that look like the original,

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,460
but maybe aren't exactly the same?

12
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,720
But pretty close.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,700
It’s true though that

14
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,850
when it comes to knockoffs,

15
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,650
China is the undisputed king.

16
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,359
And it’s largely thanks to

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,439
loose intellectual property laws,

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,620
and well, people generally not caring about

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,670
the laws that are in place.

20
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,780
Plus a Chinese court system

21
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,300
that usually rules in favor

22
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,880
of homegrown Chinese companies.

23
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
Take the iPhone.

24
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,660
Um, no, not that iPhone.

25
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,910
That’s a Chinese leather goods maker

26
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,870
that beat Apple to the iPhone trademark in
China.

27
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,670
I’m talking about the never-ending stream

28
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,629
of cellular hand held devices

29
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,000
that look suspiciously like Apple’s iPhone.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,050
Here are my top 5.

31
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,050
Number 5

32
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,840
Oppo China style

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,380
This is the Oppo.

34
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,670
A quick glance at their website

35
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,670
makes it pretty clear

36
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,880
where they get their inspiration.

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,670
“But they slightly changed the shape

38
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,000
of the home button,” you say.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,960
Yes, but these phones—

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,040
the F3 and F3 Plus—

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,490
otherwise look pretty much

42
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,200
exactly like iPhones.

43
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,740
They even follow Apple’s color options.

44
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,909
But after F3,

45
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,380
the numbering gets weird.

46
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,580
There’s the A77,

47
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,400
the R9s Plus,

48
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,630
the A39,

49
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,780
the N3, the N1 Mini,

50
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,590
and the awkwardly named, Find 7a.

51
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,100
“Hey Siri, find Find 7a.”

52
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,210
Number 4

53
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,020
Big Cola

54
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,219
People in China love the iPhone.

55
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,219
Just look at the lines

56
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,400
for the release of the iPhone

57
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,090
a few years ago.

58
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,090
The problem is,

59
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,860
most people in China are actually really poor.

60
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,750
78% of people there

61
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,909
make less than 10 dollars a day,

62
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,259
according to the Pew Research Center.

63
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,719
And considering the iPhone 7 and 7 plus

64
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,430
both go for around 1,000 US dollars in China,

65
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,430
you can see how there might be

66
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,330
a bit of a disconnect.

67
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,320
That’s where Big Cola,

68
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,470
or DaKeLe comes in.

69
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,500
It was specifically designed to be

70
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,290
a cheap iPhone knockoff—

71
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,390
less than half the price.

72
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,640
And you can also get a two-liter version free

73
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,700
if you order two large one-topping pizzas

74
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,910
from Pizza Hut.

75
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,220
Now that's a deal!

76
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,550
In fact, a few years ago,

77
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,690
the Big Cola was even hailed as

78
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,210
the best iPhone knockoff.

79
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,030
Yes, this was a whole industry in China.

80
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,770
But the company folded.

81
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,770
What happened?

82
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,990
Did people start buying the real thing?

83
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,990
No.

84
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,900
Other, larger Chinese companies

85
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,160
with dubious ties to the government

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,390
decided to get in on the fake iPhone game

87
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,860
and dominated the market.

88
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,090
And that brings us to...

89
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,090
Number 3

90
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,670
A super Nova

91
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,800
You see, what DaKeLe really was lacking

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,910
was big name celebrity endorsement

93
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,000
that only a mega telecommunications giant
like Huawei

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,290
could reel in.

95
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,740
Sure, it’s an iPhone knockoff,

96
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,370
but it’s endorsed by Chinese heartthrob
singer,

97
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,360
Zhang Yixing.

98
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,580
And it’s not just the nova.

99
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,060
The Huawei P10 is also basically

100
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,870
an iPhone clone.

101
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,870
Now sure,

102
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,870
having a Huawei device

103
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,970
may have its downsides.

104
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,410
The US government thinks that Huawei

105
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,060
has “undisclosed connections

106
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,760
with the Chinese government,”

107
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,070
and “Huawei equipment could surreptitiously
harbor

108
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,980
software to facilitate cyberwarfare,

109
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,440
including espionage or network disruption.”

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,100
But don’t worry,

111
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,580
they were talking about Huawei’s telecommunications
equipment,

112
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,420
not their phones, which I'm sure are fine.

113
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Number 2

114
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,320
The iPhone?

115
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,980
Wait, is this an actual iPhone?

116
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,220
It says iPhone.

117
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,350
It has the Apple logo on it.

118
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,790
But as those of you read Chinese can see—

119
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,110
it’s not an iPhone.

120
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,580
It’s “the Best iPhone 7 Plus knockoff.”

121
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,580
You see,

122
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,580
this isn’t a brand.

123
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Their motto is:

124
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,750
“We're the leader in high quality iPhone

125
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,620
and Samsung knockoffs.”

126
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,700
And they nailed it.

127
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,590
Right down to the iPhone 7’s

128
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,190
missing headphone jack,
making this knockoff

129
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,150
just as terrible as the original.

130
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,430
I mean, no headphone jack?!

131
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,280
What were they thinking?!!!

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,870
And finally,

133
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,860
Number 1

134
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,900
Will the real smartphone

135
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,000
please stand up?

136
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,020
Okay, now this one barely looks like the iPhone.

137
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,760
And yet, the Baili 100C accused the iPhone

138
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,450
of stealing its design.

139
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,810
That’s right,

140
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,870
a Chinese smartphone maker so small,

141
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,220
it didn’t even have a website,

142
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,020
sued Apple in a Beijing court

143
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,810
for stealing that classic Baili 100C look.

144
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,180
Irony is dead.

145
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
And of course,

146
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,360
the Beijing Intellectual Property Office

147
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,720
ruled in favor of the Chinese company.

148
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,040
They said, “Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone
6 Plus

149
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,330
have minor differences from Baili’s 100C.

150
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,640
The differences are so tiny

151
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,730
that the average customer

152
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,480
could not notice.”

153
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,660
The result? Apple was banned

154
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,580
from selling iPhones in Beijing.

155
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,200
Of course, Apple immediately appealed,

156
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,900
and there was no actual break in people

157
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,440
being able to buy the real iPhone.

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,380
Apple did eventually win.

159
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,950
It helped that Baili was a defunct company

160
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,960
by then anyway.

161
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,330
But if an out-of-business Chinese knockoff

162
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,260
can sue Apple for stealing its design and
win,

163
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,200
at least for a little while...

164
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,960
actually I don’t know what that says.

165
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,100
How about you tell me what you think it means?

166
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,940
Leave your comments below.

167
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,780
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

168
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,470
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

169
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,680
See you next time.
