1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,330
Is the Coronavirus plague warfare?

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,690
China is charged in one of the biggest hacks
in history

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,620
And Chinese jets harass Taiwan.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,360
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,400
This is China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,970
This week’s China News Headlines.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,520
First up, the coronavirus,

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,310
now known as COVID-19.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,730
Currently, it’s believed the virus spread

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,869
from this wet market in the Chinese city of
Wuhan.

11
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,620
However, that might not have been the original
source.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,070
Therefore, there’s only one logical explanation.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,930
IT WAS A BIOWEAPON THAT ESCAPED A CHINESE
LAB!

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,370
Yes, I’m channeling Alex Jones,

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,039
but that’s not his conspiracy.

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,039
Maybe he believes it.

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,370
But he didn’t come up with it.

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,450
It’s actually a widely popular theory

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,000
spreading almost as fast COVID-19.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
So much so, that Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,739
actually asked that question

22
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,609
to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,430
“They knew that coronavirus had happened
back in December.

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,520
They sent a delegation to the White House
to shake everybody’s hand.

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,530
They knew that they had this virus that had
started with the 'phase one.'

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,170
Then, they sent the largest delegation ever
to Davos.

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,170
And now, the ambassador to China

28
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,420
was on one of the Sunday shows this weekend,

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,909
and he did not deny that coronavirus could
have started,

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,490
could have started in a weapons lab.

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,030
“Do we know if this started in a research
lab?

32
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,619
And how come they won’t allow the CDC in
there

33
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,720
to better understand how this started,

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,420
because if they started this in a weapons
lab,

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,009
that’s evidence that they are developing
or trying to develop

36
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,729
weapons of mass destruction, biological weapons.”

37
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:49,180
Wait, is Maria Bartiromo asking if Chinese
authorities

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,009
were using the coronavirus to *infect* US
officials

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,250
and rich and powerful people at Davos?

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,140
I mean, she was talking kind of fast

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,741
but I’m pretty sure she’s implying that
the coronavirus

42
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:03,539
could be plague warfare.

43
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,539
That is giving Alex Jones a run for his money.

44
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,140
Look at poor Navarro’s face.

45
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,030
Pro tip: If you’re going to ask your interview
guest a leading question,

46
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,490
at least give him a chance to *answer* your
leading question.

47
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,350
On to another conspiracy theory—

48
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,490
one that turned out to be true.

49
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,130
Remember that massive Equifax hack back in
2017

50
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,060
that stole the personal information of 145
million Americans?

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,320
At the time there were rumblings

52
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,390
that maybe Chinese state-sponsored hackers
were behind it.

53
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,010
Well, the US just charged 4 members of the
Chinese military for the hack.

54
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,500
Don’t worry, 145 million American who were
affected by their actions.

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,330
The Chinese military only gained access to
your name,

56
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,510
address, Social Security number, driver’s
license number,

57
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,880
and a few other minor details.

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,480
And anyway, the Chinese military says they
didn’t do it.

59
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,910
Why is America such a big bully?

60
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,110
The US Justice Department has been busy.

61
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,280
Besides charging Chinese hackers for the Equifax
hack,

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,600
they also charged 5 people in New York and
Texas

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,140
for selling sanctioned Iranian oil to China.

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,210
They managed two shipments of oil per month

65
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,060
worth a profit of 28 million dollars.

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,370
But they now face 25 years in jail.

67
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,090
Partially because, you know,

68
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,580
China buying Iranian oil is funding Iranian
terrorism.

69
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,880
The Pentagon submitted its 2020 budget proposal.

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,280
The focus is on keeping pace

71
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,180
with high tech weapons developments in Russia
and China,

72
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,910
including “boosting hypersonic missiles,

73
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,090
nuclear modernization, 5G technologies, and
missile defense,

74
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,340
as well as the newly-minted Space Force.”

75
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,500
A big part of that is ship killing missiles.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,910
It comes at a time when China is rapidly building
up its Navy.

77
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,020
I’m sure there’s no connection though.

78
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,540
Meanwhile, the State Department is hammering
China’s military

79
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,450
for crossing into Taiwan airspace.

80
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,580
Yes, while the Chinese regime

81
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,780
should be dealing with the outbreak of a deadly
virus,

82
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,950
they put resources into military drills and
harassing Taiwan.

83
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,400
Surely the world will be successfully distracted!

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,430
Except now the US is flying bombers near Taiwan

85
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,150
to show that they’ll stand by Taiwan’s
side.

86
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,390
2020 is the year everything goes wrong

87
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,480
for the Chinese Communist Party.

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
So what do you think?

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,860

And as you may have heard me mention,

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,330
YouTube has refused to run ads

94
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,330
on most of our episodes about the coronavirus.

95
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,730
Which means we can’t afford to keep covering
it.

96
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,100
Except for one thing:

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,900
We have the support of viewers like you,

98
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,690

website Patreon,

China issues,

102
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,300
like a deadly global pandemic.

103
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,190
So as a thank you to supporters,

104
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,020
I answer a question from them at the end of
some of my episodes.

105
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,080
Today’s question comes from rswaggs

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,720
“What is the Supreme People's Court?

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Doesn't Xi interpret all the Chinese's laws?”

108
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,500
Good question!

109
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,440
Well, the Supreme People’s Court

110
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,510
is the highest court of law in China.

111
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,120
Which is kind of an oxymoron since China

112
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,750
doesn’t really have rule of law.

113
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,590
But since the 1980s,

114
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,200
China has built up a structure that looks
a lot like a legal system.

115
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,930
The difference is, the Communist Party uses
the law

116
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,090
to go after people it wants to go after—

117
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,810
but not everyone is treated equally under
the law—

118
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,360
if you’re rich, if you have connections,

119
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,620
and especially if you’re a Party member.

120
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,120
Unless you’re a Party member who makes a
big mistake.

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Keep in mind,

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,910
the Chief Justice of the Supreme People’s
Court once said,

123
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,280
“China’s courts must firmly resist

124
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,420
the Western idea of judicial independence

125
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,420
and other ideologies that threaten

126
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,400
the leadership of the ruling Communist Party.”

127
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,430
So does that mean Xi controls the courts?

128
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,900
Not directly.

129
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,550
The Communist Party is like the world’s

130
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,000
most nightmarish bureaucracy.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,950
Xi definitely has a lot of power now,

132
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,560
but he still has to guard his back

133
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,930
from all the other Communist Party members

134
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,590
who would love to see him gone

135
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,520
and maybe themselves put in as replacements.

136
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,550
This means there’s a lot of compromise

137
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,260
that goes on behind the scenes.

138
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,630
They’ve called it the collective leadership
of the Party.

139
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,480
But even if Xi Jinping doesn’t have the
final word,

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,170
you can be sure it is still the will of the
Communist Party

141
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,300
coming through on any sensitive verdict.

142
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,830
Thanks for your question.

143
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,910
