1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:03,389
Jackie Chan

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,210
Loves the Chinese Communist Party
He says wants to become a Chinese Communist

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,210
Party member!

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:19,160
But does the Party want him?

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:33,660
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,750
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,530
World-famous martial artist and actor Jackie
Chan is making a desperate plea to the Chinese

8
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,530
Communist Party.

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,530
“I’m honoured to be a Chinese person.

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,530
But I’m also envious of you Chinese Communist
Party members.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,809
I just feel like the CCP is truly too great.

12
00:00:49,809 --> 00:01:01,070
For every promise that the CCP makes, it doesn’t
even take a century, but only decades to become

13
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,070
reality.

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,370
I want to be a Chinese Communist Party member.

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,370
Thank you all.”

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,370
[applause]

17
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,130
Yes, he wants to be a Chinese Communist Party
member.

18
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,330
Please, oh please, let him in!

19
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,610
And while Jackie Chan’s bootlicking would
embarrass even Smithers , he may not even

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,390
be good enough for the CCP.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,390
Which I’ll get to later.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,390
But first, I’d like to say that Jackie Chan
used to be cool.

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,070
Here he is singing at the Concert for Democracy
in China.

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,110
It was held in Hong Kong—his hometown—to
support the Tiananmen Square student protesters

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,950
in Beijing.

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,520
That was just one week before the tanks rolled
in.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,330
And here Chan is in Taiwan in 1992, receiving
one of the ten Outstanding Chinese Youth Special

28
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,210
Awards, and shaking hands with Taiwan’s
first democratically elected president, Lee

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,210
Tung-hui .

30
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,180
It doesn’t seem like Jackie Chan would’ve
been the type to support the Chinese Communist

31
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
Party.

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,890
But that all started to change after the 1997
transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese rule.

33
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,270
Then, Chan seemed to transform himself from
a proud Hong Konger, into a proud Chinese

34
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,610
nationalist.

35
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,239
And in that weird brainwashed way, where he
conflates being ethnically Chinese with loving

36
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,609
the Chinese Communist Party.

37
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:23,900
This next clip is from 2009, when Jackie Chan
was invited to speak at a cross-strait symposium

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
as Hong Kong’s tourism ambassador.

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,900
“Is having freedom good?

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Or is not having freedom good?

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Really, I get those confused.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Too much freedom and you become like what
Hong Kong is today: chaotic.

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,310
Not to mention they’re becoming like Taiwan:
Also chaotic.

44
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:46,510
Uh, I’ve slowly begun to think that us Chinese
people need to be controlled.”

45
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,370
According to Chan, both Hong Kong and Taiwan
are just too free.

46
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,870
Like pets without a leash!

47
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,110
They’re in desperate need of control.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,799
They need the warm, loving iron fist of the
Chinese Communist Party!

49
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,120
By the way, Chan’s whole thing about countries
with too much freedom being “chaotic”

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,799
is straight out of Communist Party propaganda.

51
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:18,790
In 2013, Chan was appointed to join the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Conference.

52
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,099
Appointments are often used as a way to boost
celebrities’ egos while making the Party

53
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,069
look like it's open to outside ideas.

54
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,519
Hint: It’s not.

55
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,650
Unlike America.

56
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,609
A place where a celebrity can push for criminal
justice reform.

57
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,279
And actually get it done.

58
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,569
In China, it’s the opposite.

59
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,249
The Communist Party gives people high-up positions
as a way to control them.

60
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:47,200
And the Party is not open to constructive
criticism.

61
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:54,439
This year, Jackie Chan was also given membership
to Hong Kong’s newly reformed Election Committee—where

62
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,870
a group of unelected people get to participate
in a rigged election to determine the next

63
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,609
leader of Hong Kong.

64
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,909
Chan is also a Vice Chairman of the China
Film Association, which refers to itself as

65
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:13,599
“an important force for the prosperity and
development of socialist literature and art

66
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,290
and the construction of a strong socialist
cultural country.”

67
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,200
And by development and construction, they
mean endorsing censorship.

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,310
Here’s an interview Jackie Chan did with
CGTN in August 2019—as the anti-Chinese

69
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,130
Communist Party protests were raging in Hong
Kong.

70
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,800
0:38 I have visited many countries, and I
can say, our country has been rapidly developing

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,860
in recent years.

72
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,530
I feel pride in being Chinese wherever I go,
and the ‘Five-starred Red Flag’ is respected

73
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,070
everywhere around the world.

74
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:52,090
1:06 Hong Kong and China are my birthplaces
and my home.

75
00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:00,670
China is my country, I love my country, I
love my home.

76
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,020
So what was Chan doing in June of that year
when the Hong Kong protests were happening?

77
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,160
He was drinking tea in Taiwan, promoting his
new album.

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,260
And he claimed he did not know anything about
the Hong Kong protests while he was there.

79
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:20,610
But what Jackie Chan seems to have forgotten
is that his success as a movie star is not

80
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,920
thanks to the Chinese Communist Party.

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,420
It’s thanks to Hong Kong’s freedoms.

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,780
I’ll explain after the break.

83
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,150
Welcome back.

84
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,190
Jackie Chan was born in Hong Kong—back when
it was a British territory.

85
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,930
And that’s where his career took off.

86
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,190
Hong Kong’s political and economic freedom
made it one of the world’s most flourishing

87
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,870
filmmaking industries—especially for martial
arts films.

88
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,860
For decades, Hong Kong was the world’s second
largest motion picture exporter.

89
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,190
Jackie Chan began his career in Hong Kong
films in the 60s and 70s.

90
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,480
In 1980, he starred in his first Hollywood
film.

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,900
That movie may have been dumb, but it was
his big break.

92
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,250
After that Chan’s career took off—thanks
to the freedoms of Hong Kong, and eventually

93
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
America.

94
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:16,020
And at the time, the film industry in China
was just pushing out boring propaganda films.

95
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,040
Unlike now, when some of them are interesting
propaganda films.

96
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,200
This article from 1991 says: “From the point
of view of the studios, an important advantage

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,510
of [China’s] political films is that no
matter how awful they are, they make money

98
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,090
because the great majority of tickets are
bought in bulk by offices and factories.

99
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,390
Employees are encouraged to see the films
during normal work hours.”

100
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,301
So while Jackie Chan was filming classics
like the thrilling “Police Story” and

101
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:50,930
the jam-packed “Drunken Master” mainland
China was pouring all its money into films

102
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,680
about the Communist Party like the “Creation
of a World”, and “Mao Zedong and His Son”.

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,240
So why on earth would Jackie Chan want to
join the Chinese Communist Party?

104
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,870
I don’t know.

105
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:10,540
But it does seem the Chinese Communist Party
hesitates to have Jackie Chan join.

106
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,560
I mean, he might not be good for the Party’s
image.

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,620
Which is sad, because their bar is real low.

108
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,890
On the business end, Chan is what Chinese
people call a broom star an old term for a

109
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,640
comet.

110
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,330
It means that Chan is bad luck.

111
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,210
Whatever product he endorses, ends up failing
miserably.

112
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:39,580
He’s promoted Chinese computer brand Xiaobawang
, and also the VCD player brand Aiduo . Never

113
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,910
heard of those?

114
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:47,300
That’s because Xiaobawang filed for bankruptcy,
and Aiduo’s boss was put in prison for embezzlement.

115
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,500
But maybe that’s just a coincidence.

116
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,750
Those Chinese manufacturers would have fallen
on their own.

117
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,710
Jackie Chan even said it himself.

118
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,460
When I buy a television, I definitely go for
the Japanese TV…

119
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,190
China’s TV’s will explode!

120
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,760
Chinese products are just not trustworthy.

121
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Whoops.

122
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,120
That won’t get you in to the Communist Party,
Jackie.

123
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,030
Chan also ran promotions for BaWang shampoo,
which later was found to have carcinogens.

124
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,180
Chan was also the spokesperson for Yujia real
estate.

125
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,800
But in September 2020, two of his Beijing
luxury condos developed by Yujia were seized

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,019
and auctioned because Yujia hadn’t paid
its debts.

127
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:38,199
Plus, the boy band Jackie Chan manages is
a total flop.

128
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:42,509
So needless to say, Jackie Chan isn’t very
good at non-movie stuff.

129
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:47,579
But the biggest backlash from critics of Chan’s
wish to join the Chinese Communist Party cite

130
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:50,009
his embarrassing personal life.

131
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:54,959
“Many have said on social media that he
has cheated on his wife and that his son has

132
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,410
used drugs, both of which would disqualify
him from [Party] membership.”

133
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,930
If adultery and drug use actually disqualified
people from the Chinese Communist Party...there

134
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,550
would be a lot fewer Chinese officials.

135
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,060
Anyway, one of the biggest scandals with Jackie
Chan is his extramarital affair with Hong

136
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,350
Kong actress Elaine Ng.

137
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,199
They had a daughter together, but Elaine had
to raise her all by herself.

138
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,980
Chan allegedly refused to pay child support
at the time.

139
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,180
The other scandal happened in 2014, police
raided Chan’s home—the same one that later

140
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,800
got seized and auctioned.

141
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,670
Jackie’s legitimate son, Jaycee Chan, was
found with 100 grams of marijuana.

142
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,899
The penalty for drugs in China is severe.

143
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,699
Jaycee pleaded guilty for sheltering others
to use drugs and ended up spending six months

144
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,290
in jail.

145
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,980
And Jackie Chan didn’t even show up at his
son’s trial.

146
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,199
I understand why Jackie Chan was embarrassed.

147
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:01,181
After all, the Chinese government had appointed
Chan as their “Anti-drug ambassador” back

148
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,569
in 2009.

149
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:07,149
Clearly, that was another non-movie thing
he wasn’t good at.

150
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:13,189
But weirdly, even after all of that, Chan
still manages to be a Chinese icon.

151
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:18,829
He even took center stage at the 100 anniversary
of the CCP.

152
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:19,829
.

153
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:25,430
A dark past of corruption and failure, but
he still looks good when he performs?

154
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,820
Maybe he is a good fit for the Chinese Communist
Party!

155
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,889
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

156
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,370
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,

157
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,809
by contributing through crowd funding website
Patreon.

158
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:46,360
jessie santiago asks, “Is the US and the
rest of the world paying attention?

159
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,430
Is the US taking steps?”

160
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,749
That question in response to my recent episode
China’s First Space Walk Hides a Dark Secret

161
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:55,749
.

162
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:59,570
Basically, the Chinese space program is run
by the People’s Liberation Army.

163
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,019
That’s right, not a civilian organization
like NASA.

164
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,739
Not even a private company run by an evil
super villain like SpaceX.

165
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:08,739
.

166
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:09,739
The Communist Party’s military.

167
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:13,769
That’s a huge danger to democracies around
the world.

168
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:19,420
“Advanced weapons at China’s military
bases can fire warheads that smash satellites

169
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,139
and can shoot laser beams that have a potential
to blind arrays of delicate sensors.”

170
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,029
And so the question was, is the US paying
attention?

171
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,620
Well, some in the intelligence and military
sectors have been sounding alarm bells for

172
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,150
years.

173
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,709
Not too much was done.

174
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:41,269
But the Trump Administration’s Space Force
was partly an attempt to turn things around.

175
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,389
The Space Force currently has bipartisan support
in Congress and in all likelihood, the Biden

176
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,600
Administration will continue it.

177
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,029
Last year, the Space Force unveiled its first
weapon, a satellite jammer.

178
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,329
So in many ways, space warfare has already
begun.

179
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,889
But the US is only just beginning to play
catch up.

180
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,279
