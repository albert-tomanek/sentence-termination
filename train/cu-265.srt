1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,290
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,040
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,040
China and India:

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,240
The two most populous countries on Earth.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,610
And like a scene from the most popular

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,420
Indian movie in China, Dangal,

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,820
China and India could soon be in the ring,

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,529
wrestling it out.

9
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:19,529
And by “ring,”

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,140
I mean the Doklam Plateau.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,140
And by “wrestling,”

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,140
I mean shooting.

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,140
With guns.

14
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,550
Or nuclear weapons.

15
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,550
But don’t worry.

16
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,220
They’re not going to actually use nuclear
weapons.

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,400
Probably.

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,400
Since June,

19
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,780
China and India have been in

20
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,050
their most serious military stand-off in decades.

21
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,070
Americans know India

22
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,210
as the land of the Taj Mahal,

23
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,910
the birthplace of Buddhism,

24
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,120
and the backdrop of the world’s most influential

25
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,500
nonviolent resistance movement.

26
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,329
I’m just kidding, of course.

27
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,329
Most Americans know India

28
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,250
as the land of the Taj Mahal,

29
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,539
the birthplace of Kwik-E-Mart owners,

30
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:53,660
and the backdrop of that one

31
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,590
Wes Anderson movie.

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,809
This is India.

33
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,930
It has this sort of flap in the northeast

34
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,190
that’s connected by the narrow Siliguri
Corridor.

35
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,920
It’s less than 17 miles wide at one point.

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,980
It’s sometimes called “the chicken’s
neck.”

37
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,270
I’m going to come back to that.

38
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,690
The military stand-off is happening

39
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,480
near the three-way border of China, India,

40
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,900
and the tiny kingdom of Bhutan.

41
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,160
Americans know Bhutan for its archery,

42
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Buddhism,

43
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,320
and being the happiest country on Earth.

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,620
Look at how happy they made the British.

45
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,900
I’m just kidding, of course.

46
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,280
Most Americans know...

47
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,260
okay, they’ve never heard of Bhutan.

48
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,630
Anyway, it’s here,

49
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,790
between northeast India and Chinese Tibet.

50
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,810
Bhutan has less than a million citizens.

51
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,350
It’s army is so small,

52
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,230
it relies on India for military support.

53
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,200
Now China and India have had their share

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,430
of border disputes over the years.

55
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,520
Most notably, in 1962,

56
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,860
they actually fought a war

57
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,330
over a disputed border.

58
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,290
But that was a different time,

59
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,900
and in a different place.

60
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,540
This border dispute is actually happening...

61
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,960
in Bhutan.

62
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Or in China,

63
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,940
depending on which country you ask.

64
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,240
But not in India.

65
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,210
You see, China’s People’s Liberation Army

66
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,650
has been building a road through part of Bhutan,

67
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,039
or as the Chinese Communist Party calls it,

68
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,730
part of Chinese territory since ancient times.

69
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,860
It’s hard to find accurate maps

70
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,390
of this region online.

71
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,200
Apparently those guys at Google Maps

72
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,609
have more important things to do

73
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,349
than try to correctly draw disputed border
lines

74
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,000
in far off lands.

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,720
Important things like turning Google Maps

76
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,280
into a Pac-Man game.

77
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,060
Anyway, the dispute seems to be happening

78
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,500
somewhere in this region,

79
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,280
part of the Doklam Plateau.

80
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,290
The thing is,

81
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,159
while this is the map according to India

82
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,450
and Bhutan and Google,

83
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,519
this is the map according to China—

84
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,760
and its Google knockoff, Baidu.

85
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,180
Anyway, Bhutan was obviously

86
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,140
more than a little miffed at the presence

87
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,999
of Chinese troops in its territory.

88
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,799
But from the Chinese Communist Party’s perspective,

89
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,510
they simply sent the army in

90
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,980
to build a road inside China.

91
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,540
That’s why China had a major problem

92
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,090
when Indian soldiers tried to stop

93
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,019
what the Chinese Defense Ministry called

94
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,400
“the normal activity of the Chinese border
defense troops.”

95
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
To be fair,

96
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
for the Chinese regime,

97
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,950
construction in disputed territory

98
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,299
is normal activity.

99
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,749
But from India’s perspective,

100
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,019
Bhutan asked India for help,

101
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,159
so India sent in troops into Bhutan.

102
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,450
An initial scuffle happened on June 16.

103
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,159
Now, both sides have stationed

104
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,250
thousands of troops along the border—

105
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,030
in what’s become a month-long stand-off.

106
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,240
And neither side wants to back down.

107
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,819
“I want to remind India,

108
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,480
don’t leave things to luck

109
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,800
and unrealistic illusions….

110
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,239
shaking a mountain is easy

111
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,860
but shaking the PLA is hard.”

112
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,870
Yes, you don’t shake the PLA.

113
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,359
In disputed territory,

114
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,530
PLA shakes you.

115
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,670
At least according to this India Today video.

116
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,400
“Its personnel were caught on camera

117
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
jostling with Indian troops—

118
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,650
some time in second week of June

119
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,680
across the LAC in Sikkim.”

120
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,420
So why is this a big deal for India,

121
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,700
when the PLA is mainly just building roads

122
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
in China-slash-Bhutan?

123
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,249
Well, for over a decade,

124
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,290
the Chinese Communist Party has been building

125
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,680
roads deeper into Tibet.

126
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,790
And not just to bring happiness

127
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,100
and prosperity to the locals.

128
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,720
The roads greatly speed up the Chinese regime’s
ability

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,520
to move troops through the region.

130
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,110
This narrow finger of Tibet

131
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,610
borders India’s Sikkim region to the west,

132
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,690
and Bhutan to the east.

133
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,700
And it’s also of strategic importance.

134
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,920
According to Indian military experts

135
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,170
speaking to the BBC,

136
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,540
“Sikkim is the only area through which India

137
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,290
could make an offensive response

138
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,950
to a Chinese incursion,

139
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,940
and the only stretch of the Himalayan frontier

140
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,870
where Indian troops have a terrain

141
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,300
and tactical advantage.”

142
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Essentially, in the event of war,

143
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,070
that would be the last good place

144
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,690
for India to defend against a Chinese incursion.

145
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,260
And if the Chinese troops were to incur,

146
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,780
well, remember the Siliguri Corridor,

147
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,880
the chicken’s neck?

148
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,510
It’s only half a day’s drive by highway.

149
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,790
So India may be imagining a possible war scenario

150
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,600
where Chinese troops enter India

151
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,970
through this disputed border region,

152
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,850
and then occupy the Siliguri Corridor

153
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,120
— cutting the chicken’s neck.

154
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,990
That would separate the main part of India

155
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,730
from its eight northeastern states.

156
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,730
By the way,

157
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,260
if you’re wondering why the map of India

158
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,090
looks so crazy,

159
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,690
you can thank Prince William’s great grandfather.

160
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,630
Of course, when the map of India

161
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,970
was drawn in 1947,

162
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,720
Tibet was an independent country

163
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,010
ruled by this guy—

164
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,540
but that’s another story.

165
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,130
Anyway, this whole border dispute

166
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,210
between India and China

167
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,060
is basically over maintaining the ability

168
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,000
to fight a future war with the other.

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,210
Fortunately, this conflict hasn’t gotten
out of control—

170
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,500
besides that Dangal-movie-inspired wrestling,

171
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,710
which is merely off the hook.

172
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,710
No shots have been fired,

173
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,830
as far as we know.

174
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,740
But China has been continually holding

175
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,920
live fire drills in Tibet.

176
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,990
Or as the Chinese military calls them,

177
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,190
“war games.”

178
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,740
The military says they were merely

179
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,680
to “[test] the brigade’s joint strike
capability

180
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
on plateaus.”

181
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
You know, plateaus in general.

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,920
Definitely not any particular plateau.

183
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,210
Meanwhile, as I mentioned last week,

184
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,280
the Indian government is preparing weapons

185
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,740
for a short, intense war.

186
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,940
You know, a short intense war in general.

187
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,030
And while it’s always nice to say

188
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,340
no one wants war—

189
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,400
this time, it’s more complicated.

190
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,100
Neither Chinese leader Xi Jinping

191
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,420
nor Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi

192
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,880
wants an actual full-scale war.

193
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,030
But neither of them wants to back down, either.

194
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,240
India needs to show Bhutan

195
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,430
it’s capable of supporting them.

196
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,650
After all, Bhutan is India’s only neighbor

197
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,080
that can be called a true ally against China.

198
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,720
But most importantly,

199
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,640
neither Xi nor Modi can afford to look

200
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,510
politically weak.

201
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,640
Modi will be up for Indian re-election in
2019—

202
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,000
or maybe earlier.

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So politically,

204
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,640
it can’t look like he’s caving in to China.

205
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,580
Xi Jinping doesn’t exactly face an election,

206
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,420
but the Chinese Communist Party’s 19th Party
Congress

207
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,530
is coming up in November.

208
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,180
And he’s going to make some decisions there

209
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,600
that are going to create political enemies.

210
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,220
So Xi can’t afford to look like

211
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,430
he’s caving to India.

212
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,180
And in particular,

213
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,950
my favorite state-run media the Global Times

214
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,710
is really pushing hard for war,

215
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,280
telling India not to forget who won the last
war;

216
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,400
that things are going to escalate;

217
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,350
and that China will kill everybody.

218
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,370
So both sides are grandstanding,

219
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,050
and no one wants to back down.

220
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,820
But you know who’s really to blame,

221
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,240
according to the Global Times?

222
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,220
That’s right,

223
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,280
America.

224
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,360
Also any other country like Australia

225
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,440
that calls for de-escalating the situation.

226
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
For now, though,

227
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,330
nothing terrible has happened.

228
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,430
But if shots are fired,

229
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,430
and soldiers are killed,

230
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,840
then there will be a lot of political pressure

231
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,400
to respond with Global Times-style violence.

232
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,830
Really, they should just resolve it

233
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,060
by wrestling in the ring like men.

234
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,420
Or, you know,

235
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
women.

236
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,680
And coming up after the break,

237
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
China Uncensored road trip!!

238
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,640
You may like China Uncensored,

239
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,210
but you know who doesn’t?

240
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,270
The Chinese Communist Party.

241
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,720
They even pressure advertisers

242
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,610
not to work with controversial content like
this.

243
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,220
That’s why China Uncensored is supported

244
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,430
mainly by viewers like you.

245
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,430
If you can,

246
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,670
head over to the website, Patreon,

247
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,240
and contribute to China Uncensored.

248
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,380
Even a dollar per episode

249
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,120
makes a huge difference.
