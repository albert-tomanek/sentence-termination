00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,860
why can't "disputed territory" just be code for,

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,540
"I wanna get next to you?"

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,860
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,030
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,030
Tensions are getting worse

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,890
between India and China.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,890
For those of you who need a quick catch-up,

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,570
Chinese troops began building a road

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,980
in disputed territory with Bhutan.

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,220
Bhutan asked the Indian army to come over

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,510
and stop the Chinese troops,

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,710
and now the two biggest powers in Asia

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,830
are at each other’s throats.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,830
China and India.

16
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,830
Not Bhutan.

17
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,210
Bhutan is the smallest power in Asia.

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,090
Anyway, Chinese state-run media i

19
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,430
s becoming more and more aggressive,

20
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,210
saying India had better check itself,

21
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,020
or there’s gonna be war.

22
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,180
And this article says Indian Prime Minister
Modi

23
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,490
is gambling with India’s destiny...

24
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:55,370
...because Chinese troops would kill every
single Indian soldier.

25
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,060
Indian troops are still on the border,

26
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,240
but China and India can’t seem to agree
how many.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,590
Chinese sources are saying 53,

28
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,750
but New Delhi says around 350

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,750
have been stationed there

30
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,170
since the border dispute began.

31
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,250
And inside India,

32
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,800
the conflict has sparked a grassroots movement

33
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,470
to boycott Chinese goods.

34
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,350
“There should be a boycott of Chinese products,

35
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,070
and if some people do not boycott,

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,950
then they are traitors.”

37
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,650
Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama has suggested

38
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,980
that perhaps the two sides ought to sit down

39
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,460
and resolve their disputes like adults.

40
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,400
I’m sure the Chinese Communist Party

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,870
is going to listen to him.

42
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,840
And proving that once again individuals

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,500
are more rational than governments,

44
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,600
an Indian boxer defeated a Chinese boxer

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,860
in a major match,

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,480
and dedicated the victory to peace

47
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,380
between the two nations.

48
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,300
...after literally just punching

49
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,970
his Chinese opponent in the face.

50
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,640
The Indian winner offered to return

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
the championship belt to the Chinese boxer

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,150
to ease tensions along the border.

53
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,080
He said, “I hope for peace in the border

54
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,210
and the message is about peace.”

55
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,159
The Chinese Foreign Minister rejected his
offer,

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,190
responding that China is already a land of
peace,

57
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,200
and anyway the championship belt has been

58
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,100
part of China's sacred territory since ancient
times—

59
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,270
so give us the belt now or war is inevitable.

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,440
We’ll be right back.
