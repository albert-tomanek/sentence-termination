bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
Hit and Run Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,380
I m your host, Chris Chappell. In my recent
episode, China declares war on the Chinese

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,150
people, I said that China s vast array of
standard, secret, and military police officially

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,130
get more money than the Chinese military.
So rather than existing to protect and serve

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,400
the Chinese people, the police in China are
an extension of the Chinese Communist Party

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,279
and function more as a means of making them
obey the Party. Here s an example. I hope

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,489
they see that ped. Oh. And the police drive
off. There s no word on whether or not the

8
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,429
pedestrian survived, but if they did, I m
sure they ll rest comfortably knowing that

9
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:47,100
China s police are absolutely dedicated to
fighting crime, and they ll crush anyone in

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,281
their way to do so. So yeah, the police suck,
but I mean, the driver of this car didn t

11
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:57,739
stop either. Come on, where s the love for
your fellow man? Actually, this is a problem

12
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,289
in China, something contemporary Chinese social
critics have been pointing out for years,

13
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,869
that while China has developed materially,
it s come at the cost of its spiritual civilization.

14
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:14,369
It reminds me of a similar thing from 2011.
Yueyue was only two years old when. Well,

15
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,079
we don t need to see that. But get this. Over
the next ten minutes, 18 people walk past

16
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,679
without doing a thing to help, before ultimately,
she s run over by another van. She died two

17
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:30,899
weeks later from her injuries. It was a huge
story in China. The China Youth Daily, the

18
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:36,530
official Communist Party paper for youth,
did a survey and 88% of respondents said Yueyue

19
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:43,039
died because of growing apathy in China toward
other people. Amazingly, another 71% thought

20
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:48,979
all those people just walked by Yueyue because
they were afraid of getting in trouble themselves.

21
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,280
That s because good Samaritans in China often
find themselves getting blamed for the crime.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,740
The most famous example is from 2006, when
a 65 year old woman fell while exiting a bus.

23
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,740
While others passed by, a 26 year old student
named Peng Yu stopped, helped her to a hospital

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,370
and even paid part of the bill. The woman,
of modest means, thanked Peng by suing him

25
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,209
for 7,000 dollars, saying he pushed her. The
case went to court and the judge famously

26
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,290
said it was common sense that the only reason
someone would help another person was if they

27
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,650
had a guilty conscience, and ruled against
Peng. That s proved a grim lesson. In 2009,

28
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,769
a 75 year old man also fell after disembarking
a bus. No one dared touch him until he shouted

29
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,769
it s nobody s fault. I fell by myself. Then
everyone nearby helped him out. But here s

30
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,820
the kicker. Six years after the Peng Yu case
enraged the country, some newly disclosed

31
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,870
documents from the trial that hadn t been
made public came to light. Apparenlty, Peng

32
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,500
confessed to pushing the old woman, then solicited
local media and online forum moderators to

33
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,079
paint him as a martyr. On top of that Peng
and the 65 year old grannie were in cahoots,

34
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:05,360
and they had already agreed to a financial
settlement. And on top of that, law enforcement

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,069
officials had testimony and evidence that
Peng knocked the old woman down, and didn

36
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,390
t say anything. So for years people have been
afraid of helping each other because of this

37
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,590
crazy lawsuit case that was a total sham.
That s just. That s, I can t even really wrap

38
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,319
my head around that one. Which kind of begs
the question, if that whole thing hadn t happened,

39
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,530
would someone have helped Yueyue? So what
do you make of all this? I mean, it seems

40
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,629
to me like people in China want to help each
other, but they ve been made too afraid to

41
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,110
do anything. Share your thoughts by either
