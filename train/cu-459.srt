00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,829
how the Chinese military's theft is costing
America trillions of dollars a year

3
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:13,861
hi welcome to China uncensored

4
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,850
I'm your host Chris Chappell

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,360
as I always say:

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,880
good artists copy, great artists steal

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,300
which means there's no greater artist than:

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,880
"we sampled them from them but it's not the
same base line"

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,570
sorry I was actually talking about:

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,390
economic espionage by members of the Chinese
military

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,450
yes the Chinese military

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,060
it's perhaps the world's most prolific and
successful thief

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,399
of course the Chinese government denies it

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,170
I wanna stress that the Chinese government
resolutely bands and cracks down on any form

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,719
of hacking activity

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,829
this position is consistent and clear

17
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,989
right...

18
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,710
the Chinese government cracks down on its
own military

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,150
anyway by now it's widely known that:

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,750
hackers associated with the Chinese government
have repeatedly breached the computer systems

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,330
of U.S. companies

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,050
but how does that translate into actual profits
for Chinese companies and losses for American

23
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,260
ones?

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,369
introducing: Technology Transfer Centers

25
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,049
As early as 2001 the Chinese Communist party
started building a systematic mechanism

26
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,100
to not only steal intellectual property from
foreign companies

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,710
but also to reverse engineer that technology
and make it available to Chinese companies

28
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,740
that then can use it to out-compete the same
foreign companies they stole the technology

29
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,049
from.

30
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:46,350
although this has been going on for more than
a decade it's only recently that we've understood

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,369
the missing link of how this works

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,650
there are actually three pieces to China's
nationwide system of economic theft

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,299
the first piece is the Chinese military

34
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,509
they hack, they spy, they steal

35
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:04,610
whatever it takes to obtain raw information
like blueprints, data, trade secrets and so

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,610
on

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,970
the second piece is the transfer centers

38
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,870
they have trained experts process this raw
information into step-by-step designs that

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,709
are actually usable

40
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,840
the third piece is Chinese companies

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,409
some of them are state-owned

42
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,620
some are private

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,870
many of them are run by people with party
or military connections

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,819
they get the designs from the transfer centers
and use them to make Chinese versions of foreign

45
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,999
products

46
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,260
let me give you an analogy

47
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:40,209
it's the Iowa State Fair and grandma chapel
has won first prize for her famous apple pie

48
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,419
now folks from all over come to buy her delicious
pastry

49
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,379
one day she's in her kitchen baking when my
golly

50
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:52,650
she notices two Chinese tourists taking photos
through the window

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,569
well shucks they look friendly enough

52
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,819
the next day these friendly folks stop by
her pie stand and tell her how much they love

53
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,939
her pie

54
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:07,329
and that they just be tickled to take a few
pies back home to their friends in China

55
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:09,029
well sure

56
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:13,559
little does grandma know what these two tourists
are planning

57
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:19,269
they take her pies to the transfer center
run by the beijing new oriental Culinary Institute

58
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,489
where they're analyzed by foreign trained
pastry chefs

59
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,129
and reverse engineered into a step by step
recipe

60
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,849
then the recipe is sold to a Chinese company

61
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,809
so it's a year later

62
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:36,489
grandma chapel is setting up her pie booth
again at the Iowa State Fair

63
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:42,489
but this time there's a new competitor selling
apple pies that taste almost the same

64
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,479
but for half the price

65
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,689
poor grandma can no longer compete

66
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:51,930
obviously this is just a made-up example

67
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,689
my grandma's from California not Iowa

68
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,499
but this kind of thing really does happen

69
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:02,669
like how in june 2011 employees of American
superconductor Corp discovered

70
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:08,049
that their design for the computer chips that
run wind turbines had been stolen

71
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,669
the company's biggest customer "china sinovel
win group"

72
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,339
had suddenly stopped using the American chips
to run its turbines

73
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:20,989
and instead began using knock off ones based
on the American source code

74
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,500
since this theft also robbed American superconductor
of its biggest customer

75
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,729
it lost more than eighty percent of its stock
value within six months

76
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,490
this kind of thing doesn't just happen sometimes

77
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,120
it happens constantly on a massive scale

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,930
in december 2007 the Chinese government literally
wrote economic theft into its national economic

79
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,930
plan

80
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,580
back in June I interviewed cyber-espionage
expert joshua philipp

81
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,349
today he published a groundbreaking article
in The Epoch Times

82
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,440
that for the first time reveals the scope
of China state-authorized technology transfer

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,539
centers

84
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:02,879
Josh thank you for joining me again to help
me further undermine china

85
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,240
so your article exposes these technology transfer
centers

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,710
what's the big deal about them?

87
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,669
right, so when people talk about Chinese cyber
espionage,

88
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,960
they often talk about the cyber attacks or
the spies steal the technology

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,610
or they mentioned vaguely the Chinese companies
are profiting from this

90
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,330
the transfer centers are the place between
the two of those

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,889
that process the stolen technology from the
military and then pass them to the relevant

92
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,599
Chinese state-run industry

93
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,699
so they're sort of the the in between that
reverse engineers what is stolen

94
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:42,139
exactly and the funny thing about them is
they don't even try to hide it

95
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,189
if you read their doctrine

96
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,099
if you read what they even say about their
companies

97
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,879
they, I mean they call themselves China's
National Technology Transfer Centers

98
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,330
this is totally open

99
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,270
open, open, functioning through Chinese universities
or under Chinese companies

100
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,099
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________--------------
or illa ties the Chinese military

101
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,300
and nobody seems to talk about them

102
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,139
the Technology Transfer Centers exist throughout
the entire Chinese system

103
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,979
they exist in the military

104
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:18,629
they exist on the government side of the Chinese
regime under the state council

105
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,669
they exist under universities

106
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,789
they exist under businesses

107
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,449
so this is an incredibly powerful organization
you're talking about

108
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:27,909
well it's not just an organization

109
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,620
this is something the CCP set up

110
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,070
something the ccp created and then encouraged
people to duplicate

111
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,530
as a system that just permeates the entire
Chinese economy

112
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,680
as a way to steal and process stolen information

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:54,659
this is a system that is massively larger
than what anyone today is thinking about

114
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,789
when they when they talk about Chinese espionage

115
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,370
for some reason

116
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,509
it's crazy

117
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:07,550
this is the missing link in understanding
the Chinese system for economic theft

118
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,310
they have a step-by-step process for stealing
information

119
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,319
for processing the information

120
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,630
and for drawing a profit from the stolen information

121
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,889
- how many Americans are being affected by
this?

122
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,409
well this this affects every American

123
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,800
this is something that not only affects U.S.
innovation

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,529
that not only affects U.S. companies and taxpayers
and services supported by taxes

125
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:38,860
it also affects our basic ability to innovate
and to benefit from what we create

126
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,629
in your article you quote Casey Fleming

127
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,259
who is the chairman CEO of black ops partners
corporation

128
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,669
and he gives a number that this is costing
the U.S. five trillion dollars a year

129
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,810
which is about a third of the country's GDP

130
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,809
that's so much freaking money

131
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,560
how is that possible?

132
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,370
what Casey is talking about is the potential
market value over a ten year lifespan

133
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,599
so basically not just what information was
stolen

134
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,159
but what value would that have had when it
actually went to market

135
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:17,330
across a 10-year span of market value

136
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,900
we're talking about five trillion dollars
a year

137
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,159
so in that 10-year period it would be about
five trillion dollars every year

138
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,349
that's right

139
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,509
and he's looking not just at reported cases

140
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,919
which is where things get out of whack

141
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,849
because most companies don't want to report
cyber-attacks

142
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,789
Casey's working with companies that have been
victims

143
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,850
and who don't report that they've been attacked

144
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,430
because they don't want to cause their shareholders
to freak out

145
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,810
they don't want to cause customers to freak
out

146
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,230
they don't want to get their CEOs fired

147
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,410
which has happened to, I think, Target, and
quite a few other companies that have reported

148
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,600
cyber attacks

149
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,730
so it's basically "blame the victim"

150
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,899
so Casey is seeing a different side of this

151
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,459
he's seeing the number of cases that have
not been reported

152
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,490
he's looking at cases of stolen technology
that we don't know about

153
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,120
so why don't we just hack China and steal
their ideas?

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
right

155
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,769
so there are some companies that have asked
permission to launch counter attacks

156
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,079
and they've been told not to do so

157
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,820
it's because we are a country of laws and
we can't get away with that kind of stuff

158
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,660
but this is something I hear a lot

159
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,060
What right does the U.S. have to criticize
China for this?

160
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,500
isn't the U.S. the biggest cyber aggressor
in the world?

161
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,100
U.S spying is just spying

162
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
it's just listening to conversations

163
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,360
it's listening to high-level dialogue

164
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,960
and its trying to analyze strategies and opinions
on the west

165
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,010
it's trying to figure out: are you planning
to attack us,

166
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,079
are you really our friends?

167
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,640
are you plotting against us behind our backs?

168
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
it's that kind of stuff

169
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,740
this is the kind of stuff that every spy organization
in the world is engaged in

170
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,300
the stuff China is doing is that,

171
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,970
in addition to actually stealing things from
other countries

172
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,709
and then taking that stolen information and
using it to undermine that country

173
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,160
thanks for joining us Josh

174
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
thank you

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,790
that was all really really scary

176
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,639
I provided a link in the description below

177
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,230
where you can read Josh's article

178
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,779
let me know what you think

179
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,699
