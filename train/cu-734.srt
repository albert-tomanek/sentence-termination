00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,500
International Women's Day in China.

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,040
Like Black History Month.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,310
But only a day.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,570
And way less respectful.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,380
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,860
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,640
You know, a lot of people say,

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,210
Chris, why are you always criticizing the
CCP?

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,540
How come you never talk about all the good
things the Communist Party has done?

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,720
Well today, that changes.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,330
Because I'm going to talk about International
Women's Day.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,230
The first International Women's Day was celebrated
in 1909

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,640
and was organized by The Socialist Party of
America.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
But it didn't really become big until 1922,

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,750
when the Soviet Union made it official.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,310
And until the 1970s,

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,610
it was pretty much something only celebrated
by communist and socialist countries,

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,700
until the United Nations decided to join in.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
According to the UN,

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,010
International Women's Day is a time

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,239
"to reflect on progress made,

23
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,579
to call for change

24
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,699
and to celebrate acts of courage and determination
by ordinary women."

25
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,510
Now that's inspiring.

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,840
The Chinese Communist Party made March 8 an
official holiday in 1949.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,040
Women get to take a half day off work.

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,520
And for more on how they celebrate,

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,630
we go to China Uncensored's international
woman, Shelley Zhang.

30
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,030
Hello, Chris!

31
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,310
Wow. What's with all the bags?

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,549
I'm celebrating International Women's Day.

33
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,920
With Chinese characteristics.

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,729
So women in China celebrate by going...

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,909
Sha ping! Nothing says honoring women like
50% off the original price.

36
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,680
Isn’t that...kind of a shallow way to celebrate
an important holiday?

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,750
Is celebrating President’s Day with mattress
sales?

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,190
Fair point. But that's not all China does
for International Women's Day, right?

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,120
Don't be silly Chris!

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,400
There's also...fashion shows!

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,220
Really.

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,409
Yes, like this one from southern China.

43
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,790
Or this one, held in the Great Hall of the
People

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,229
as part of a celebration hosted by the All
China Women's Federation.

45
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,049
The All-China Women's Federation.

46
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:15,120
Isn't that the women's rights organization
set up by the Chinese Communist Party?

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,040
I assume they talked about policy changes
to improve women's lives...

48
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,019
Actually, no.

49
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,169
They had a couple of dance numbers,

50
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:26,389
and some acrobats performed.

51
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,230
But it was a celebration!

52
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,049
Not a policy meeting...

53
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:36,629
Were there any other, uh, notable, International
Women's Day events?

54
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,629
Sure! I wouldn't want you to think that men
weren't involved, Chris.

55
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:46,489
In fact, look at these guys, who turned themselves
into punching bags so their wives could take

56
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,349
out their aggression.

57
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,269
And these men, who decided to literally walk
a mile in women's shoes,

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,920
and dresses, up a mountain.

59
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,330
They even stuffed their bras like 12-year-old
girls.

60
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,780
That's dedication.

61
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,240
And you're...ok with this.

62
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,780
It's kind of hard to see how that directly
relates to improving the lives of women,

63
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,680
but it's a...C+ kind of for effort?

64
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,359
Anyway, the point is, men in China also care
about International Women's Day.

65
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,760
Wait...what was that last image?

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,579
Um, nothing.

67
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,510
Was that...what I think it was?

68
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:35,139
So a mall in southern China had a competition
to find the fastest person to undo women's

69
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,760
bras one-handed.

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,510
For International Women's Day?

71
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,779
Yes.

72
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:44,730
Shelley, are you ok?

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,449
Shouldn't you be mad about this?

74
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,169
Hey, a woman won it!

75
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,999
Look, you're right, I hate this.

76
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,169
There's one entire day that's supposed to
be about women,

77
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:00,739
and we have guys literally dressing up like
clowns in high heels,

78
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:03,059
or taking off women's bras.

79
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,559
It's just too much sometimes!

80
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:07,180
I wanted to find a silver lining!

81
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,079
I even defended the All-China Women's Federation!

82
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,799
Weren't they the ones calling educated, unmarried
women over 27 "leftover women"?

83
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,080
Yeah. And they also said women shouldn't "make
a fuss" if their husbands have affairs.

84
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,250
I expected the Party to have a better track
record on women's rights.

85
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,620
After all, Mao said that women hold up half
the sky.

86
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,330
Yes he did, as mentioned in every article
that talks about women in China.

87
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,630
But while in the early days,

88
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,850
the Party did do things like abolish foot
binding,

89
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,070
Party leaders almost immediately started backtracking
on their statements about women being equal

90
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,340
because the Chinese men who they were trying
to recruit didn't like it.

91
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,230
And they cared more about having men to fight
for the Party.

92
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:00,000
I guess years of the one-child policy that
led to female infanticide and forced abortions

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
were also not good for women.

94
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,960
No. And while the state-run People's Daily
may say that women are irreplaceable in

95
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,900
"constructing socialist core values,"

96
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,870
it's only ok as long as they don't speak up.

97
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,930
Like last year, when five women were jailed
for planning an International Women's Day

98
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,820
protest against sexual harassment.

99
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,580
But surely there has to be something good
here?

100
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,580
Ok, here's something.

101
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,520
This year at the Two Sessions

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,580
China's annual legislative meetings,

103
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,880
they replaced some of the attractive female tea servers
with men.

104
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,580
Doesn't that just take jobs away from women?

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,780
Yes it does.

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,760
But at least it means that fewer women
have to get ogled by Party elders.

107
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,850
At least there's that.

108
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,200
Thanks, Shelley.

109
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,710
And thank you for watching.
