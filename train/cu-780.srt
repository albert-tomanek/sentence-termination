00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,660
Should we be afraid of China's military after looking at this?

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,160
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,540
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,080
You know, nothing screams confidence

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,250
like driving down the street in your brand-new,

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,650
bright red Lamborghini.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,770
Unless it’s driving down the street

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,250
with your brand-new,

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,290
intercontinental missiles.

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,500
On July 30,

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,440
this was broadcast on Chinese state-run media.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,520
“The commencement of the military parade

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,710
marking the 90th anniversary of the founding

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,590
of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,360
Who did they get to do that voiceover?

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
The guy from The Warriors?

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,240
“Warriors, come out to play!”

19
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,920
12,000 troops, 129 aircraft,

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,760
and more than 500 tanks,

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
missile launchers,

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
and other weapons

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,640
lined up rank and file.

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,470
All part of the PLA—

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,470
the People’s Liberation Army that was formed

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,620
on August 1, 1927.

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,340
Typically, military parades are held

28
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,360
in the heart of Beijing,

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,970
in front of large crowds,

30
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,859
under blue skies—blue skies that disappear
after the CCP

31
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:23,259
allows people to start driving their cars
again.

32
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:24,389
But this military parade

33
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,810
was held in the middle of nowhere,

34
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,479
at the Zhurihe military base

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,560
in the region of Inner Mongolia—

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,009
which is part of northeast China.

37
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,929
You may remember Zhurihe military base

38
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,340
from an episode we did two years ago.

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,090
That’s where they have a replica

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,509
of Taipei’s presidential palace,

41
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,340
so troops can practice invading Taiwan.

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,219
Anyway, this time \hthere were no adoring
crowds

43
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,020
watching the parade live,

44
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,030
but state-run TV solved that problem

45
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,990
by broadcasting the footage

46
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,479
at the top of every hour.

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,670
Holding the parade at a base

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,060
instead of in Beijing was a stylistic choice.

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,950
You know, a little grittier,

50
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,219
a little tougher.

51
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,639
A little more...

52
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,639
rap music video.

53
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,639
Never compromise

54
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,840
The dignity of the great nation is inviolable

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,170
Never give an inch

56
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,840
Not an inch of territory will be occupied

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,030
But the biggest change in style

58
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,890
had to go to Xi Jinping.

59
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,320
He rocked this full combat uniform.

60
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,760
I’ve always wondered though...

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,560
why do they have four microphones?

62
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,120
Anyway, the soldiers seemed to be

63
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:25,709
pretty into it.

64
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,290
Xi...not so much.

65
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,489
The soldiers also wore combat outfits

66
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,030
instead of ceremonial uniforms—

67
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,319
I guess to show they’re combat-ready,

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,150
following Xi’s recent instructions.

69
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,099
But should this display of China’s military

70
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,280
might worry the rest of the world?

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,359
Don’t be silly.

72
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,420
Everyone knows what a giant

73
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,340
military parade in China means!

74
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,480
It means, peace!

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,100
Peace, peaceful one, and peace…

76
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,541
World peace, peace, peaceful, peace

77
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,209
peaceful...peace, peace

78
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,620
Peaceful development, peaceful rise

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,620
Peaceful,

80
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
Peaceful development, peaceful development

81
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,480
Peace, Peace, Peace

82
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,930
The parade ended with a nuclear missile formation.

83
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,030
I’m sure it was a nuclear missile formation

84
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,219
of peace.

85
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,269
So how terrified should we be?!

86
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,269
Under Xi Jinping,

87
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,250
the budget for the military has swelled.

88
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,040
He’s laid off redundant troops,

89
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,319
and he’s been spending money

90
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,890
for an upgraded, modern army.

91
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,659
According to the Ministry of Defense,

92
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,540
almost half of the equipment seen at this
week’s parade

93
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,439
was on display for the first time.

94
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,870
Xi has also created a new branch of the military

95
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,400
modeled after DARPA in the US.

96
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,750
Its goal is to work on high-tech weaponry,

97
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,770
like stealth aircraft and electromagnetic
cannons.

98
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,469
And Xi has given himself some big new titles—

99
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,409
Core Leader, and Commander in Chief.

100
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,830
So is World War III imminent?

101
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,220
Probably not.

102
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,400
Despite the pageantry,

103
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,930
China’s army isn’t exactly ready for war.

104
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,930
For one,

105
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,150
a lot of that new military hardware

106
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,959
is just knockoffs of stolen Western tech.

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,090
And the average Chinese soldier

108
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,219
is not very well equipped.

109
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,670
He carries only about 1,500 dollars worth
of equipment.

110
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,670
Compare that to the average US soldier,

111
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,019
who carries 18,000 dollars worth of equipment.

112
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:13,170
Also, China also has no seasoned joint command—

113
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,689
because the military lacks combat experience.

114
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,180
A war isn’t the same as a parade.

115
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,570
And the history of the PLA is not,

116
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,910
shall we say,

117
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,750
the stuff of legend.

118
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,530
Ninety years ago on August 1,

119
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,530
the Chinese Communist Party

120
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,340
set up a guerrilla force called

121
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,780
the People’s Liberation Army—

122
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,920
the PLA.

123
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,160
It barely survived its first 15 years,

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,030
and then pretty much sat out World War II.

125
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,530
It let the Chinese army controlled

126
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,420
by the KMT government fight the Japanese.

127
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,420
After the war,

128
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,110
the PLA started a civil war

129
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,090
by attacking the weakened KMT army.

130
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,090
It won,

131
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,090
forcing the Chinese government

132
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,030
to flee to Taiwan.

133
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,590
This is what Mao Zedong meant when he said

134
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,070
the Communist Party “liberated” China.

135
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,980
It was straight out of The Art of War.

136
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,460
Let your enemy fight another enemy.

137
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,210
And when he’s tired,

138
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,210
sucker punch!

139
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,340
What’s that, Shelley?

140
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,000
Sucker punch is not in the Art of War?

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,520
Well, I’m just paraphrasing.

142
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,020
Anyway, then there was the Korean War—

143
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,500
where Mao favored the strategy

144
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,110
of another great military leader,

145
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,410
Zapp Brannigan.

146
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,820
Yes, Mao threw wave after wave

147
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,220
of his own men at American troops,

148
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,800
succeeding in killing 10 of his own PLA soldiers

149
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,930
for every 1 American soldier they killed.

150
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,950
But that was just one of many

151
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,410
shining victories for the PLA.

152
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,140
There was also the early 1950s

153
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,440
when they killed a bunch of people in Tibet,

154
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,480
so they could claim Tibet

155
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,260
had been part of Chinese territory

156
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,110
since ancient times.

157
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,360
And then there was the time in 1989

158
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,790
when PLA crushed all those students

159
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,630
in Tiananmen Square.

160
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,840
But the most damning weakness for the PLA

161
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,280
is that it is, and always has been,

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,590
primarily a political tool,

163
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,490
rather than a fighting force.

164
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,250
Buried in this week’s hour-plus long military
parade

165
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,480
was the real message Xi wanted to give to
troops.

166
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:13,000
“All comrades, soldiers and commanders of
the PLA,

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,040
you should unswervingly follow the absolute
leadership

168
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,180
of the Communist Party of China,

169
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,740
listen to the directions set by the Party,

170
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,150
and follow its command.

171
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,890
Wherever the Party points,

172
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,310
and you shall go to battle.”

173
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,690
And there’s something just a little too

174
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,990
spot-on about that.

175
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,380
This photo shows the troops carrying

176
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
the flags of the PLA,

177
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,700
the People’s Republic of China,

178
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,370
and the Communist Party.

179
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,090
You see, technically,

180
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,751
the Chinese military doesn’t belong

181
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,780
to the government of China.

182
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,750
It belongs to the Communist Party of China.

183
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,620
That’s why they’re also carrying

184
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,020
the communist hammer and sickle.

185
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,940
It would be like if the Republican party,

186
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,200
or the Democratic party—

187
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,080
whichever one you dislike more—

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,940
had its very own army,

189
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,150
and that army was loyal to the party

190
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,520
before the nation or the people.

191
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,440
Well, that’s these guys.

192
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,740
If you noticed in an earlier clip of the parade,

193
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,700
Xi called all of the soldiers “comrades”

194
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,860
and they called him “chairman.”

195
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,910
Instead of making the PLA

196
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,720
China’s national army,

197
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,830
Mao Zedong kept it

198
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,960
as the Communist Party’s army.

199
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
Because the most important thing

200
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,880
was that they be loyal to him.

201
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,030
And Xi Jinping is carrying out that legacy.

202
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,580
The PLA is supposed to be loyal

203
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,070
to the Communist Party,

204
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,500
and thus to Xi Jinping,

205
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,520
the head of the Communist Party.

206
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,390
The parade happens ahead of a major meeting

207
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,230
of the Communist Party later this year,

208
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,930
the 19th Party Congress.

209
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,740
You see, Xi Jinping isn’t trying to send

210
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,550
a message to foreign countries

211
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,840
that the Party’s military is powerful.

212
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Xi is sending a message

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,370
to the Party itself—

214
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,060
that the military is powerful,

215
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
and he controls it.

216
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,400
This is useful information

217
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,591
in case anyone in the Party

218
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:01,090
was thinking of maybe trying to oppose him.

219
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,610
As longtime viewers know,

220
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,810
Xi is in the middle of a life-or-death struggle

221
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,720
for control of the Communist Party

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,680
with a faction tied together loosely

223
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,190
by former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

224
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,699
You know, loosely,

225
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,280
like the way the skin hangs off his face.

226
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,460
At the 19th Party Congress this November,

227
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,370
several positions in top Party leadership

228
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,140
will open up as officials retire.

229
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Xi wants to ensure

230
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,030
that the Jiang faction people are out,

231
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,000
and that his own people are in.

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,620
Xi also will most likely not name

233
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,470
a successor to himself,

234
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,440
implying that he’d like to stay on a little
longer

235
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,270
than others might feel comfortable with.

236
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,640
And having a strong military right under his
thumb

237
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,959
might make his opposition

238
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,469
think twice about arguing.

239
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,140
Now part of the reason Xi has done this

240
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,240
is because Jiang had way more power

241
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,470
over the Party than Xi did.

242
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,890
If Xi did not amass power for himself,

243
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,620
he would have suffered the same fate

244
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,000
as former leader Hu Jintao,

245
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,030
surrounded and crippled by the Jiang faction.

246
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,360
Or possibly an even worse fate.

247
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,560
In 2012,

248
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,550
ahead of the previous Party Congress,

249
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,860
there were widespread rumors

250
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,170
of an attempted coup

251
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,270
from members of Jiang’s faction

252
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,360
that would have replaced Xi Jinping

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,320
with one of their own.

254
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,990
But is holding a military parade

255
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,060
and dressing in a combat uniform

256
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,580
a sign that Xi Jinping now has ultimate control

257
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,930
over the Communist Party?

258
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,170
Or is it just giving people Xi fatigue?

259
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,220
We’ll find out at this November’s Party
Congress.

260
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,260
It will be less of a party than the name suggests.

261
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,880
And coming up,

262
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,530
we’ll take you south of the border!

263
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,440
Like, really far south.

264
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Venezuela.

265
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,760
By way of China.

266
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,540
Well, that military parade was really something else.

267
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,760
I wonder what else Xi Jinping had to say.

268
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,100
