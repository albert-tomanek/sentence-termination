1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,870
The Chinese Communist Party

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,210
is trying to undermine Taiwan’s democracy

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,930
But it might be Taiwan

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,820
That helps democracy come to China

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,700
This is China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,710
once again coming to you from Taiwan.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,950
We are just days away from Taiwan’s elections.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,050
Taiwan is dominated by two major political
parties:

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,450
the DPP and the KMT.

10
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,920
But more and more third parties

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,840
have also been making their mark.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,961
I sat down with Huang Kuo-chang,

13
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,410
a legislator from the New Power Party,

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,820
to talk about how Taiwan’s third parties

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,010
can change democracy in Taiwan,

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,200
and even in mainland China.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,380
Thanks for joining me today.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,390
My pleasure.

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,399
So what would the Chinese communist party

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
like to see happen in this election?

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,949
I think that they want a KMT's candidate,
Mr. Han,

22
00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:00,539
to win the presidential election, but as far
as I know,

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,500
predicting from where we stand right now is
not going to happen.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,210
Well, why is the Communist Party interested
in

25
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,930
the KMT candidate winning the election?

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,000
There is no doubt that a KMT candidate

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,340
is very pro-Beijing government.

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,480
More than that, they keep silent when a political
leader

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,610
should speak out where the Beijing government

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,960
pressure the human rights in China

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:45,070
and the KMT candidate is quite cooperating
with the Beijing government

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,930
with all kinds of political agenda they are
pushing against Taiwan.

33
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,250
Can you give me an example of an instance
where they have [crosstalk]?

34
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,410
See what happened in Hong Kong this past summer.

35
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,670
I think all people around the world,

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,030
they support Hong Kong people's right

37
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,590
to fight for their basic human rights.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,969
But a KMT candidate behaved quite awkward
during that period.

39
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,010
They tried to say something

40
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,329
but they have a great pressure from the Beijing
government.

41
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:33,180
So as a result, they kept silent.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,930
That is not acceptable for the Taiwan people

43
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,150
because we have been there,

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,249
we fought for our democracy,

45
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:49,700
we fought for our freedom for the past 40
years

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:58,950
and the KMT's candidate quite cooperate with
the Beijing government.

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,579
I think that is not acceptable for the Taiwan

48
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,420
people because that is not our best interest.

49
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,300
You see that as going against Taiwan's principles
of democracy.

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Sure.

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,950
Is the Chinese Communist Party doing anything

52
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,950
to ensure that its interests come to fruition
in the election?

53
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:28,540
I think from what we saw from the last election.

54
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,019
I mean last year's local election,

55
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,079
the Beijing government tried their best

56
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,099
to penetrate our democratic system

57
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,329
to influence the final result.

58
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,489
Actual election interference.

59
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,549
Yes, and-

60
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,660
Do you think that's happening again this time?

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:58,419
Yes, they tried their best to influence the
result of our election

62
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:03,469
in order to fit their own interest,

63
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:12,069
but that was not acceptable for the Taiwanese
people

64
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:18,970
because our democracy should be decided by
Taiwanese people

65
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,669
not by the Beijing government.

66
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:29,680
We understand the cross-strait relation is
quite important.

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,830
Everyone wants peace, but we put human rights
above all.

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,190
That is what we stand for.

69
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:48,330
As a result, I think Taiwanese people

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,330
are growing stronger and stronger

71
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,750
to immute from those kinds of influence from
the Beijing government.

72
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,379
Well, I know you mentioned the Hong Kong protest.

73
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:07,090
How do you think that has affected politics
in Taiwan?

74
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,639
It has a huge political impact on politics
in Taiwan

75
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,810
because Taiwanese people observe what will
happen

76
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,389
if we accept One Country, Two Systems

77
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,169
as pushed by the Beijing government.

78
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,610
Hong Kong used to be a society with legal
order

79
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,259
that is why many foreigners loved to invest
in Hong Kong.

80
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,680
But since the Beijing government

81
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,660
tried to interfere with the public order in
Hong Kong,

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:02,190
many people are observing the legal order
is collapsing in Hong Kong.

83
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,560
That is not only bad for Hong Kong people's
human rights

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,930
but also hurting their economy.

85
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,060
From Taiwanese people that kind of scene

86
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:27,930
as we observe this past summer in Hong Kong
is terrifying.

87
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:36,419
Most Taiwanese people cannot accept what that
is going to become,

88
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,819
what we are going to become.

89
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,280
Now, it's interesting you mentioned

90
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,139
the economic impact that happened in Hong
Kong

91
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,419
because I know there are people in Taiwan

92
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,199
that say closer ties to mainland China

93
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,949
will be better for the Taiwanese economy,

94
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,180
but you don't think that's the case?

95
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:00,620
If you look at what happened for the past
20 years before 2016

96
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,930
that is the previous administration tried
to persuade Taiwanese people

97
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,110
if we signed across-strait service trade pact,

98
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,789
it will help the economy in Taiwan.

99
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:23,120
But since the trade war between the United
States and China,

100
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,250
Taiwan actually benefits from [it],

101
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:35,750
we are not part of the trade partnership with
China.

102
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:45,380
Otherwise, when the United States sanctioned
China,

103
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,280
Taiwan might become the collateral damage.

104
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,430
So if you look at the economic numbers for
the past three years,

105
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,539
Taiwan is doing better and better.

106
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:09,430
What is the most important for us is to upgrade
our own industry,

107
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,909
not put our hope into China.

108
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:21,219
You know, don't wrong if we put our whole
economic growth,

109
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:25,300
if we put our hope on the Chinese market,

110
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,440
that is going to hurt us.

111
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
I see.

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,560
So, I can tell you're very concerned that

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,550
China's authoritarian regime could damage
Taiwan's democracy.

114
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,200
Do you think it's possible that Taiwan's democracy

115
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,940
could likewise have a positive influence in
China?

116
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:50,430
That is what we have been hoping for the past
20 years.

117
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,290
As long as Taiwan can have a healthy democracy,

118
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:04,680
the whole world will witness in the so-called
Chinese community,

119
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,770
democratic life is not only possible while
also beneficial.

120
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:16,930
China has been telling the whole world democracy

121
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,940
is not suitable for the Chinese community.

122
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,900
I think if you look at what happened in Taiwan,

123
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,820
Taiwan's democracy becomes stronger and stronger.

124
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,950
Taiwanese people's human rights have been
taken care of

125
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,930
and everyone who lives in Taiwan

126
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,760
can pursue their happiness and their dreams.

127
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,860
Democracy can work not only in Western countries

128
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,140
but also in Chinese community.

129
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,829
So it seems in this election the candidates

130
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,100
most likely to win the presidency

131
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,110
are either Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic
Progressive Party

132
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,110
or Han Kuo-yu of the KMT Party.

133
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,620
First, what do you think would happen to Taiwan-China
relations

134
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,690
if Tsai won?

135
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,570
From what I observe,

136
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:29,440
President Tsai is going to win her second
term.

137
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,089
There's no doubt about that.

138
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:39,550
But what is more important is the congressional
election

139
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:47,959
because there are a number of important legislations

140
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:54,579
which have not been finished in our term.

141
00:10:54,579 --> 00:11:01,380
They have to be finished by last Congress.

142
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:08,600
So we are hoping the pro-democracy camp

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,320
can win the majority of seats in Congress.

144
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,710
But as far as the president goes,

145
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:25,199
I think President Tsai is going to continue
her previous pace,

146
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:36,910
trying to protect Taiwan's democracy and at
the same time

147
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:43,490
maintain a stable relation with the Beijing
government

148
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:51,370
trying not to provoke the Beijing government,

149
00:11:51,370 --> 00:12:02,140
but also showing all the people in China democracy
can work in Taiwan.

150
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,760
It also can be done in China.

151
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,529
So what do you think would happen if Han Kuo-yu

152
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:15,079
wins the presidency or the KMT wins a majority
in the Congress?

153
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:29,050
It doesn't look like it-
It is a horrifying thing if Han Kuo-yu wins

154
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,160
the election

155
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:44,640
I'm afraid the Xi Jinping's political agenda
might come to reality.

156
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,769
The so-called one country-two system

157
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:57,839
will be implemented by the Han Kuo-yu.

158
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,020
Do you think it would be that bad?

159
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Yes.

160
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,230
Even after the Hong Kong protests,

161
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,120
wouldn't most people in Taiwan fight against
that, specifically,

162
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,610
the one country-two systems model even if
Han or the KMT won?

163
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:28,130
But Han did not say anything to protest

164
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:43,959
the political agenda by the Xi Jinping.That
is why his credibility is always in doubt

165
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,009
for most Taiwanese people.

166
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:53,850
We are not sure how aggressive he will become

167
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,550
if he do win the presidential election.

168
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:06,690
But that chance is not the kind of chance
we can take.

169
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,730
So in 2014, the mass of sunflower movement
protest

170
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,730
showed that many people in Taiwan were very
concerned about

171
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:21,899
the economic ties between Taiwan and mainland
China.Do you think that's still the case today?

172
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,980
If you look at the number,

173
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:35,650
the trade between China and Taiwan is still
going on,

174
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:46,529
there's not influence by the fact that DPP
is the ruling party,

175
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:57,290
but our government is trying their best 
to invest

176
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,740
more in other countries other than mainland
China.

177
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,760
I think the economic situation around the
world

178
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,259
will become quite complicated given the fact
that

179
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:21,839
the trade war between the United States and
China is quite uncertain.

180
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,930
We are not sure what is going to happen for
the next two or three years.

181
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:37,170
But in any event, it's very important for
Taiwan

182
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:52,190
to keep growing our own economy and trying
to have a sustainable system.

183
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:59,270
We have to avoid relying too much on the Chinese
market.

184
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,389
Otherwise, it's very possible for us to lose

185
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,899
our own political independence.

186
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,589
So as leader of one of the most successful
third parties in Taiwan,

187
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:23,819
what does your party see the future of Taiwan
China relations?

188
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:33,870
I think that is a very difficult question
because in some sense

189
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:41,790
it would depend on what will happen within
China.

190
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:48,449
We always support all kind of democratic movement

191
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:58,720
or any fights for human rights within China.

192
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,589
We are hoping more and more Chinese people,

193
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:10,930
they will stand up to fight against the Chinese
communist regime.

194
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:19,209
If that happens then we can seize the moment

195
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:25,069
to improve the political system in China.

196
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:31,200
As long as the political system changed within
China,

197
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,720
Taiwan can become safer and Taiwan can grow

198
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,490
a more healthy relation with China.

199
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,799
So you think Taiwan can play a big role in
bringing democracy to China?

200
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,940
Sure.

201
00:17:51,940 --> 00:18:01,100
I think that is very important and significant.

202
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:07,030
If you look at what is happening in Taiwan,

203
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:17,970
why there are so many Chinese people who fought
for democracy,

204
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,809
used Taiwan as an example to show the whole
Chinese people

205
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:28,159
democracy can work.

206
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,890
The most important thing for us is to continue

207
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:45,289
to support that kind of democratic efforts
happening in China.

208
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:51,830
That is not only beneficial for the Chinese
people,

209
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,850
but it is also the best interest of Taiwan.

210
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,100
So moving forward, what would you like

211
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,980
to see happen between US and Taiwan relations?

212
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:13,980
We want to establish a formal official relation
with the United States.

213
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:20,030
We are very grateful for all kinds of good
efforts

214
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:27,390
done by the US Congress for the past two years,

215
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,020
such as the Taiwan Travel Act and the Taipei
Act.

216
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:39,669
They are very helpful for Taiwan to continue

217
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:47,270
to grow a stronger relation with Washington,
D.C.

218
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,220
But more than that,

219
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,750
I would be happy to see we signed a trade
deal

220
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,980
with the United States

221
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:07,240
to continue the economic partnership

222
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,740
between the United States and Taiwan.

223
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,370
And moving forward beyond that,

224
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,789
eventually I hope we can establish

225
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:25,809
an official diplomatic relations with Washington,
D.C.

226
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,020
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

227
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,680
We're very anxious to see what happens in
these elections.

228
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,480
My pleasure.

229
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
Thank you.
