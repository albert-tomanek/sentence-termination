1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:03,700
China can destroy US targets in space.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,509
That’s according to a new Pentagon report.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,150
Carnival in Italy has a surprise guest.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,750
And China reaches out to the Venezuelan opposition.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,560
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,700
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,550
This week’s China news headlines.

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,640
China is the largest

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,469
most powerful authoritarian state in the world.

15
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,399
Plus they’ve got lasers,

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,750
and they know how to use them.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,940
That’s at least the message

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,430
of the latest Hollywood blockbuster,

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,280
Challenges to Security in Space.

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,800
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
Oh, that’s not a movie.

22
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,199
It’s a report from the Pentagon.

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,199
Makes sense.

24
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,050
I did think the special effects were somewhat
lacking.

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,690
The report says “China and Russia, in particular,

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,219
are developing a variety of means to exploit

27
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,789
perceived US reliance on space-based systems

28
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,380
and challenge the US position in space.”

29
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,070
Basically space warfare is already here.

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,250
The future is now!

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,440
The scary future.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,350
Not the cool hoverboards future they promised
us.

33
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,500
Most people today don’t think about how
much we rely on space.

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,580
Satellites are used for everything from consumer
GPS,

35
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,700
to military weapons targeting,

36
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,390
to intelligence gathering.

37
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,820
And China and Russia are building space lasers

38
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,250
to destroy these satellite networks.

39
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,200
“China likely will field a ground-based
laser weapon

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,020
that can counter low-orbit space-based sensors
by 2020.”

41
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,560
That’s part of the reason President Trump

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,830
has been pushing for a Space Force.

43
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,110
That and of course the obvious Warhammer 40K
references.

44
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,710
Italy knows what’s up.

45
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,440
Because the recent carnival in Italy

46
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,960
had this gigantic Trump float.

47
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,790
There’s a lot going on there,

48
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,440
but if you look at his right leg,

49
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,220
you’ll notice the crest of the People’s
Republic of China

50
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,920
and I’m pretty sure that’s Xi Jinping’s
face.

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,800
Another float also had Xi Jinping, Putin,

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,840
and Trump holding down a dove

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,550
as Kim Jong-Un stabbed it with a nuclear missile.

54
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,810
Carnival seems like a lot of fun.

55
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,300
What’s next, a Cthulhu float?

56
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,790
What’s that, Shelley?

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,530
Ok, close enough.

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,860
Speaking of space wars,

59
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,970
the Trump administration

60
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,390
is also preparing an executive order

61
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,070
that would ban telecommunications companies
in the United States

62
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,180
from using Chinese equipment in their 5G networks,

63
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,230
in particular Huawei.

64
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,500
Though it seems like the executive order won’t
mention Huawei,

65
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,300
or even China by name.

66
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,550
Rather it’s geared at “adversarial powers.”

67
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,450
No adversarial power in particular.

68
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,860
It could be anyone.

69
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,290
And in trade war news,

70
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,580
it looks like the US could extend the deadline

71
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,350
on trade negotiations with China by 60 days.

72
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,450
Otherwise, if no agreement was reached

73
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,890
by its current deadline, March 1,

74
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,770
the US has said it would slap 25% tariffs

75
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,390
on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.

76
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,130
The biggest challenge though—

77
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,770
making sure China keeps the promises it makes.

78
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,950
To that end, according to anonymous sources

79
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,870
who spoke to the New York Times,

80
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,550
“American negotiators want to create a mechanism

81
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,260
that would automatically raise tariffs on
Chinese goods

82
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,730
if its exports to the United States keep rising.”

83
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,360
Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,220
should be meeting soon to hammer out

85
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,920
more of the trade deal.

86
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,380
And something tells me Trump

87
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,710
may be getting a slightly frostier welcome

88
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,060
compared to the last time he was in the Forbidden
City.

89
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,190
That was in 2017,

90
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,340
before he launched the trade war.

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,170
The Chinese regime has been propping up

92
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,090
the dictator of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro

93
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,280
with money, weapons, and surveillance technology.

94
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
The only problem—

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,310
other than that not being cool—

96
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,900
is that now this guy, Juan Guaido,

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,660
has declared himself interim president.

98
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,120
And most of the world is backing him.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,290
Man, he looks like Obama.

100
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,950
Wait, have we ever seen the two of them

101
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,370
in the same room at the same time?

102
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,370
Come to think of it,

103
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,030
I’ve never seen Batman and Shelley

104
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,900
in the same room at the same time.

105
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,350
I wonder…

106
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,530
What’s that, Shelley?

107
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,530
Oh?

108
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,709
Oh really?

109
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:15,709
But anyway,

110
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,910
China has given big loans to Venezuela—

111
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,030
about 20 billion dollars worth.

112
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,700
They’re supposed to pay that back in oil.

113
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,389
And if Maduro goes down,

114
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,370
which seems more and more likely,

115
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,310
the Chinese regime is going to want to make
sure

116
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,500
Guaido doesn’t renege on those agreements—

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,590
or do what the new prime minister of Malaysia
has done,

118
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,680
and cancel a whole bunch of Chinese investment
deals.

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
For Guaido’s part,

120
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,820
he needs China to switch from supporting Maduro
to him

121
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,200
if he wants to get into power.

122
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,710
And according to the Wall Street Journal,

123
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,990
“Chinese diplomats...have held debt negotiations
in Washington

124
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,060
in recent weeks with representatives of Juan
Guaidó.”

125
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,820
I can’t imagine Maduro will be dancing much
longer.

126
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,060
That’s it for this week’s China news headlines.

127
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,070
Before we go,

128
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,120
now is the time when I answer questions from
you,

129
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,970
my loyal 50-Cent Army—

130
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,570
fans of the show who support what we do

131
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,320
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

132
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,920
BlueFox asks,

133
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,470
“Chris, do you think the CCP plans to

134
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,130
meddle with the 2020 elections coming up?”

135
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,400
Well that is a good question.

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,370
It’s certain that the Chinese Communist
Party

137
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,010
does enjoy undermining the democratic process

138
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,880
when it's in the Party’s interest.

139
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,150
It’s widely believed Beijing did meddle

140
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,360
in the recent elections in Taiwan.

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,970
Mainly it was through social media,

142
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,500
and supporting certain candidates.

143
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,980
President Trump certainly made a similar claim

144
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,340
during the 2018 midterm elections.

145
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,620
“Regrettably we found that China

146
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,800
has been attempting to interfere

147
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,560
in our upcoming 2018 election —

148
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,870
coming up in November.

149
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,570
Against my administration.

150
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,590
They do not want me or us to win

151
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,110
because I am the first president ever

152
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,070
to challenge China on trade.”

153
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,150
And while there wasn’t a whole lot of proof
of that,

154
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,919
it’s not far fetched to imagine the Chinese
regime

155
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,860
would like to ensure a more China-friendly
president

156
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,300
takes the reins in 2020.

157
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,590
And earlier this year,

158
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,070
the Director of US National Intelligence said

159
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,820
in a worldwide threat assessment

160
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,210
to the Senate Intelligence Committee,

161
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,440
that Russia, China and Iran,

162
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,729
“probably already are looking to the 2020
U.S. elections

163
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,020
as an opportunity to advance their interests.”

164
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,710
Specifically he wrote they

165
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,150
“will use online influence operations

166
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,180
to try to weaken democratic institutions,

167
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,150
undermine U.S. alliances and partnerships

168
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,740
and shape policy outcomes

169
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,990
in the United States and elsewhere.”

170
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,680
So a lot to look forward to—

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,290
besides the normal chaos of the US election
cycle.

172
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,350
Thanks for your question, BlueFox.

173
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,410
