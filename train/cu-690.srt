00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,360
China Attacks Australia

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,320
And joins the UN Human Rights Council

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,440
While Apple uses ethnic slave labor

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week's China news headlines

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,520
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.\h
And I need your help. YouTube has been secretly\h\h

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,680
unsubscribing people, demonetizing us, and\h
not recommending our videos. So please,\h\h

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,920
Revenge! That’s how Chinese state-run China\h
Daily is framing the relationship between China\h\h

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
and Australia. This editorial\h
accuses the Australian government\h\h

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
of “stigmatizing and demonizing”\h
the relationship with China.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,880
Keep in mind, this is coming from the same regime\h\h

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,800
that called Australia the\h
poor white trash of Asia.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,640
And has launched a trade war against\h
Australia for political grievances.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,520
That’s because Australia has started to wise up to\h\h

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,960
the Chinese Communist Party’s campaign\h
of unrestricted warfare, and push back.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,320
Part of that was related to a 2018 Belt and Road\h
agreement with the Australian state of Victoria.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
The Australian federal government is now\h
considering cancelling that agreement.

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,960
Why? Because it could put the\h
work of Australian scientists\h\h

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,800
into the hands of the Chinese\h
Communist dictatorship.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,640
The China Daily editorial says\h
this “is obviously intended\h\h

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,120
as an act of revenge by Australian\h
Prime Minister Scott Morrison.”

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,960
You know, I’m not sure China Daily understands\h
what it wrote. Revenge implies that someone\h\h

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,960
wronged you. Surely China Daily isn’t saying\h
the Chinese regime wronged Australia? Are they?

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,240
2020 is finally over! And to kick off 2021,\h
China will be starting a three year term\h\h

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,960
on the United Nations Human Rights Council!

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,320
What? You thought this year would be better?\h
Haha, enjoy your indefinite lockdown, you schlebs.

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,640
But from a certain point of view, China joining\h
the human rights council actually makes sense. You\h\h

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,720
see, the Chinese Communist Party has first-hand\h
experience with how to violate human rights.

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,080
A new report from Buzzfeed news has identified\h
hundreds of detention centers for Uyghur Muslims\h\h

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,080
in China’s Xinjiang region, and “At least 135\h
of these compounds also hold factory buildings.”

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,320
They identified these factories from\h
satellite photos from Planet Labs.\h\h

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Here you can see six factories, highlighted in\h
blue. They tend to be long rectangular buildings.

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,440
This the 21st Century. Who would\h
be using ethnic slave labor?\h\h

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
Well, for one, Apple’s longtime supplier!

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,520
“Lens Technology, which makes iPhone glass\h
and is owned by China’s richest woman,\h\h

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,760
received Uighur Muslim laborers\h
transferred from Xinjiang.”

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,720
That’s on top of several other Apple suppliers\h\h

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,320
that have also been accused\h
of using Uyghur forced labor.

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Apple is taking these accusations\h
very seriously. So seriously in fact,\h\h

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,880
that they’re lobbying against a bill\h
that would stop Uyghur forced labor.

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,440
But that’s not enough for Apple. No, they\h
are dedicated. According to a new lawsuit,\h\h

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,520
Apple also punished an American employee\h
for approving an app critical of Beijing.

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,520
But I don’t want to sound like I’m\h
being too hard on Apple. Because\h\h

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,840
there’s plenty of criticism to go around!

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,040
The EU has struck a major\h
investment deal with China.

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Great! Now the EU can make lots of\h
money off an authoritarian regime\h\h

47
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
that uses concentration camps and slave labor!

48
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,120
But don’t worry, because as part of the deal,\h
“China has agreed to ‘make continued and\h\h

49
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,640
sustained efforts’ to ratify international\h
conventions on banning forced labor.”

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Good. Continued and sustained efforts. Not a\h
promise to end Uyghur forced labor. No penalties\h\h

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,200
if they don’t. And certainly no inspections\h
to see if they are. This is about trust.

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,360
And considering how well China honors its\h
international commitments, like the One Country,\h\h

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,680
Two systems model in Hong Kong, I’m sure the\h
Uyghurs will be fine. But more importantly,\h\h

54
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,840
Europe's corporate elite will get richer.

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,240
But it’s not just European elite that benefit\h
from this investment deal. It’s the whole world!

56
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,320
That’s why this deal is just like China and the EU\h
jointly presenting a New Year gift to the world.

57
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
According to my favorite\h
state-run media, the Global Times,\h\h

58
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,640
this is about “win-win cooperation”\h
and “peaceful development.”

59
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,880
Welcome to 2021!

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,960
But there is some good news.
On Dec. 21, U.S. Secretary\h\h

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,600
of State Mike Pompeo announced new visa\h
restrictions on Chinese Communist Party\h\h

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
(CCP) officials believed to have\h
engaged in human rights abuses and\h\h

63
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
their immediate family members. US Department\h
of Homeland Security acting Secretary\h\h

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,480
Chad Wolf also said his department was\h
looking at further restrictions on China.

65
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,200
Hold on, Chad Wolf?\h\h

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,080
That’s the Chaddest name I’ve ever heard.\h
I’m sure Xi Jinping isn’t too fond of him.

67
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,080
The Trump administration is also bolstering an\h
order barring U.S. investment in Chinese firms\h\h

68
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
with ties to the Communist military.

69
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,440
In a statement, Secretary of State\h
Mike Pompeo said “The Executive Order\h\h

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,320
applies to all transactions by U.S. persons,\h
including individuals, institutional investors,\h\h

71
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,040
pension funds, university endowments,\h
banks, bond issuers, venture capital firms,\h\h

72
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,920
private equity firms, index firms, and other U.S.\h
entities, including those operating overseas.”

73
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:37,840
The Trump Administration is pathetic. They really\h
should take a cue from the EU about how much money\h\h

74
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,640
can be made in China! At least American media\h
is warning American investors about missing out!

75
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,720
And coming up after the break, is the\h
coronavirus getting worse inside Mainland China?

76
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,200
Welcome back.

77
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
Remember how China beat the coronavirus in 2020?

78
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,520
Well, it’s 2021, and the coronavirus\h
is getting worse inside Mainland China.

79
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Footage emerged of authorities putting\h
paper seals on residents homes.\h\h

80
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,200
If authorities find the seal is\h
broken, they assume the family\h\h

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,840
violated restrictions and will\h
be sent to a quarantine center.

82
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,880
I mean, that’s slightly better than Chinese police\h
just beating people up for violating restrictions.

83
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,480
It’s hard to know how bad the CCP Virus\h
is inside China right now. Of course,\h\h

84
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,400
it’s hard to know how bad it ever was. But\h
according to a new study, half a million people\h\h

85
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,640
may have had the CCP virus in Wuhan. That’s\h
almost ten times the official figure.

86
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,120
Now what’s really scary about this study,\h\h

87
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
is that it was done by the Chinese Center\h
for Disease Control and Prevention.\h\h

88
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,440
That’s run by the state. And so if China’s\h
CDC is saying the outbreak was 10 times worse\h\h

89
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,320
than official figures, that suggests to me that\h
the numbers are actually even higher than that.\h\h

90
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,160
So high, that they had to increase the official\h
figures because they couldn’t cover it up.

91
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,240
But at least from a certain point of\h
view, China did beat the coronavirus.

92
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Speaking of the coronavirus,\h\h

93
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,320
it turns out that the Chinese Communist Party\h
has been suppressing coronavirus research.

94
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,400
This is my shocked face.

95
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,280
The Party is giving money to military\h
scientists researching the coronavirus,\h\h

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,400
but it is also “monitoring their findings\h
and mandating that the publication of any\h\h

97
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,800
data or research must be approved by a new\h
task force controlled by...Xi Jinping.”

98
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,840
Basically the documents show that the coronavirus\h
coverup goes right to the top. And meanwhile,\h\h

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,440
the Chinese Communist Party is still\h
trying to control the narrative\h\h

100
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,840
by claiming that the virus didn’t come from\h
China. Including from imported frozen foods.

101
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
Like I said, it was the pizza rolls all along!!

102
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,400
The 10 Hong Kong activists who were arrested after\h\h

103
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,560
attempting to flee the city on a\h
speedboat, have been sentenced.

104
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,440
Keep in mind, these Hong Kong citizens were held\h
and tried in Mainland China. Which is exactly\h\h

105
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,200
what last year's protests were\h
originally trying to prevent.

106
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,280
The activists were sentenced\h
to up to three years in prison.

107
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
Maybe the UN Human Rights Council should look\h
into this. And their newest member can help!

108
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
The sentencing of the ten\h
Hongkongers follows this:\h\h

109
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,200
A Chinese citizen journalist has been sentenced\h
to four years for reporting on the CCP Virus.

110
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,280
Zhang Zhan is a former lawyer. “For several months\h\h

111
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,120
she shared videos that showed crowded hospitals\h
and residents worrying about their incomes.”

112
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,920
But for challenging the state’s official\h
narrative, she got four years in prison!

113
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,240
She really should have just\h
waited until the CCP realizes\h\h

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
it can’t keep covering things up,\h
and changes its official narrative.

115
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
One of Zhang’s lawyers said that\h
she’s been on a hunger strike\h\h

116
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,800
since June to protest her arrest, because she was\h
punished for exercising her freedom of speech.

117
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
“When told that she could be\h
imprisoned...Zhang ‘quoted\h\h

118
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,320
a passage from the bible and said she\h
would expect herself to die in prison.’”

119
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,120
You can’t help but admire that kind of\h
courage. While also being horribly sad.

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,400
But coming up after the break, there’s\h
actually some good China news this week.\h\h

121
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
Coming from America.

122
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,080
Welcome back.

123
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,480
To end the week on a positive note,\h
there’s some good news related to China.

124
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,040
It comes as President Trump signed\h
a massive omnibus spending bill\h\h

125
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,560
on Sunday—which we talked about on\h
our other show, America Uncovered.

126
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:07,040
One of the dozens of random bills crammed\h
into it was this, starting on page 5,037:\h\h

127
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
The Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020.

128
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,800
It says the US should conduct regular sales\h
and transfers of weapons to Taiwan, in order to\h\h

129
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,360
enhance its self-defense capabilities, including\h
undersea warfare and air defense capabilities.

130
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,160
This bill represents a renewed US\h
commitment to lend military support.\h\h

131
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,360
That’s important, because Taiwan is facing more\h
and more threats from the Chinese military—which\h\h

132
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
I’ll talk about in a special episode tomorrow.

133
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,240
The bill also says the US should advocate\h
for Taiwan’s participation in international\h\h

134
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,640
organizations where statehood is\h
not a requirement. That includes\h\h

135
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,520
the United Nations and the\h
World Health Organization.

136
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,640
I just hope the US can get Taiwan\h
back into Birdlife International—the\h\h

137
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,160
bird watching group that kicked Taiwan out back\h
in September after facing pressure from Beijing.

138
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,760
I really don’t think Birdlife should\h
require statehood for members.\h\h

139
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,040
I mean, they don’t require it for the birds.

140
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,840
And speaking of things crammed into that\h
omnibus bill, let’s flip to page 5,090:\h\h

141
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,760
The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020.

142
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,360
One of the cheeky things it does is seek\h
to establish a US consulate in Tibet.

143
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,040
And if the CCP won’t allow\h
that, which of course it won’t,\h\h

144
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,640
then the US won’t authorize any\h
new Chinese consulates in the US.

145
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,840
So there!

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,080
The bill also allows the US government to\h\h

147
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,560
sanction individual Chinese officials\h
who violate human rights in Tibet.\h\h

148
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,520
That includes officials who interfere with the\h
reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. Not kidding.

149
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,160
For more than a decade, the\h
atheist Chinese Communist Party\h\h

150
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
has sought to regulate Buddhist reincarnation.\h\h

151
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,480
Their long game is to eventually pick a future\h
Dalai Lama who they can make into a CCP stooge.

152
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,160
After the Tibetan Policy and\h
Support Act passed on Sunday,\h\h

153
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,040
China’s Foreign Ministry wasted no\h
time, insisting that “Reincarnation\h\h

154
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,880
of living Buddhas including the Dalai\h
Lama must comply with Chinese laws.”

155
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,720
And that the US is interfering\h
in China’s internal affairs.

156
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
But really, when it comes to reincarnation,\h\h

157
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,840
isn’t China interfering in the\h
Universe’s internal affairs?

158
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,720
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from you,\h\h

159
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon!

160
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,040
Jose Vega asks, “Chris, every\h
conservative is now on Parler.\h\h

161
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,840
You should be there too, so we can follow you.”

162
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, Jose, I’m not a conservative. Or a liberal\h
for that matter. No, I think the whole left right\h\h

163
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,680
political spectrum is completely wrong. It’s more\h
like a political horseshoe. Because when you go to\h\h

164
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,520
the extreme on either side, it loops back in on\h
itself. And I... am at the top of the horseshoe.

165
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,840
I call it being politically regressive. I’m\h
a regressivist! I believe in things like,\h\h

166
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,760
mandatory abortions for all women and men.\h
Universal basic gun, starting at age 3.\h\h

167
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,360
And making schools unsafe spaces. Mainly\h
by releasing large apex predators.

168
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,040
Can’t argue about politics if you’re running for\h
your life. Unless you have really good cardio.

169
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,880
Anyway, I am on Parler. You can\h
follow me @Lord of the Uncensoring.
 \h

170
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,080
