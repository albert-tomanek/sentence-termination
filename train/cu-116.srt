00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,280
The World Freaks Out

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,240
Over a Deadly Chinese Virus

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,660
How far will it spread?

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,460
This is China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,730
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,640
An outbreak of a deadly coronavirus

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,090
from the Chinese city of Wuhan is spreading.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,340
It’s now surpassed the number of people
affected by SARS in 2003.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,630
SARS was another deadly disease

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,130
the Chinese Communist Party tried to cover
up,

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,980
which only made it worse.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,980
It was a bad idea that time.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,770
It’s a bad idea now.

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,460
The initial coverup of this new coronavirus

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,820
has made the spread worse,

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,260
and the coronavirus has now spread to every
region of China.

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,140
The rest of the world is freaking out.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,360
Despite the fact that there are still

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,290
fewer than one hundred cases outside China.

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,060
World Health Organization officials have now
declared it

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,440
a “global health emergency.”

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,060
The rest of the world is responding to the
coronavirus in different ways.

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,140
Foreign companies operating in China are shutting
down.

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,040
For example, Starbucks has closed 2,000 stores
in China.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,440
So hey, there you go.

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,810
There’s your silver lining.

27
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,510
At least people don’t have to suffer from
a terrible disease

28
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,350
and terrible coffee.

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,920
Other companies are doing even more to help
the people trapped in China.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,100
For instance, there’s been a huge shortage
of medical masks.

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,380
So Boeing is donating a quarter million.

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,810
Meanwhile, a Danish newspaper printed this
political cartoon.

33
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,130
Which the Chinese Communist Party was really
not cool with.

34
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,080
The Chinese embassy in Denmark demanded an
apology

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,680
for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,650
You know, I think the Chinese people would
prefer an apology

37
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,990
from the Chinese government for covering up
the virus.

38
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,320
But, the Chinese people won’t be getting
an apology.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,150
The Danish newspaper refused.

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,780
And to no one’s surprise,

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,630
the Chinese Communist Party is also not apologizing.

42
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,460
Fortunately for Americans living in China,

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,670
the US State Department chartered a plane

44
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,259
to evacuate US Citizens in Wuhan back to the
United States.

45
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,259
Don’t worry,

46
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,870
“The individuals on board the flight were
screened before take off,

47
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,779
monitored during the flight by medical personnel

48
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,650
and screened again when the plane landed.”

49
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,400
They’re also being voluntarily quarantined

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,049
at a military base in Southern California
for three days.

51
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,980
The US is planning more evacuation flights
from Wuhan.

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,360
And other countries have also been looking
at

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,060
evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.

54
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,349
Some, like Japan, have also been given the
go ahead by China.

55
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,849
Not Taiwan, though.

56
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:36,260
Meanwhile, Russia is just closing its entire
border with China.

57
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,049
And when Putin says, “Close the southern
border,”

58
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,069
no one in his country is allowed to protest.

59
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,719
And if you’re watching this show illegally
from China,

60
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,889
now might be a good time to leave.

61
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,540
Because commercial airlines around the world

62
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,760
are suspending a lot of flights to and from
China.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,609
It’s either an attempt to halt the spread
of the virus,

64
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,480
or there’s a curious lack of demand for
flights to China right now.

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Good news, though.

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,739
Australian scientists have been the first

67
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,499
to recreate the virus outside of China.

68
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,930
Wait, why is that good news?!

69
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,439
Well, supposedly this is a major breakthrough

70
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,019
that will hopefully help find a cure.

71
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,370
That, or some intern is playing a real life
version of Plague Inc.

72
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,900
But with the virus spreading rapidly around
the world,

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,209
international health organizations are like,

74
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,409
can we...please help, China?

75
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,430
Please?

76
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,809
And the Chinese regime was like, naww.

77
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:33,370
They denied help from the CDC.

78
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,280
That’s the US Centers for Disease Control.

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,569
I mean, you wouldn’t want them snooping
around

80
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,129
and exposing a massive coverup, right?

81
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,700
But after more begging, the Chinese regime
announced

82
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,440
it would finally accept some limited help
from the World Health Organization.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,139
The organization in turn “praised China’s
response to the outbreak,

84
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,260
including its rapid identification of the
virus

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,339
and its ‘openness to sharing information
with W.H.O. and other countries.’”

86
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:03,180
The World Health Organization praised China’s
response?

87
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,920
I wonder if that has anything to do with why
they got access to China.

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,370
Or maybe it’s because the head of the organization

89
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,260
is such good buddies with Xi Jinping.

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,060
And that’s it for this update on the coronavirus.

91
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,230
What do you think of how the world is freaking
out?

92
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,720
And how are you freaking out?

93
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,530
Tell me in the comments below.

94
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,110
And, want to stand up to the Chinese Communist
Party yourself?

95
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,310
Join the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army.

96
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,150
That’s what I call the fans who support
China Uncensored

97
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,780
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

98
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,690
YouTube demonetizes a lot of our episodes,

99
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,620
so we rely on your support to keep the show
going.

100
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,300
Today’s question comes from William Adderholdt.

101
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,910
“I have a question for the show.

102
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,560
What exactly are these "live markets"

103
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,760
where the epidemic supposedly started?

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,050
How unsanitary are they?”

105
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,050
Good question.

106
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,220
These markets are often called “wet markets”
in Chinese.

107
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,840
They’re usually open air markets

108
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,431
where you can buy food from different vendors.

109
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,200
And they sell everything from fruits and vegetables

110
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,440
to raw meat, seafood, and live animals.

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,390
They’re a huge part of China’s food supply
chain.

112
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,860
And some of them are...not super sanitary.

113
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,900
Chopping fish on the floor.

114
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,580
Butchering pork without gloves.

115
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,090
And freshly slaughtered chickens just hanging
around.

116
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,850
This is the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan—

117
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,210
regarded as the epicenter of the outbreak.

118
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,140
It’s been closed down now.

119
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,670
They sold all sorts of weird stuff.

120
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,170
This was a menu at one of the more...exotic
animal stalls.

121
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,030
To be fair, according to some reports,

122
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,160
the *first* person reportedly infected with
the coronavirus—

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,050
on December 1—never came into contact with
that wet market.

124
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,350
There’s a lot of conflicting information
right now

125
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,400
and it will be months before we know what
happened.

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,910
But the virus did somehow spread *to* that
market.

127
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,520
And wet markets are the perfect place to spread
disease.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,300
Because they’re pretty much unregulated

129
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,540
and having live animal feces,

130
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
blood from slaughtered animals,

131
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,230
and fresh produce all next to each other is
extremely unsanitary.

132
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,560
But what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,
right?

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,040
Thanks for your question.

134
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,510
And thank you for watching.

135
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,780
Hope you all stay safe and healthy.

136
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,090
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.
