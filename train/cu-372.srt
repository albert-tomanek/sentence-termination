1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,380
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:06,260
how the Chinese Communist Party is influencing
Australian politics.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,910
I'm Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,650
Chinese money has been pouring into Australia

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,380
over the past few years.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,160
Some of it is connected to the Chinese Communist
Party--

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,800
and it's being used to influence

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,149
the Australian government and its policies.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,460
So I sat down with Craig Kelly--

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,789
who's a representative in Australia's

12
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:28,829
House of Representatives--

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,440
to talk about why this is such a big deal.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Kelly.

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,430
So, the Chinese communist party is

16
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,680
buying influence with Australian members of
Parliament.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,430
What's the going rate these days?

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,510
Very funny question.

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,330
We saw our ex-Labor senator, Senator Dastyari,

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,480
accept a couple of thousand dollars that we
know about

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,390
from influential Chinese businessmen and actually

22
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,740
being forced to resign from the Senate.

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,980
So, the price seems to coming at the moment.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,500
It seems like to sell out your country,

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
a thousand dollars,

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,360
a couple thousand isn't that much.

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,350
Well, look. What the real issue with Mr. Dastyari

28
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,869
was that the Australian government,

29
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,069
both the coalition, which is in government

30
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,009
now and the Labor party who are the opposition

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,759
had a bipartisan position on China's influence

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,969
in the South China Sea.

33
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:26,409
What Senator Dastyari actually did ...

34
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,950
he went to our Parliamentary offices in Sydney,
special Parliamentary office of Federal

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,740
Parliamentarians where special interviews
are held

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,789
with heads of state, went into the commandeered
the

37
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,909
main interview room, and took two left turns
with the

38
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:45,479
Australian crests in front to give all the
official,

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,689
stood on one, looked to himself,

40
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:49,770
had his Chinese business friend on the other

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,039
lead turn, and basically went and said views

42
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:58,520
that were completely contrary to both his
own party,

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,630
the Australian government, the Parliament
of

44
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,609
Australia's position on the South China Sea.

45
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,130
So, he made it look very official.

46
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,909
He made it look very official that he was
actually taking,

47
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:09,260
if you want to call it,

48
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,570
the Chinese communist party's position.

49
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,530
Contrary to all other international positions
in Australia

50
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,780
and almost every other nation in the world

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,060
on the South China Sea,

52
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,950
and then we find out later that he'd been

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,450
accepting money from this Chinese businessman

54
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,110
to help pay some of his legal bills.

55
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,060
And it isn't just Sam Dastyari.

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,600
How else have you seen Chinese communist party
infiltration affect Australian politics?

57
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,890
Look, I'll give you one example.

58
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,420
I was at function last year,

59
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,110
and there was a lot of Chinese businessmen,

60
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,920
and I just went along as my position

61
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
of member or Parliament.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,580
We have invitation.

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,330
At the time, Shen Yun, the ballet,

64
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,330
in the play, in the opera,

65
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,600
the play or ballet, opera play.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm not sure.

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Chinese classical dance.

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,310
Classical dance, which has been

69
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,700
shown in Sydney was on.

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,930
Now, I've been in the Shen Yun before.

71
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,320
They're invited. I liked it.

72
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,250
I must admit I'm a more sort of football

73
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,250
and sporting type of guy

74
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,710
that would rather go to a sporting event

75
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,780
than something at the ballet,

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,880
so although I enjoyed it,

77
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,460
I'd prefer to go the football

78
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,700
if I had my choice.

79
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,110
That's right. Yes.

80
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,070
So, now this very high-ranking

81
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,950
Chinese government official said to me

82
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,120
at the time,

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,250
"You shouldn't go to these things.

84
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,280
This is not China's official custom.

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,790
Therefore, you shouldn't go."

86
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,720
I didn't really have any great intention of
going,

87
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,070
but I said to him ... I said,

88
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,790
"Look. We also have a custom in Australia.

89
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,230
And when people tell us not to do something,

90
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,230
it makes us want to go and do it."

91
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,230
I said, "So I was actually ... "

92
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,230
So, I said, "Well, I was actually going to

93
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,810
watch the football that day,

94
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,770
but now I just might go and see it."

95
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,540
That actually sounds a lot like how

96
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,790
Americans respond to that sort of thing.

97
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,790
That certainly is.

98
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,710
And actually, how has this Chinese communist
party

99
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,940
infiltration affected U.S. Australia relationship?

100
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,819
Well, look we have very close relationship

101
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,490
with the U.S.A.

102
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,380
So, Australia's relationship,

103
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,710
our trade relationship,

104
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,860
our belief in freedom of speech,

105
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,260
democracy, all those freedoms

106
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,120
that we hold so dearly are equally held

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,540
by Australians and Americans.

108
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,100
Do you think the communist party

109
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,620
is trying to drive a wedge between

110
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
our two countries?

111
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
I don't know if I ...

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,350
I don't think they'll be able to achieve that.

113
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,760
I did just want to say the communist party

114
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,300
is trying to buy influence in Australia,

115
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,180
but partnering with the U.S.,

116
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,160
there can be a lot of benefits to us as well.

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,200
Very good, I guess. Absolutely.

118
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,240
That looks very good.

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,880
I'll put that on my desk in

120
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,170
Parliament House proudly, very proudly.

121
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,630
Oh, see it's yours. No, it's yours.

122
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,380
Thank you. Thank you.

123
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,010
So, what can Australian politicians

124
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,630
and officials do in the face of

125
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,680
communist party infiltration?

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,930
One issue is also that we have

127
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,350
very big economic ties with China,

128
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,670
and that's the commercial reality of the world.

129
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,420
China is our biggest export market,

130
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,700
so of course, we need good relations with
China.

131
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,780
That's just the bottom line economics,

132
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,930
but we have to tread those lines carefully.

133
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,680
I think one thing that from my business dealings

134
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,260
with China before I came into politics

135
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,220
is they respect if you are firm.

136
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,130
If you show signs of weakness, if you show
signs of appeasement, they just take advantage

137
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,430
of that.
Do you support the foreign interference laws?

138
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,430
Yeah. Absolutely.

139
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,750
They're important laws.

140
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,100
We need to make sure that the outcome of the
elections

141
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,280
in Australia are determined by the Australian
people.

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,480
That's what we need to do at the moment.

143
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,780
There's evidence of influence of foreign money

144
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,950
coming in to influence those elections,

145
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,630
and that's what we need to stamp out.

146
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,800
And do you think there's any risk

147
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,800
that the laws are written in a vague way

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,830
that could have negatively affected Chinese
Australians?

149
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,540
I don't think so, not at all.

150
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,790
I think the ... Look,

151
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,830
we have many people from China

152
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,750
that have settled in Australia.

153
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,040
One of the reasons that they've settled

154
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,700
is because of our democratic systems

155
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,260
and democratic beliefs,

156
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,040
and the right that they get to go

157
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,889
to their polling booth and vote

158
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,389
for whoever they want to.

159
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,522
If they don't like the way the government
is going,

160
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:03,169
they can stand up, and they protest

161
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,950
as loudly as they like without knowing

162
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,990
there's any going to be sort of come back

163
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,990
or sanctions against the person.

164
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,560
I know you've actually spoken up on behalf

165
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,980
of Chinese Australian groups

166
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,300
that are often victimized by the Chinese communist
party.

167
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,490
Have you faced any consequences for that?

168
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,130
I haven't personally, no.

169
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,020
But, it is ... we have ...

170
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,940
This is an area that all of us in politics

171
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,210
know that we have to tread carefully

172
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,460
because we don't want to be doing things

173
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,950
that actually upset our trading relationship

174
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,071
with China because that's very important to
us.

175
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:40,889
So, how do you balance keeping

176
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,590
a good relationship with China?

177
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,770
Well, I think most ...

178
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,020
most important thing that I've seen

179
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,700
that Chinese respect strength.

180
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,960
If you show them you have a solid position

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,760
on a certain issue,

182
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,790
and you are not going to bend
