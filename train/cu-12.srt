1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,540
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,049
Ring ring. Mom?!

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,220
How’d you get me on the hydrophone?

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,930
Chinese fishermen are playing laser tag...

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,290
with US aircraft.

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,420
And finally, Xi Jinping says China won’t
give up

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,560
“even one inch” of Chinese territory.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
Really?

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,900
How about half an inch?

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,220
This is China Uncensored.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,960
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,310
I’m Chris Chappell.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,880
A Chinese national has just been charged

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,440
with illegally exporting anti-submarine devices
to China.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,940
According to the Justice Department,

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,940
he got his assignment

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,970
from the Northwestern Polytechnical University,

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,490
which is a a Chinese military research institute.

19
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,700
He stole “approximately 78 hydrophones.”

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,930
Approximately?

21
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,970
How can you steal approximately 78 hydrophones?

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,629
That sounds like a very precise number of
hydrophones to steal.

23
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:02,270
Ah well, probably something lost in translation,

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,320
a game of Chinese whispers,

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,799
or, if you will,

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,869
a game of hydrophone.

27
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,249
Hydrophones, by the way,

28
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,049
detect and monitor sound underwater.

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,420
The way modern telephones detect and monitor

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,119
when your mother is calling you,

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,140
so you can let it go to voicemail.

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,929
Unless you haven’t set up your voicemail
box yet,

33
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:25,149
which I swear I’m going to do soon, mom.

34
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,810
In other news, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,570
met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,100
And they must have been feeling the pain

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,840
of an awkward social situation.

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,969
Xi Jinping’s pants are too high.

39
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,859
Mattis’s tie is too long.

40
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,599
A bunch of Chinese military guys

41
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,969
are sitting around watching.

42
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,990
Also awkward:

43
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,560
That moment when Xi Jinping said,

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,999
“We cannot lose even one inch of the territory.”

45
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,520
Especially since Mattis had just announced
that

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,829
the US was going to send navy ships

47
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,679
through the South China Sea—

48
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,309
where China has built fake islands—

49
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,539
to demonstrate freedom of navigation.

50
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,789
Mattis also reminded Xi Jinping that no matter
what,

51
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,229
China is still going to lose one inch of territory

52
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:08,590
every year to natural erosion.

53
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,690
I think we all know who the real enemy is
here:

54
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,690
tides.

55
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,349
And how is the Communist Party going to fight
tides?

56
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,190
Are they going to control the moon?

57
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,190
Yes.

58
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,230
Yes, they are.

59
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,660
Meanwhile, militant Chinese fishermen

60
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,430
in disputed territories in the East China
Sea

61
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,470
have been flashing lasers at US military jets.

62
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,409
If the jets respond the same way to laser
pointers

63
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:33,670
as my cat,

64
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,599
China’s in trouble.

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,950
Over the last year,

66
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,290
there have more than 20 lasering incidents

67
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,989
perpetrated by the Chinese military—allegedly.

68
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,579
And like a game of laser tag,

69
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,140
it’s getting old pretty fast, guys.

70
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,500
Chinese police have already set up

71
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,370
more than 200 million surveillance cameras
across China—

72
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,799
mostly in big cities.

73
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,290
But now, they’re setting up what they’re
calling

74
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,920
the “Sharp Eyes Surveillance Project”

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,659
to cover small towns and villages, too.

76
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:03,659
Their goal is to achieve

77
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,159
“full coverage, network sharing, real time
availability,

78
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,890
and full control” by the year 2020.

79
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,160
Which just goes to show you,

80
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,160
the Communist Party believes that poor people

81
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,760
deserve equal opportunity...

82
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,239
to have their behavior monitored at all times.

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,980
And the Chinese Communist Party

84
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,739
may be trying to buy influence in Australia...

85
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,600
...but that’s no reason to worry about Chinese
phones!

86
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,310
Like Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications
firm

87
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,969
with close ties to the Chinese military,

88
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:35,359
the one that’s been banned by

89
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,840
some US government agencies.

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
Well Huawei’s Australian chairman assured

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,959
government officials there that Huawei

92
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,750
definitely wouldn’t give Australian users’
data to China.

93
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,540
That would be “completely illegal” he
said.

94
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,540
And we know they would never do something
illegal, right?

95
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,170
Just don’t let them near your hydrophones.

96
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,340
And now it’s time for another fan question

97
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,840
from a China Uncensored supporter on Patreon.

98
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,909
Pete Kuhns asks,

99
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,760
“Do you see signs/evidence of China physically
grabbing

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,439
more territory outside the 9-dash line?”

101
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,670
Yes.

102
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,919
The Chinese Communist Party is doing deals

103
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,380
to get control of land in a number of countries.

104
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,710
Military bases in Pakistan and Djibouti.

105
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,620
A 99-year lease on a port in Sri Lanka.

106
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,860
Using Chinese companies to buy up

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,810
20% of Cambodia’s coastline.

108
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,220
Setting up special economic zones

109
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,330
for Chinese state-backed companies in Vietnam.

110
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,759
The list goes on.

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,280
Plus, China wants to have influence in Antarctica,

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,830
where it announced it would be building

113
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,440
its fourth research base.

114
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Now sure,

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,550
the Communist Party says that none of these
things

116
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,919
are about grabbing territory.

117
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:53,440
But if the Communist Party is willing to lie
about

118
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
its plans for the South China Sea,

119
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,470
trust me, it’s going to lie about

120
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,970
other territorial plans too.

121
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,620
Thanks for your question, Pete.

122
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
So what do you think?

123
