00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
Germany’s Got a China Problem

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,120
And it could spell disaster

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,480
For all of Europe

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,640
Germany has a China problem. A big one.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,360
German Chancellor Angela Merkel\h
has gotten a lot of criticism

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,360
for being soft on China.\h

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,120
Which is weird because normally\h
Angela Merkel seems so tough.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,320
But I guess she melted when Xi Jinping\h
went all “panda diplomacy” on her.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
Once again, it’s the pandas.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,080
It’s always the pandas!

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,120
Stop falling for their stupid cuteness, people!

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,680
Even Putin fell for it.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
But it’s not just stupid pandas causing\h
Angela Merkel to be soft on China.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,120
It’s also German companies that\h
want to do business in China.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,560
And Merkel is facing a revolt from\h
parliament for her reluctance to ban Huawei.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,440
And her reluctance is pretty weird,

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
considering that her own government

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,000
told her that Huawei worked\h
with Chinese Intelligence.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,040
And this is important.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,480
Germany often sets the tone\h
for the rest of Europe.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
For example, when Germany goes to\h
war, the rest of Europe does too.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,160
Germany, such a trendsetter.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,520
But all jokes aside, if Germany\h
were willing to use their power

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,240
to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party,

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,160
it would probably mean that China\h
couldn’t get a foothold in most of Europe.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,720
Unfortunately, certain people\h
in the German government

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
seem to have a soft spot\h
for authoritarian regimes.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
Who would’ve guessed?

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,200
According to an Axios exclusive,

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,040
a top German official hushed up a\h
report on China’s influence in Germany.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,880
“A high-ranking German official suppressed\h
a sensitive intelligence report in 2018

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,520
on China’s growing influence in Germany

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
out of fear it would damage\h
business ties with China.”

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Funny how different a decision like\h
that looks in light of the coronavirus.\h

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,200
The report looked at how\h
the Chinese Communist Party

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
has been seeking to influence every level

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,800
of German government, society, and business.

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,040
The report probably should\h
have taken a closer look

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,480
at the unnamed German official\h
who suppressed the report.\h

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,640
Now according to Axios, Merkel did see the report.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,320
And there’s a reason why some\h
segments of the German government

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,960
have been so reluctant to ruffle China’s feathers.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
The former German Ambassador to China said,

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
“Germany depends on exports to a high degree,

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,360
and that gives business a large influence.

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,000
Business representatives talk to the\h
government and are used to being listened to.”

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,200
For example, Germany’s largest\h
telecom is 32% state owned.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,160
And guess what? It relies\h
heavily on Huawei technology.\h

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,240
And “It has lobbied strongly against any action

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,360
that would make it harder for it to roll out 5G.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
The Ministry of Economic Affairs,

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
often eager to defend the\h
interests of German industry,

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,960
has backed the firm.”

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,080
Volkswagen has had to defend its\h
operations in China’s Xinjiang.

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
You know, where there’s been a lot\h
of ethnic slave labor being used.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
I knew there was a reason\h
Hitler liked the Volkswagen.\h

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
But somehow I don’t associate\h
the Volkswagen Bug with genocide.

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,600
That’s good marketing.

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Volkswagen has actually been\h
in China since the 1980s.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,960
Which shows how long Germany

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,840
has had economic ties with\h
the Chinese Communist Party.\h

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,880
“Germany’s big industrial companies

64
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,760
including engineering behemoth Siemens, car\h
giant Volkswagen and chemical maker B.A.S.F.

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
were among the first Western companies\h
to make big bets on China in the 1980s.”

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,320
And Germany’s economic relationship with China

67
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,440
has gotten closer and closer under Angela Merkel.

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,320
“In the 15 years since she took\h
over as chancellor in 2005,

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,600
German exports to China have quintupled.”

70
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,320
China is Germany’s largest trading partner.\h

71
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
And the Chinese Communist Party is working hard

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,360
to make sure the status quo\h
in Germany is maintained.

73
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,200
Huawei even wants to set up\h
a media outlet in Germany.

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,120
“The Chinese technology company\h
is looking for an editor-in-chief

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
to lead Huawei’s news offering [in Germany].”

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,760
I wonder how Huawei News will report\h
on German-China relations and Huawei?

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,600
That’s crazy. That’s like Verizon\h
setting up a news office in America.

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
If Verizon were headquartered in Pyongyang.

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you hear me now?

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
Now all this doesn’t mean that Germany

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,120
has completely ignored\h
China’s human rights issues.

82
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
They do talk about them. Merkel has\h
even met with the Dalai Lama. Twice.\h

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
But while the German government is\h
willing to occasionally criticize\h\h

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,000
the Chinese Communist Party,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,480
they’re not going to stop\h
doing business with them.

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,920
In fact, it seems like Germany’s elite

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,280
may have bought into the\h
Communist Party’s propaganda

88
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,520
that China is just different\h
and shouldn’t be judged.\h

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
One German billionaire said

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
“We can’t judge the Chinese\h
according to our standard of values,

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
or our cultural or humanistic ideals.”

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
That same billionaire has

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,520
“spent decades dealing with China,

94
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,080
including as the Asia point man\h
for Germany’s main industry lobby.”

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,880
Hmm, I wonder whether he’s in that hushed\h
up report on China’s influence in Germany.

96
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
But clearly, the future of Europe...\h
is being fought in Germany.

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
Seems strangely familiar, somehow.

98
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,360
Jenny Wong asks, “Hi Chris. Why Vatican/ the Pope

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
refused to meet Mike Pompeo

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
and the 88 year old Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen?

103
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
And that the Pope intentionally\h
omitted comments in speech a

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
bout China's security law in Hong Kong on July 5?”

105
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
Well that’s a really great question.

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,920
I’d like an answer to that too.

107
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,840
The Pope hasn’t really been talking much\h
about the national security law in Hong Kong.

108
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,480
And the Pope rejected a meeting with\h
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

109
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,520
who has been a vocal critic of\h
the Chinese Communist Party.\h

110
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
That might be because last month,

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,120
the Vatican and China renewed an agreement

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,960
that allows the officially atheist Communist Party

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,600
to appoint Catholic bishops in China.\h

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
And yes, China is already breaking the deal.

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
“Only last week in Jiangxi province,

116
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,800
dissenting Catholic priests have\h
been placed under house arrest,

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
in breach of an agreement to\h
protect clergy from coercion.”

118
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,840
Now I get why Merkel has been soft on China.

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
There’s money on the line.

120
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,520
I don’t get what the Vatican\h
gets out of being soft on China.

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
It’s not as if the Chinese regime is persecuting

122
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Christians or Catholics any less because of it.

123
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
If anything it’s getting worse.

124
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
They say God works in mysterious ways.

125
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,120
Maybe the Pope is taking a cue from Him.\h

126
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
Thanks for your question Jenny.

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,200

about the Vatican’s deal with China,
