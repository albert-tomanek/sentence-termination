1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,899
The deadly coronavirus:

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,500
Chinese leaders say things are getting better,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,900
but should you believe them?

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,380
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,360
I’m Shelley Zhang, filling in today for
Chris Chappell,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,660
who has been temporarily taken down by YouTube.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,740
Well, I’ve got some good news and bad news

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,910
about the coronavirus disease that started
in China—

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,260
called COVID-19.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,670
First, the good news.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,189
The head of the World Health Organization

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,500
said this week that their team in China

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,710
has made a range of findings about COVID-19,

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,710
including this:

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,430
“They found that the epidemic peaked

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:48,780
and plateaued between the 23rd January and
the 2nd of February

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,410
and has been declining steadily since then.”

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,550
What a relief!

19
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,440
The W.H.O. says the epidemic

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,900
peaked in China three weeks ago,

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,170
and now it’s been declining.

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,050
And if you want to verify that,

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,450
just read Chinese state-run media...

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,880
...which just cites the W.H.O. again.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,150
Creating a perfect, harmonious circle of information

26
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,760
that is definitely both believable and trustworthy.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,650
Let’s see how things are on the ground this
week, like in Beijing.

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,420
Well, that’s pretty light traffic for rush
hour.

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,700
And all these shops seem to be closed.

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,280
What’s going on?

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,710
“Our company has less than 100 employees,

32
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,190
and now we only have around 10 people working
in the office.”

33
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,220
That does not sound good.

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,960
Well, unless he hates his co-workers;

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,010
then it’s pretty great.

36
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,520
Look, we’ve all been there.

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,700
Now, I think it’s time for the bad news.

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,311
The bad news is, when Chinese state-run media

39
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:57,570
and the W.H.O. say coronavirus cases are on
the decline...

40
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,650
that is a lie.

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,200
Did you hear that?

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,590
That was the sound of this episode

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,340
being demonetized by YouTube.

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,119
I hope you watched our recent also demonetized
episode

45
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,079
about how corruption in the W.H.O. helped
the coronavirus spread.

46
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,599
If you did, you’d know that you should not
trust the W.H.O.—

47
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
because while their top executives

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,860
are galavanting around the world in first
class,

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,950
the division responsible for handling the
coronavirus outbreak,

50
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,920
“is so chronically underfunded it has repeatedly
been found

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,309
to pose a ‘severe’ and ‘unacceptable’
level of hazard.”

52
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:38,079
That certainly hasn’t stopped the W.H.O.
from partnering with China,

53
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,659
and taking China’s money.

54
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,200
Which is another reason that you shouldn’t
trust what the W.H.O.

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,359
says about how the Chinese Communist Party

56
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:47,859
has handled the coronavirus.

57
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,279
Look how close they are.

58
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,409
Wait, don’t get that close.

59
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,650
There’s a coronavirus spreading.

60
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,989
Wash your hands, Wang Yi.

61
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,059
Meanwhile, Chinese leaders

62
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:00,139
are encouraging Chinese peopleto return to
work

63
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,709
because they don’t want the economy disrupted.

64
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,400
But Chinese leaders *themselves*

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,780
have just canceled their hugely important
“Two Sessions” meeting,

66
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,329
because the fight against the coronavirus
is actually intensifying.

67
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:16,379
Yes, everything is fine and the masses have
nothing to worry about.

68
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,449
Go make the economy strong.

69
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,889
But the Chinese government is going to call
in sick.

70
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,409
Just in case.

71
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,640
Look, nobody actually likes the Two Sessions.

72
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,249
Which is an annual meeting of the National
People’s Congress,

73
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:30,980
or the NPC.

74
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,150
And the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference,

75
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,699
the CPPCC.

76
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:40,060
Mostly it’s an excuse for the attendees
to get in a good nap.

77
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,459
Unless you’re Yao Ming.

78
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,620
He can’t exactly blend in.

79
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,989
But you know who’s really glad the meetings
have been postponed?

80
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,230
The tea ladies.

81
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,370
So gross.

82
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,860
Postponing the two sessions is a political
blow, and a loss of face.

83
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,209
But, Chinese leaders don’t want hundreds
of Party delegates

84
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,980
from all those possibly disease-ridden provinces

85
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,870
coming to Beijing next month,

86
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,260
thank you very much.

87
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,199
This is called “setting the right example.”

88
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,110
It’s like how, as the masses deal

89
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,840
with a severe shortage of face masks...

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,319
...Chinese leaders...set the right example.

91
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,660
Seriously though, when it comes to the coronavirus,

92
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,489
don’t look at what Chinese leaders say.

93
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:22,670
Look at what they do.

94
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,820
So the W.H.O. is corrupt.

95
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,370
And the unholy alliance between the W.H.O.

96
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,810
and the Chinese Communist Party could also
be leading to,

97
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,910
at best...mixed messages,

98
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,200
and at worst, dangerous lies.

99
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,320
So take their advice with a grain of salt.

100
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,980
And a handful of Purell.

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,980
What do you think?

102
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,030
Leave your comments below.

103
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,450
And before I go, it’s time for me to answer
a question

104
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,510
from one of our contributors on Patreon.

105
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,810
Episodes like this one usually get demonetized
by YouTube,

106
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,190
so we rely on viewer support to keep this
show going.

107
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,300
And as a reward,

108
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,840
we answer some of our contributors’ questions

109
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,770
at the end of some episodes.

110
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,720
Today’s question comes from...Coralline
Algae.

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,380
“Do you think it would be beneficial for
president Trump

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,330
to take a hard stance against the WHO?

113
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,100
Perhaps something similar to the hard stance

114
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,580
he took against NATO early in his presidency.”

115
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,990
Well, that’s a big question.

116
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,910
The W.H.O. is definitely corrupt.

117
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,920
But how much can the US really do?

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,860
The W.H.O. is a United Nations organization.

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,650
No single nation can control it,

120
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,650
and that’s by design.

121
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,180
That’s a good thing when it’s running
cleanly.

122
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,970
But it doesn’t seem so good when US taxpayers

123
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,150
are forking over half a billion dollars a
year to a corrupt,

124
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,980
ineffective, and wasteful organization.

125
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,210
But this isn’t just an issue for Trump.

126
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,290
Leaders from both major political parties

127
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,700
should unite behind this issue,

128
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,520
and publicly criticize the W.H.O. for corruption.

129
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Beyond that,

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,890
the US could consider reducing its funding
for the W.H.O.

131
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,510
or putting conditions on it,

132
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,260
like what Trump did with NATO.

133
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,690
But the W.H.O. is the only major international
health organization.

134
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,150
So while it’s hard to live with,

135
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,640
it’s also hard to live without.

136
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,030
It’s a lot more complicated than NATO,

137
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,010
so there are no easy answers here.

138
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,400
Thanks for your question, Coralline.

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
