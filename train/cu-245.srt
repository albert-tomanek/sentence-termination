1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,760
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,920
there are some pretty shocking rumors

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,860
about what’s happening inside Chinese preschools.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,220
Let’s just say,

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,880
this episode is not suitable for children.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,400
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,020
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,370
Over the past 40 years,

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,240
China has seen stunning economic growth.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,090
And for some people in China’s growing middle
class,

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,590
it can feel like everything is great

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,539
and there’s absolutely no downside

13
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,480
to living a country where they’re allowed
to make money

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,960
as long as they keep their mouths shut on
politics.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,080
I mean, does politics really affect our lives?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,079
So it comes as a shock to many in the middle
class

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,460
that the same authoritarian regime that’s
ok with

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,930
arresting anyone who speaks out

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,100
and savagely torturing Falun Gong practitioners

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,260
is also ok with letting horrible things

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,079
happento the people they love.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,240
Like their children.

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,039
I take you now to the RYB Kindergarten and
Daycare

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,310
in Beijing—

25
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,890
an expensive school targeting

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,320
upper middle class families.

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,460
According to the school motto,

28
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,540
it’s where children take their

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,360
“first step to a colorful life.”

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,650
Why, look at all the eager parents

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,040
flocking to enroll their kids!

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,140
Except, that’s not why they’re there.

33
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,820
They’re protesting.

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,080
“Police are investigating allegations

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,580
of horrific abuse that went on inside,

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,830
the youngest victims only three years old.

37
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,049
Parents are accusing teachers and staff at
RYB Kindergarten

38
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,420
of sexually abusing their children,

39
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,590
making them stand naked as a punishment,

40
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,979
stabbing them with needles,

41
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,140
or making them swallow suspicious white pills.”

42
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,500
Wow.

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,720
And when I was in kindergarten,

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,900
I complained about nap time.

45
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,360
“After hearing from other parents,

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,090
I asked my child,

47
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,100
my child said they take two white pills

48
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,110
after lunch every day.

49
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,329
They go to sleep after taking the pills.”

50
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,369
I wish I could say that was the worst of it.

51
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,170
But besides those accusations,

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,270
“The most troubling accusation comes from

53
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,189
the mother of a 3-year-old who spoke with
Tencent News...

54
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:08,779
The parent says that her child told her

55
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,019
that kids at the kindergarten were given

56
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:13,309
regular ‘health checkups’ by

57
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:15,769
an ‘uncle and grandpa doctor’

58
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,069
in which they were made to stand naked

59
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,469
while one of the doctors was nude as well.”

60
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:22,200
Wow.

61
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,060
That makes Harvey Weinstein seem practically

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,269
like a normal...sexual predator.

63
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,260
And even a kindergartener knows that when

64
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,849
“uncle doctor” starts taking off his clothes,

65
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,950
that’s not how you play doctor.

66
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,129
According to one allegation,

67
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,620
a teacher threatened a student by saying,

68
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,900
“I can hear whatever you say

69
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,040
and see whatever you do

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,849
because I have a very, very, very long telescope

71
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,640
that can reach your home.”

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,360
I mean, it is kind of believable.

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
China is a surveillance state after all.

74
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
And you know what?

75
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,150
I wish I could say those horrible allegations
were it!

76
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,839
But there are also allegations

77
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,839
that the Chinese military was involved.

78
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,969
Which sounds outrageous.

79
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,870
But it struck enough of a nerve

80
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,170
that the Chinese military actually responded.

81
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,450
And they never respond!

82
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,680
“A Chinese military commissar

83
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,799
issued an extraordinary statement

84
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,430
adamantly denying rumors

85
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,010
that People’s Liberation Army officers

86
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,400
were implicated in the alleged sexual abuse.

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,109
Those who spread the rumors, he warned,

88
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,290
would be pursued for ‘legal culpability.’”

89
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,449
Now I wish I could say that was it.

90
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:34,279
But, no, there’s more.

91
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,839
See this Chinese official visiting

92
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:39,469
an RYB Kindergarten in November 2016?

93
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,019
That’s Meng Jianzhu.

94
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,870
He was China’s top security chief,

95
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,569
and a powerful member of Jiang Zemin’s political
faction,

96
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,909
which opposes Xi Jinping.

97
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,750
Meng Jianzhu had praised RYB Education,

98
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,739
and there are rumors he may have even

99
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,859
profited from it somehow.

100
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,209
So there are rumors floating around

101
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,969
that all the negative publicity about RYB

102
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:06,629
is actually part of a strategic political
takedown of Meng Jianzhu,

103
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,979
and that it’s tied to high-level CCP power
struggles.

104
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,760
But even that’s not all of it.

105
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,790
Because authorities have reacted to all of
this by—

106
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,250
you guessed it—

107
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,030
telling the media to cover it up.

108
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,000
As if that would make the problem disappear.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Really.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,680
“If you can’t see it, it doesn’t exist”?

111
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,110
I think someone needs to go back to kindergarten.

112
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,870
But there’s a silver lining to all the sharp
needles.

113
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,500
At least authorities have arrested two people
in the scandal.

114
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,409
Wait...what’s that, Shelley?

115
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,409
Oh.

116
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,409
Ok.

117
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,120
Apparently one woman who was arrested

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,370
was not some teacher accused of stabbing her
students

119
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,400
with needles,

120
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
force-feeding them pills,

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,520
or making them play doctor.

122
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,729
She was actually detained for

123
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,790
“spreading rumors” about the abuse.

124
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,289
As state-run media The Global Times writes,

125
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:00,539
“Rumormongers and those that maliciously
spread their rumors

126
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,330
must face punishment and be held accountable

127
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,990
according to law.”

128
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,729
Now I know what you’re thinking.

129
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,599
Spreading rumors doesn’t really seem like

130
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,180
the worst part of all this.

131
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,380
Well, here’s where it gets even more complicated.

132
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,129
After days of investigation,

133
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,289
the Beijing police released a statement

134
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,370
saying that they found no evidence of sexual
abuse

135
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,259
at the kindergarten.

136
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,830
They said they arrested one teacher

137
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,930
who had been pricking kids with needles

138
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,830
when they wouldn’t take naps.

139
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,400
Yeah, what kind of horrible teacher thinks
that

140
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,610
poking children will sharp objects

141
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,690
would help them sleep?

142
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,210
But police also said the rumors of children
being fed pills

143
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,110
and forced to “play doctor”

144
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,840
were fabricated by parents,

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,129
who are now willing to apologize.

146
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,320
Sounds like the police are covering up something,
right?

147
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
But in this case,

148
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,539
they might actually be...correct.

149
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,509
Some of the disturbing accusations,

150
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:58,530
like the kids being injected with unknown
substances,

151
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,460
are commonly seen in Chinese urban legends.

152
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,889
Like how when you were a kid,

153
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,400
people always warned you about someone passing
out

154
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,810
apples with razor blades in them during Halloween.

155
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,030
And this wouldn’t be the first time

156
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,650
that fear about child abuse in preschools

157
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,680
triggered mass panic.

158
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,780
It even happened in America.

159
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,409
During the 1980s and 90s,

160
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:21,199
there was a string of highly publicized cases

161
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,330
about daycare child abuse.

162
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,150
It made the national news.

163
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,259
Accusations of sex abuse,

164
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,580
satanic rituals,

165
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,169
even drinking giraffe blood in front of children.

166
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,439
“Authorities now believe that at least

167
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,169
60 young children were victimized,

168
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,169
and that the ultimate number

169
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:41,539
could well be much greater.”

170
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,090
The evidence was based primarily

171
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,410
on interviews with the children.

172
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,969
Several daycare teachers were thrown in prison—

173
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,350
only to be found innocent

174
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,639
and released years later

175
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,669
with a big fat apology

176
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,879
and millions of dollars in compensation

177
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,050
for wrongful imprisonment.

178
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,050
It turns out,

179
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,919
child testimonies are unreliable,

180
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,590
because kids often tell you the answers

181
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,319
they think you want to hear.

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,580
I mean, adults do that too, I guess.

183
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,689
But when bad stuff might be happening to your
kids,

184
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:11,800
you freak out.

185
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,639
It’s what you do.

186
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,639
Which is why,

187
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,289
when it comes to RYB Education in China,

188
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:20,469
even a seed of truth can quickly snowball

189
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:22,530
into mass hysteria.

190
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,340
And some of the accusations are apparently
true.

191
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,870
The needle stabbing part, for example.

192
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,470
I mean, there’s photos of the needle marks.

193
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,599
And this is not the first scandal the RYB
has had.

194
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,310
RYB Education operates 1,800 kindergartens

195
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,410
and day cares across China.

196
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,479
It’s worth over 750 million dollars.

197
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,969
It’s also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

198
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:47,099
And as they say,

199
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,379
“Mo’ money, mo’ problems...

200
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,120
with rampant child abuse.”

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,449
“In 2015,

202
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,529
four teachers at an RYB Education kindergarten

203
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,319
in Siping, northeast China,

204
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,909
were charged with using sewing needles

205
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,949
to jab more than 20 children on their heads,

206
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,169
mouths and limbs.”

207
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,949
Ok, seriously,

208
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,159
what is it with the sewing needles?

209
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,210
And earlier this year,

210
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,210
at another RYB Education kindergarten,

211
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,240
a teacher was caught on video kicking a child.

212
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,979
So there’s already widespread public sentiment

213
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,949
that something might be wrong at RYB Education.

214
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,360
But with some of the more recent accusations,

215
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,919
the evidence is harder to find.

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,159
There was video of a toddler telling his parents

217
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,241
that his teachers gave him white pills

218
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,900
to make him sleep.

219
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,550
But that video has been taken offline.

220
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,039
And it was only a child talking to his parents,

221
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,099
not firsthand evidence.

222
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,029
That doesn’t mean it’s not true.

223
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,649
There’s just a lack of evidence.

224
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,779
And the allegations of sexual abuse—

225
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:45,779
at this point—

226
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,440
are also still just allegations.

227
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Ones that police are now dismissing.

228
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,350
Police say that independent doctors found

229
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,589
no physical evidence of sexual abuse in the
kids.

230
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,370
And, according to state-run media,

231
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,940
“The police checked the 113-hour-long

232
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,890
recovered surveillance footage,

233
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,139
and didn’t find any evidence

234
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,130
of anyone committing child sexual abuse.”

235
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,400
Of course,

236
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,800
I don’t exactly trust state-run media.

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,399
And neither do a lot of people in China.

238
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,860
And that is exactly the problem.

239
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,709
Under the Communist Party,

240
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:18,709
authorities have covered up

241
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,170
so many scandals for so long,

242
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,480
and issued so many censorship directives,

243
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,699
that Chinese citizens area little skeptical

244
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,829
when reporting on an issue is suddenly squashed

245
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,449
and any online discussion is heavily censored.

246
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,279
In the environment the CCP has created,

247
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,500
it’s almost impossible tell what is true

248
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,180
and what is false.

249
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,600
So it’s basically like one of those

250
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,899
“choose your own adventure” novels.

251
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,080
Except it’s “choose your own conspiracy.”

252
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,960
Do you believe there was sexual abuse?

253
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,040
Turn to page 61.

254
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,630
Do you think the military was involved?

255
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,720
Turn to page 84.

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,620
Did this involve high-level power struggles

257
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,260
within the CCP?

258
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,200
Go directly to jail.

259
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
The public outcry over all this

260
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,170
is totally understandable,

261
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,610
because there’s so little trust

262
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,250
that authorities will expose abuse

263
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,259
even if they find it.

264
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,690
Since the story became public,

265
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,580
the Ministry of Education has vowed

266
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,120
to put an inspector in every kindergarten
in Beijing,

267
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,300
plus launch a much larger investigation.

268
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,740
But that’s just not very comforting to the
parents, who,

269
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,449
understandably, now believe the authorities

270
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,800
are constantly lying to them.

271
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,149
And child abuse does happen in China.

272
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,730
“Since 2010, news media and internet sites

273
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,000
have reported more than 60 such cases

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,430
of physical abuse at Chinese kindergartens

275
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,280
and child care facilities.”

276
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,180
State-run Xinhua has reported,

277
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,329
“968 cases of sexual abuse against children

278
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:51,079
were recorded nationwide between 2013 and
2015,

279
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,029
involving at least 1,790 children,

280
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,720
with many remaining unreported.”

281
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
In 2013,

282
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
the LA Times reported that

283
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
in just three weeks,

284
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
“Nine cases of sexual abuse in Chinese schools

285
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,649
involving more than 30 children

286
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,730
have brought the neglected crime to light.”

287
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,579
And while those reports also caused outrage

288
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:11,579
at the time,

289
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,750
a lot those cases happened to poor people.

290
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,750
But this time,

291
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,959
it’s happening to the upper middle class—

292
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,639
people who for a long time

293
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,250
were pretty happy with the system

294
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,470
that let them make money

295
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,709
and live comfortable lives.

296
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,270
And there’s a widespread belief

297
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,410
that if anyone gets in trouble with the authorities,

298
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,709
well, it’s because they did something wrong.

299
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:33,709
Just keep your head down,

300
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,720
and trust the system.

301
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,480
But now there are rumors of terrible things

302
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,980
happening to their own children.

303
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,540
Authorities tell them they’re investigating,

304
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,529
but the parents think they’re covering it
up.

305
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:47,910
And maybe they are—

306
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,310
it’s impossible to know.

307
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,720
And who can they turn to now?

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,090
This is what the CCP’s system

309
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,130
of censorship and control does to society.

310
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,139
The question is,

311
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,630
is this scandal enough to actually affect
their rule?

312
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,540
Or will it all blow over next week?

313
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,300
Too bad we can’t flip to the end to see.

314
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,839
That would be cheating.

315
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:09,839
So what do you think?
