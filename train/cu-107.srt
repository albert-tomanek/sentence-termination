1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,600
it’s been 20 years since the British

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,160
gave Hong Kong back to China.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,500
And everything is awesome.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,560
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,330
20 years ago tomorrow,

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,240
on July 1, 1997,

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,290
the British handed Hong Kong over to China.

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,680
1997 was a simpler time.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,460
It was the year we told you what we want,

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,430
what we really, really want.

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,220
The year we ran through Platform Nine

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,989
and Three Quarters for the very first time.

15
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,500
And the year we promised Leo

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,460
that our hearts would go on,

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,350
by watching him die in a movie theater

18
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,820
like 14 times.

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,820
Wait.

20
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,789
1997 was 20 years ago?

21
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,420
Shelley, I think I'm glimpsing

22
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,420
my own mortality.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,559
Make it stop.

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,559
Oh good.

25
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,230
In an MmmBop it's gone.

26
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,100
But in China in 1997,

27
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,399
the theme was reunification.

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,059
Look how happy it made everyone!

29
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,059
At the time,

30
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,809
Hong Kong, the Pearl of the Orient,

31
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,149
had been under British rule for 156 years.

32
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,570
Their lease for Hong Kong was signed

33
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,760
not with the Chinese Communist Party,

34
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,900
but two governments prior,

35
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,980
when the Chinese emperor wore golden robes

36
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,610
and the British queen wore a fancy crown.

37
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,130
Wait, she still does.

38
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,610
The reasons why the British

39
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,140
had to return Hong Kong to China

40
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,100
are so complicated that they should be

41
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,000
a whole other episode—

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,090
and let me know in the comments below

43
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,510
if you want me to do that episode—

44
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,850
but suffice it to say:

45
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,800
Chinese leaders made it clear:

46
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
what we want,

47
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,520
what we really, really want

48
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,120
is for Hong Kong to be part of China again.

49
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,620
So starting in the 1980s,

50
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,890
the Chinese Communist Party began

51
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,980
negotiating the handover with Great Britain.

52
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,010
They agreed on the principles of

53
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,170
“One Country, Two Systems”

54
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,140
and “50 Years, No Change”,

55
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
where yes,

56
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,150
Hong Kong would technically become part of
China,

57
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,380
but would get to keep its basic freedoms,

58
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,380
rule of law,

59
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,700
and capitalist economy—

60
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,520
complete with dangerously unregulated street
signs.

61
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,370
And the CCP would definitely,

62
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,370
in no way change Hong Kong

63
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,270
for at least 50 years.

64
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,960
Plus 2047 was so far away!

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,979
I’m sure by then we’ll all be living on
that moon colony

66
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,360
New Gingrich keeps talking about.

67
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,269
Anyway, at the time of the handover,

68
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,670
in 1997, there were some concerns about

69
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,890
what the future of Hong Kong would become

70
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,629
under the Chinese Communist Party’s rule.

71
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,629
After all,

72
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,939
it had been only eight years since Tank Man.

73
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,730
But most predictions for the future

74
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,069
of Hong Kong were optimistic.

75
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,069
At the time,

76
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,401
The Economist suggested that Hong Kong

77
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,330
“could serve as a laboratory

78
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,879
for political change on the mainland.”

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,300
A former Washington Post correspondent said

80
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,489
Hong Kong will “infect China with democracy.”

81
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,200
And The New York Times called Hong Kong

82
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,700
a Trojan Horse that could “destroy those
in power,”

83
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,799
and suggested that perhaps

84
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,209
“it is the Chinese Communist Party leaders

85
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,019
who should tremble about whether

86
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,599
their style of life and leadership

87
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,580
can long survive” when faced with

88
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,139
the shining beacon of Hong Kong’s freedoms.

89
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,090
Granted, there were also a few

90
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,010
negative nellies out there,

91
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,930
like an article in Fortune Magazine called

92
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,639
The Death of Hong Kong.

93
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,989
It predicted Hong Kong would

94
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,840
lose its global standing,

95
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,469
that English would lose its place to Mandarin,

96
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,250
that legislators and the Chief Executive

97
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,430
would be selected by the CCP,

98
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,950
and that power struggles in Beijing

99
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,239
would ultimately determine

100
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,290
who really rules Hong Kong.

101
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,319
But a lot of Hong Kongers

102
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,049
were also cautiously optimistic.

103
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,480
After all, most Hong Kongers

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,030
were ethnically Chinese,

105
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,060
and like I said,

106
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
the big theme at the time

107
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,510
was reunification with the motherland.

108
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,849
So they held a giant ceremony,

109
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,169
did their awkward handover thing,

110
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,400
and everyone celebrated together

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,459
in weird harmony.

112
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,459
Including a huge gala

113
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,340
where the biggest Hong Kong stars

114
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,970
sang a medley of popular songs,

115
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,379
some of which had their lyrics changed

116
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,859
to be about Hong Kong reuniting with China.

117
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,390
So how did it all turn out?

118
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,150
Are the 7 million residents of Hong Kong

119
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,150
better off?

120
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,629
Well, of course!

121
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,689
The Chinese Communist Party

122
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,450
kept all its promises.

123
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,849
For six years.

124
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,049
And then they tried to sneakily implement

125
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,180
Article 23,

126
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,010
a draconian anti-subversion law,

127
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,959
under the guise of national security.

128
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,260
It was designed to allow police

129
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,060
to burst into people’s homes,

130
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
search their stuff,

131
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,930
and arrest them without a warrant,

132
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,410
just because they’re suspected of

133
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,630
“subversion” of the Chinese Communist
Party.

134
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,130
It also criminalized speech

135
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,620
that instigates subversion,

136
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,240
whatever that means.

137
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,990
Oh, and it made things

138
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,199
that were illegal in mainland China,

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,630
also illegal in Hong Kong.

140
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,010
But Hong Kongers discovered

141
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,530
what Article 23 was all about.

142
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,580
And some of them marched

143
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,569
through the streets in protest.

144
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:47,569
And by some,

145
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,800
I mean half a million people.

146
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,710
The CCP wasn't expecting so many people

147
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,430
to oppose Article 23,

148
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,449
which was then withdrawn.

149
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,400
And the CCP was forced to back down.

150
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
For a while, at least.

151
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
Until they realized

152
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,830
what Hong Kongers really need

153
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,639
is more effective brainwashing.

154
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,740
So in 2012,

155
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,460
they tried to force Hong Kong schools

156
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,680
to teach what they called

157
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,520
“Patriotic Education.”

158
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
It would give children

159
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,979
“lessons on appreciating mainland China,”

160
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,259
and “[gloss] over major events

161
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,270
like the Cultural Revolution

162
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,759
and the Tiananmen Square crackdown.”

163
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,960
And there’s nothing wrong with patriotic
education,

164
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,419
according to Chinese state media.

165
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,419
But once again,

166
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,310
those rebellious Hong Kongers didn’t agree.

167
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,310
And once again,

168
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,740
thousands took to the streets to protest,

169
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,300
including many high school students.

170
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,300
And once again,

171
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,069
they forced the CCP to back down.

172
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,470
If those high school students

173
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,699
had just been patriotically educated,

174
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,159
none of this would have happened.

175
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,889
But anyway, the Communist Party

176
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,770
just wouldn’t give up.

177
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,849
It just kept going and going.

178
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,569
Like the Energizer Bunny,

179
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,569
but evil.

180
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,379
You see, an important milestone was coming
up.

181
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,430
The CCP had promised that in 2017,

182
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,730
Hong Kongers would be able to directly elect

183
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,639
their chief executive for the first time,

184
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,419
instead of having someone chosen by

185
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,599
a select pro-Beijing election committee.

186
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:11,909
So in 2014,

187
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,510
the CCP announced that, yes,

188
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,400
they would indeed keep their promise

189
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,189
and allow Hong Kongers to elect

190
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,080
their chief executive,

191
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,740
as long as the pro-Beijing election committee

192
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,750
could “assist” Hong Kong’s democratic
process

193
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,639
by pre-selecting all the candidates

194
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,069
that people could vote for.

195
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,610
You know, to make sure the candidates

196
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,740
“love the country and love Hong Kong.”

197
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
It's like one of those diets

198
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,190
where you can eat whatever you want,

199
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,280
as long as it's broccoli.

200
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,410
You probably know what's coming next.

201
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,909
100,000 Hong Kongers

202
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,889
came out to protest.

203
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,159
Police beat them and fired tear gas.

204
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,520
Or as they call it in China,

205
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,810
Patriotism Vape.

206
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,810
Side effects may include

207
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,020
shedding tears of love for your country.

208
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,960
Those protests became the Umbrella Movement.

209
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,889
It was called that because Hong Kong protesters

210
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,550
used umbrellas as shields

211
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,129
against the Patriotism Vape.

212
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,129
Umbrellas are not always

213
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,160
the most effective shields.

214
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,409
But probably more effective than...

215
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,129
whatever I was trying to do here.

216
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,860
A lot of people were afraid the Umbrella Movement

217
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,220
would turn in Tiananmen Square 2:

218
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,590
Electric Boogaloo.

219
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,590
But it didn’t.

220
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,590
Which is good,

221
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,590
because the sequel is always

222
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,250
worse than the original.

223
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,849
Anyway, Chinese state-run media

224
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:24,229
largely tried to ignore the Umbrella Movement,

225
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:25,810
and when they couldn’t they framed it

226
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,539
as a secret American plot to undermine China.

227
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,539
See?

228
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,710
Hong Kong was a Trojan horse after all!

229
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,830
Ultimately the protests faded away

230
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,360
and the next Chief Executive

231
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,120
was a pro-Beijing candidate

232
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,409
chosen by the election committee.

233
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,479
So did Fortune Magazine

234
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,080
accurately predict Hong Kong’s fortune?

235
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,610
Well, it did accurately predict that legislators

236
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,630
would eventually be selected by the CCP.

237
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,630
And Hong Kong did lose

238
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,240
some of its global standing,

239
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,280
as China’s entry into the WTO

240
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,580
helped the CCP build up cities

241
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,130
like Beijing and Shanghai.

242
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,249
In 1997, Hong Kong “accounted for some

243
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:03,060
16 percent of China’s GDP;

244
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,669
that figure has now shrunk to 3 percent.”

245
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,250
And Mandarin has replaced English

246
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,310
as the second most common language,

247
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,449
as close to a million mainland Chinese

248
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,590
have moved to Hong Kong.

249
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,590
And the future of Hong Kong

250
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,640
is definitely connected to the power struggle

251
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,090
between current Chinese leader Xi Jinping

252
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,610
and former commander toad,

253
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,900
Jiang Zemin.

254
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
But Chris, you say -

255
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,139
This all sounds so depressing.

256
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,180
Is Hong Kong's future just one of doom and
gloom

257
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,879
under the CCP?

258
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,270
Well, that just depends on your perspective.

259
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,389
Like from the perspective

260
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,750
of my favorite state-run media,

261
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,169
The Global Times,

262
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,240
everything is great since

263
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,250
“decolonization is finally coming to Hong
Kong."

264
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,139
And state-run Xinhua News informs us that

265
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,570
“Democracy, but a mirage during Britain's

266
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,260
150 years of rule,

267
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,610
has been greatly expanded.”

268
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,769
And if you're still not convinced,

269
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,269
Xinhua even released a rap video

270
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,440
ahead of the celebrations,

271
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,310
about how cool things are in Hong Kong now,

272
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,649
and how it's forever part of the motherland.

273
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,180
Here's how they describe the handover:

274
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,010
“All Chinese people had tears on their faces.

275
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,930
Lowering humiliation, raising sovereignty.

276
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,329
Raising up our dignified sovereignty."

277
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:12,329


278
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,329
See?

279
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,329
Everything is great.

280
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,329
But to be serious for a moment,

281
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:16,329
one of the things I really admired

282
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:17,370
about people in Hong Kong

283
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,630
when I was there last year

284
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,720
and especially in 2014

285
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
during the Umbrella Movement,

286
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000
was their genuine love of Hong Kong

287
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,490
that drove them to resist the CCP's

288
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,720
encroachment on their way of life.

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
And it has made a difference.

290
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,540
If Hong Kongers hadn't stood up against the
CCP

291
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,959
in the last 20 years,

292
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,089
the CCP would have imposed

293
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:36,329
an anti-subversion law

294
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:39,180
that would ruin Hong Kong's freedoms,

295
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,310
patriotically re-educated their kids,

296
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,120
and given them the formality of

297
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,190
"universal suffrage" without a real vote.

298
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,350
So yes,

299
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,370
the future of Hong Kong

300
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,170
does depend on what happens in

301
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,580
the Party's internal power struggle.

302
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,600
But it also depends on the people of Hong
Kong,

303
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
and whether they continue to resist the Party.

304
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,000
Because one thing's clear:

305
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the Chinese Communist Party

306
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,839
won't stop trying to control Hong Kong.

307
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,680
And for those of us outside Hong Kong,

308
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,350
the last 20 years is a warning.

309
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,040
A warning to Taiwan about what reunification

310
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,399
with a China controlled by the CCP

311
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,740
would look like.

312
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,040
And a warning to the rest of the world

313
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,690
about how well the Communist Party

314
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,240
keeps its promises.

315
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,370
But hey,

316
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,600
as the Xinhua rap video points out,

317
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,699
at least Hong Kong is getting

318
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,740
the world's longest bridge.

319
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,280
Which is what they want. What they really, really want.

320
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,960
So what do you think of the handover

321
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,440
of Hong Kong to China?

322
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,490
Leave your comments below.

323
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,490
Once again,

324
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,000
I’m your host, Chris Chappell,

325
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,020
see you next time.
