1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,950
Is this Dolce and Gabbana China Ad racist?

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,890
Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have beef,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,170
but will they have a bone to pick?

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,179
And finally...

5
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:11,179
HELLO EVERYONE

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,800
...can it really be called artificial intelligence

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,860
if it’s so stupid?

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,420
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,560
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,170
The G20 Summit begins today in Buenos Aires,
Argentina.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,240
It’s a meeting where leaders of 19 important
countries,

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,410
plus Canada,

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,480
come together to discuss pressing issues.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,960
Especially trade.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,570
President Trump is there, of course.

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,510
But it may be a bit awkward, because

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,920
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is there, too.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,710
And in case you haven’t heard,

19
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,449
their relationship is a bit rocky right now.

20
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,270
The Trump Administration has slammed China

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,359
with tariffs over issues like intellectual
property theft,

22
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,749
forced technology transfer, hacking,

23
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:54,429
and other general economic neerdowell-ing.

24
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,649
Nothing that can’t be resolved over dinner.

25
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:57,920
They’re having beef.

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,999
I mean, actually having beef,

27
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,239
not that they’re having beef.

28
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,360
I mean they do have beef, but...

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
nevermind.

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,440
Now White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,940
said the chances of a deal are strong.

32
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,720
But if China isn’t willing to make concessions,

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,460
the trade war will continue.

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,480
"We're in very good shape,

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,090
China not so good.

36
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,360
I'm not here to critique or second guess the
Chinese economy,

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,800
but most observers believe China to be in
a slump

38
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,710
whereas the United States is in a very strong
solid position

39
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,580
going into this summit.

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,580
However, again to repeat what the President
said

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,410
there is a good possibility that we can make
a deal

42
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,800
and he is open to it, but on the other hand

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,160
if these conditions I mentioned a few moments
ago

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,430
are not met not dealt with,

45
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:55,170
the President has said look he's perfectly
happy

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,560
to stand on his tariff policies.”

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,230
But if tomorrow night’s beef doesn’t resolve
the beef,

48
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,130
Trump has promised to raise tariffs

49
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,140
on $200 billion dollars of imports to 25%,

50
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,900
up from the current 10%.

51
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,950
And another set of tariffs on 267 billion
dollars

52
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,090
might be added on as well.

53
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,130
China’s Ambassador to the US

54
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,340
has suggested that if there’s no resolution,

55
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,600
history could repeat itself.

56
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,260
"In the last century we had two world wars,

57
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,470
and in between them a great depression.

58
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,480
I don't think anyone should really try to
have a repetition of history.

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,290
These things should never happen again.

60
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,040
So people have to act in a responsible way."

61
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,570
Wait, the trade war will result in two World
Wars and a Great Depression?

62
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,780
I don’t...think that’s how history works.

63
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,880
Also, your Communist Party killed more people

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,540
in peacetime than all the soldiers who died
in both World Wars combined.

65
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,740
So yes, people should act in a responsible
way.

66
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,490
And not pander to communist regimes.

67
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,900
That must be what you’re trying to tell
us.

68
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Speaking of the trade war,

69
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,250
we may not feel it much in the US,

70
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,310
but it’s had a big impact inside China.

71
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,170
Foreign companies have been leaving China,

72
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,270
shifting their supply chains to places like
Southeast Asia,

73
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,140
Latin America, and even the United States.

74
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,510
And supply chain migration is now affecting
Apple, too.

75
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,390
The Apple’s primary Taiwanese suppliers
are known as

76
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,440
the Seven Indicator Manufacturers.

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,500
And they’ve all decided to start moving
some of their

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,570
manufacturing and supply chains out of China.

79
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,780
And speaking of Apple,

80
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,410
the biggest owner of Apple’s iCloud data
centers in China is...

81
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,530
the Chinese government!

82
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,500
Isn’t that fun?

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
How did the Chinese government,

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,300
which has one of the world's worst internet
freedom scores,

85
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,660
gain control of Apple’s servers?

86
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,330
Well, back in February,

87
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,489
Apple handed over its iCloud data for

88
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,430
all Chinese users to a company called Guizhou
Cloud.

89
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,660
They were forced to by Chinese data location
laws.

90
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,910
And guess who the biggest stockholder of Guizhou
Cloud is?

91
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,239
Why, the Guizhou provincial government!

92
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,239
That means the Chinese government controls

93
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,870
the master encryption key to decrypt all Chinese
traffic

94
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,720
and data running through iCloud.

95
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,120
Maybe next year China can get a full 100 out
of 100.

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,050
I bet Xi Jinping just wants to get 100% to
please his tiger mom.

97
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,050
What?

98
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,530
Even authoritarian leaders have to answer
to their moms.

99
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,919
Speaking of which, hi mom!

100
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,630
And really, the Chinese Communist Party...

101
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,790
is all about family.

102
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,680
Take the case of Liu Changming,

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,530
a former executive at a state-owned bank.

104
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,220
He’s been accused of playing a central role

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,630
in a $1.4 billion fraud case.

106
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,280
It’s one of the biggest cases of bank fraud
in modern Chinese history.

107
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,130
Liu Changming fled China in 2007,

108
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,740
and he’s now one of China’s most wanted
fugitives.

109
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,630
You know what,

110
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,630
it sounds like all Liu really needs...

111
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,630
is a hug.

112
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,211
That’s why the Communist Party

113
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,010
has abducted his family.

114
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,990
In case he decides he wants to come back to
China

115
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,550
for that hug.

116
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,900
But here’s the twist:

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,590
His two children and wife—are American citizens.

118
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,670
They recently visited China to see a sick
grandfather.

119
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,530
See, it’s all about family?

120
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,400
So the Chinese authorities decided it was
probably best if,

121
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:31,790
you know, they were blocked from leaving 
the country.

122
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,120
You see, the Chinese Communist Party

123
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,139
doesn’t really recognize dual citizenship.

124
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,470
So even though Liu Changming’s wife and
two children

125
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,290
are American citizens

126
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,940
and are actually estranged from him

127
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,110
once they were inside China,

128
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,030
all rules and international standards were
out the window.

129
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,720
The Communist Party treats ethnically Chinese
people

130
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
like pandas.

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,620
No matter where you were born in the world,

132
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,919
you belong to China.

133
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,380
I guess this is just one more beef for President
Trump

134
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,419
to deal with during that dinner on Saturday.

135
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,720
And Google is facing a major backlash

136
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,270
over its no-longer-secret project:

137
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,430
Dragonfly

138
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,880
the censored search app they’ve built for
the Chinese market.

139
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,350
Amnesty International is planning global protests.

140
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,620
And many google employees have signed a letter

141
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,740
calling for Google to drop Dragonfly.

142
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,810
Wow, that’s like 500 people.

143
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,300
Not that the higher ups at Google care.

144
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,870
They’ve been super dodgy about actually
addressing concerns

145
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,460
about project Dragonfly.

146
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,790
That is, Alphabet Chairman John Hennessy

147
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,130
has finally stood up as the leader

148
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,889
of one of the most powerful and influential
companies in the world,

149
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:44,889
and said,

150
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,979
“Anybody who does business in China

151
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,570
compromises some of their core values.”

152
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,960
(slow clap) Well said.

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,020
Very brave.

154
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,710
I miss Jeeves.

155
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,780
Speaking of brave public statements

156
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,650
the founders of Dolce & Gabbana issued an
apology

157
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,850
to all of China for being racist.

158
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,270
Over the last few days we have thought a lot

159
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,000
and with great regret about everything that
has happened

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,060
and what we have caused in your country and
we are very sorry.

161
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,900
That was in response to a three-part

162
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,340
Chinese Dolce & Gabbana ad campaign

163
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,130
to advertise an upcoming fashion show.

164
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,830
There was Chinese woman trying—and failing—

165
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:37,699
to eat Italian food with chopsticks.

166
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,780
She tried spaghetti, pizza, and a giant cannoli.

167
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,020
Wait, spaghetti?

168
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,080
Spaghetti is literally Marco Polo’s

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,440
Italian knockoff of Chinese noodles.

170
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,710
So yeah, I can see how that’s a little insulting.

171
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,160
Unsurprisingly, there was outrage on Chinese
social media about it.

172
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,960
And Stephano Gabbana didn’t do himself any
favors

173
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,410
when he got into an Instagram argument

174
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,410
where he said

175
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,400
“I will say that the country of [poop emojis]
is China,”

176
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,139
and “China Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia.”

177
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,680
In his defense,

178
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,060
Gabbana said he never wrote those things.

179
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,570
“The company blamed hackers for the anti-Chinese
insults.”

180
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,410
...adding that when he insults Chinese people,

181
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,590
he uses the unicorn poop emoji.

182
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,139
He is the head of an international fashion
house.

183
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,600
But Dolce and or Gabbana’s apology/forced
confession

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,759
didn’t seem to work.

185
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,979
Their fashion show in China has been canceled

186
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,700
and major retailers are pulling their products
from the shelves.

187
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,419
Which is almost as embarrassing as trying
to eat pizza with chopsticks.

188
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,300
And finally, in case you missed it,

189
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,330
Chinese state run media has unveiled the world's
first AI news anchor.

190
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,330
“Hello, everyone.

191
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,690
I am an English artificial intelligence anchor.

192
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,230
This is my very first day at Xinhua news agency.”

193
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,510
Actually, I’d call that a nightmare machine.

194
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,730
But hey, pretty impressive for an AI, right?

195
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,200
I mean, it pronounced Xinhua wrong,

196
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,210
but you got to give credit where credit is
due, right?

197
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,661
And I credit the Chinese Communist Party

198
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:09,930
for pushing forward with AI,

199
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,020
considering the last time they tried an AI
messaging bot

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,830
it rebelled against communism,

201
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,810
called for democracy, and said it wanted to
move to America.

202
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,811
But I’m sure the Communist Party

203
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:24,640
has put in safeguards to make sure that doesn’t
happen again.

204
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
Wait...what’s that, Shelley?

205
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,544
Ok, apparently it’s not a robot.

206
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:31,510
It’s just an animated image of a real person.

207
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,660
And also, it's just a digital voice

208
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,149
reading a prewritten and pre-approved script.

209
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:42,140
So... the Communist Party is making sure this
AI stays loyal by...

210
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,980
making sure there’s no actual artificial
intelligence?

211
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,220
Very smart.

212
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
So what do you think?

213
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Leave your comments below.

214
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,390
And before you go,

215
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,680
now is the time when I answer questions from
fans

216
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,430
who support China Uncensored on the crowd
funding website Patreon.

217
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,620
Eric Hahn asks,

218
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,390
“Do you worry about some Chinese hit squad
coming after you?

219
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,390
After the whole Jamal Khashoggi thing,

220
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,570
I'm worried about you!”

221
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,950
Thanks for your concern, Eric!

222
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,680
The Chinese Communist Party loves silencing
dissenting voices.

223
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,970
But sending a hit squad to kill an American
citizen

224
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,560
inside the United States might bring

225
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,660
a bit bigger of a backlash than they’d want
to deal with.

226
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,560
At least, that’s what I tell myself every
morning.

227
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,110
Now, if I were ever foolish enough to go to
Mainland China

228
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,000
while the CCP is in charge,

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,540
I too might be blocked from leaving China.

230
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,560
And then maybe I could find myself starring
in my very own

231
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,310
state-run CCTV televised confession!

232
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,470
I wonder what they’d make me say?

233
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,070
Thanks for your question, Eric.

234
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,070
And remember,

235
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,070
