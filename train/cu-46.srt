Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,129
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,069
You know, not everyone is so lucky to be present

4
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:09,190
for the exciting 19th Party Congress in Beijing—

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,540
where delegates get to listen to reports from
the Central Committee,

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,639
and pretend to elect the Party’s new leadership.

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,940
Fortunately, the CCP has developed

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,230
over 100 smartphone apps

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,600
to help Party members remain loyal.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,210
But what kind of apps could you possible want,

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,580
in a country where the Communist Party

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,140
has already done so much to involve itself

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,050
in every aspect of your life?

14
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,079
Well, perhaps this commercial

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,949
will make it make it clearer.

16
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,280
What’s great about the iPhone in China,

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,489
Is that if you want to brush up on

18
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,090
your knowledge of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
Thought,

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,340
There’s an app for that.

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,360
If you want to sing along

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,820
to your favorite childhood propaganda songs,

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,740
There’s an app for that.

23
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,000
If you want to hear dramatic retellings

24
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,780
of the communist revolution,

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,940
including the story of the first Chinese hero

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,069
to shoot down an American plane,

27
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:01,000
There’s an app for that.

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,559
And if you want to virtually sweep the tombs

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,140
of those communist martyrs,

30
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,060
There’s even an app for that.

31
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,860
If you want to visit every landmark along

32
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,550
the entire 6,000-mile-route

33
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,930
of Mao Zedong’s Long March,

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,320
where thousands of people died

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,860
for virtually no reason,

36
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,300
There’s an app for that.

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,230
And if you want to turn that tragic history

38
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,990
into a fun video game.

39
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,760
There’s also an app for that.

40
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,040
And if you want to help your local Party branch

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,950
monitor your ideological education,

42
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,950
force you to take Party knowledge exams,

43
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,170
hound you for Party membership fees,

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,820
and evaluate whether you’re learning your
lessons

45
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,310
in a timely and active manner,

46
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,740
Well, there’s a lot of apps for that.

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,180
Yep.

48
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,320
There’s a Communist app for just about anything.

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,220
Only on the iPhone in China.

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,600
So what communist apps—

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,080
or anti-communist apps—

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,560
would you like to see?
