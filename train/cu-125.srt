1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,110
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,860
China is now the most threatening country.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,440
Sorry Kim.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,179
Chinese troops are messing around in Djibouti

5
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:11,179
And finally,

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,089
the Chinese regime has a new plan to make

7
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,410
every Uighur Muslim in Xinjiang really happy.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,680
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,820
The United States considers Taiwan

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,609
to be its unsinkable aircraft carrier--

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:32,419
its friend in the Pacific that will never
let America down.

12
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,570
So if the Chinese Communist Party follows
through

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,010
with its promise to attack Taiwan,

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,969
that could mean the United States and China
coming to blows.

15
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:42,980
But at least according to some in the United
States,

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,359
military, the US and China coming to blows

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,620
might be inevitable.

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,840
At least, that's what I'm getting from General
Joseph Dunford.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
(Corner Box)

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
He told Congress,

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,491
"I think China probably poses the greatest
threat

22
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,990
to our nation by about 2025."

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,109
Yes, according to this general,

24
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,670
China, then Russia,

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,170
then North Korea are the greatest threats
to the United States.

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,810
In that order.

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,610
General Dunford wasn't talking just about
China versus Taiwan,

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,630
but about the threat of China's military in
general.

29
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,960
And considering that North Korea made a video

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,590
about blowing up the White House and the Capitol
Building,

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,670
you've got to wonder what a bigger nation
is capable of.

32
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,290
Probably better video quality, for one.

33
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,479
And Chinese troops are training for war--

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,830
at least, in Djibouti.

35
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,659
Yes, things are blowing up in Djibouti

36
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,509
as the Chinese military carries out

37
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:38,100
its first live fire drills in Africa.

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,869
That's after the CCP built its first overseas
military base there.

39
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,409
Hopefully, the Chinese military will stay
contained in Djibouti.

40
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,500
But maybe Chinese construction in the area
will take off.

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
And if it does,

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,040
I have the perfect man for the job:

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,700
The guy who designed this:

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,340
the Career and Entrepreneurship Comprehensive
Service Base

45
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,579
of University Graduates in Zhengzhou.

46
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,450
That building has become the current laughingstock
of the Chinese internet.

47
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,060
But don't expect people to be sharing it on
WhatsApp.

48
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,860
Because WhatsApp has been blocked in some
areas of China.

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Again.

50
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,550
It comes just a few weeks ahead of the 19th
Party Congress in mid-October.

51
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,240
You see, the CCP would hate it if people were
to share

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,500
sensitive information through WhatsApp--

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,980
information like ...

54
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,710
what people think about stuff.

55
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,880
Yeah, guys, having opinions doesn't make the
country better.

56
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,630
But you know what does?

57
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,320
Creating jobs.

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,890
The CCP is working hard to make sure life
is great

59
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,330
for all the happy ethnic Uighur Muslims in
Xinjiang.

60
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,060
And the best way to do that of course is through
job creation.

61
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,560
And the fastest growing job segment in Xinjiang
is--security!

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,940
Over the past 12 months,

63
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,670
authorities have posted ads for hiring

64
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,840
100,000 new security personnel.

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,610
That's a ridiculous number of people to hire.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,190
By comparison,

67
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,950
that's more than the total number of US Border
Patrol Agents,

68
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,890
TSA Officers, and FBI Agents combined

69
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,390
in the ENTIRE United States.

70
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,050
The population of Xinjiang is less than a
10th of the US.

71
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,130
Just imagine 100,000 security guards in Xinjiang

72
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,430
riding around on segways

73
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,960
and eating lamb kebabs.

74
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,590
In fact, Xinjiang has already spent around
$6 billion

75
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,500
on security in the first half of 2017.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,070
That's more than 50% of the region's income.

77
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,170
And it's all thanks to Chen "Entire Country"
Quanguo.

78
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,190
That's not his nickname,

79
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,310
that's just the translation of his name, Quanguo.

80
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,330
Fresh off his tenure as

81
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,750
one of the most brutal Party Secretaries of
Tibet,

82
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,850
now he's turning Xinjiang around.

83
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,940
Why, just look at these 10,000 happily employed
citizens.

84
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,610
And all those happily employed folks

85
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,450
are helping keep Xinjiang under full lockdown.

86
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,790
Which the people love.

87
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,520
Why, this is what one shoe vendor told to
NPR reporters.

88
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,730
"It makes me feel safer.

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,600
They've built police stations every few blocks
or so.

90
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
The police check us every day,

91
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,210
no matter if you're a doctor, teacher, anyone.

92
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,080
It's all for our safety."

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,200
China, leading the way in treatment of ethnic
minorities

94
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,590
since the liberation of Tibet.

95
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:19,590
What do you think?

96
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,989
Leave your comments below.

97
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,440
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Once again I'm your host Chris Chappell,

99
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,680
see you next time.

100
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,880
Oh?

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Hi there.

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,130
I'm just sending pictures of Djibouti

103
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,000
to a friend on WhatsApp.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But if you want to see something really good
on the Internet,

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,790
you should go to China Uncensored.tv.

106
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,780
We upload full half hour episodes there every
Friday.

107
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,650
So you could have seen this and other segments
earlier.

108
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,210
Now if you'll excuse me,

109
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,560
it's back to Djibouti.
