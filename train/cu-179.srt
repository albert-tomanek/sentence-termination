00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,140
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,520
what are the US presidential candidates saying
about...

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,260
"China"

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:06,880
"China"

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,460
"China"

6
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,860
"China, China, China"

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,141
"CHINA!!!"

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host, Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
You know, as a patriotic American,

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,029
there's nothing I love more than watching
democratic process in action.

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,509
And by democratic process, I mean this.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,450
But there's one thing it seems the presidential
candidates can all agree on:

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,489
The biggest problem America has,

14
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,969
the true threat that must be addressed, is
China.

15
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,540
"China is waging cyber warfare against America."

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,360
"They're also trying to hack into everything
that doesn't move in America."

17
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,170
"China is also a growing danger to our national
security."

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,800
"The trade agreement with China was an unmitigated
disaster for American workers."

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,880
"China thinks we are  truly the dumbest people on Earth."

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,139
Now far be it for me to criticize anyone for
criticizing China.

21
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:16,739
In fact, I think all of you know why I criticize
the Chinese regime.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,500
But for the leading five candidates,

23
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,729
one of them will most likely be the US president
less than a year from now.

24
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,189
So just how would each of them deal with China?

25
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,679
For more, I'm joined by former political correspondent,
Matt Gnaizda.

26
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,329
Thanks, Chris.

27
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,490
Now Matt, you used to cover politics as a
news reporter.

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,069
I don't like to talk about that time in my
life, Chris.

29
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:46,849
I've seen things...that cannot be unseen.

30
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,219
I know what's under Donald Trump's hair.

31
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,209
Do I want to know?

32
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,909
Do you want to have nightmares for the next
10 years?

33
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,679
Ok, never mind then.

34
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,139
So these top five candidates

35
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:00,319
they've all been talking a lot about China,

36
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,200
but which of them have actual experience dealing
with China?

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,880
Two of them do.

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,159
Hillary Clinton has by far the most political
experience with China.

39
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,590
When she was first lady, she met a lot of
Chinese officials.

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,540
Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton
co-chaired the US-China Strategic and Economic

41
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,700
dialogue.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,069
She also traveled to China twice during that
time.

43
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,819
Her second trip coincided with blind Chinese
activist Cheng Guangcheng's escape from house

44
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,400
arrest to the US embassy in 2012.

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,860
Those were exciting times.

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,370
And the other?

47
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,739
Donald Trump.

48
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,489
He has no real political experience,

49
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,150
but he's done lots of business with Chinese
clients.

50
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,390
He's had his products made there,

51
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,210
and he's sold properties to big-time Chinese
investors.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,960
Does that...count as China experience?

53
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:44,889
He thinks it does.

54
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,389
"I love China. I sold an apartment for 55 million dollars to a Chinese gentleman.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Ok, let's get to the main issue.

56
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,359
All the candidates have talked about China
taking American jobs.

57
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,069
Would any of them actually do something about
it?

58
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,689
Look, Chris: convincing voters that you'll
fix the US economy is the best way to get elected.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,040
That's kind of cynical.

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,590
That's kind of politics.

61
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,129
It's true that millions of US jobs

62
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:13,900
have disappeared over the last 15 years since
China joined the World Trade Organization,

63
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,239
with America's help.

64
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,969
Those particular jobs aren't coming back.

65
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,560
So I think that if elected,

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,469
all the candidates except one would support
continued free trade with China.

67
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,810
No matter what they say now as candidates.

68
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,670
You said all the candidates except one?

69
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,019
That's Bernie Sanders.

70
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,870
As a US Congressman, and later Senator,

71
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,409
he had actually opposed pretty much every
trade deal with China,

72
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:39,249
starting with Bill Clinton's original push
to get China into the WTO.

73
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:41,230
So maybe Sanders, as president,

74
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,230
would actually try to pull back.

75
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,060
The problem is, even if he wanted to,

76
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,459
it's unclear that he'd really have that power

77
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,120
since the president needs the support of Congress.

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,040
What about human rights?

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,249
Well, Chris, as you of all people know,

80
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:57,040
it's easy to criticize the Chinese government
for its for human rights abuses.

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,160
It's hard to actually do something about it.

82
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,069
Are we still talking about the candidates?

83
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,819
Oh, sure.

84
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,310
So Ted Cruz.

85
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,079
He's been outspoken against forced abortions
in China

86
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,279
mainly because he opposes abortion.

87
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:13,689
Hillary Clinton has been outspoken against
forced abortions in China

88
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,430
mainly because she supports a woman's right
to choose.

89
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,630
Marco Rubio has called for the release of
political prisoners,

90
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,750
and to block US visas for Chinese officials
who've violated human rights.

91
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,880
And Bernie Sanders has probably been the boldest.

92
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,720
While in the House of Representatives,

93
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,830
Sanders actually co-sponsored resolutions
about Chinese human rights

94
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,479
including HCR68, a resolution that specifically
condemned the persecution of Falun Gong.

95
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,440
What about Donald Trump?

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,569
Oh, Trump hasn't said anything about China's
human rights.

97
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,469
In a way, he kind of agrees with China.

98
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,420
What?

99
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,060
Well, China's position on human rights is...

100
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,080
to actually change the definition to include
allowing people to make money as a human right.

101
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,860
And Donald Trump supports making money.

102
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,599
So the Chinese leaders must like Donald Trump.

103
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,750
You'd think so, but actually no.

104
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,520
My favorite state-run media, Global Times,

105
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,349
recently published an editorial that was very
anti-Trump.

106
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,190
Chinese leaders think Trump lacks the nuance
and diplomacy to have a good relationship.

107
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,479
Like that Tweet where he said

108
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,120
"the concept of global warming was created
by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,599
manufacturing non-competitive."

110
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,270
Yeah, that's just...not a widely accepted
view.

111
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,509
So which candidate would serve America best
when it comes to China?

112
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:29,840
None of them.

113
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,580
None of them?

114
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,419
Let me put this in context, Chris.

115
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,750
Back in 1992, a young, passionate Bill Clinton
took a tough stance against China.

116
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,629
In his first presidential campaign,

117
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:43,180
he criticized George Bush Sr. for "coddling
dictators."

118
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,370
Or as Clinton called them,

119
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,120
the "butchers of Beijing" because of the Tiananmen
massacre.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,860
"We need to be a force for freedom and democracy

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,039
and we need to use our unique position to
support freedom

122
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,990
whether it's in Haiti, or in China, or in
any other place."

123
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,970
But then, by the end of his second term,

124
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,810
Clinton just wanted to do business with China.

125
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,190
"I don't believe it's right to crack down
on people for their religious views,

126
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,800
or their political expression,

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,599
or because they want to be in an association
like the Falun Gong.

128
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,509
I don't think that's right.

129
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:21,780
But I don't believe that we will have more
influence by giving them the back of our hand."

130
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,009
I guess that explains why Clinton offered
the palm of his hand to Jiang Zemin,

131
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,449
the man who just authorized the mass murder
of the "Falun Gong."

132
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,330
Exactly. So Bill Clinton ended up coddling
his own dictators.

133
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,960
But you know, that's because Bill Clinton
was a Democrat.

134
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,479
And Democrats are known to be hypocrites.

135
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,590
So then presidential candidate George W. Bush
comes along.

136
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,120
And he has a tough stance against China.

137
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,220
In a 1999 interview on CNN,

138
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,620
he said that Clinton, quote "made a mistake
[in] calling China a strategic partner."

139
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,750
Bush argued that we need to view China as
a competitor, not a partner.

140
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,270
And then he went on to treat China as a "responsible
stakeholder" instead.

141
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,039
Well, at least when it came to Jiang Zemin,

142
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,569
the dictator who killed huge numbers of his
own citizens,

143
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,329
Bush maintained a dignified distance, right?

144
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,659
Yeah. But you know, that's because George
Bush was a Republican.

145
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,719
And Republicans are known to be hypocrites.

146
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,420
So you're saying...?

147
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,009
I'm saying don't rely on the next US president,

148
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,509
whoever he or she may be.

149
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,889
Because once you become president,

150
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,150
campaign rhetoric goes out the window.

151
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,370
Thanks, Matt. I guess.

152
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,379
The pleasure was all mine.

153
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,720
So what do you think the next US president
should do about China?

154
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,710
Leave your comments below.

155
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,639

157
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,539
Because after this episode,

158
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,180
I don't think we're going to get much funding
from the CIA.

159
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,460
Once again I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.
