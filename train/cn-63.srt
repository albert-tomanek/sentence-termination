00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,689
I took a canal boat holiday with some friends once.

2
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:03,889
(Were they Martians?)

3
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:07,250
No, they weren't Martians. Has anyone ever
been on a canal boat holiday?

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,019
- Yes.
- I haven't.

5
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,010
- You know when you open and close a lock gate?
- Correct.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,400
You've got the lock gate.
To open the… the little…

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,740
The… what are they?

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,330
Paddles.

9
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,210
Paddles! The paddles that let the water
in and out of the lock.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,860
- You use what is called a windlass.
- You do.

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,260
Which is basically a big crowbar-like-thing
that you put in

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,670
Wind it like that

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,710
And then, while the paddles are open,

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,090
You hold onto the windlass.

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,039
So it doesn't chin you.

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,949
- Yes.
- Oh, the force of the water makes it go…

17
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,059
She makes it spin round very quick!

18
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:41,530
Yes. I was given the instruction
"hold onto the windlass"

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,589
roughly at the exact point that I let go of
the windlass

20
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,109
at which point it performed one complete revolution

21
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:50,870
and hit me squarely in the balls.

22
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,639
Poseidon's kick right there!
