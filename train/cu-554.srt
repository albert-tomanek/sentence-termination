1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,080
As the Chinese Communist Party celebrates
100 years

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,680
There are things they don’t want to talk
about

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,990
Like the Tiananmen Square Massacre

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:29,400
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,410
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,170
On July 1, the Chinese Communist Party will
be turning 100.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,910
And they’re throwing themselves the birthday
party of the century.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,239
You know what they say: Ain’t no party like
a communist party ‘cause a communist party

9
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,930
insinuates itself into every part of your
life, subverting society until there’s no

10
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,930
escape.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,340
It’s a catchy song.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,620
The Chinese Communist Party is big on anniversaries.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,590
Celebrating the ones they want you to remember,
and arresting people ahead of the ones they

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,800
want you to forget.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,720
And this 100th anniversary celebration is
a theme party.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,140
The theme is Without the Communist Party,
there would be no new China.

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,340
It’s the same theme as all their parties.

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,330
This year, they’re celebrating that theme
with everything from patriotic films to mass

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,470
weddings.

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,790
And the message to “follow the Party forever.”

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,950
How romantic.

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,770
The Chinese Communist Party is also using
this year’s celebrations to further elevate

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,900
its own mythology.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,470
Using some pretty religious language.

25
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,020
“In party literature and state media, former
revolutionary bases are labeled ‘holy sites,’

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,160
and the almost obligatory visits to such locations
by the rank and file are meant to ‘baptize’

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,540
members in the Communist ‘faith.’”

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,730
Of course, you can’t baptize people in the
Communist faith without sweeping a few things

29
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,100
under the rug.

30
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,390
“Thornier subjects--infighting and purges
in the upper echelon, and ruthless mass political

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,070
campaigns dating back to the party’s early
days--are almost never touched on.”

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,250
You mean the Communist Party isn’t telling
the truth about history?

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,030
I’m shocked.

34
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,890
It’s happening in Chinese state-run media
as well.

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:25,080
For example, here’s a poster series of “key
events during the Party’s 100-year path

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,170
to glory”

37
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,140
They’re doing one poster for each year since
1921.

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,060
Like, in 1987, the poster is about the 13th
national congress.

39
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,160
In 1988, it’s about the establishment of
the Hainan Special Economic Zone.

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,710
And in 1990, it’s about the opening of the
Shanghai Stock Exchange.

41
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,910
Hmm.

42
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,310
The posters go from 1988 straight to 1990.

43
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,430
There’s no poster for 1989.

44
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,720
I guess nothing important happened in China
in 1989.

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,050
You know, after seeing all of this excitement,
we want to get in on the festivities, too.

46
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,581
So here on China Uncensored, we’re going
to do a special series to celebrate 100 years

47
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,110
of the Chinese Communist Party.

48
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,790
But we’re going to cover the things that
the Chinese Communist Party might want to

49
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,790
skip.

50
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,430
We’re calling it: 100 Years of Things That
“Never Happened.”

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,290
More after the break.

52
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,970
Welcome back.

53
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,090
First up on 100 Years of Things That “Never
Happened”: The 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.

54
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:39,210
Or as many young Mainland Chinese people call
it, “What’s that?”

55
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,660
The Chinese Communist Party simply refers
to the massacre as the “June 4th Incident”.

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,540
That is, when they are forced to mention it
at all.

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,170
The Party much prefers making people forget
the whole thing ever happened.

58
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,800
Which has led to what some call Generation
Amnesia.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,760
The official Party line is that student protests
in 1989 were a “counterrevolutionary riot.”

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,510
You see, violent students attacked the poor,
heavily armed soldiers who had to shoot the

61
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,289
students, as well as innocent bystanders,
to defend themselves.

62
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,280
The Tiananmen Square Massacre is a huge turning
point in modern Chinese history.

63
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
There may well be a parallel universe where
the crackdown never happened, and China is

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,970
now a liberal democracy.

65
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,690
And only Quinn Mallory has seen it.

66
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,330
Yes, Sliders.

67
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,650
I said we’re talking about things people
have totally forgotten.

68
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,600
The massacre was the Chinese Communist Party's
final response to 7 weeks of protests led

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,680
by students demanding political reform, less
corruption, freedom of speech and the press.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,500
Only towards the end of the protests did people
start talking about democracy.

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,060
The students weren’t trying to overthrow
the Communist Party.

72
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,930
They believed the Communist Party could reform
itself.

73
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,360
Turns out, the answer was no.

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,980
The student protests at Tiananmen Square started
after Hu Yaobang died on April 15, 1989.

75
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,190
Hu was one of the only outspoken liberal reformers
in the Communist Party.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,280
He had been purged from the Party by Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, after Deng blamed Hu

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,210
for student protests in 1986.

78
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,290
At the time, people were like, “Who got
purged?”

79
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,490
“That’s right.

80
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,010
Hu got purged.”

81
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,560
Hundreds of thousands of students showed up
in Tiananmen Square for Hu Yaobang’s funeral.

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,400
That morphed into a series of protests and
marches.

83
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,250
But it all could have died down again, if
the Party hadn’t issued an editorial in

84
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,680
the People’s Daily on April 26.

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,270
“Titled ‘The Necessity for a Clear Stand
Against Turmoil,’ it described the protests

86
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,550
as a ‘well-planned plot’ to overturn Communist
rule.”

87
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,470
This editorial gave new life to the student
protest, and sparked protests across the country

88
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,250
in support of the students.

89
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,040
The students saw themselves as patriotic.

90
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,550
They were protesting for the good of the country.

91
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,770
And now workers, intellectuals, and ordinary
citizens started to join in.

92
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,680
Tiananmen Square witnesses remember this time
as having an air of celebration, with feelings

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,860
of joy and hope.

94
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,370
People paraded through the streets.

95
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,240
Some even brought their kids to see this historic
event.

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,430
On May 13, the students started a hunger strike.

97
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,990
These were some of the reasons the students
gave for the strike: “widespread illegal

98
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,229
business dealings by corrupt officials, the
dominance of abusive power, the corruptions

99
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,199
of bureaucrats, the fleeing of a large number
of good people to other countries, and the

100
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,300
deterioration of law and order”

101
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,740
Sounds kind of familiar.

102
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,580
One of the quirks of history is why we have
so many photos and videos of the Tiananmen

103
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,860
protests.

104
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,169
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was visiting
China at the time.

105
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,710
It was the first time Soviet and Chinese leaders
had met since the Sino-Soviet split in the

106
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,710
1960s.

107
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,449
And the Chinese Communist Party had allowed
in lots of foreign journalists to cover the

108
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:20,820
meeting.

109
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,680
It turns out, foreign journalists were more
interested in covering a million Chinese people

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,530
marching on Tiananmen Square.

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,009
But while all this hope and change was happening
in the square, the Party leadership, especially

112
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,260
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping , decided to
crack down on the protests and declare martial

113
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,759
law.

114
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,759
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was against
martial law.

115
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,650
He was forced to resign and purged from the
Party.

116
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,419
Zhao then famously went to Tiananmen Square
and apologized to the students, begging them

117
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,580
to leave.

118
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,229
After his speech on the square, Zhao would
spend the rest of his life under house arrest.

119
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:04,140
Zhao’s secretary, Bao Tong was imprisoned
for the protests.

120
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,740
He says that Deng Xiaoping was already planning
to get rid of Zhao, and the protests were

121
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,150
just a good excuse.

122
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,120
Deng replaced Zhao with Shanghai Party leader
Jiang Zemin , who would spend the next 20

123
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,430
years amassing power through his own crackdowns
on innocent citizens.

124
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,380
This is basically the prequel to General Hostility,
everyone’s favorite soap opera about Communist

125
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
Party power struggles.

126
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,029
But Zhao Ziyang wasn’t the only person to
stand against martial law.

127
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:38,789
A PLA general who commanded one of the most
elite units refused to deploy his soldiers

128
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,880
against the protesters.

129
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,259
He was also arrested and imprisoned.

130
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:48,000
Martial law didn’t go exactly as the Party
leaders had planned.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,329
As the first PLA soldiers tried to enter Beijing
on May 19, Beijing citizens actually convinced

132
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,910
them to turn back and leave.

133
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,939
Meanwhile, the protests continued to spread
to other cities.

134
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:06,470
They continued for another two weeks, before
the Party sent in the troops again, on the

135
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,529
night of June 3rd to June 4th.

136
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,139
This time, there was no turning back.

137
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:16,839
The soldiers drove the students out of Tiananmen
Square.

138
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,459
Even as they left, the students were still
singing the Communist Internationale and the

139
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,860
Chinese national anthem.

140
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,670
When the soldiers opened fire on the unarmed
civilians, most of them were killed on the

141
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,189
surrounding streets outside the square.

142
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,699
Here’s what one BBC reporter saw.

143
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,459
"The young man in front of me fell dead.

144
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,600
I fell over him.

145
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,670
Two others were killed yards away.

146
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,089
Two more people lay wounded on the ground
near me."

147
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:47,459
We still don’t know how many people died
in the massacre.

148
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,129
Estimates are in the thousands.

149
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:54,940
A recently declassified British diplomatic
cable puts the number at 10,000.

150
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,009
But the legacy of Tiananmen Square wasn’t
just the massacre.

151
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,490
The real legacy was what happened afterwards.

152
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,529
More after the break.

153
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,999
Welcome back.

154
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,790
You might be wondering why I haven’t talked
about this guy yet.

155
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:17,019
Well, Tank Man actually faced down those tanks
on June 5, the day after the soldiers killed

156
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,360
people in the streets.

157
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,629
Which, if you think about it, makes it even
more ballsy than you previously thought.

158
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:30,079
Also more ballsy: when you see how many tanks
this guy was actually facing down.

159
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,499
One of the photojournalists who took photos
of Tank Man had to hide his film in the toilet

160
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:38,569
to keep it from getting taken by Chinese police.

161
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:43,709
That’s because the suppression of any information
about the Tiananmen Square massacre was already

162
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,709
starting.

163
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,360
The Communist Party spent the next 18 months
running a mass political campaign designed

164
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,839
to scare the crap out of the Chinese people
and make sure this never happened again.

165
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,029
Over 4 million Chinese Communist Party members
were investigated for involvement in the protests.

166
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,050
Chinese state-run media showed video after
video of police capturing “counterrevolutionaries”

167
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,119
in raids.

168
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:14,050
Some of the students involved in the protests
escaped, others were arrested and sentenced.

169
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,889
People were told the best thing to do was
to forget.

170
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,649
To the point where many were even afraid to
admit they had family members who had been

171
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,149
killed in the massacre.

172
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:29,130
The Chinese Communist Party had a new bargain
for the Chinese people: shut up about politics,

173
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,629
and we’ll let you make money.

174
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,269
And most people took that bargain.

175
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:40,220
The Party also started a new patriotic education
campaign that used nationalism to erase the

176
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,309
memory of any wrongdoing by the Party.

177
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:48,739
As Chinese artist and former Tiananmen soldier
Chen Guang says, “China’s political education

178
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:53,549
forces you to forget what happened in the
past--forget the bad things that the party

179
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,459
did, and only remember the good things.”

180
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:02,569
A few years ago, we interviewed Tiananmen
survivor Fang Zheng . He lost both of his

181
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,470
legs after he was run over by a tank on June
4.

182
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,600
Fang says the Party is waging a memory war.

183
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,480
Fang Zheng: This has been one of the most
difficult problems in China, under the Chinese

184
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,110
Communist Party's rule, this type of memory
war.

185
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,480
The Chinese Communist Party has continuously
committed crimes against the Chinese people

186
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,420
during different periods of history, over
and over again, from when it first started

187
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,980
to rule to the present day, almost 70 years
now.

188
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,110
But why is it still successful?

189
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,119
The biggest reason is that through propaganda,
brainwashing, and thought control, they've

190
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:44,660
made people unaware of what happened in the
past.

191
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,730
According to Fang Zheng, the only way to fight
back is to remember.

192
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:54,549
Which explains why the Communist Party is
so against anyone who won’t forget the Tiananmen

193
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:55,549
massacre.

194
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,449
Like the Tiananmen Mothers, whose children
were killed.

195
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:00,869
Or the people of Hong Kong.

196
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:06,439
For decades, Hong Kong was the only place
in China where people could remember the Tiananmen

197
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,019
Square Massacre.

198
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,069
Every year, they held a vigil.

199
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:15,600
But now authorities warn that people could
be sentenced to five years in prison for doing

200
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,250
that.

201
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,749
So as the years go by, the Chinese Communist
Party is getting more and more successful

202
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:26,869
at treating the Tiananmen Square Massacre
as a thing that never happened.

203
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:30,299
One among many things that never happened.

204
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,720
Let us know what other things you’d like
us to talk about in this new series.

205
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,139
The Great Leap Forward?

206
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,610
The Cultural Revolution?

207
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,839
Leave your ideas below.

208
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,639
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a fan who supports China Uncensored on

209
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,110
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

210
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:51,290
Bruce Johnson asks "Chris, with Taiwan beginning
to take center stage with the CCP's increasing

211
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,689
aggression, is there any chance the US will
get serious before a conflict begins?

212
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,569
I realize there would be serious repercussions.

213
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:04,759
However, if the US is serious about defending
the island, getting started now with a new

214
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:11,339
security agreement including US bases seems
like the best bet, rather than reacting AFTER

215
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,069
the fighting begins."

216
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,559
Good question, Bruce.

217
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,560
It seems the US has already begun to take
steps to get serious about Taiwan, though

218
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,639
it's in the early stages.

219
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,739
Last August, the US sent the Secretary of
Health and Human Services to Taiwan—angering

220
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:28,739
China.

221
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:36,459
And the next month, the US sent another high-ranking
diplomat—also angering China.

222
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:43,589
This year in April, the US sent another delegation
to Taiwan—further angering China.

223
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:48,350
The problem with all these visits, though,
is that too many idiots in the media frame

224
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,100
this as "angering China," rather than supporting
our democratic ally.

225
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,679
And that makes politicians afraid to anger
China.

226
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,819
So progress has been slower than it could
be.

227
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:08,470
The US needs to start stationing troops in
Taiwan, doing military training with Taiwan,

228
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,609
and having consistent high-level strategic
talks with Taiwan.

229
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:18,339
This might "anger China" in the short term,
but actually acts as a deterrent to a Chinese

230
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,239
invasion, since the better prepared the US
and Taiwan are for war, the less of a chance

231
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,049
that war will happen.

232
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,089
Hopefully, the current administrations in
both countries can see that.

233
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:32,199
Thanks for your question, Bruce.

234
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,889
And thank you for watching this episode of
China Uncensored.

235
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:55,660
I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
