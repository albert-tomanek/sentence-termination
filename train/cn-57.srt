1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
I always thought that, as the curtain closes
and the coffin sort of slides away:

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,980
Thunderbirds music.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,680
Actually, no, Stingray would be better,
with the whole city descending.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,380
No, I was thinking the bit where they...
you know, Thunderbird 3, they sort of go back.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,960
GARY: Ohhh, yes!

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,200
Have the thing tilt over backwards like...

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,340
That was Thunderbird 1, wasn't it.
Not 3... 3 was the sofa.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,700
Thunderbird 2 would be a better coffin delivery system...
if we're actually going here...

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,820
MATT: [Laughs]
TOM: Yeah, that's true.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,960
Because you've got the combination of slides that could
take you all the way down to the crematorium.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,380
Gentlemen! Gentlemen:
Themed crematorium.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,720
MATT: Oooo.
GARY: [Gasps]

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,620
Also... How does Thunderbird 3 launch?

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,160
[Roar of flame]

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,700
Are you saying Jeff Tracy should have combined
his millionaire's tropical island with a crematorium?

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,420
Yeah. And then when you're picking up the urn...

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,300
you've basically got Thunderbird 2 comes along
and all the pods go by...

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,460
CHRIS: 'Oh, there's Granddad!'
TOM: [Mechanical whirring]

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,500
Are we making a series of crematorium gags here?

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,560
Yes. To be...

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,400
To go where no man has been before.

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,620
Crematorium Thunderbirds jokes, let's be clear.

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,860
Let's be fair. We're not completely stupid and irresponsible.

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,380
We're talking about, you know, aligning kids' favourites
with death. It's what they all need.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,060
So you could have like a Virgil Vigil?

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,200
Ohhhh.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,680
I like... that's not worth biscuits, it's just a...
Yeah. That's a golf clap. A golf-clap pun there.

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,740
It's a lovely knock-down...

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,520
Four... only just made it over the ropes.

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
GARY: Yeah. Yeah.
MATT: 'Golf-clap pun...'

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,780
Tell you what you could do...

32
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,340
You could replace all the paintings of the sons with whoever it is that's dead, couldn't you?

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,520
Yeah, but the thing is, when the eyes light up...

34
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,900
...that's when you know they've hit the flames!

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,440
If you *haven't* watched Thunderbirds, the last
couple of minutes have been very confusing for you.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,020
GARY: Pause it. Just get a 'Best Of'.
TOM: Yeah.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,940
Erm... we were on the coffin ray.

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,160
Do they spread the Black Death?
[Coughs]

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,280
TOM: Ahh!
GARY: Ahh...

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,560
TOM: Golf-clap pun.
GARY: Yeah, golf clap...

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,500
We'll just signal that one for...

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,980
Why are we reaming Matt today? What's he done?

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,800
TOM: It's normally me, so I'm not complaining.
CHRIS: Ah, fair.
