1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,960
The Beijing government does not like me.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,640
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,360
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,320
We're in Taiwan as part of our Pivot to Asia Tour.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,340
Is Taiwan a province of China?

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,600
An independent country?

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
Or just an awkward-to-describe region?

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,140
Yes, Taiwan may be a difficult place for many of our American viewers to understand.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,100
For instance,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,060
Taiwan politics has successful third parties.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,500
Sorry, Gary Johnson.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,520
And Jill Stein.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,040
Two main parties have dominated the Taiwanese political landscape since the 1990s:

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,940
The KMT, which favors closer ties with mainland China,

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,520
and the DPP, which currently dominates the government and views Taiwan as a separate country.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,780
But the elections in January that put the DPP in power

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
also saw the success of a third political party:

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,820
the NPP, founded by several well-known activists in Taiwan.

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,800
Including Taiwanese heavy metal music star and now legislator,

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,620
Freddy Lim.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,100
The NPP grew out of the 2014 Sunflower Movement.

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,720
When students occupied Taiwan's legislature

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,080
for 24 days, to protest a controversial trade deal with mainland China.

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,100
I had the opportunity to sit down

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,700
with current NPP chairman,

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,940
Mr. Huang Kuo-chang,

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,720
to discuss the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment in Taiwan and Hong Kong,

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,520
and the future of democracy in mainland China.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Huang.

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,520
My first question is,

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,460
what is the goal of the NPP as a political party?

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,120
We want to become the second-largest political party in the near future.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,180
The NPP - New Power Party - was founded last January,

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,480
kind of growing out of the Sunflower Movement.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,820
Our strongest supporting base

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,240
is young generations.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,780
And you mentioned the NPP sort of came out of the Sunflower Movement.

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,380
A lot of the political parties that came out of that movement

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,540
are often accused of being anti-China.

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,120
How would you respond to that?

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,580
It's not anti-China.

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,180
It's pro-democracy.

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,900
Pro-freedom.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
Pro-human rights.

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,980
So that has nothing to do with "against China."

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,980
But to keep our way of life.

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,880
To keep the democracy in Taiwan

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,920
more vibrant, more mature.

49
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,780
Do you think there is a risk to Taiwanese democracy?

50
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,340
Oh, sure!

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
It's happening every day.

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,500
Our biggest threat

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,560
is from the Chinese Communist Party.

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,840
But you will not see any TV channels

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,300
there to criticize the Chinese Communist Party.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,920
Why?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,260
Because the enormous economic influence

58
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,000
China has over Taiwan's many big corporations

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,520
which control most of our TV news.

60
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,280
How do you feel about the current situation in Hong Kong?

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,700
I...

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,380
To be frank,

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,440
I'm a little bit worried.

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,520
If we look at what is happening in Hong Kong right now,

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,040
Not only is democracy disappearing,

66
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,940
But also, its rule of law is seriously undermined

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,720
from all kinds of pressure from the Beijing government.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,180
I know during the Umbrella Movement,

69
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,800
you had been denied a visa to travel to Hong Kong.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,480
Have you been back since?

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,980
And here now, I'm still

72
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,300
not allowed to go to Hong Kong.

73
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,820
Why do you think that is?

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,600
The Beijing government does not like me.

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,620
We support all democratic movements in China.

76
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,580
We support...

77
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,480
- In mainland China?

78
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,420
Yes.

79
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,660
And we support all the lawyers.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,720
It requires a lot of courage to stand out against

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,360
the Chinese Communist Party.

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,860
How do you see the futures of Hong Kong and Taiwan being tied together?

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:45,260
What happened in Hong Kong really gave many Taiwanese a lot to think about.

84
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:53,000
That is also why we try our very best to support

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,920
all the democratic movements happening in Hong Kong right now.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,340
Because we realized that if

87
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,420
the Chinese Communist Party can change

88
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,340
the way of life in Hong Kong.

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,120
It is also very damaging and dangerous for us -

90
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,800
To keep our way of life.

91
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,920
So since the Taiwanese people

92
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,380
and the people in Hong Kong

93
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,280
both want democracy,

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,720
I think it's very important

95
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,000
for Hong Kong and Taiwan to stand together

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,420
against the overreaching from the Beijing government.

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,300
What do you think the young people in Hong Kong and Taiwan can do together?

98
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,340
We can support each other.

99
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,320
When our friends in Hong Kong came to Taiwan

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,640
to talk with us, and to discuss

101
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,400
what they can do in Hong Kong,

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,440
to change the status quo,

103
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,020
and what they can learn from our experience

104
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,000
of becoming a democratic country,

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,040
There are simply too many things,

106
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,460
too many experiences we can share with each other.

107
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,960
What do you think the role of these young people is?

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,580
In the past,

109
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,660
many people believed young people don't vote.

110
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,920
So their voice can't be ignored

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,940
in the political arena.

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,500
But after those civic movements,

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,360
our young generation not only came out to vote,

114
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,300
but they will also try to influence their parents -

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,780
even their grandpas and grandmas -

116
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,620
to change the way they vote.

117
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,280
And how do you think the United States could help Taiwan better deal with mainland China?

118
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,020
I think we need help from the United States.

119
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,820
Taiwan, we have a better chance

120
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,840
to be able to build

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,760
sufficient capability for us to defend

122
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,040
our own democracy.

123
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,800
So to our American audience,

124
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,260
why do you think they should be concerned about the situation in Hong Kong and Taiwan?

125
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,280
Look at what China did for the past few years.

126
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,580
They tried to

127
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:02,220
change the status quo in East Asia.

128
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,560
and by China's unilateral actions,

129
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,520
the South China Sea region became one of the most dangerous regions in the world.

130
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,840
And it not only affects

131
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,120
people living in this region,

132
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,260
But also, in fact,

133
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,100
the world order.

134
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,960
And even in the United States,

135
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,920
American people's interests,

136
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,100
By maintaining the stability

137
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:46,000
in this region, and also the Americans' business interest.

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,260
So if the United States chooses not to do anything

139
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,080
to stop China,

140
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,660
this threat to the United States had from China

141
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,920
is going to be increasing significantly.

142
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,980
Well, thank you very much for meeting with me today, Mr. Huang.

143
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,300
I have one final question, it's very important.

144
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,300
Do you think you could get me a spot in Freddy Lim's band?

145
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,580
What?!

146
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,020
I could ask him, but I don't see that being a big problem.

147
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,940
Alright, great! - Yeah, okay!

148
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,460
Thank you very much! - Thank you.
