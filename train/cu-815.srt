00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,940
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,540
the Chinese regime is battling the US for
world domination.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,800
And now they’re fighting a trade war.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,559
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,180
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,220
Since the 90s the United States has been

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,119
“engaging” with China more and more.

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,720
Most favored nation status.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,329
Normalized trade relations.

10
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,140
Entry into the World Trade Organization.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,929
Turns out, the Chinese Communist Party used
that

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,040
as an opening to hack US intellectual property,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,550
give unfair advantages to Chinese businesses,

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,510
and, let’s just say,

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,750
there’s hardly a World Trade Organization
rule

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,500
the Chinese regime hasn’t violated.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,390
So what can the US do?

18
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,390
President Trump,

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,940
who had been tweeting about these trade issues

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,390
even well before he was president...

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,600
...has doubled down on the trade war as a
solution.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,640
But who’s going to win?

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
China or the US?

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,200
I sat down with China expert Gordon Chang
to find out.

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,659
Thank you for joining me today, Gordon.

26
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,550
Thanks so much, Chris.

27
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,380
The US and China are in a trade war.

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,380
Who's winning?

29
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,030
It's a little bit early,

30
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,030
in a sense,

31
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,380
if we think about the tariffs this year.

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,259
But the Chinese have been waging a trade war

33
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:17,520
against the United States for decades,

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,460
and look at that perspective, well,

35
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,560
the Chinese are winning,

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,520
because they've been stealing, for instance,

37
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,830
hundreds of billions of dollars

38
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,460
of US intellectual property each year,

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,469
and there have been so many other predatory
tactics

40
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,659
that they have used against America.

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,759
Now, we're a big economy,

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,670
we're a strong and robust economy,

43
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,860
they're a fragile one.

44
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,240
So in that sense you could say,

45
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,750
"Well, maybe we're still okay."

46
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,750
But the point is,

47
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,640
the Chinese have made big gains over the course
of two decades,

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,909
and so we've got to understand that perspective.

49
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,850
Well, I know my favorite Chinese state-run
media, the Global Times,

50
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,990
has written several articles about you,

51
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,960
and they say you have a biased view towards
China.

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,610
Why are you so biased?

53
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,369
I don't think that I'm biased.

54
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:04,460
I think that I look at China realistically.

55
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,670
We have to understand what's going on in Beijing
right now.

56
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,360
You've got Xi Jinping, a very aggressive,
very provocative ruler.

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,140
He wants China to be bigger than it is today,

58
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,960
so for instance you have Chinese troops south
of the line

59
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,280
of the actual control in the Indian Himalayas,

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,220
you have the Chinese trying to take

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,000
the Senkaku Islands from the Japanese.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,890
The Chinese call them the Diaoyus.

63
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,610
They believe the South China Sea is actually
blue national soil,

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,190
but everybody else thinks it's the global
comet.

65
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,190
You go through,

66
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,360
there is a list of countries that are targets
of the Chinese,

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,910
and they're doing all sorts of other things.

68
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,350
For instance, we see them lasering American
planes,

69
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,610
blinding American pilots.

70
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,580
If you blind the pilot of a plane, Chris,

71
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,910
what you're trying to do is to bring it down.

72
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,810
That is an attack on the United States.

73
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,290
There have been a series of attacks on American
planes and vessels,

74
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,040
and we just sort of try to shrug it off,

75
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,560
but China is very aggressive right now,

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,670
and very dangerous.

77
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,230
So there's an overall war, you might say,

78
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,310
between China and the US,

79
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,490
and the trade war is just an economic part
of that.

80
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,490
Part of it, yes.

81
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,270
I mean, China has really tried to make itself
strong

82
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,160
by building up its economy,

83
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,350
and by using the fruits of that to build up
its military.

84
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,090
So, right now, China has the world's biggest
navy.

85
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,120
That means that they are using it for purposes
that us neighbors,

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
the international community,

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,110
the United States finds to be very destructive.

88
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,110
Mm-hmm.

89
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,440
So you called the trade war

90
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,150
an existential struggle for the Communist
Party.

91
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,370
What's at stake?

92
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,740
What's at stake is really you could say

93
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,430
the dominance of the 21st century.

94
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,320
The way I look at it is, the United States
has an economy

95
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,770
which is increasingly based on innovation.

96
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,010
If we cannot commercialize the fruits of innovation,

97
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,930
we don't have very much of an economy.

98
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,830
So, for us, it's really the future of the
United States.

99
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,360
You know, the economy has always been

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,260
the foundation of American strength,

101
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,670
so clearly that's what's at stake.

102
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,810
China doesn't want us to have that economy.

103
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,280
We don't want to be in a quote, unquote trade
war with the Chinese,

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,050
we want to get along with them.

105
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,540
We've had a succession of US Presidents who
thought that

106
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,360
the best interests of the Communist Party

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,500
were in the best interests of the United States.

108
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,120
We should engage with China.

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,870
This is really something which we don't want
to do,

110
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,330
but we've got our backs to the wall,

111
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,220
so we really have no choice but to defend
our economy.

112
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,300
Do you think a trade war is the best way to
deal with

113
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,430
the issues of intellectual property theft,

114
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,830
currency manipulation, trade violations?

115
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,830
We tried to talk to the Chinese,

116
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,229
to negotiate with them,

117
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,979
to engage them as you say,

118
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,280
it just hasn't worked over the course of decades.

119
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
As Bill Clinton said.

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,120
So what we have to do is impose costs.

121
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,430
People don't like tariffs,

122
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,960
the Section 301 tariffs.

123
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,099
Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974,

124
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,129
but the Chinese are not leaving us any choice.

125
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,280
If the tariffs don't work, Chris,

126
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,789
we're going to have to probably go to trying
to ban

127
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,919
Chinese imports into the United States,

128
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,460
things that are more drastic.

129
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,330
So let's hope that tariffs work, but if not,

130
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,509
we've got to be prepared to defend our society.

131
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,509
Okay.

132
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,370
What impact has the trade war up to now

133
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,960
had on the Chinese economy?

134
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,150
You know, we're at a really early stage of
the tariffs,

135
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,080
where the United States has really started
to impose costs,

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,229
so there is some shaking of the confidence,

137
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,870
but it's really, I think it's not so much
you can see it in GDP,

138
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,270
gross domestic product numbers.

139
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,419
You can't see it in ours.

140
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,530
There's been a lot of moaning, of course,

141
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,050
because people are worried about the cost
of consumer goods,

142
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,050
but the point is-

143
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,050
For the US.

144
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,199
For the US.

145
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,310
Also, you're going to see the same effects
in China eventually.

146
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,669
Right now, we've imposed $50 billion of Section
301 tariffs on China.

147
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:49,550
China's imposed $50 billion of tariffs on
us,

148
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,759
but last year we imported something

149
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,289
like $505 billion worth of goods from China,

150
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,569
so there's a lot more room for us to escalate
this.

151
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,689
By the way, China, they've sort of run out
of bullets,

152
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:02,689
in a sense,

153
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:07,310
because we only sold like $129 billion worth
of stuff to them,

154
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,740
so when they get to tariffs on $129 billion
of goods,

155
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,949
we've still got a lot more to go on them.

156
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,400
That's true.

157
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,780
Some Chinese officials have said,

158
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,229
"Oh, we can just do business, we can trade
more with Africa.

159
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:25,439
We don't need the United States."

160
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,120
Do you think that's a threat?

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,600
Long term, yeah, I suppose that's the case.

162
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,039
If you look at sub-Saharan Africa

163
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,590
is the fastest growing part of the world,

164
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,050
but you've got to remember that last year,

165
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,330
China's overall merchandise trade surplus,

166
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,729
88.8% of that related to sales to the United
States.

167
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,430
We now account for an outsized portion of
China.

168
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,320
They rely on selling things to the US.

169
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Decades down the road,

170
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,449
can they lessen that dependence?

171
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,809
Yes, they can.

172
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:58,900
But you've got to remember that

173
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,360
other countries are going to take

174
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,660
the same attitude that we've taken.

175
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,960
So now you see a much tougher posture on the
part of the Europeans,

176
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
for instance.

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm sure that decades down,

178
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,279
when Africa is really important to China,

179
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,710
you're going to see the same thing.

180
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,120
African nations are going to do the same thing
we're doing,

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,889
because they, like us, are going to protect
themselves.

182
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,930
How does this right now impact the Chinese
Communist Party?

183
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,529
There you're starting to see very interesting
symptoms,

184
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,370
because people in China are starting to understand

185
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,259
that they cannot win a long term struggle
with the United States,

186
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,740
and that's why Xi Jinping is trying to huff
and puff,

187
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,659
and bluff us down, but I don't think President
Trump

188
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,240
is really going to back down in the face of
that.

189
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,370
But what people are saying in China, is first
of all,

190
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,370
"Well, look.

191
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,370
We can't beat the Americans.

192
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,719
So the question is, why are we taking them
on?"

193
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,499
Xi Jinping, I think is coming in for a lot
of criticism.

194
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,710
There's been an erosion of his influence and
position.

195
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,449
We don't know how serious it is, but clearly
it's there,

196
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,120
because we are seeing people openly criticizing
him,

197
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,580
and we didn't see that six months or so ago.

198
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,960
The point right now is that people are saying,

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,919
"Who lost America?"

200
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,330
The United States, as we were talking about,

201
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,909
really did see it in its interest to help
China.

202
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,300
Now, Americans don't think that way, and we're
seeing

203
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,610
a hardening of attitudes, not only the US,

204
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,240
but also in places like Europe.

205
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
That is also critical,

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,740
because it means for instance that Beijing

207
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,240
cannot play Brussels off against Washington.

208
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Mm-hmm.

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,190
My view of the Chinese Communist Party has
maintained

210
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,510
its power by always saying that they can build
a middle class,

211
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,140
that they can keep the economy going and strong.

212
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,250
If there is a risk to the Chinese economy,

213
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,820
is that a risk to the Chinese Communist Party
itself,

214
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
or Xi Jinping?

215
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,830
Of course, because the Party has made it very
clear.

216
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,820
They've been explicit about this,

217
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,310
that the Communist Party has a right to rule,

218
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,120
not only because it represents the wave of
proletarianism,

219
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
the rest of it, but in a practical sense,

220
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,210
they say they have the right to rule because

221
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,640
they've been able to develop the economy.

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,940
They've been able to make China strong.

223
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,330
When China gets shaken by President Trump,

224
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,330
that's a problem for it.

225
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,560
So for instance, we had this seven year ban
on ZTE Corp,

226
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
the embattled Chinese telecom equipment maker.

227
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,800
That was a death sentence, and what the Chinese
officials said was,

228
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,940
"Oh my gosh.

229
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,390
The Americans are able to do this to us."

230
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,550
They started to blame us, of course,

231
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,040
but also Xi Jinping for creating this problem.

232
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,560
So that's why I think that Xi Jinping,

233
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,280
in order to regain the authority that he's
lost,

234
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,750
the position that he's lost,

235
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,630
what he needs to do is he needs to quote,
unquote

236
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,670
win the tariff battle with President Trump,

237
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,700
which means setting China into a very dangerous
position,

238
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,410
because long term, their economy cannot stand
up to ours.

239
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,480
We got a much bigger economy, we got a more
stable economy,

240
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,070
we're growing faster than China is in reality.

241
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,570
We don't have a critical systemic debt crisis
on our doorstep.

242
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,770
China is just not in a position to wage this
struggle,

243
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,790
and yet Xi Jinping is absolutely determined
to do so.

244
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,700
Speaking of Xi Jinping, and I'm in no way
defending him,

245
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,850
but these intellectual property theft, trade
violations,

246
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,260
none of this started with him.

247
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,380
That's been going on a long time.

248
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,070
Is it an issue that he might become the scapegoat

249
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,070
for some of these long term practices?

250
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,440
He's going to become a scapegoat for a lot
of things,

251
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,290
and the reason is that throughout his five
and a half years in power,

252
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,650
what he's done is he's purged a lot of people.

253
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,950
They call it anti corruption, but it's really
a political purge-

254
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,950
Political opponents.

255
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,590
So he's created enemies.

256
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,520
Those enemies have been intimidated by him,

257
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,650
but recently they've been coming out and criticizing
him in public,

258
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,310
which is an indication that Xi Jinping's in
a little bit of trouble.

259
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,380
Whatever the issue is, it could be the South
China Sea,

260
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,800
it could be Taiwan, whatever doesn't go right
for Xi Jinping,

261
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,770
his adversaries are going to use it.

262
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,130
Remember, he's made himself the chairman of
everything.

263
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,640
That means when things go well for China,

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,410
great for Xi Jinping politically.

265
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,930
But when things don't go well, he does not
have anybody else to blame,

266
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,980
because he said he's supposed to be in control.

267
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,130
Absolute control.

268
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,310
That means he's absolutely responsible when
things

269
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,950
don't go the way the Chinese want them to.

270
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,430
Let's talk about Xi Jinping's Made in China
2025.

271
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,280
How is this trade war going to affect that?

272
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,850
Am I still going to be able to buy a Huawei
phone

273
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,740
with pre-installed spyware?

274
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,970
I don't think so, unless you go to China itself.

275
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,040
We've seen countries now start to say,

276
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,060
"Look, we're not going to allow Huawei networks
for 5G."

277
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,290
5G is the next generation of wireless communications.

278
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,010
You can't buy it in Australia,

279
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,790
you probably will not be able to buy it in
the United States as well.

280
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,600
I think other countries probably will follow
suit.

281
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,740
Made in China 2025, where they've designated
10 sectors to dominate,

282
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,170
now 11 with the addition of 5G,

283
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,170
that is just one big World Trade Organization
violation,

284
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,780
because of its numerical targets for Chinese
control of its own market.

285
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,600
On its face, it's just not going to pass WTO
muster.

286
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,840
When has that stopped them before?

287
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,550
It hasn't stopped them before, but it is also
now

288
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,190
at the core of the US complaints against China.

289
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,080
You know, in the beginning when we started
this tariff struggle,

290
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,510
President Trump was saying, "Look, I'd be
happy if you reduce

291
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,980
the bilateral trade deficit by $200 billion."

292
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,080
They're not talking about that anymore.

293
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,480
They're talking about China's industrial policy,

294
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,840
which is Made in China 2025.

295
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,570
They're talking about subsidies for state-owned
enterprises.

296
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,090
They're talking about things that go to the
core

297
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,500
of the Communist Party's economy.

298
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,750
So Made in China 2025 is now a critical issue

299
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,270
in the discussions between the US and China,

300
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,270
when they occur.

301
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,360
They're not occurring very often,

302
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,750
by the way, but the point is that the US has
now decided

303
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,340
to focus in on the critical issues,

304
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,060
not just sort of the thing about trade deficits,

305
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,400
which were superficial at best.

306
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,930
So this is expanded in scope.

307
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,950
It's kind of more fundamental.

308
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,090
Absolutely more fundamental.

309
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,211
That is the exact word for this.

310
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,870
This has become structural, fundamental.

311
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,720
We're not looking at things that are peripheral
anymore,

312
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,610
and that's a problem for China.

313
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,800
Xi Jinping and a lot of other people are not
in the mood

314
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,400
to change Made in China 2025.

315
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,200
They are willing to not talk about it,

316
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,420
they try to downplay it in the media,

317
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,880
but nonetheless, they're not giving up on
it,

318
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,530
which means that as long as President Trump
is around,

319
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,180
he's going to be banging on them in this.

320
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,670
I think it's even just more than Trump, because

321
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,550
there's a bipartisan consensus now in the
United States

322
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,710
that something's got to be done about China.

323
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,710
Yeah.

324
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,920
I remember even Chuck Schumer said he'd like

325
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,920
to give Trump a pat on the back over the initial
tariff.

326
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,280
If you look at Congress, Trump's support on
tariffs

327
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,090
is found mainly in the Democratic Party.

328
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,030
There's a number of reasons for that,

329
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,670
but everyone's coming along, because, yeah,

330
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,700
people don't like tariffs, they moan about
them,

331
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,090
complain about them, but the question is,

332
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,680
what you going to do about China's theft of
US intellectual property?

333
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,380
This is an existential threat for the American
economy,

334
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,680
which means it's an existential threat for
the country as a whole.

335
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,370
What are the possible risks for the US economy?

336
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,040
How is this going to affect your average American?

337
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,680
I think that what we could see, for instance,

338
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,450
consumer prices will go up on things.

339
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,450
But you've got to remember,

340
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,160
this is overblown.

341
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,460
So for instance, take this mug.

342
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,630
A lot of them are made in China.

343
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,960
Not that one.

344
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,580
Not this one, and I congratulate you for that.

345
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,580
Thank you.

346
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,590
The point is, most mugs in the US are made
in China.

347
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,410
Prices are going to go up on mugs at some
point,

348
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,960
but it really doesn't matter.

349
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,400
The reason is that mug manufacturers can easily

350
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,010
move their supply chains out of China.

351
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,860
We're starting to see that already for a number
of reasons,

352
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,340
not only because China's no longer

353
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,460
the low cost manufacturer in the world,

354
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,670
but also because companies are worried about
the security

355
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,900
of their supply chains because of the quote,
unquote trade war.

356
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,040
So you're seeing companies now actively take
steps

357
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,340
to move their supply chains out of the People's
Republic.

358
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,470
Also, there's one company that going to have
a really hard time,

359
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,630
and that is Apple,

360
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,190
because their supply chain is firmly fixed
in China because of Foxconn,

361
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,800
their contract manufacturer.

362
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,370
Even Apple at some point will be able to move
if it gets bad enough.

363
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,950
The other effect is we won't be able to sell
soybeans to China.

364
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,130
Soybean farmers are sort of up in arms, but
the point is,

365
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,250
there are only so many soybeans in the world

366
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,110
at this particular moment, Chris.

367
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,320
So if China doesn't buy US soybeans,

368
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,730
they've got to buy them from, basically Brazil.

369
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,950
That means Brazil is not going to sell to
its traditional customers,

370
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,300
which means the US is going to sell to Brazil's
customers.

371
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,750
By the way, that tentative agreement that
President Trump

372
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,940
negotiated with the European Union,

373
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,750
part of that deal is that Europe buys American
soybeans.

374
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,900
So soybean farmers are going to be hurt a
little bit,

375
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
but not too much.

376
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,860
By the way, a lot of people in Iowa,

377
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,930
they're not going to be planting soybeans
this year.

378
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,570
They're going to be planting corn or other
things.

379
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,000
That high fructose corn syrup we all love.

380
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,520
Yes, and I got a sweet tooth.

381
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,140
But the point is,

382
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,120
what we're going to see is American farmers
adjust.

383
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,690
And yes, there will be problems to the US
economy,

384
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,830
but you cannot have maintained decades of
misguided trade policies,

385
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,560
economic policies with China and expect we
can get out of this

386
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,940
without any cost.

387
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,990
We're going to have to do this,

388
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,870
because the overriding reality is that China
is harming our economy,

389
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,160
and it's doing so in a malicious manner.

390
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,400
We can compete with anybody fairly.

391
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,079
If they compete fairly and they win, that's
one thing.

392
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,329
But that's not what's happening now, Chris.

393
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,699
What we're seeing is China, one WTO violation
after another.

394
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,029
One violation of their bilateral agreements
with us after another,

395
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,329
and these are critical.

396
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,400
They're not just superficial, unimportant
violations,

397
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,520
they go to the core of our trading relationship
with China.

398
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,850
We've got to do something.

399
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,999
That's why this is not just a Trump issue,

400
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,010
this is an American issue.

401
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,850
Americans understand they need to protect
their economy.

402
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,110
I mean, we're talking hundreds of billions
of dollars

403
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,080
in the loss to American companies and workers.

404
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,840
So clearly, this is unacceptable.

405
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,990
We've accepted it for far too long,

406
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,600
and basically Americans are saying now,

407
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,390
"No, we're not going to accept it."

408
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,639
That's why people may not like the tariffs

409
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:52,799
under Section 301 of the Trade Act of '74,

410
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,330
but the point is what else you going to do?

411
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,059
If those tariffs don't work, as I mentioned,

412
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,299
we're going to have to do things which are
even more drastic.

413
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,809
But at the end of the day,

414
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,320
we're going to make sure that we defend our
economy.

415
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,940
So what's the end game?

416
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,649
I think the end game is a long struggle with
a very willful Xi Jinping,

417
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,090
but it's a struggle that we, because I mentioned
we don't want,

418
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,690
but it's a struggle that we have no choice
but to wage.

419
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,299
So we will wage it, and I think that China,
long term,

420
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,340
as I mentioned, even the Chinese understand

421
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,660
they cannot win that struggle with us.

422
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,770
