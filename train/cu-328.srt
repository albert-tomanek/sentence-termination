1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,810
China’s military is getting stronger,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,279
and it needs foreign technology.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,200
Is Google helping the Chinese military?

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,600
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,520
Google.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,090
It’s not the first Western company

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,570
to do business in China—

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,000
not by a long shot.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,620
But when it comes to tech companies,

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,730
Google was always the good guy,

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,789
with its famous motto,

13
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,720
“Don’t be evil.”

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,029
That is, until Google

15
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,190
conveniently removed that motto last year.

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,359
And you may also remember,

17
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,059
a few months later,

18
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,309
employees leaked Google’s plans

19
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:42,940
to launch a censored search engine for China.

20
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,960
And then Google employees protested,

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,530
saying launching a censored Chinese search
engine

22
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,839
would definitely be evil.

23
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:51,409
Obviously they missed the point.

24
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,600
It’s ok for Google to be evil

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,890
now that they’ve changed their motto!

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,739
Sadly, Google is under fire again.

27
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,059
This time, from President Trump.

28
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,989
And while it’s not exactly for being evil,

29
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,539
it *is* for being “terrible”.

30
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:08,840
“Google is helping China and their military,

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,780
but not the U.S. Terrible!”

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,070
Like many of Trump’s tweets,

33
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,159
this was met by some...skepticism from the
media.

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,270
In an article called “Trump Now Just Accusing
Google

35
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,320
of Aiding the Chinese Military, or Whatever,”

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,340
tech news website Gizmodo wrote that

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,460
“Most likely...the president heard

38
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,490
some kind of sound bite about Google and China...

39
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,140
but did not mull the specifics

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,280
before using it as an opportunity

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,340
to lob another wild accusation at the company.”

42
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,509
To be fair, it *is* hard to picture Trump

43
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:42,429
“mulling the specifics” before tweeting
anything.

44
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:46,439
He’s more the kind of guy who tweets from
the hip.

45
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,659
But is saying that Google is helping China’s
military

46
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,350
just a wild accusation?

47
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,640
Some people don’t think so.

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,700
Like the highest-ranking military officer
in the US.

49
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,520
“The work that Google is doing in China

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,569
is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military…”

51
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:07,479
“We watch with great concern

52
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,380
when industry partners work with China

53
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,950
knowing there is an indirect benefit,

54
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,180
frankly, indirect, may be not

55
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,410
a full categorization of the way it really
is.

56
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,980
It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese
military.”

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,151
Google’s connections to the Chinese military

58
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:23,420
are not obvious.

59
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,250
It’s not like they did a blog post about
it.

60
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,250
To be clear,

61
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,650
this is not a real Google blog post.

62
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,790
But the photo is real.

63
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,400
It was taken while Google’s CEO

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,629
was speaking at the very real

65
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,830
state-sponsored “Global Internet Conference”

66
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,230
held in Wuzhen, China in 2017.

67
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,480
Because nothing screams a free and open global
internet,

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,159
like being sponsored by the Chinese Communist
Party.

69
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,250
At the conference,

70
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,050
Google’s CEO told the audience that, quote

71
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,920
“A lot of work Google does is to help Chinese
companies”.

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,250
And Google’s work with Chinese companies

73
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,760
is how Google—indirectly—

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,910
is helping China’s military.

75
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,080
Or to be more accurate,

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
China’s People’s Liberation Army,

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,450
which belongs directly to the Chinese Communist
Party.

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,299
That same People’s Liberation Army

79
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:16,220
has threatened the United States,

80
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,420
and stolen untold amounts of US military secrets.

81
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,140
Looking into this, we found at least two ways

82
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,580
that Google has been indirectly supporting

83
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,080
the People’s Liberation Army—the PLA.

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,250
Here’s the first way.

85
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,000
Google has invested more than

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,500
half a billion dollars in JD.com,

87
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,890
which owns JD Logistics.

88
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,290
According to state-run media,

89
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,390
back in 2017,

90
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,300
the PLA Air Force signed a major agreement

91
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,969
to “cooperate with five Chinese non-military
companies

92
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,060
[including JD Logistics] to upgrade

93
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,500
civil-military logistics integration.”

94
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,939
It looks like that partnership includes

95
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,150
using JD’s drones and logistics software

96
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,790
to deliver supplies for the air force.

97
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,489
Chinese “state-media hailed

98
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,930
the JD.com [PLA Air Force] partnership

99
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,459
as an ‘innovative specimen of civil-military
fusion.’”

100
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,920
And last year JD logistics signed a similar
agreement

101
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,620
with the PLA land forces.

102
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,220
And since Google owns half a billion dollars
of JD.com,

103
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,650
which owns a majority share in JD Logistics,

104
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,360
it’s a bit like Google is partnering with
the PLA.

105
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Indirectly.

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,850
I know what you’re thinking.

107
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,150
Who cares about logistics and supply chains?

108
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,940
Besides every military in the world.

109
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,860
Anyway, I’m sure JD.com is happy to be

110
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,840
directly helping the PLA.

111
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,600
Its CEO, Liu Qiangdong,

112
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,330
is a celebrated Communist Party member.

113
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,830
And “civil-military fusion” is one of
Xi Jinping’s

114
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,600
key national strategies right now.

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,540
It means private Chinese companies

116
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,290
are supposed to help the military.

117
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,000
Win-win cooperation.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,480
For the military.

119
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,800
So Google is partnered with a Chinese company

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,060
that has strong links to the Communist Party,

121
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,550
and is helping the PLA with logistics.

122
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,680
Terrific.

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,660
Here’s the second way Google been

124
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,280
indirectly supporting China’s military:

125
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,100
Artificial Intelligence.

126
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,970
At the end of 2017, Google opened up

127
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,690
an Artificial Intelligence research lab in
Beijing,

128
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,310
because “science has no borders.”

129
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,250
The Chinese military would agree,

130
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,680
because it doesn’t recognize borders

131
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,350
between civilian and military technology.

132
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,380
It’s that whole “civil-military” fusion
thing again.

133
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,880
As former US Deputy Defense Secretary Bob
Work said,

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,780
“Anything that’s going on in [Google’s
AI center in China]

135
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,990
is going to be used by the military.”

136
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,960
And anyone who’s worked on AI programming
knows,

137
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,420
it’s a highly collaborative process—

138
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,250
where a lot of people share data to train
their bots.

139
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,370
So why would Google set up an AI Center in
China?

140
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,560
Well, one reason might be that they have access

141
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,770
to huge amounts of data there,

142
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,310
and aren’t so restricted by America’s

143
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,420
or Europe’s pesky privacy laws.

144
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,790
Google is also hiring

145
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,800
a large number of local employees.

146
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,210
As of last August,

147
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,750
Google had 700 employees in China.

148
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,030
Now I don’t know for sure if Google

149
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,580
has a Communist Party branch,

150
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,780
but in theory,

151
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,880
“companies in China,

152
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,470
including foreign firms,

153
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,930
are required by law to establish a party organization.”

154
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,070
Plus Google has been encouraging

155
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,740
Chinese developers to use TensorFlow—

156
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,520
a Google software library useful for AI development.

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,210
As China researcher Matthew Robertson puts
it,

158
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,220
“Aside from meeting Google’s own research
needs,

159
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,520
[Google’s AI China Center] will without
doubt

160
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,310
also help fertilize China’s own AI ambitions
and talent.”

161
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,440
And China’s military is rushing to use

162
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,470
artificial intelligence—

163
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,620
so they’ll be needing that talent.

164
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,520
So while Google’s AI research in China

165
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,680
may not directly support China’s military,

166
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,740
the AI technology Google develops in China

167
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,090
will almost certainly be *used* by China’s
military.

168
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,770
If Google doesn’t share technology

169
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,210
with the Chinese military directly,

170
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,860
its Chinese partners will.

171
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,680
I mean, how could Chinese tech companies say
no?

172
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,370
Seriously, they’re not allowed to say no
to the Party.

173
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,620
So there you have it:

174
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,120
Google is partnering with JD.com,

175
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,370
which partners with the PLA.

176
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,220
And Google is partnering with Chinese AI companies

177
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,660
to develop technology

178
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,340
that will be almost certainly used by the
PLA.

179
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,260
We did reach out to Google for their response—

180
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,250
specifically about the AI Center in China

181
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,270
and their partnership with JD.com.

182
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,970
They didn’t reply about those things directly,

183
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,460
but they *did* send us this two-sentence

184
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,610
cookie-cutter statement attributable to

185
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,670
“a Google spokesperson.”

186
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,670
It says,

187
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,930
“We are not working with the Chinese military.

188
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,990
We are working with the U.S. government,

189
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,810
including the Department of Defense,

190
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,170
in many areas including cybersecurity,

191
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,430
recruiting and healthcare.”

192
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,890
No mention, though,

193
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,170
of how Google canceled Project Maven.

194
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,550
That was a partnership with the Department
of Defense

195
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,370
that supplied imaging tools

196
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,490
used by American military drones.

197
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,400
Google stopped project Maven

198
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,940
because lots of employees protested it.

199
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,620
They didn’t want Google’s technology

200
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,829
to be used for weapons.

201
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:39,789
Not for American weapons at least.

202
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,669
So when Trump tweeted that

203
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,379
“Google is helping China and their military,

204
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:45,720
but not the U.S.

205
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Terrible,”

206
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
he’s mostly right.

207
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,430
It is terrible.

208
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,790
Of course, Google is in a tough spot.

209
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,170
Even if it develops technology

210
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,490
entirely for private use,

211
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,740
the Chinese military can still buy it

212
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,240
or co-opt it for weapons.

213
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,189
But no one forced Google

214
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:04,810
to set up an office in Beijing,

215
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,899
or to partner with Chinese tech companies

216
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,120
that have ties to the Chinese military—

217
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,830
at a time when the Communist Party

218
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,170
is demanding “civil-military fusion.”

219
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,579
Now just to be clear,

220
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,829
Google is not the only US tech company

221
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:20,740
to have questionable dealings in China.

222
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,149
In fact, I could make a whole video out of
that,

223
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,560
starting with Cisco,

224
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,259
which basically built China’s Great Firewall.

225
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,600
Let me know in the comments below

226
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
if you’d like to see that video.

227
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
But I think we’re all just

228
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,240
a little more disappointed in Google,

229
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,540
especially since it pulled out of China in
2010,

230
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,820
seemingly out of principle.

231
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,870
But I guess access to that sweet, sweet China
market

232
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,649
is one of the benefits to removing

233
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,459
“Don’t be evil” from your motto.

234
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,750
So what do you think of Google’s

235
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,769
indirect support of the Chinese military?

236
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,540
Leave your comments below.

237
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
And before we go,

238
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,730
it’s time for me to answer a question

239
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,930
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

240
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,040
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

241
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,240
BlueFox asks:

242
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,009
“Hey Chris, what's your zombie plan?”

243
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,879
That’s a good question,

244
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,800
given that my last episode was about

245
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,360
China’s zombie apocalypse.

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,770
Well, zombie *company* apocalypse.

247
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,129
Sort of different.

248
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,240
But if there were a real zombie attack,

249
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,329
I’d just head on over to

250
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,209
the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York.

251
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,120
It’s ranked one of 8 buildings around the
world

252
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,720
to help you survive the apocalypse—

253
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,629
because it has “relatively few windows

254
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,490
and is made of concrete.”

255
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,110
It sure is ugly,

256
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,170
but it’ll do in a pinch.

257
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,160
I’ll just wait there for the zombies

258
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,319
to eat the rest of New York.

259
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,529
And when they’re in a serious food coma,

260
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,199
I’ll make my way to the survivor’s colony
in Vermont.

261
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,949
It works in movies, right?

262
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:47,319
Thanks for your question, BlueFox.

263
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,629
And thank *you* to all of our supporters—

264
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,709
who contribute a dollar or more per episode

265
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,209
through our Patreon website.

266
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,310
We rely mainly on your support—

267
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,339
not advertising—

268
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,280
to keep China Uncensored going.

269
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,700
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

270
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,780
See you next time.
