1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,040
Hong Kong’s freedom is in danger

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,750
From scary new extradition rules.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,410
Some people in Hong Kong could end up

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,460
extradited to mainland China.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,160
But the people of Hong Kong are fighting back.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,250
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,289
Umbrellas are once again in the streets of
Hong Kong.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,750
Not because of foul weather—

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,199
more like foul laws that rain down on freedom

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,039
and wash away democratic institutions.

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,880
The Hong Kong government has proposed amendments

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,420
to Hong Kong’s extradition laws.

14
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,739
If passed, people in Hong Kong

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,559
could be extradited to mainland China

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,160
to face trial for things that are illegal
in China.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,579
So Hong Kongers did what they’re so good
at:

18
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,949
They protested.

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:49,510
En masse.

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,069
130,000 people.

21
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:54,899
Clearly, no one wants to be extradited to
mainland China.

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,949
“The way they have organised this law,

23
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,930
as soon as they want to extradite you,

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,930
it’s hopeless.

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,739
The scariest thing is that in the mainland

26
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:05,159
they can detain you via executive order.

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,310
No crime is needed.”

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,530
It’s scary because China

29
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,600
has very different laws than Hong Kong.

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,810
Laws that say criticizing the Communist Party

31
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,600
or practicing religion are punishable by long
prison sentences.

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,299
And even if they don’t have a law for the
thing you did,

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,460
don’t worry,

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,250
they can make one up.

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,670
Back in 1997,

36
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,759
the UK had to give Hong Kong to the People’s
Republic of China.

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,340
But they were concerned that the Chinese regime

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,770
would immediately take away Hong Kong people’s
freedom.

39
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,450
So the British had the Chinese government

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,350
sign the Sino-British Joint Declaration—

41
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,590
where China promised not to change Hong Kong’s
laws

42
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,070
for at least 50 years.

43
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,300
Only *after* 50 years,

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,680
could the Chinese regime take away Hong Kong
people’s freedom.

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,210
But it’s been only 22 years,

46
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,729
and already the Chinese regime is like,

47
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,140
“What Sino-British Joint Declaration?

48
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,009
Haha, suckers!”

49
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,679
But taking away Hong Kong’s freedoms

50
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,780
has been done little by little,

51
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,299
step by step.

52
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,770
Mostly by the Chinese regime

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,829
gradually influencing the Hong Kong government,

54
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,060
which is made up of an unusual combination
of

55
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,750
elected officials and business groups,

56
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,470
often with Mainland ties.

57
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,060
And then, from within Hong Kong’s government,

58
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,030
the Chinese regime uses the law to undermine
freedoms.

59
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,250
So it’s all done legally.

60
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,640
This became apparent in 2003,

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,770
when the Hong Kong government proposed Article
23,

62
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,860
an anti-subversion law.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,440
It would have allowed Hong Kong authorities

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,030
to charge citizens with treason or subversion
for things like...

65
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,840
saying Hong Kong should be independent from
mainland China.

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Article 23 would have also allowed police

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,510
to search people’s homes,

68
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,640
seize property,

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,450
and detain people without a warrant,

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,870
as long as they *suspected* someone of treason
or subversion.

71
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,400
Even for so-called crimes like

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,980
handing out anti-Communist Party pamphlets.

73
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,250
I mean, just look at this man handing out
a flyer

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,320
on how the Communist Party persecutes Falun
Gong.

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,960
Information is very dangerous.

76
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
The good news is,

77
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,560
half a million Hong Kong residents looked
at Article 23 and said

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,120
“Nope!”

79
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,350
And they got the government to ultimately
back down and not pass it.

80
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,380
That was 2003.

81
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,710
Then in 2014,

82
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,260
the Hong Kong government said they would allow
people

83
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,370
to vote for their Chief Executive—

84
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,170
which is like a governor—

85
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,600
but only from among candidates

86
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,770
that the Chinese Communist Party pre-approved.

87
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,371
And once again, the people of Hong Kong

88
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,960
looked at this encroachment on their freedom
and said,

89
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
“Nope!”

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,690
That’s how the 2014 Umbrella Movement began—

91
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,220
where thousands of people occupied major streets

92
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,110
in Hong Kong in protest for 79 days.

93
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,580
But after that,

94
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,090
the Chinese Communist Party got more clever.

95
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,920
They probably had a hand in getting

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,340
democratically elected pro-democracy legislators

97
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,450
disqualified from parliament

98
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,790
And they pressured Hong Kong to go

99
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,360
after people for protesting in the Umbrella
Movement.

100
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Just last week,

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,330
a Hong Kong court sentenced nine leaders to
prison—

102
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,670
some of them for as long as 16 months.

103
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,020
Their crime?

104
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,980
Creating a “public nuisance.”

105
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,019
And that was the straw that broke the camel’s
back.

106
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,720
Or the bamboo that broke the panda’s back.

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,829
Or something.

108
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,000
Anyway, this past Sunday, April 28,

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,580
130,000 Hong Kongers protested the latest
encroachment:

110
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,400
the new extradition rules.

111
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,960
Hong Kong already has extradition treaties
with 20 countries—

112
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,620
but they’re free countries,

113
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,560
like the US and the UK.

114
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,310
But under the proposed changes,

115
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,680
the Hong Kong Chief Executive

116
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,190
“would have the right to order the extradition

117
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,020
of wanted offenders to China, Macau and Taiwan.”

118
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,120
But don’t worry!

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,090
Hong Kong promises they’re totally

120
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,060
not going to use it against dissidents.

121
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,340
“The [Hong Kong] government justified

122
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,670
the swift introduction of the changes

123
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,510
by saying they are needed so a young Hong
Kong man

124
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,920
suspected of murdering his girlfriend in Taiwan

125
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,790
can be extradited to face charges there.”

126
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,620
Riiight, for that one case involving Taiwan,

127
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,250
it’s necessary to allow extraditions to
mainland China now, too.

128
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,830
Why not just have a bilateral extradition
treaty

129
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,250
between Hong Kong and Taiwan?

130
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,040
Well, because the Chinese Communist Party

131
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,200
considers Taiwan part of China.

132
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,590
So I don’t think they’d be too happy

133
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,220
if the Hong Kong government had a deal with
Taiwan

134
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,660
and it didn’t have with Mainland China.

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,310
They’re the same country after all.

136
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,050
So the excuse is obviously flimsy.

137
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,050
But don’t worry,

138
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,820
you can trust the government.

139
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,440
They won’t abuse the law!

140
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,170
Now to all those people who say,

141
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,790
Chris Chappell, you’re exaggerating!

142
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,450
The law only applies to serious crimes,

143
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,450
not dissidents!

144
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,840
Well, you’re technically right.

145
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,300
It only applies to crimes that

146
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,940
“if the conduct had occurred in Hong Kong,

147
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,370
would constitute an offence...punishable in
Hong Kong

148
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,639
with imprisonment for more than 3 years.”

149
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,639
But remember,

150
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,380
Hong Kong just jailed a bunch of democracy
activists

151
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,440
to 16 months in prison for the “crime”

152
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,260
of creating a public nuisance.

153
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,270
So there’s already a trend away from Hong
Kong’s

154
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,800
traditional British-style freedoms.

155
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,850
But to be fair,

156
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,550
this current round of changes to the extradition
law

157
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,500
is not at the level of allowing mainland Chinese
authorities

158
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,071
to just go into Hong Kong

159
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,370
to grab any activist they want.

160
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,040
But it very likely *is* step 1 in a larger
plan—

161
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,610
a plan to make Hong Kong’s legal system

162
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,110
look a lot more like the legal system in the
rest of China.

163
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,930
It’s also possible dissidents

164
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,960
aren’t the main target of the extradition
law.

165
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,650
They might just be icing on the cake.

166
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,830
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is in a life or
death power struggle

167
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,130
with a rival faction in the Chinese Communist
Party

168
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,290
made up of officials and businesspeople

169
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,240
tied to former Chinese leader,

170
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,669
and retired Battletoad, Jiang Zemin.

171
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,380
Since everyone’s corrupt in the Communist
Party,

172
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,440
Xi Jinping has been using what he calls

173
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,580
an anti-corruption campaign to go after them.

174
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,480
“Since Xi started the push in 2012,

175
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,310
authorities have investigated more than 2.7
million officials

176
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,930
and punished more than 1.5 million people.”

177
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,570
The problem is, many of Xi Jinping’s rivals

178
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,680
have fled with their ill gotten gains to Hong
Kong.

179
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
Like a jar of honey,

180
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,640
just out of reach.

181
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,919
In fact, it’s widely believed Jiang’s
political faction

182
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,260
still controls Hong Kong.

183
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,060
The new extradition law could help Xi

184
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,290
purge his rivals in Hong Kong,

185
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,380
so he’d have greater control.

186
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,540
Xi Jinping’s got Jiang under close watch.

187
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,680
In this scenario, Piglet is obviously me.

188
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,889
So it could be part of the reason why this
protest

189
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,250
has united both democracy activists and businesspeople—

190
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,710
to say no to the extradition proposal.

191
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,870
Notice the sign says “No China Extradition.”

192
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,120
No one seems to be concerned about Taiwan
Extradition.

193
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,430
And that reflects the larger problem.

194
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,150
Normally, extradition only happens between
countries

195
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,590
that have a comparable legal system—

196
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,990
allowing fair trials,

197
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,699
and allowing the accused access to a lawyer.

198
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,229
So it makes sense to extradite people from
Hong Kong

199
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,990
to the UK, or the US, or even Taiwan,

200
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,300
not that I’m saying Taiwan is a country.

201
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,419
But mainland China?

202
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:21,430
People in mainland China

203
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,669
sometimes don’t even get a trial.

204
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,800
They just sit in prison,

205
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,760
like this Chinese journalist.

206
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,669
Or are denied access to a lawyer,

207
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,620
like this Australian writer.

208
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,909
Or if you’re like this elderly Falun Gong
practitioner,

209
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,930
face trial,

210
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,469
but it lasts only 20 minutes

211
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,370
and you’re not allowed to defend yourself.

212
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,000
Her “crime,” by the way,

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
was distributing flyers exposing

214
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,260
how the Communist Party persecutes Falun Gong.

215
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,009
Tragic irony.

216
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,009
So anyway,

217
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,260
Hong Kong’s new extradition rules

218
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,649
are just one small step towards bringing

219
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,709
Hong Kong’s legal system closer to mainland
China.

220
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,709
But the Hong Kong government

221
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,920
wants to make sure you don’t worry about
it!

222
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,559
It’s really just to make sure that suspected
murderer

223
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,930
faces trial in Taiwan.

224
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,310
But Hong Kongers over the weekend still said
“Nope!”

225
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,180
And now they want Hong Kong’s chief executive

226
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,059
to step down over it.

227
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,660
For them, that’s “step 1”.

228
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,149
So what do you think the protests over

229
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,399
Hong Kong’s new extradition rules?

230
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,410
Will protesters be able to block them?

231
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,300
Leave your comments below.

232
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
And before I go,

233
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,790
now’s the time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

234
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,209
who supports China Uncensored

235
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:31,450
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

236
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,510
carbide149 asks:

237
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,990
“If Chinese citizens are able to travel
abroad,

238
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,879
what is stopping them from learning the truth
about

239
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,670
the atrocities the CCP is covering up

240
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,089
such as the Tiananmen Square Massacre?

241
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,380
Nothing is technically stopping them.

242
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,899
And a lot of them do learn some shocking things

243
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,019
when they travel to free countries.

244
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:52,709
Except that the Communist Party

245
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,839
has done such an excellent job of brainwashing
people

246
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,570
that even when some mainland Chinese citizens
travel abroad,

247
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,809
they reject the truth even after seeing it
on TV,

248
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,279
or being handed a flyer,

249
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,899
or talking to foreigners.

250
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,059
A lot of times,

251
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,490
when people encounter criticism of the Chinese
Communist Party,

252
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,550
they conflate that with criticism of *China*—

253
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,660
their country—

254
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,949
so they reject it.

255
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,209
Like they take it personally.

256
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,930
Or they learn about the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

257
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,040
but they think, oh,

258
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,119
well it happened a long time ago,

259
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,629
and the students were also agitating the situation.

260
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:30,410
It often takes a long time for them to realize
that

261
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,089
they’ve been lied to their whole lives.

262
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,439
And nearly all Chinese language media outside
China

263
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,160
are controlled through either Communist Party
money

264
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,250
or outright ownership—

265
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,949
so there’s still a lot of Chinese people

266
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:46,930
that never really learn how bad the Communist
Party is.

267
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,699
Thanks for your question, carbide149.

268
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,529
And thank all of you for supporting China
Uncensored.

269
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,990
At least Chinese people can come watch China
Uncensored

270
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,959
to learn about the real Tiananmen Square Massacre.

271
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,429
Stay tuned for our upcoming 30-year anniversary
episode,

272
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:03,500
where I sit down with a special guest who
was there.

273
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,780
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

274
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,700
See you next time.
