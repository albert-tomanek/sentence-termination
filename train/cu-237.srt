00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,819
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,580
the top 5 over-the-top Chinese engineering
projects.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,740
Hi. Welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,400
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,480
China is known for massive infrastructure
projects.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,230
Like the world’s highest bridge,

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,199
which looks like a lot of fun.

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,690
Or the longest subway tunnel on the planet,

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,289
which is 37 miles long.

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,500
China is the biggest country by population,

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
so it makes sense

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,929
that some of its infrastructure projects are
big, too.

13
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,550
And some of these projects are not just big,

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,239
but really, really big.

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,059
And also have big problems.

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:44,600
So let’s take a look at 5 crazy Chinese
engineering projects.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,620
Number 5

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,600
Looking for intelligent life.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,620
A few years back in the limestone hills of
Guizhou province,

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,710
Chinese engineers were busy putting the final
touches

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,079
on China’s newest gadget in the race to
dominate space.

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,040
the Death Wok.

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,579
Formally known as the Five-hundred-meter

24
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,550
Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, or FAST.

25
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,860
While it may look like a great place

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,820
to cook the world’s largest stir-fry,

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,730
it’s actually the world’s largest radio
telescope.

28
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,440
Nestled lovingly in the middle of a gorgeous
mountain view.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,020
It was built by this guy—

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,060
—chief scientist and engineer Nan Rendong.

31
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,960
He was so proud of his creation that

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,380
he told Science magazine in an interview

33
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,030
“I’m really not very interested in science,

34
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,030
I’m sorry to say.”

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,890
That was a joke, according to his colleagues.

36
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,600
Haha, science humor.

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,840
So funny.

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,700
The satellite dish started receiving signals
in 2016,

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,570
but it’s currently still being calibrated,

40
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,220
which takes three years to finish.

41
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,280
They have, however, already been able

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,890
to receive signals from the Crab Nebula.

43
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,330
This photo is from NASA, by the way,

44
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,320
and not from the radio telescope.

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,990
For historical context, a thousand years ago,

46
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,150
astronomers in the Song dynasty used little

47
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,090
more than the naked eye to observe the supernova

48
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,150
that created the Crab Nebula.

49
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,880
Which proves that the Crab Nebula has been

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,450
part of Chinese territory since ancient times.

51
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,210
Experts say the aim of the giant telescope

52
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,500
is to capture radio signals from distant galaxies,

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,400
probe gravitational waves, and,

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
coolest of all, look for alien life!

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
Waaiiiit a minute.

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,020
A giant radio satellite dish in China

57
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,100
that’s looking for alien life,

58
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
built by an astronomer

59
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,360
who survived the Cultural Revolution..

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,100
are we sure we’re not living through

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,860
the plot of the Three Body Problem?

62
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,250
Because while that’s one of my favorite
sci-fi books,

63
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,930
I don’t think I’d want to live there.

64
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,300
No sign of aliens yet, though.

65
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,000
As far as we know.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,420
While we wait...stir fry, anyone?

67
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
Number 4

68
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,290
The Wansheng Ordovician Theme Park in Chongqing.

69
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,070
No science here, just fun.

70
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,100
Or sheer terror, 500 feet in the air.

71
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,050
Though you’d think on a bridge

72
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,540
hundreds of feet above ground

73
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,550
missing floor planks and no guard rails,

74
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,000
a touch more engineering wouldn’t kill anybody.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,120
The theme park is home to all kinds of totally
safe attractions

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,250
like this swing built over a cliff.

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,990
or the park’s top attraction, a cantilever
platform

78
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,630
that Guiness says is the longest in the world.

79
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,380
With a floor made of glass.

80
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,750
Everybody loves it.

81
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,230
In fact there’s so much demand for terror-induced
adrenaline kicks,

82
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,530
there’s a whole bunch of glass bridges in
China.

83
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,580
Like the Zhangjiajie Glass Bridge,

84
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,170
which holds the record for the tallest

85
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,430
and longest glass bridge in the world.

86
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,310
This one was such a hit with audiences

87
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,620
it had to be closed down after less than two
weeks of use

88
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,730
for design reinforcements.

89
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,520
The bridge was designed to hold up to 800
people at once,

90
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,330
and up to 8,000 visitors per day.

91
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,280
It turns out ten times the allowed limit,

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,790
so 80,000 visitors, tried to get on the bridge
each day.

93
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,270
But officials put an end to that kind of dangerous
excess

94
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,580
after only 13 days of use.

95
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
Number 3

96
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,970
The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge.

97
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,560
At 34 miles end to end, it’s the world’s
longest sea bridge.

98
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
Construction was overdue by two years,

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,240
and more than a billion dollars over budget.

100
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,450
At least 19 people were killed during construction,

101
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,060
and hundreds were seriously injured.

102
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,330
The cost was high,

103
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,640
but at least the bridge will reduce trade
barriers

104
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,530
between Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China.

105
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,540
Except maybe it won’t.

106
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,250
There’s so much red tape to use it,

107
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,550
that the average citizen

108
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,560
will never be able to drive across it.

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,580
It requires three separate permits

110
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,340
with seperate application processes.

111
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,560
Plus car insurance from three separate regions.

112
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,350
Not to say the 34-mile long bridge isn’t
impressive.

113
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,180
It’s just that you’re still better off
taking the ferry.

114
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,200
Number 2

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,210
China is so dam crazy!

116
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,650
China has 9 of the world’s 20 largest dams.

117
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,949
But at top of the list is the Three Gorges
Dam.

118
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:03,310
It’s both the biggest dam in the world

119
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,250
and the biggest hydroelectric power station
in the world.

120
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,110
So it’s either twice the bang for your buck
or double the trouble.

121
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,110
On the one hand,

122
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,610
it generates a whopping 22,500 megawatts of
electricity.

123
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,370
To put that into perspective,

124
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,620
one megawatt is about 1000 people

125
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,590
all blow drying their hair at the same time.

126
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,260
So the dam makes enough power for

127
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,130
22 and a half million Chinese people

128
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,960
to blow-dry their hair all at the same time.

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,820
But that’s still only one-and-a-half percent
of

130
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,960
the country’s electricity needs.

131
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,600
And all it took was the forced relocation
of 1.4 million people,

132
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,170
the destruction of more than 2000 archeological
sites,

133
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,230
catastrophic flooding in some places,

134
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,199
and crippling droughts in others.

135
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,300
Plus, when the dam closes to fill its reservoir

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,949
with about ten trillion gallons of water,

137
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,680
the enormous weight of the huge body of water

138
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,169
causes mudslides and landslides.

139
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,370
Fun fact: the massive weight of the reservoir

140
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,010
caused the Earth to rotate a bit slower, too,

141
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,220
so each day is now zero point zero zero

142
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,660
zero zero zero zero zero six seconds longer.

143
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,110
Water in the reservoir also submerged hundreds
of factories,

144
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,080
mines and waste dumps,

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,419
creating a festering bog of industrial pollutants
and garbage.

146
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,290
There are garbage islands so thick that people
can stand on them.

147
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,290
On the plus side,

148
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,160
fishermen can make extra money by collecting
the garbage.

149
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,860
See, it’s creating jobs!

150
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
And finally...

151
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,390
Number 1

152
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,389
The water displaced by the Three Gorges Dam

153
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,290
is just a drop in the bucket when it comes
to

154
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,470
the number one most insane engineering project
in China,

155
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,780
the South-North Water Transfer Project.

156
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,490
Despite what you may have heard about pollution

157
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,460
being China’s worst environmental threat...

158
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,320
there’s something worse:

159
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
Drought.

160
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,990
China is drying up, and water is running out.

161
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,960
Chinese people on average have around

162
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,419
half of what is internationally defined as
water stress,

163
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,720
the point where there’s not enough water
to go around.

164
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,460
But the bigger problem is that

165
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,210
four fifths of China’s water mis in the
south.

166
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,740
That makes the north of China pretty much
a desert.

167
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,990
Especially now that it has so many huge cities.

168
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,570
A recent report called “China’s Looming
Water Crisis”

169
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,130
says that unlike any other of China’s problems—

170
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,310
like mounting debt or housing bubbles—

171
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,810
the scarcity of water in the north threatens
to cause

172
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,699
severe economic disruption or even outright
collapse.

173
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,490
But the report says that instead of solving
the problem

174
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,479
by regulating industrial water consumption,

175
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,169
implementing reforms to make agriculture more
efficient,

176
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,910
or letting experts instead of communist party
officials

177
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,840
manage the water shortage,

178
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,449
the Chinese Communist Party has adopted

179
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,380
a plan straight out of Mao Zedong’s playbook.

180
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,560
I mean they literally took Mao at his word

181
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,400
when he said “the south has plenty of water,

182
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,289
the north much less.

183
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,550
If possible, the north should borrow a little.”

184
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,660
Just in case anybody needs a reminder that

185
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,009
taking Mao at his word is never a good idea,

186
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,419
remember his big economic development idea,

187
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,050
the Great Leap Forward?

188
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,900
Yeah, that killed more than 40 million people.

189
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,130
But I’m sure the South-North Water Transfer
Project,

190
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,580
which will use three different routes to divert
water

191
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,660
from tributaries of the Yangtze River in the
south,

192
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,740
and transfers that water to the north,

193
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,610
will have no unintended consequences.

194
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,560
Like half the water evaporating along the
way.

195
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,229
And all it took was drilling 2000 miles of
canals and,

196
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:44,550
as usual, ignoring the potentially devastating

197
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,800
environmental consequences.

198
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,529
I mean what could possibly go wrong?

199
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,990
Ok, so it forced nearly 400,000 people to
relocate,

200
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,040
and needed the construction of

201
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,600
a whole bunch of new dams to control water
flows,

202
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,459
with each dam sparking its own set of mudslide

203
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,540
and landslide type issues.

204
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,980
And for all that effort,

205
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,769
and a cost of 48 billion dollars and counting,

206
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,319
the two out of three sections of the project

207
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,179
that have been opened so far

208
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,810
can only divert 25 billion tons of water annually.

209
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,920
That’s barely 4% of China’s total water
consumption.

210
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Worst of all, according to The Economist,

211
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,110
“The project diverts not only water

212
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,100
but money and attention from China’s real
water problem:

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,400
waste and pollution.”

214
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,120
According to government statistics,

215
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,800
half of all China’s lakes and reservoirs
are polluted

216
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,970
beyond what’s safe for human consumption.

217
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,269
But when has the Chinese Communist Party

218
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:45,459
ever rejected an idea just because it’s
bad?

219
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,889
So what do you think about China’s

220
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,129
insane engineering projects?

222
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,059
And before we go, it’s time for me to answer

223
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:56,309
a question from one of our supporters on Patreon.

224
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,880
Shane Butler asks:

225
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,829
“Is Jiang Zemin the number 1 target

226
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,020
in the anti-corruption campaign?”

227
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,680
Good question, Shane.

228
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,860
Yes, former Chinese leader and toady Jiang
Zemin

229
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,139
is the final target in Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption
campaign.

230
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,600
And for those of you who are new here,

231
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,740
it’s not really an anti-corruption campaign.

232
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,980
It’s a political purge.

233
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,670
But even after being out of power for more
than a decade,

234
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,360
Jiang Zemin still holds a lot of sway behind
the scenes.

235
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,449
And in Chinese Communist Party politics,

236
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,449
Xi has to take down

237
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,520
all of Jiang’s supporters and cronies first.

238
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,279
Basically, Jiang Zemin is the final boss,

239
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,440
and Xi Jinping needs to clear all the previous
levels,

240
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,070
and rack up enough experience points,

241
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,970
to be able to defeat him.

242
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,639
But unlike a video game,

243
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,610
this one will just end in the main character

244
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,730
becoming the final boss himself.

245
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,279
