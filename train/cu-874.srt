1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,100
Hong Kong holds local elections.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,380
And Beijing is shocked and humiliated by the
results.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,700
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,350
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:20,529
Hong Kong has been engulfed in protests for
nearly six months now.

6
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:22,180
People are upset about the Chinese Communist
Party

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,840
for increasingly interfering in their city,

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,960
and encroaching on their freedoms.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,970
They’re also upset about the police tear
gassing people.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,349
And beating them up.

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,050
And spraying them with water cannons.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,250
And arresting them.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,860
Did I mention the tear gassing?

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,090
More recently, some of the protesters have
reacted

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,660
by throwing molotov cocktails and setting
fires to keep the police from...

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,070
doing all those things to them.

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,180
Pro-Beijing officials make up the majority
of Hong Kong’s government.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,090
And for months, they’ve been demanding that
protesters follow the rule of law.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,360
And so on Sunday, Hong Kongers did follow
the rule of law—

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,110
by voting out hundreds of pro-Beijing officials.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,190
Sunday was Hong Kong’s district council
elections.

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,510
Now these are small local elections,

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,710
which don’t usually get that many votes.

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,760
But this year,

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,440
Hong Kong saw an unprecedented voter turnout
of 71%.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,530
It’s the largest voter turnout in any Hong
Kong election, ever.

27
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,080
Voters lined up around the block at polling
stations.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Wow.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,230
Nobody gets this excited about local elections…

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,920
except Leslie Knope.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,810
And even more shocking, Pan-Democrat candidates—

32
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,210
who support the protest movement—

33
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,590
won 85% of district council seats.

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,040
For comparison, in the 2015 district council
election,

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,840
it broke down like this,

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,470
with Pan-Dems\h winning only 126 seats.

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,869
This year, they won 385 seats.

38
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,780
That makes them the majority

39
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,380
in 17 out of 18 district councils in Hong
Kong.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,380
And Hong Kongers were out on the streets celebrating.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,380
Including this nice lady,

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,380
who was pouring champagne for the crowd.

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,380
You know what Dom Pérignon tastes like in
a paper cup?

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,380
It tastes like victory.

45
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
For months, pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong
Kong and China

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,790
had claimed that most Hong Kongers

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,940
supported the police cracking down on protesters,

48
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,819
and that those people “are representing
the silent majority.”

49
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,030
And for months,

50
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,860
Chinese state-run media had called for Hong
Kong’s

51
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,520
“silent majority” to not stay silent.

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Well, they were half right:

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,260
The “silent majority” *didn’t* stay
silent.

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,010
They were just wrong about what the silent
majority had to say.

55
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,270
Now, these newly elected Hong Kong district
council members

56
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,330
won’t get to decide a lot of big picture
things in Hong Kong.

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,930
They mainly handle local things,

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,239
like where to put traffic lights and garbage
cans.

59
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,849
Next year’s elections for the Legislative
Council will be more meaningful,

60
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,060
since those legislators get to pass laws.

61
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,250
But these local District Councils do get to
choose

62
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,790
about 10% of the representatives

63
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,430
who vote for the next Hong Kong chief executive.

64
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,450
Even though that system is rigged, so it can
ultimately be controlled by Beijing.

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,410
Nonetheless, Sunday’s District Council election
results are huge.

66
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,291
They’re indisputable proof that the majority
of Hong Kong

67
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,160
voters are unhappy with how the government

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,200
and police have been handling the protests.

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,890
And Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam

70
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,940
understands that voters are upset with the
government.

71
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,000
“We were aware of the large number of voters

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,440
coming out to cast a vote,

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,190
perhaps not only to select a preferred candidate

74
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,230
to sit on the district council,

75
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,790
but also to express a view on many issues
in society, including,

76
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,340
I will readily accept that,

77
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,890
including deficiencies in governance,

78
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,560
including unhappiness with the time taken

79
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,650
to deal with the current unstable environment.”

80
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,650
No.

81
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,650
No!

82
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,950
They’re not unhappy that you haven’t dealt
with the protesters!

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,960
They’re unhappy that your government has
refused to listen to the protesters,

84
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,500
and instead allowed the police to do the whole
thing with the tear gas,

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
and the beatings,

86
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,580
and the water cannons, and the arrests,

87
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,549
and the tear gas.

88
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,769
The people are unhappy with *you*,

89
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,070
Carrie Lam.

90
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,570
Even a lot of the pro-establishment

91
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,500
politicians don’t like you either,

92
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,060
because your handling of the Extradition Bill

93
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,720
was what led to six months of protests

94
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,350
and their stunning defeat at the polls.

95
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,450
Anyway, the election results were not just
a shock

96
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,600
to tone-deaf Carrie Lam.

97
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,610
They were also a shock to tone-deaf

98
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,120
Communist Party officials in Beijing.

99
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,050
According to Foreign Policy editor James Palmer,

100
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,620
“Beijing genuinely thought they were going
to win big in the elections...

101
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,340
to the point of having pre-written the stories.”

102
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,900
That’s embarrassing.

103
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,000
The Global Times adjusted their coverage

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,720
to accuse Hong Kong protesters

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,490
of having a “political agenda.”

106
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,150
I mean, that’s...true.

107
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,610
Their political agenda was to use the democratic
process

108
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,280
to win seats in government.

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,250
That’s what elections are for.

110
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,889
Meanwhile state-run China Daily created this
handy infographic

111
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,940
to show how the protesters stopped people
from voting.

112
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,270
Which is funny, because Sunday

113
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,950
actually had highest voter turnout in Hong
Kong history.

114
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,500
Might want to re-think that one, China Daily.

115
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,940
Hong Kong-based author of “City on Fire”
Antony Dapiran

116
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,990
writes that “Beijing appears to have been
genuinely surprised by this result—

117
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,240
and Beijing does not like to be surprised

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,970
by anything that happens within its borders.”

119
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,600
Which is why Beijing is no fun at birthday
parties.

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,980
Surprise!

121
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,220
So will China’s communist leaders

122
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,710
look at these District Council election results

123
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,150
and engage in genuine self-reflection?

124
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,220
Not a chance!

125
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,830
As Dapiran writes, “This election result
will not be seen by Beijing

126
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,420
as a sign that they need to change tack in
their approach to Hong Kong.

127
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,360
It will not be the catalyst for some grand
compromise.

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,580
It will be seen as a sign that the Hong Kong
people

129
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,900
are making the wrong choice,

130
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,680
and action needs to be taken to correct them.”

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,970
Fortunately, Beijing has ways to help correct
people’s wrong thinking.

132
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,200
They want to introduce patriotic education
in Hong Kong schools,

133
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,669
and a national security law to further restrict
Hong Kongers’ freedom.

134
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,639
And if those don’t work,

135
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,700
there’s always simply telling the police
to crack down harder.

136
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,509
I mean, if savagely beating people doesn’t
make them like you,

137
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,699
I don’t know what will.

138
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,720
So what do you think about the Hong Kong elections?

139
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,330
Leave your comments below.

140
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,990
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

141
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,139
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

142
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,610
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

143
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,610
Your support is important,

144
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,520
because everytime I make an episode about
Hong Kong,

145
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,020
YouTube instantly demonetizes it.

146
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,430
So viewer support is the main way we can pay
our staff,

147
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,470
travel to places like Hong Kong,

148
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,110
and keep making this show.

149
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,770
Here’s today’s question.

150
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,240
Adam C. asks “How fast did this get demonetized?”

151
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,400
Ah, you’re talking about my video from two
days ago,

152
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,960
where I started out talking about pandas,

153
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,910
hoping the video wouldn’t get demonetized.

154
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,780
Well, it was instantly demonetized.

155
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,840
That was a decision made by YouTube’s artificial
intelligence bots.

156
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
Then I appealed that decision.

157
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,680
That was on Friday afternoon.

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,460
By Saturday evening, about 30 hours later,

159
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,700
a human at YouTube had reviewed it,

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,220
and confirmed that it should *not* have been
demonetized.

161
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,740
That’s good news!

162
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,860
So by the time the video was finally made
public on Monday,

163
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,199
it was, in fact, monetized with ads.

164
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,030
But waiting 30 hours to enable ads is a long
time,

165
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,289
and we usually don’t get that long.

166
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,530
For most of our episodes,

167
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,910
we publish them as soon as Seamus is done
editing the video.

168
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,669
That means they go public,

169
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:02,900
get instantly demonetized, and then,

170
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,949
after an entire day of losing all the revenue,

171
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,580
a YouTube human will review it.

172
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,630
They usually re-monetize it.

173
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,009
Which is to say,

174
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,090
YouTube humans are acknowledging

175
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,030
that the AI bots are *wrong most of the time*.

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,560
Sadly, that wrong-ness costs us thousands
of dollars a month!

177
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,480
That’s why demonetization—

178
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,490
even temporary demonetization—

179
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,400
is a huge deal.

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,310
And that’s also why your support is so important,
Adam.

181
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,680
So thank you.

184
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:41,579
With your support,

185
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,279
we can afford to continue covering

186
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,290
topics that YouTube’s AI bots demonetize.

187
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,640
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

188
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,940
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

189
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,920
See you next time.
