00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,370
China wants to use drones to hunt Tibetans.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,139
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:12,900
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,040
Is it a dystopian sci-fi future?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,020
Or just China today?

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,180
Yes, China is working on a rating system for
every citizen.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,680
Yes, China wants to go to the Moon to mine
Helium 3.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,510
Yes, China is planning to build orbital space
lasers.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,210
And now this.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:40,719
Wait, sorry. That's from Star Wars.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,780
But, sadly, it's not far from reality.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,020
Because the Chinese regime has set up a new
frontier monitoring system in Tibet.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,739
A system that will track people using radar
and drones,

15
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:58,030
according to a November 6th report in China
Daily.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,050
Unlike in America, where border patrol tries
to keep people out...

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,450
...in China, border patrol tries to keep citizens
from leaving.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,409
Now I'm not sure why anyone would want to
leave Tibet.

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,439
I mean, sure the Chinese Communist Party under
Mao Zedong killed an estimated 1.2 million

20
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,439
Tibetans,

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,009
and destroyed 6,000 Tibetan monasteries.

22
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,049
But that was a long time ago!

23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,770
It's not like there's cultural genocide happening
now.

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,909
Oh.

25
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:29,340
But according to state-run media,

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,630
Tibet has a growing economy...

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,600
...and is full of happy faces!

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,299
In fact, Lhasa tops CCTV's list of the happiest
place in China!

29
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,259
So it's hard to imagine that anyone would
want to leave.

30
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,259
And yet, for some reason, several thousand
Tibetans flee Tibet every year.

31
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,270
Tibetan refugees attempt a dangerous trek
across the Himalayas in hopes of making it

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,220
to India or Nepal.

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,340
I can't stress how dangerous this is.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,969
Because in addition to avoiding dangerous
mountain conditions,

35
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:04,950
they also have to avoid Chinese soldiers.

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,220
For example, a group of Western mountain climbers
caught this footage near the Nepalese border

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,099
in 2008.

38
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,030
Dozens of Tibetan refugees are walking in
line through the mountains of snow trying

39
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,180
to reach India and see the Dalai Lama, their
spiritual leader

40
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,370
Everybody can see the Chinese soldier standing
in shooting position

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,900
He opens fire.

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,480
The bullets hit human flesh.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,050
They're shooting them like dogs.

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,300
Whoa. Did you see that?

45
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,140
No, of course you didn't.

46
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,860
Because according Chinese state-run media
Xinhua,

47
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,239
the Tibetans had attacked the People's Armed
Police.

48
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,110
And so the soldiers were forced to defend
themselves.

49
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,980
As you can see from the footage.

50
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,870
That was in 2008.

51
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,050
But now, no longer will the brave Chinese
border soldiers have to hunt Tibetans alone,

52
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,459
purely out of a sense of responsibility.

53
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,250
Because now, China has drones.

54
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,629
Here's how it will work.

55
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,590
The Chinese drones will provide "round-the-clock,

56
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,550
all-weather surveillance of illegal cross-border
movements.

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,120
People trying to cross the border will be
detected by the system,

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,069
which then automatically notifies soldiers."

59
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,400
And then the soldiers...

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,989
"He opens fire. The bullets hit human flesh."

61
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,450
And in case that doesn't work,

62
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,739
the new monitoring system also includes acoustic
weapons.

63
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,409
Now I think I've heard something about how
loud sounds on snowy mountains are a good

64
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,310
idea.

65
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,599
But acoustic weapons are also capable of anything
from causing nausea and disorientation,

66
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,950
to actually being able to kill.

67
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,110
So I guess they'll be playing Miley Cyrus?

68
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,750
And this whole using-drones-to-hunt-people
thing isn't just for Tibet.

69
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,409
It's also being set up in Xinjiang, home to
the Uighur Muslims

70
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:52,450
who are equally disenfranchised,

71
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,150
but get way less media attention.

72
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,580
Maybe because they don't have a Dalai Lama.

73
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,730
Check out this video from Seeker Daily.

74
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,390
"Although the Chinese government stresses
that it respects Islamic traditions,

75
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,909
incidents like this suggest otherwise."

76
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,280
So what do you think of the Chinese regime's
new monitoring system aimed at stopping refugees...

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
from attacking poor defenseless Chinese soldiers?

78
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,340
Leave your comments below,

79
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,650
and please share this video with people you
know.

80
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,000
Once again I'm Chris Chappell.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:57,180
See you next time.
