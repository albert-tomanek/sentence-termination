1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,620
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,110
A Hong Kong student leader-

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,840
slash-dangerous criminal has been sentenced
to prison.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,670
Plus, war may be brewing on three fronts.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,910
Good thing China’s a nation of peace.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,490
And finally, have you ever felt like

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,150
you were being watched?

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,570
You are.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,380
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,940
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,099
I’m afraid I have some bad news.

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,919
In Hong Kong, democracy activist,

14
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,020
friend of the show,

15
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,050
and apparent criminal mastermind Joshua Wong

16
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,550
was sentenced to 6 months in prison

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,840
for “unlawful assembly”

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,470
during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests.

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,050
Fellow activists Nathan Law and Alex Chow

20
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,930
were sentenced to similar prison terms.

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,550
If this feels like déjà vu,

22
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,450
it’s because last November,

23
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,120
all three activists were already sentenced

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,040
for the same thing...

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,570
but they were given hours of community service

26
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,220
instead of prison time.

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,829
But apparently that wasn’t enough for

28
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,100
the Hong Kong government,

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,670
which is increasingly controlled

30
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,170
by mainland China—

31
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,700
the very thing the three of them

32
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,189
were protesting against.

33
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,539
They prosecutors filed an appeal

34
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,280
of the original sentences,

35
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
and earlier this week

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,860
a judge decided that, yes,

37
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,499
the punishment ought to be harsher

38
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:18,499
to deter other young people

39
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,390
from possibly unlawfully assembling

40
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,070
in the future.

41
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,070
According to the judge,

42
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,719
“the defendants’ banners of peace and
rationality

43
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,509
were empty words.”

44
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:28,509
And the court needed to

45
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:31,939
“impose sentences with an even greater deterrent
effect

46
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,710
in order to defend the dignity of the rule
of law.”

47
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,710
And nothing says

48
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,689
“the dignity of the rule of law”

49
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,049
like giving harsh sentences

50
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,750
to political activists.

51
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,259
But was it really a political decision, you
ask?

52
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,319
Well since they were sentenced to prison,

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,189
the activists can’t run for office

54
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,249
for the next 5 years.

55
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:53,009
Nathan Law had already been elected last year

56
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,009
to Hong Kong’s legislature...

57
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,049
until he was kicked out last month

58
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,819
for quoting Gandhi during his oath of office.

59
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,950
So yeah,

60
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,890
probably not political at all.

61
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,029
Now on to North Korea.

62
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:06,029
Earlier this week,

63
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,700
China implemented UN sanctions

64
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,090
against the rogue regime.

65
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,090
But in case you thought things

66
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,280
were getting too cooperative

67
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,090
on the North Korea issue,

68
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,030
Chinese state-run media the Global Times,

69
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,030
wrote last week,

70
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,160
“that if North Korea launches missiles

71
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,950
hat threaten US soil first

72
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,920
and the US retaliates,

73
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,360
China will stay neutral.”

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
In other words,

75
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,860
you’re on your own, America.

76
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
On the plus side,

77
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,390
it won’t be a repeat of the Korean War.

78
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,670
After all, China has bigger fish to fry.

79
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,780
Particularly fish from the South China Sea.

80
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,470
Another US Navy patrol conducted

81
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,190
a freedom of navigation operation

82
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,800
in the South China Sea on August 10th.

83
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,770
They cruised past Mischief Reef,

84
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,900
where China is building an artificial island

85
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,440
with military installations.

86
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,780
It prompted state-run media

87
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,440
to ask whether the US is making trouble

88
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,000
or keeping peace.

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,120
Obviously, making trouble.

90
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,720
If the United States wanted peace,

91
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
they’d just let the Chinese army

92
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,480
keep building military bases there...

93
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,120
in peace.

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,020
But one country that apparently does want

95
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,870
peace with China is Vietnam.

96
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,090
This week we learned Vietnam

97
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,660
pulled its oil drilling ship out of disputed
waters.

98
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,290
And China wants peace with the Philippines.

99
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,890
At least, according to the Philippines’
defense minister,

100
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,430
who said that Chinese officials

101
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,020
had promised not to claim

102
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,360
more territory in the South China Sea,

103
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,890
or build anything on the Scarborough Shoal.

104
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,300
They’d better not,

105
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,260
since I claimed that as China Uncensored’s
sacred territory

106
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,450
9 months ago.

107
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,930
And over to India.

108
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,450
You know the saying sticks and stones

109
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,540
may break my bones,

110
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,090
but words will never hurt me?

111
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,430
Chinese and Indian troops

112
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,140
must have been listening.

113
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,190
They threw stones at each other.

114
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,190
That was not the best idea

115
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,190
because in another disputed border territory,

116
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,190
China and India have already

117
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,190
been in conflict for weeks.

118
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,190
Chinese media have been particularly aggressive

119
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,190
in their response.

120
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,190
So this latest bout

121
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,190
of elementary school-style rock throwing

122
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,190
could lead to something more serious.

123
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,190
And finally,

124
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,190
big brother is watching.

125
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,190
So could you please be a little more entertaining?

126
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
In China,

127
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,960
everyone is being filmed all the time.

128
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,050
Cameras are everywhere.

129
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,670
They even have special police buses for it.

130
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,890
C’mon, people!

131
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,620
What ever happened to subtlety?

132
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,540
But what’s even weirder

133
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,840
is that in China,

134
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
your average citizen can get in on

135
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,670
the surveillance fun.

136
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,730
“China’s 751 million internet users

137
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,310
can binge on real-time video streams of

138
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,320
yoga studios, swimming lessons,

139
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,930
alpaca ranches and thousands of other scenes

140
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,900
captured by surveillance cameras.”

141
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Some of those other scenes

142
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,970
include people shopping for lingerie.

143
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,040
That article even mentions

144
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,910
a popular feed of a slim

145
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,000
attractive receptionist in Beijing,

146
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
who, according to comments,

147
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,090
is a chronic nose picker.

148
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,300
There is so much constant surveillance footage,

149
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,450
one Chinese film director

150
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,060
complied 7,000 hours of it

151
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,400
to make a full length movie.

152
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
It includes footage

153
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,520
of people actually dying.

154
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,100
It’s ironic.

155
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,990
In a society where so much is censored,

156
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,590
a person’s private moments

157
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,040
can be seen by all.

158
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
It’s the real life version

159
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,050
of the Truman Show.

160
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,620
So if you’d like to see more,

161
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,280
stay tuned tuned after the break.

162
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,340
You might be freaked out

163
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,820
if someone was watching you,

164
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,350
but I love it.

165
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,110
And you could see more of me

166
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,060
if you go to ChinaUncensored.tv.

167
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,260
