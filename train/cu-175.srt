1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,460
why women in China are becoming rice bunnies.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,820
Welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,350
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,840
Thursday, March 8 was International Women’s
Day.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,860
It was originally a socialist holiday

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,030
popularized in the Soviet Union.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,070
Now, it’s an official holiday in China,

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,470
where women get a half day off of work

10
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,530
so they can have afternoon tea

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,119
at the Ritz Carlton in Shanghai.

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,220
And do lots of online shopping.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,920
Vladimir Lenin would be so proud.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,679
I bet he’s looking down right now

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,190
from communist heaven and...

16
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,219
oh, wait.

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,540
Never mind.

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,100
In the past,

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,600
China has celebrated International Women’s
Day

20
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,579
in some unique ways,

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,899
like having a one-handed bra-undoing contest.

22
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:49,899
Which really seems more like

23
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,899
something that should be done

24
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,949
to celebrate International Teenage Boys’
Day.

25
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:55,609
But that was two years ago.

26
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,719
Today, as the Me Too movement

27
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,269
against sexual harassment

28
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,960
is making waves across the globe,

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,329
have things changed for women in China?

30
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,630
For more on this,

31
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,280
we go to China Uncensored’s

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,590
resident Chinese woman,

33
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,670
Shelley Zhang.

34
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,670
Shelley.

35
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,670
Thanks Chris.

36
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,710
So Shelley,

37
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,740
have you seen improvements

38
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,509
in how women are treated in China

39
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,380
on International Women’s Day?

40
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,770
Oh definitely, Chris.

41
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,789
Just take a look at this page from Tmall,

42
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,189
China’s biggest online shopping site.

43
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,340
In Chinese it says,

44
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,290
March 8, Queen’s Day,

45
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,159
hashtag live your girl power.

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,590
Isn’t that amazing?

47
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,020
That’s your example

48
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,479
of how things are getting better?

49
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,070
Hey, last year it said

50
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,609
hashtag live your beauty

51
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:38,719
and had a woman staring lovingly at a shoe.

52
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,070
So I’d say that girl power is better.

53
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,429
That’s not what I had in mind.

54
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:44,829
What about the Me Too movement

55
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,229
to raise awareness about sexual harassment?

56
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,189
Is that having an impact at all?

57
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,259
Yes, sort of.

58
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,659
Me Too made a splash in China

59
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:53,659
earlier this year,

60
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,149
when a Chinese woman named Luo Xixi

61
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:57,679
posted online story of how she was

62
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,570
studying under a famous professor,

63
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,209
Chen Xiaowu.

64
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,209
She says he tried to coerce her

65
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,399
into having sex with him.

66
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,149
He only stopped when she told him

67
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,569
she was a virgin.

68
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,069
More women also accused Chen,

69
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,149
and even state-run media

70
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,069
started reporting on the story.

71
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,519
Chen was eventually fired.

72
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:14,519
Wow.

73
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:15,700
I’m surprised it actually worked.

74
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,599
Does that mean Me Too

75
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,970
is growing into a movement in China?

76
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,970
No.

77
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,970
It’s complicated.

78
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,500
More women started sharing stories online

79
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,370
of being harassed by their college professors,

80
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,530
but soon the words Me Too

81
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,650
started getting censored online.

82
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,450
So now it’s censored?

83
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,450
No.

84
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,720
It’s complicated.

85
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Chinese women started using

86
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,900
the hashtag rice bunny instead,

87
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,370
because those words sound like

88
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,170
Me Too in Chinese.

89
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,680
And you can still find articles

90
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
on the Chinese internet

91
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,190
that discuss the Me Too movement.

92
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,660
Wait a minute.

93
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,780
Why would the Chinese Communist Party

94
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,490
allow reporting on this,

95
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,790
but then censor it,

96
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,090
and then not censor it?

97
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,540
It’s a way of staying in control.

98
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,680
They start off by letting people

99
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,750
talk about sexual harassment,

100
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,130
and they’re even ok with action

101
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,450
being taken in isolated cases,

102
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,299
like Chen getting fired.

103
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,200
But then when it gets too popular,

104
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
they censor it.

105
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
It’s a warning to people

106
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,110
that this topic is getting too sensitive.

107
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,019
But they don’t want to completely cut off

108
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,329
all discussion of it because

109
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,409
then people would notice

110
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,280
that they can’t talk about it.

111
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,739
That is so...complicated.

112
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,720
What is even the point of doing that?

113
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,840
Two things:

114
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,099
One, they want to make people

115
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,650
think that authorities are doing

116
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,170
something about the issue.

117
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,500
When state-run media talked about

118
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Chen being fired,

119
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,530
they emphasized that “the quick response

120
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,510
and strong stance of the Chinese authorities

121
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,129
won applause from the public.”

122
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,530
But then they go and censor it.

123
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,930
So doesn’t that make it look like

124
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,430
they’re not really doing something about
it?

125
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,570
Yes, but the censorship is important

126
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,120
for point number two.

127
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,439
The Communist Party doesn’t want

128
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:51,000
grassroots movements to get too popular.

129
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,920
They care way more about social control

130
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,939
than really exposing sexual harassment in
China.

131
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,370
Especially when it involves

132
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,840
exposing Chinese officials.

133
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,969
So when people start petitions about the issue,

134
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,290
well, those have to be censored.

135
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,900
And whatever discussion is happening

136
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,459
is also only happening online.

137
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,459
Like three years ago,

138
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,069
there were five women who were arrested for,

139
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,069
get this,

140
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,180
planning to pass out stickers

141
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,720
on International Women’s Day

142
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,330
about sexual harassment on public transit.

143
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,860
Wait, they were arrested for

144
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,750
planning to pass out stickers?

145
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,240
Yeah, they didn’t even get to

146
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,090
actually pass out the stickers.

147
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,090
They were arrested ahead of time.

148
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,080
And then accused of being foreign spies.

149
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,940
You know, the usual.

150
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,350
So what I’m getting from this is that

151
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,050
things are not getting better for women in
China.

152
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,970
Well, ok, to be fair,

153
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,190
the fact that the conversation

154
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,500
is happening at all

155
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,140
is better than it was.

156
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,920
But as to whether there will be any change

157
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,540
when it comes to sexual harassment in China,

158
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,070
that will take a lot longer.

159
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,630
Take the anti-sexual harassment law

160
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,000
that was passed in 2005.

161
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It just says,

162
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,810
"Sexual harassment against women is banned.

163
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,720
The victims shall be entitled to complain

164
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,920
to the entity or the relevant organs."

165
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,930
So you can complain,

166
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,930
but the law doesn’t say

167
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,540
what will be done after your complaint.

168
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,190
So the anti-sexual harassment law

169
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,380
is just a suggestion.

170
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,500
Practically speaking, yes.

171
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,010
And is sexual harassment against men banned?

172
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,130
Oh wow.

173
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,380
That’s a good point.

174
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,720
Let’s pick this up on International Men’s
Day.

175
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,000
Thanks, Shelley.

176
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,340
So what do you think about international women’s
day?

177
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,000
Leave your comments below.

178
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,290
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

179
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,600
See you next time.

180
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,420
I know, you watch China Uncensored

181
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,000
because you’re hungry for knowledge.

182
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,640
But I also know you get hungry for food.

183
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,680
Well now, you can take care of both.

184
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
