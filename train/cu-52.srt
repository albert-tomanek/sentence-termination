1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,310
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,870
Olympic Gold.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,860
When she shines she really shows you all she
can.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,959
Oh Rio, Rio dashing China’s Olympic Plan.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your...

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,820
host whose pop music references come from
1982, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,500
Chinese athletes have flopped at the Rio Olympics!

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,740
Oh, I’m sorry, does that sound harsh?

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,010
Well, yeah, it actually kind of does.

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,059
And it wasn’t me who said that.

11
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:40,329
It was China’s state-run Xinhua news.

12
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,670
And that picture is Chinese gymnast You Hao

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,310
“flopping” at the men’s parallel bars
final on Tuesday night.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,629
I haven’t seen a worse display on parallel
bars since Gymkata,

15
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,110
a movie that combined the skill of gymnastics,

16
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,399
the kill of karate,

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,820
and former Olympic gymnast Kurt Thomas

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,200
fighting for his life in the fictional country
of...Parmistan.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes, all of my movie references are also from
the 80s.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,180
Now this is not what China had planned.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,770
The Chinese Communist Party recruits thousands
of children

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,530
to train for their entire lives to win Olympic
Gold.

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,900
“Picked at a young age,

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,920
Gao Lei is a product of the world's largest
mass recruitment and sports training program.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,800
51,000 athletes are currently training

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,240
at elite national and regional Institutes
like this one this one.”

27
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,670
But the important thing about this massive
sports system

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,890
is that...it works!

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,130
In the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics,

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,030
China won 51 gold medals.

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,970
So it didn’t seem like a stretch

32
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,390
that party mouthpiece Global Times

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,740
ran this spread before the Rio Olympics.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,120
Except now it’s pretty clear that isn’t
going to happen.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Here’s another Xinhua sports tweet,

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,740
that they later deleted, for some reason.

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,700
They’re...not too happy the Brits have outdone
them.

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,100
“Burn me.”

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
As of this morning,

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,240
Chinese athletes have only won 20 gold medals.

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,640
That’s a far cry from expectations.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,299
And, coincidentally, Chinese media have suddenly
shifted their tone

43
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,069
away from valuing Olympic gold above all else.

44
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,170
China Central Television ran a story called

45
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,250
“When we are no longer obsessed with gold
medals.”

46
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,519
It said, “we will be able to openly applaud
our rivals

47
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,790
to reflect our great country's confidence
and tolerance.”

48
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,830
I...actually kind of agree with that?

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,230
A Global Times piece talked about

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,090
how the burden of Olympic medals was "unfair"
to athletes.

51
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,380
I...also agree with that.

52
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,780
And another Global Times piece says the public

53
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,560
doesn’t really care about gold medals because
fitness is more important.

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,420
I mean, it's hard to disagree with that.

55
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,500
What's going on here?!

56
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,989
One expert interviewed said that

57
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,290
“As China grown from a backward country

58
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,060
to become the world’s second largest economy,

59
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,870
its people no longer need to use sporting
prowess

60
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,730
as a means to boost national confidence.”

61
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,010
Oh, ok.

62
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,629
Well, as an American,

63
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:15,370
representing the world’s largest economy,

64
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,980
all I have to say is...

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,980
BOOYAH!!!

66
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,969
Ohh, mmm, sporting prowess is boosting my
national confidence!

67
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,859
In all seriousness,

68
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,590
it’s great that Chinese media isn’t going
all

69
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,470
Tiger Mom on their Olympic athletes anymore.

70
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,109
I mean, that’s the kind of attitude that
leads to this.

71
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
“I feel terribly guilty for disappointing
my country,

72
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,100
the Chinese weightlifting team

73
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,920
and all the people who supported me.

74
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,280
I really wanted to be the best but I didn’t
make it.

75
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
I am sorry!”

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,360
Yeah, what a national disappointment!

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,960
He got silver.

78
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,409
Compare that four years ago

79
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,900
to one of the breakout stars of Rio

80
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,060
Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui.

81
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,260
Here's her reaction to placing third in the
100-meter backstroke semifinals.

82
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,200
Did you not expect that you...

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,620
I thought it was 59 seconds!

84
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,739
I was so fast!

85
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,120
In the end, she tied for the bronze medal

86
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,489
and won the hearts of the Internet forever.

87
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,590
At least when it comes to Internet memes,

88
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,480
she won gold.

89
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,760
There are 206 countries or regions competing
in the Rio Olympics.

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,560
And Chinese athletes have:

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,810
The third most gold medals.

92
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,390
Chinese athletes have done incredibly well.

93
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,200
That is something to celebrate.

94
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,450
And I'm happy to say that

95
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,810
as a reflection of my great show’s confidence
and tolerance.

96
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,050
So what do you think of how China’s state-run
media are treating the Olympics?

97
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,420
Leave your comments below.

98
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,580
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

99
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,030
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

100
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,800
See you next time.
