1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,480
North Korea.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,620
The Hermit Kingdom.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,800
Home to one of the craziest, most oppressive
regimes in history.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,300
And thanks to my producer,

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,260
that's where I'm going today.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,100
What's that Matt?

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,360
What do you mean we're going to North Korea?!

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,840
If you couldn't tell from the constant stream
of soldiers, barbed wire, and intense security,

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,170
North and South Korea are technically still
at war.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,300
And even though you can come here on a bus
tour,

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,580
as the tour guides are only oh so often ready
to remind us,

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,360
this is not Disneyland.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,059
The DMZ, or demilitarized zone,

14
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:42,010
is the stretch of land separating the North
and South Korean border on either side

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,059
about 2 miles wide.

16
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,899
The Korean War sort of ended with an armistice
agreement in 1953,

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,760
when the two militaries pledged to end

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,000
"any hostile act within, from, or against
the demilitarized zone.”

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,020
Then they filled it with landmines.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,260
What's on the other side of those white posts?

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,899
Landmines. Lots of landmines.

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,200
Occasionally, you'll see the remains of an
animal that stepped on one.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,030
Did I mention this is not Disneyland?

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,360
To get here, I travel up the un-ironically
named "Freedom Highway."

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,480
Everywhere there's a monument to war and destruction,

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,840
to the horror of bloodshed, the…

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,490
DMZ themed restaurant, premium outlet malls,
and Popeye's chicken!

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,260
Also, there was this creepy empty amusement
park.

29
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,570
This is the Dorasan Train Station.

30
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,130
It serves as a tribute to the hope of a one
day unified Korea.

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,470
Though technically, the Korean Peninsula could
be unified tomorrow

32
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,250
if the south would just accept the benevolent
leadership of glorious leader Kim Jong-un.

33
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,030
Hypothetically, one day you will be able to
take a train from Seoul through here to the

34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,600
North Korean capitol Pyongyang.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,220
It obviously does not currently connect.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,720
On the way to the North Korean border,

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,160
I took a tour of this cramped, narrow tunnel

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,890
known as the Third Infiltration Tunnel.

39
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,200
It's one of many North Korea dug in the hopes
of launching a future invasion on South Korea.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,260
Though since it's hard for even one person
to stand up in,

41
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,670
and it's 27 miles from Seoul and has no oxygen
vents, good luck sending your troops through.

42
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,130
I sure wouldn't want to have been a North Korean tunnel digger.

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,090
Now we're on our way to the Joint Security
Area,

44
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,460
where I plan to actually cross the border
into North Korea.

45
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,970
After passport controls,

46
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,890
I have to sign this visitor declaration that
says,

47
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,960
amongst other things, this entails the entrance
into

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,850
"a hostile area and the possibility of injury
or death as a direct result of enemy action."

49
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,750
Is it too late for second thoughts?

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,440
At last, we reach the actual border between
North and South Korea.

51
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,310
See that North Korean soldier there, watching?

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,790
Is this really a good idea?

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,660
Sure it is!

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,010
I go into one of the blue buildings on the
border.

55
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,940
"Uh, excuse me. So what country are we in
right now?

56
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,330
Think about it.

57
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,350
We crossed the border line.

58
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,110
So we're in…

59
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,880
North Korea! North Korea this side.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,560
Wow…

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,600
Are you scared

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,319
I'm ready to defect.

63
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,819
Oh

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,500
I am so ready to go back to South Korea.

65
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,640
And here I am.

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
As we leave,

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,760
A flock of birds fly over the rice paddies.

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,000
For them there are no borders.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,400
I take a moment to reflect on the delicate
balance struck in this place between the tragedy

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,430
of the past and the hope for the future

71
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,599
and to enjoy the chocolate you can only get
in the DMZ!

72
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,660
This is Chris Chappell, thanks for watching
this episode of

73
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,520
Korea Uncensored?
