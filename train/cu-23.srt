1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,980
Chinese has a major shortage of women,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,470
and birth rates are plummeting.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,490
As China faces a population crisis,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,679
a new database is asking:

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,880
Are you breed ready?

6
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:19,680
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:20,760
I’m Chris Chappell.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,580

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,720
That way, you get an alert

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,340
each time we publish a new episode.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,340
You know, one thing

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,800
I love about the Chinese Communist Party

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,360
is that even after all these years,

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,850
it still manages to surprise me.

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,850
For decades,

18
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,160
China had the One Child Policy.

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,560
It meant most Chinese people

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,180
were only allowed to have one child,

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,820
or face fines.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,260
Or forced abortion.

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,760
China: the only country

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,380
that’s officially both Anti-Choice and Anti-Life.

25
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,500
But because of a cultural preference for boys,

26
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
this meant a lot of baby girls

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,390
were aborted or killed after birth.

28
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,390
So today,

29
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,370
there are more than 30 million more men.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,990
So—will China have 30 million men

31
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,660
going their own way?

32
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,660
Of course not.

33
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,000
That’s because the Chinese Communist Party’s

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,080
got their backs.

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,210
There’s a variety of solutions,

36
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,220
from forcing oppressed ethnic women to marry
them...

37
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,240
to a thriving human trafficking trade

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,200
from around the world...

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,570
to robot wives.

40
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,200
You know you’ve got a problem when “robot
wives”

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,240
is the least bad among those three options.

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,750
But a Dutch internet expert,

43
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:35,750
Victor Gevers,

44
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,090
from the non-profit group GDI Foundation,

45
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,280
discovered a new tactic.

46
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,060
He discovered an open database

47
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,590
of 1.8 million women in China.

48
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,070
The average age is 32,

49
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,549
but some are as young as 15.

50
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,020
The database contains a ton of personal information,

51
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,870
“including their phone numbers,

52
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,870
addresses,

53
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,940
and something called “BreedReady” status.

54
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,820
Now BreedReady could just be

55
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,750
a poor translation of some Chinese term.

56
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,030
It could be as innocent as a saying

57
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,810
this woman has children,

58
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,429
or the woman has reached childbearing years.

59
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,429
After all,

60
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,609
the youngest woman with a breed ready status
is 18.

61
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,870
But, in the context of China’s birth rates

62
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,760
falling to the lowest level ever…

63
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,519
and the Communist Party’s general habit

64
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,959
of launching large scale top down systems
of state control t

65
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,620
o deal with problems,

66
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,049
some people are concerned this is a giant
database

67
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,749
of women meant for breeding.

68
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,249
As Foreign Policy says,

69
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:36,950
“Female bodies have always been treated
as state property

70
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,939
that yielded what the country needed.”

71
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,230
90% of the database’s women are single,

72
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,430
and 82% live in Beijing.

73
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,380
Beijing is where all the best Communist officials
live.

74
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,269
“The database also included fields labeled
“political”

75
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,400
and “hasvideo” as well as links

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,560
to what appear to be Facebook profile pages.”

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,469
And since Facebook is banned in China,

78
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:02,309
these girls are very naughty.

79
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:03,829
It is not clear if the database

80
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,540
is part of some dating app,

81
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,099
a government registry,

82
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,359
or some other organization or company.

83
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,879
However, even if this is completely innocent,

84
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,540
there’s the problem that personal information

85
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,579
about a lot of women,

86
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,629
including full names and addresses,

87
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,340
is accessible in a totally open database.

88
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,669
No wonder China says it’s the biggest victim
of hacking.

89
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,200
Though, since the database is totally open,

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,640
I’m not sure you could count that as hacking.

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,919
Gevers is also the researcher

92
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,169
who discovered authorities in Xinjiang

93
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,279
were tracking an absurd amount of data

94
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,519
about the ethnic Uighur population.

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,239
Also, in a totally open, unsecure database.

96
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,239
Now there are a lot of reasons

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,049
birth rates are falling in China,

98
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,569
besides the fact that there just

99
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,919
aren’t that many women around.

100
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,079
According to state-run media,

101
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,049
the cost of raising a child is at an all time
high.

102
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,420
But China’s population is getting old.

103
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,109
And it’s so big of a problem,

104
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,180
Chinese leaders can’t continue to ignore
it.

105
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,180
Which gives you an idea of how bad the situation
is.

106
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,400
I mean, you know the Great Famine,

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,279
where 30-45 million people died?

108
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:15,730
Chinese authorities today still call the Great
Famine,

109
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,709
the Great Leap Forward.

110
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,459
So yeah, dealing with reality

111
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,740
is not the Communist Party’s strong suit.

112
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,590
The One Child Policy has been replaced

113
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,190
which the slightly more liberal Two Child
Policy.

114
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,879
But birth rates are still falling.

115
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,780
So the Party has been pushing for women

116
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,919
to start pushing out babies.

117
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,750
“The popular narrative has gone from

118
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,009
‘delayed motherhood is beneficial for women’s
health’

119
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,110
to ‘pregnancy during university

120
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,580
improves employment chances in the future.’

121
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,000
‘Painless abortion’ ads were seamlessly
replaced by

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,850
‘painless childbirth’ ads.”

123
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,360
As this state-run People’s Daily article
says,

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,960
“Giving Birth Is Not Only A Family Matter

125
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,659
But Also A National Issue”

126
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,250
That must be why factory owners

127
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,580
were required to monitor their female workers’
menstruation.

128
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,330
Just to be clear, that’s not a joke.

129
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,750
I don’t know why you would think that’s
a joke,

130
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,930
but that’s what actually happened.

131
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,449
So it might not be too much of a stretch

132
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,520
to say that someday soon,

133
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,599
women in China will face a new baby quota—

134
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,949
this time not limiting how many children she
can have,

135
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,110
but how many she’ll be required to produce
for the state

136
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,930
They just got to be breed ready.

137
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,300
So what do you think?

138
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,020
Leave your comments below.

139
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,629
And before you go,

140
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,160
now is the time I answer a question

141
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,259
from a member of the China Uncensored 50-Cent
Army—

142
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:37,259
fans who support the show

143
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,120
with a dollar or more per episode

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,070
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

145
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,349
Benjamin Jull asks,

146
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,400
“Has the air pollution in Beijing

147
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,530
improved at all recently?”

148
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,840
Great question!

149
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,689
As I’m sure everyone watching knows,

150
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,910
Beijing has gotten a reputation for bad air.

151
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,310
In fact, crazy bad levels of pollution.

152
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,720
And Beijing isn’t even the worst.

153
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,850
That article mentioned,

154
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,319
that on a scale of 0-500,

155
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,189
Beijing got a 755. In some areas,

156
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:09,629
it’s even reached 1000.

157
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:10,710
So the Chinese Communist Party

158
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,240
launched a war on pollution.

159
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,780
Anyone found breathing air

160
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,169
was immediately executed.

161
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,169
But seriously,

162
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,169
I could do a whole episode

163
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,900
on China’s War on Pollution.

164
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,909
But according to a recent study,

165
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,370
Beijing is now no longer among the world’s

166
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,360
100 most polluted cities.

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,810
Granted, 57 of world’s 100 most polluted
cities

168
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,449
*are* in China.

169
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,780
But Beijing is not among them.

170
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,190
So is China winning the war on pollution?

171
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,860
Maybe not.

172
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,690
Thanks for you question.

173
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,949
If you’d like to hear your question

174
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,030
