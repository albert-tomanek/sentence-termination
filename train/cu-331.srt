1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,270
Google is building an artificial intelligence
center in China.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,870
If only they could make software to warn them

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,379
when things are a bad idea.

5
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,049
The Chinese regime starts collecting

6
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,530
the DNA of ethnic minorities.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,040
Ancestry.com says you’re 97% in trouble.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,240
And finally,

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,759
China has a new Youth Ambassador.

10
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,609
And he’s not a “he.”

11
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,860
Or a “she.”

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,980
This is China Uncensored.

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,440
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,720
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,090
Forget about the looming specter

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,390
of nuclear war with North Korea.

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,199
The real threat to China is its own nuclear
power plants.

18
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:46,320
A key component of a Chinese nuclear power
plant

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,420
cracked during a safety test.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,280
And it’s located pretty close to Hong Kong.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,011
The plant is actually a joint venture

22
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:57,170
started in 2009 between China’s state-owned

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,089
China General Nuclear Power Corporation

24
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,330
and French utility,

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,829
Électricité de France.

26
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,180
After the component cracked,

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,740
the French scientists threw their hands in
the air and said,

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,280
“We give up!

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,310
We surrender!”

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,580
The completion of the plant

31
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,280
had been repeatedly delayed.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,980
It was supposed to go operational

33
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,150
at the end of this year,

34
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,290
but now, maybe not.

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,500
Possibly, other countries might want to

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,490
reconsider nuclear joint ventures with China.

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,680
But Western companies seem to never learn

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,530
the right lessons about working with China.

39
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,540
Which is why Google has decided to build

40
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,950
its new artificial intelligence research center
in Beijing.

41
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,960
It’s been up and down for Google

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,470
and China over the years.

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,060
Google set up a presence in China

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,960
starting in 2005,

45
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,070
but pulled out in 2010

46
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,720
after getting hacked by Chinese authorities—

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,060
allegedly—

48
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,950
and being forced to self-censor,

49
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,700
which they didn’t like...

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,470
…slash-got criticised for.

51
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,040
But it’s been 7 years!

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,550
That’s plenty of time to forget

53
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,140
all the lessons you learned!

54
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,330
I mean I have zero recollection

55
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,450
of anything I learned in college.

56
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,360
Like that book I read, 1984.

57
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,280
What was that about again?

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,519
Anyway, Google doing AI research

59
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,100
in China is a big deal.

60
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,819
China is trying to become the world leader

61
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,540
in artificial intelligence,

62
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,549
and has invested 161 billion dollars into
the field.

63
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:24,180
And the Chinese regime has done such a good
job,

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,569
the Council on Foreign Relations

65
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,400
warns China could surpass the US.

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,909
And whoever leads in AI

67
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:33,049
will be the ruler of the world—

68
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:35,549
at least according to Vladimir Putin,

69
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,959
who knows a thing or two about staying in
power.

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,209
Moving on, you may remember last week

71
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,430
we reported on the mass evictions

72
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,190
and demolition of migrant homes in Beijing.

73
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,199
Well, a painter in Beijing, Hua Yong,

74
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,650
is afraid you might not believe the scale
of it.

75
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,799
So selfie time!

76
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,520
I’m actually more amazed

77
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,310
those police didn’t immediately grab him.

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,930
Don’t worry though,

79
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,500
they did try to grab him eventually.

80
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
In his home.

81
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,360
Fortunately, it was a swing and a miss, because

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,180
“He fled the city after the police came
to arrest him

83
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,849
for publicizing the evictions.”

84
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,300
This isn’t Hua’s first time getting in
trouble with authorities.

85
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,269
He was sentenced to a labor camp back in 2012
for,

86
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:21,230
I kid you not,

87
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,790
filming himself in Tiananmen Square,

88
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,340
punching himself in the face until his nose
bled,

89
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,310
and then using the blood to write “6-4”,

90
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,310
which is a reference

91
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,140
to the June 4th 1989 Tiananmen Massacre.

92
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,380
Hua Yong is now my favorite artist.

93
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
But Hua’s not alone in being targeted by
police.

94
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Remember how, in pretty much

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,750
the only heartwarming thing about this story,

96
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,750
ordinary Beijingers were banding together

97
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
to help the migrants?

98
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,109
Well, they got in trouble with the police
too.

99
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,060
Yes, businesspeople who offered migrants jobs,

100
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,780
and charity workers who tried to find them
shelter,

101
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,650
have been interrogated by the police

102
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,560
and told to stop helping people.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
I mean, what were they thinking?

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,510
Communism isn’t about helping people!

105
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,550
In fact, since the CCP

106
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,290
has decided to evict the migrant workers,

107
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,360
helping them is seen as “an act of defiance”

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,370
against the state.

109
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,010
And in the far West of China is Xinjiang,

110
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,360
a region home to about 11 million ethnic Uyghurs.

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,480
China’s central authorities have noted

112
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,100
that Uyghurs sometimes look slightly different

113
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,880
from other Chinese,

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,030
and are therefore extremely dangerous.

115
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,030
Which may be why

116
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,590
“Chinese authorities in Xinjiang

117
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,790
are collecting DNA samples,

118
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,640
fingerprints, iris scans,

119
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,200
and blood types of all residents”—

120
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
according to Human Rights Watch.

121
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Now, sure, the mass collection of biodata

122
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,900
might sound scary.

123
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,750
But it’s being done as part of a free government

124
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,460
annual health checkup program

125
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,890
called “Physicals for All.”

126
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,100
Participation is totally optional...

127
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,040
unless you refuse.

128
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,570
But I’m sure it’s all for a good cause.

129
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,290
Such as checking on people’s organ health.

130
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,530
Although considering there is some evidence

131
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,230
that Chinese authorities are killing Uyghurs

132
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,030
to use their organs in transplant operations...

133
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,260
...maybe, “Physicals for All”

134
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,640
is just a handy way to identify potential
donors.

135
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,730
Again, totally optional—

136
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,790
unless they refuse.

137
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,980
And speaking of treating people like dirt,

138
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,250
it’s the 80-year anniversary of the Rape
of Nanking.

139
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,960
According to Chinese estimates,

140
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,330
300,000 Chinese civilians were raped,

141
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,880
tortured and killed in a six-week orgy of
violence

142
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,430
when Japanese troops invaded the Chinese city

143
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,270
during World War II.

144
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,830
Xi Jinping was there at a commemoration.

145
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,530
But he didn’t give a speech.

146
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,810
And considering the guy is known

147
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,510
for making three-hour long speeches,

148
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,940
that is a miracle.

149
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,250
Moving on to more horrible things

150
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,740
happening to women in China—

151
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,100
and this time, the Japanese aren’t to blame.

152
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,680
Chinese smugglers are buying North Korean
women.

153
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,240
Decades of the CCP’s One Child Policy

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,580
resulted in the killing of so many baby girls

155
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,890
that China now has a severe shortage of women.

156
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,990
In fact,

157
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,470
there are about 33 million fewer women than
men.

158
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,910
The obvious solution is trafficking women

159
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,070
from North Korea—where they’re sold

160
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,600
into a life of sex slavery.

161
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
On the plus side,

162
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,530
they’re rescued from a life of extreme poverty

163
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,970
under Kim Jong-un’s regime.

164
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,720
Those are both terrible choices.

165
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,810
And the Chinese Communist Party is worried

166
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,200
about the youth of China.

167
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,220
That’s why the Communist Party Youth League

168
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,920
just hired a new youth ambassador

169
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,150
to show them the way.

170
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,410
She’s a singer,

171
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,190
she’s only 15,

172
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,780
and according to her biography,

173
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,560
she’s an actual angel sent to Earth

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,890
to bring the happiness of music.

175
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,140
Here she is, Luo Tianyi.

176
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,540
No, she’s not a drawing.

177
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,320
She’s a vocaloid.

178
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,000
Kind of like that Japanese one,

179
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,700
only totally different because she’s Chinese.

180
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,210
As Global Times puts it,

181
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,650
Luo Tianyi will help instill correct thinking

182
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,570
into millennials.

183
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,710
And she’s so much better than an actual
human.

184
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,680
As her creators told the Global Times,

185
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,670
“[Virtual idols] are easier to manage,

186
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,020
different from real-life stars who make their
own decisions

187
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,410
and do things the way they like, which is
hard to control.”

188
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,570
A perfect role model for young people!

189
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,090
Don’t make your own decisions,

190
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,370
don’t do things the way you like,

191
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,500
and don’t be hard to control.

192
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,620
Be like Luo Tianyi.

193
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
So what do you think?
