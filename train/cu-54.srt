1
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:02,329
China is targeting Americans

2
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:05,549
in a new wave of Hostage Diplomacy.

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,070
What’s behind it?

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,849
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,629
I’m your host Chris Chappell.\h

6
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:21,340
If you’re an American watching this video
from inside China—Get out!!!

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,450
Get out of China while you still can!

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,420
Okay, it’s maybe not quite that serious.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,000
Maybe.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,640
But tensions between the United States and
China are getting worse.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,830
Yeah, they’ve been getting worse for a while.\h

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,340
Now we’ve reached the “China warns it
may detain Americans” stage.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,530
As in, those are some nice American citizens
we’ve got here.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,890
It’d be a shame if something bad happened
to them.\h

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,730
This makes a lot of sense.

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,409
Because the Chinese Communist Party is just
threatening to do what the US government is

17
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,409
doing.

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:04,600
You see, the US has been arresting Chinese
scholars for no reason at all, other than

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,210
the fact that they were Chinese... and didn’t
disclose their military ties on their visa

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:18,960
applications...and may have also been spying
for the Chinese military on US soil.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,500
In fact, it seems diplomats in the Chinese
Consulate in Houston were working with these

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,860
scholars.

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,890
Which was a big reason why the US shut that
consulate down.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,581
So obviously the only fair thing to do, is
for China to arrest random US citizens in

25
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:35,600
retaliation.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,980
Yes, that’s what the Chinese regime is threatening
to do.

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,810
“The Chinese officials have issued the warnings
to U.S. government representatives repeatedly

28
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,130
and through multiple channels...including
through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.”

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:57,260
Sources told the Wall Street Journal that
China’s message was clear: “The U.S. should

30
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,850
drop prosecutions of the Chinese scholars
in American courts, or Americans in China

31
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,200
might find themselves in violation of Chinese
law.”

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
What law?

33
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,310
We don’t know yet, but I’m sure they can
find something.

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,980
Because the Chinese Communist Party is working
on a little something called hostage diplomacy.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,760
People started talking about China’s hostage
diplomacy back in 2018.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,540
That’s when China detained two Canadian
citizens inside of China, Michael Kovrig and

37
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,459
Michael Spavor.

38
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:33,090
Their crime?

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,090
Being Canadian.

40
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,410
I get it.

41
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,380
It’s a crime to be so nice.

42
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,030
But in China, they were actually charged with
espionage.\h

43
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,980
Not right away, of course.

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,290
They had been detained for a year and a half
before they were formally charged.

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,459
China’s bureaucracy can be slow.

46
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,050
Sometimes it takes years for them to figure
out why they arrested someone.

47
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,780
At least on the surface.

48
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,489
Because in reality, the Chinese Communist
Party knew exactly what they were doing from

49
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,030
the get go.

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,370
They arrested the two Canadians because, well,
actually because they were Canadian—at the

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,790
wrong time.

52
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,580
They were Canadian, and the Canadian government
had just arrested the CFO of Chinese telecom

53
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,960
Huawei.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,760
She has been accused of violating US sanctions
on Iran.

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,610
So the Communist Party was showing Canada:
If you arrest one of our citizens, we’ll

56
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,680
arrest two of yours.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,060
And you Canadians won’t do anything about
it, because you’re too nice.

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,740
This is called hostage diplomacy.\h

59
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,489
But I don’t want to give you the impression
that the Chinese Communist Party are the only

60
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,210
ones who do this.\h

61
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,660
It’s also done by great countries like North
Korea.

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,560
Of course, the Chinese Communist Party does
not like the term hostage diplomacy one bit.

63
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,220
I know that from my favorite Chinese state-run
media, the Global Times.

64
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,830
This was from this past summer, after the
two Canadians were charged:

65
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,960
“Asked if China’s prosecution of two Canadians
was ‘hostage diplomacy,’ Chinese Foreign

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,989
Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said...the
question was ‘full of evil intentions,’

67
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:17,299
and replied ‘it would be better to ask the
Canadian government about hostage diplomacy.’”

68
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:22,779
Wait, are you sure you want to ask the Canadian
government about hostage diplomacy?

69
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:28,360
Because the Canadian defense minister is going
to tell you exactly what he thinks.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,680
\h
Hostage diplomacy—isn’t there a more...

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,650
diplomatic name for it?

72
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,379
How about: “captivating diplomacy”?

73
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,840
But the Chinese government is going even further
to play down the issue.

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,300
I’ll tell you how after this short break.

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,599
Welcome back.

76
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,520
Remember how I said earlier that China warned
it may detain Americans?

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,880
Well now, China is denying that it ever threatened
to detain Americans, haha.

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,330
The Americans probably just *misinterpreted*
all of those repeated warnings issued through

79
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,060
multiple channels including the US Embassy
in Beijing.

80
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,830
Of course, hostage diplomacy, I mean “captivating
diplomacy”, didn’t begin with the two

81
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,830
Canadians.

82
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,180
I did a whole episode about it back in 2018
called 5 Times China Detained Foreign Citizens

83
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,229
(for No Good Reason).\h

84
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:26,939
But basically China has been using hostage
diplomacy for many years against Americans

85
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,960
and Canadians, as well as Brits and Australians.

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,520
Even smaller countries like Sweden.\h

87
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,319
Here’s another example.

88
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,539
This month, Canada said it would begin accepting
Hong Kong activists as refugees.

89
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,349
The Chinese Communist Party did not like that.

90
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:49,659
So the Chinese ambassador to Canada threatened
that if Canada goes through with this, “That

91
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,930
could have consequences for the ‘health
and security’ for the 300,000 Canadians

92
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,300
living in [Hong Kong].”

93
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,770
In other words, if you’re a Canadian living
in Hong Kong—get out!

94
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,880
Get out now!!!

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,720
So yeah, Canadians, Americans, and pretty
much everyone else...now is not a good time

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,520
to be in China.

97
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,960
A US State department official has warned
that China can pretty much come up with whatever

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,469
reason it wants to detain a US citizen.

99
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:23,669
“We warn U.S. citizens that business disputes,
court orders to pay a settlement, or government

100
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:29,770
investigations into both criminal and civil
issues may result in an exit ban which will

101
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,830
prohibit your departure from China until the
issue is resolved.”

102
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,369
Exit bans are when they stop you from leaving
the country.

103
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:44,369
Which is one key reason why the US State Department
has issued a Level 3 travel advisory on China

104
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,199
that says you might want to reconsider travel.

105
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,289
“The PRC government uses arbitrary detention
and exit bans...to gain bargaining leverage

106
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,699
over foreign governments.”

107
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,120
What if you’re an American citizen who’s
already in China, though?

108
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,740
Well, over the summer, the US State Department
issued a security alert to American citizens

109
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,139
in China.

110
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:12,139
Warning them to “exercise increased caution”
due to the heightened detention risks in China

111
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,830
Most average Americans are probably still
safe.

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,869
We haven’t gotten to the point where Chinese
authorities are targeting all Americans in

113
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:20,869
the country.\h

114
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:25,460
But there are certain things that put Americans
more at risk of being detained or arrested

115
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,460
in China, especially now that the Chinese
regime has explicitly threatened Americans.\h

116
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,199
And I’ll tell you what those are after the
break.

117
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,360
Welcome back.

118
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,020
What kinds of things put Americans living
in China at risk of being arbitrarily detained

119
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,159
or arrested?

120
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,669
The most obvious thing is doing anything illegal.

121
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,389
But that’s not as straightforward as in
some other countries.

122
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:53,740
Definitely do not do drugs in China.

123
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,110
But things that once seemed more minor, like
working in China on a non-work visa, or doing

124
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,729
business in China without the right paperwork,
can get you arrested.\h

125
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,979
For example, there’s been a surge in arrests
of foreign teachers in China.

126
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,990
Many of them arrested for visa issues.

127
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,399
Of course, doing illegal things in China also
includes things like protesting the government,

128
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,680
or helping dissidents, or making jokes about
Xi Jinping on WeChat.

129
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,240
But only Chinese people are being detained
for that.

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,370
For now.\h

131
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,270
If you have past connections to the US government,
or if you have worked for a non-governmental

132
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,490
organization, or NGO, you’re also more at
risk.

133
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,780
The Chinese Communist Party does not like
NGOs.

134
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,280
They think NGOs are actually being controlled
by foreign governments.

135
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,990
And that is because all Chinese NGOs are controlled
by the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

136
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,940
One of the two Canadian Michaels, Michael
Kovrig, was a former diplomat and was working

137
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,150
for an NGO when he was detained.

138
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,720
On our China Unscripted podcast, we interviewed
Peter Dahlin, a Swedish citizen who was also

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,490
working for an NGO in China when he was detained,
forced to confess, and deported.\h

140
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,410
Working in the media also puts you more at
risk.

141
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,650
Two Australian journalists were evacuated
from China last month after Chinese authorities

142
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,520
tried to put exit bans on them.

143
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,140
And that includes working for Chinese state-run
media.

144
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,780
An Australian CGTN anchor was also detained
last month.

145
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,090
Working in media can even include making YouTube
videos.

146
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,020
Even if your videos aren’t political or
negative about China.

147
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,180
As our friends at ADV China found out.

148
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,110
We talked to them on our podcast about their
experience in China and the threats that forced

149
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,440
them to leave.

150
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,360
Being involved in sensitive business deals
can put you at risk.

151
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,060
Like with Australian Stern Hu for the mining
company Rio Tinto, who spent 8 years in prison.

152
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,810
You are definitely more at risk if the Chinese
Communist Party can use you for leverage.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,750
That happened to Americans Victor and Cynthia
Liu, who were banned from leaving China.

154
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,140
Their mother, also an American citizen, was
detained.\h

155
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,400
Why?

156
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,250
Victor and Cynthia’s estranged father is
a fugitive official, a former executive for

157
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,280
a state-owned bank that’s wanted for fraud
charges.

158
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,970
And the Chinese Communist Party thinks that
holding his children hostage will force him

159
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,370
to return.\h

160
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,950
And that brings me to the last thing that
puts you more at risk: being ethnically Chinese.

161
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,220
The sad truth is that the Chinese Communist
Party is more likely to target American citizens

162
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,050
who are ethnically Chinese than those who
are not Chinese.

163
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,710
We’ve seen this happen over and over again.

164
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,970
Chinese authorities treat Chinese people the
way they treat pandas.

165
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,920
No matter where you are in the world, no matter
where you were born, you belong to China.

166
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,090
That extends to Chinese minorities like the
Uyghurs as well.\h

167
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,790
So why is China making these threats now?

168
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,610
I mean, the trade war has been going on a
while; and the US has been targeting Chinese

169
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,950
companies like Huawei for a long time; and
the US military has been challenging China’s

170
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,400
claims in the South China Sea for years.

171
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,170
“But former U.S. national security officials
say the Justice Department’s cases against

172
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,440
the military-affiliated researchers, who were
arrested as they had prepared to leave the

173
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,530
country, represented a major, public embarrassment
for China in a way that other U.S. actions

174
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,130
targeting China haven’t.”

175
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,260
Basically in the past, the US did what China
wanted—by handling these kinds of incidents

176
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,100
behind closed doors.

177
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,390
That’s changed over the past several years.

178
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,170
FBI Director Christopher Wray has now said
the whole of Chinese society is a threat to

179
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,900
the US—and that it requires a whole of American
society response.

180
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,750
The US government is more willing to make
these kinds of cases public now so the American

181
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,550
people learn about it.

182
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,820
Joke’s on them, though.

183
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,980
Because most Americans aren’t interested
in learning about it.

184
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:20,680
I mean, let’s be honest: Would you rather
go on YouTube to watch China Uncensored—or

185
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,130
to watch a Minecraft Let’s Play video!

186
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,130
Oh my gosh, 11.6 million views?!

187
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,220
Why am I wasting my time making videos about
China?!

188
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh right, it’s because of you, my amazing
fans.\h

189
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,550
Speaking of amazing fans, now it’s time
for me to answer a question from one of you

190
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,910
who supports us with a dollar or more per
episode.

191
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,320
William E Williams asks, “Do you think if
the NBA takes a knee - it will be easier for

192
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,040
them to suck on China's money?

193
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Oh - if you can illustrate this on a t-shirt
I'll buy 2!

194
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,820
Oh William, I’d say it’s already working.

195
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,810
The NBA broadcast had been banned after Houston
Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted

196
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,050
his support of protests in Hong Kong.

197
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,600
“The losses from that one tweet could amount
to as much as $400 million, NBA commissioner

198
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,880
Adam Silver has said.”

199
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,730
China demanded the NBA fire Morey, which would
have looked really bad.

200
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,370
So now, a year later, he decided to quietly
step down.

201
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,690
Totally not because of the whole Hong Kong
thing.

202
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:35,840
“Daryl Morey cited personal reasons for
this being the ‘right time’ to step down.”

203
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,700
And owner of the Dallas Mavricks, Mark Cuban
has said, despite the genocide, China’s

204
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,070
a customer and is okay doing business with
them.

205
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,400
So I’d say the NBA has worked hard to get
back into the China market at any cost.\h

206
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,120
As for the t-shirt, we are working on getting
a merchandise store back up, so, stay tuned

207
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
for that.

208
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,420
Thanks for your question William.

209
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,280
Be like William and support China Uncensored
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

210
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,090
Thank you for watching.

211
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,660
And did you know, 60% of you who watch China
Uncensored are not subscribed to our channel?

212
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,470
How could you not be subscribed?

213
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,100
This show is so great!

214
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,120
Way better than a Minecraft Let’s Play.

215
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,770
I think.

216
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,610
So please, hit the subscribe button.

217
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,260
It’s a huge help to the show.

218
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,970
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

219
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,250
See you next time.
