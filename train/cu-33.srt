1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,040
O say can you see...

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,029
by the Chinese flag?!

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,489
In San Francisco?!

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,119
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:15,000
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Today is October 10th—

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
National Day,

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,500
where people come together to celebrate the founding

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,170
of the Republic of China.

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,170
Which,

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,310
despite its sometimes rocky history,

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,460
is now a free and democratic society,

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,200
with elected leaders and rule of law.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,320
And that's because the Republic of China

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,100
is the one that governs Taiwan.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,410
The big China

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,210
is the People’s Republic of China.

18
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,590
The one founded by Mao Zedong,

19
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,510
the dictator who killed more people than Hitler
and Stalin combined.

20
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,870
People celebrated that Chinese National Day

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,600
on October 1st,

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,309
the anniversary of the Communist Party’s,
um,

23
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,089
“liberation” of China.

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,460
Anyway,

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,900
the mainland Chinese National Day

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,149
wasn’t just celebrated inside mainland China
this year.

27
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:10,020
It was also celebrated

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,750
in Taiwan.

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,740
A China Uncensored viewer sent us these photos

30
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,139
he took in downtown Taipei

31
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:20,139
during the October 1st celebrations.

32
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,740
He says mainland Chinese were raising the
flag

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,820
of the People’s Republic of China,

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,079
and blaring communist propaganda songs from
loudspeakers.

35
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,219
Taiwan locals on the street could hardly believe
what they were seeing.

36
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,219
But on the other hand,

37
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,090
it’s not so hard to believe.

38
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,009
The Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan

39
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,369
to be just another province of China.

40
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,509
Maybe if they say it enough,

41
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,509
it will become true!

42
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,439
Well, if they say it enough

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,079
and also keep sixteen hundred missiles pointed
at Taiwan.

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,079
As you may know,

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,240
the Communist Party has threatened

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,069
to take Taiwan by military force

47
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:57,299
if it ever officially declares independence.

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,119
So it’s little wonder Taiwan people were
upset

49
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,189
by having all those mainland Chinese flags
waving around.

50
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,240
But you know who welcomed the Chinese Communist
Party’s

51
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,450
National Day celebrations?

52
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,830
Officials from Vancouver, Canada.

53
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,110
According to another China Uncensored viewer
there

54
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,910
who works near City Hall,

55
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,380
there were dozens of Chinese flags being flown
outside,

56
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,960
and security guards blocked off a whole area

57
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,850
for a Chinese National Day event.

58
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,750
This photo from the local Richmond News shows
the ceremony.

59
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,430
The guy in the center wearing a red scarf

60
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,970
is Vancouver’s acting mayor,

61
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,970
Kerry Jang,

62
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,860
a third-generation Chinese-Canadian.

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,800
A huge backlash erupted over the flag-raising
ceremony,

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,360
and especially over the fact that Canadian
officials in the photo

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,980
were wearing those red scarves.

66
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,770
Mayor Jang dismissed the backlash as racist,

67
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,930
and he also defended wearing the scarves because,

68
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,820
"Red is the Chinese colour for luck and good
fortune."

69
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,160
Okay,

70
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,920
what Jang said about the color red is true.

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,210
And some of the backlash against the flag
raising

72
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,930
might be prejudiced.

73
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,770
There is growing resentment in Vancouver

74
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,110
over hordes of rich mainland Chinese coming
over

75
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,320
and buying up real estate with cash,

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,890
driving average housing prices into the millions.

77
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,380
But that's not why people are upset about
the red scarves.

78
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
You see,

79
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,190
those red scarves have a specific meaning.

80
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,160
And it isn’t from traditional Chinese culture.

81
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,810
Those scarves represent the blood

82
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,090
of communist revolutionary martyrs.

83
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,580
They’re generally worn by schoolchildren

84
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,910
who are members of the Young Pioneers.

85
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,180
The Young Pioneers official slogan is:

86
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,010
"Be prepared, to struggle for the cause of
Communism!

87
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,150
Always be prepared!"

88
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,260
They’re just like the Boy Scouts!

89
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,150
Except their theme song is called

90
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,260
“We are the Heirs of Communism,”

91
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,550
which talks about cleanly annihilating their
enemies.

92
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,760
I have never been so afraid of a six-year-old
before.

93
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
The point is,

94
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,700
the red scarf is a widely used symbol in different
communist countries.

95
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:59,670
Here is it on a Soviet postage stamp.

96
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,910
And being worn by Vietnamese Young Pioneers.

97
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,450
But some of us don't read Wikipedia.

98
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,440
Like that awkward-looking guy on the left,

99
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,220
also wearing a red scarf.

100
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,860
That’s Canadian Member of Parliament Joe
Peschisolido.

101
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,350
In his defense, though,

102
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,299
he regretted it more than the girl who wore
this to her wedding.

103
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,299
Afterwards,

104
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:21,239
Peschisolido told the Richmond News

105
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,230
that when the Chinese organizers told him
to wear the scarf, he

106
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,740
“didn’t realize it had the [connotations
of] the Cultural Revolution

107
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,550
and persecution that it did.”

108
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,949
What persecution?

109
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,759
Let's ask former Vancouver mayoral candidate
Meena Wong,

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,990
who wrote on Facebook:

111
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,069
“During the infamous Chinese Cultural Revolution,

112
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,289
the red guards wearing red scarves came to
our home

113
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,599
and took everything valuable.

114
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,550
They abused my aging grandmother

115
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,879
and threatened my parents.”

116
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,569
So that's why there's now a Change.org petition

117
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,930
asking acting mayor Kerry Jang to apologize,

118
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,659
and then resign.

119
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,050
And it wasn’t just some patriotic Chinese
Canadians

120
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,479
who organized the Vancouver event.

121
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,330
It was the Canadian Alliance of Chinese Associations—

122
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,099
the same group that helped organize a

123
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:12,490
“Praising Mao” event in 2013,

124
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,259
celebrating the birthday of the most successful
mass murder

125
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,509
in human history.

126
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,330
Successful not only because Mao killed like
100 million people

127
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,129
without getting punished,

128
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,800
but because hipsters still wear him on their
t-shirts.

129
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,289
But while we’d all love to blame Canada—

130
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:29,289
and we do—

131
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,259
it’s not just Canada.

132
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,900
In San Francisco,

133
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,539
Chinese American Mayor Ed Lee

134
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:39,820
also enthusiastically threw his support behind
Chinese National Day.

135
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,310
In this footage from China Daily’s Twitter
account,

136
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,789
we can see Mayor Lee during the Chinese national
anthem,

137
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:46,789
and then speaking,

138
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,150
at the National Day Event organized by—

139
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,479
wait for it—

140
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,129
the Chinese consul-general.

141
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:57,120
Here he is being praised by Chinese state-run
media for it.

142
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,199
But strangely,

143
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,370
Mayor Lee forgot to mention it on his official
webpage.

144
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,120
As if perhaps the people he represents in
San Francisco

145
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,939
might be upset by him cozying up to a regime

146
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,759
that’s killed more people in the last decade
than...

147
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,499
the entire population of San Francisco.

148
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,539
This is not the first time, either.

149
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:17,539
In fact,

150
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:21,210
Lee was criticized two years ago for raising
the Chinese flag

151
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,400
while pro-democracy protests were happening
in Hong Kong.

152
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Look,

153
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,889
I'm not trying to pick on ethnically Chinese
government officials.

154
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,889
I mean,

155
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,889
last year,

156
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,310
California governor Jerry Brown also joined
the CCP’s National Day Ceremony.

157
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,860
And I know that both Vancouver and San Francisco

158
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,900
routinely raise flags for different countries'
national day holidays,

159
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,699
as a way of celebrating the diversity of their
cities.

160
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,020
I think that's a good thing.

161
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,430
But the People’s Republic of China is different.

162
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,279
It's worth noting that the loudest protests
against these national day celebrations

163
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,719
come from Chinese people.

164
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:58,800
The Communist Party,

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,310
besides being responsible for atrocities like
the Cultural Revolution

166
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,710
and the Tiananmen Square Massacre

167
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,480
still kills its own citizens on a regular basis.

168
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,910
The Party uses events like these national
day ceremonies

169
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,380
to make itself seem like a totally legit,

170
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,740
normal government,

171
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,849
hiding what it’s done,

172
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,039
not only from its own people,

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,279
but also the from rest of the world.

174
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,699
And it really helps when foreign officials

175
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,270
raise the flag for them.

176
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,900
So what do you think of foreign countries

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,960
celebrating Chinese National Day?

178
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,849
Leave your comments below.

179
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,309
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

180
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:34,209
See you next time.
