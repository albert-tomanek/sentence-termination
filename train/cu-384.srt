1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,889
Say goodbye to your pandas, San Diego

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,940
The US and China are in a Space Race

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,280
And more political purging

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,880
in the Chinese Communist Party

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,090
That and more on this week’s

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,800
China news headlines.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,220
This is China Uncensored,

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,759
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,720
This week’s China news headlines.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,700
Want to see a Giant Panda?

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,440
Well, if you’re near San Diego,

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,500
you’ve got until April.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Because the San Diego Zoo

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,880
is sending its last two giant pandas back
to China.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,060
Bai-Yun, 27,

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,670
and her son, Xiao Liwu, 6,

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,090
will leave at the end of April for China.

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,570
The father already left for China in October.

19
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,920
“They are one of San Diego's biggest attractions,

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,420
the Giant Pandas,

21
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,460
and now they're going back to China.

22
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,170
The world famous San Diego Zoo announced

23
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,850
just a few hours ago

24
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,860
the last two pandas under their care

25
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,270
are leaving to China.

26
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,060
The pandas have been here for decades

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,399
and millions of people have visited the city

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,329
and the zoo to see them.”

29
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,329
Which just goes to show

30
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,710
how little pandas care about you.

31
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,750
No matter how much love you show

32
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,130
these black and white furballs,

33
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,130
in the end,

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,990
they’ll always leave you.

35
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,600
And that’s because every panda in the world,

36
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
regardless of where it’s born,

37
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,210
legally belongs to China.

38
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,350
China rents out pairs of pandas

39
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,330
to zoos around the world.

40
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,390
According to National Geographic,

41
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,350
US zoos have paid a million dollars a year.

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,210
That’s not a joke.

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,750
And if that pair manages to have a baby,

44
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,729
the zoo will have to pay the Chinese government

45
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,080
an additional 600,000 dollars.

46
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,990
Fortunately, they don’t have babies very
often,

47
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,290
because your average panda has the libido

48
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,840
of a 90 year old nun.

49
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,580
What’s that, Shelley?

50
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,890
That’s just a myth?

51
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,890
Pandas will have more babies

52
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,990
if they like each other?

53
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,990
You know what,

54
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,470
I don’t really care about panda love.

55
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,670
The point is,

56
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,500
pandas are expensive.

57
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
According to the Guardian,

58
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,100
“Having a panda can be ruinous,

59
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,250
say some zoos,

60
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,470
and could even take money away

61
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,570
from other conservation work.”

62
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,030
So the San Diego zoo has to send their pandas
to China?

63
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,979
I say, good riddance!

64
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:14,310
I for one am not going have my heart broken
by a panda.

65
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,310
Again.

66
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,959
There’s a new space race to the moon!

67
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,959
This time,

68
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,489
according to US Vice President Mike Pence,

69
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,279
it’s between the US and China.

70
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,279
Pence said,

71
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,489
“The first woman and the next man on the
moon

72
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,169
will both be American astronauts launched
by

73
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:32,720
American rockets from American soil.”

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,230
That’s of course, completely wrong.

75
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,470
Everyone knows that the Chang’e

76
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,489
accidentally went to the moon

77
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,400
thousands of years ago.

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,060
Say, what’s going on with the US-China trade
war?

79
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,819
It’s in the End Game.

80
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,200
Tom, we’re in the End Game here.

81
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,150
And that’s no Dr. Strange.

82
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,219
That was the executive vice president

83
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,340
and head of international affairs

84
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,629
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,

85
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,389
Myron Brilliant.

86
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:01,349
Wait, Shelley that’s his actual name?

87
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,139
Yeah, really it’s a brilliant comment.

88
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,629
Of course, just like the Avenger’s End Game,

89
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,849
we may still have to wait a while.

90
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,529
Experts told CNBC that a trade deal

91
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,980
may not come until May or June.

92
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,200
Hmm, June.

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,560
Yes, I’m sure the Chinese Communist Party

94
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,230
will love having the spotlight on trade in
early June,

95
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,359
which just so happens to be the 30th anniversary

96
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,159
of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

97
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,180
India has become the fourth country in the
world

98
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,159
to develop anti-satellite missiles.

99
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,530
To explain how it works,

100
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,249
they released this pretty spiffy video.

101
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:43,900
“The missile locks onto incoming satellite
and it hits the target.”

102
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,689
Wow.

103
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:49,419
I’m truly blown away.

104
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,549
Now this certainly ups

105
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:52,739
India’s strategic defense capabilities.

106
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,019
That’s important—

107
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,510
since India is one of China’s largest regional
rivals.

108
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,819
But just so you know,

109
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,129
China is totally cool with it.

110
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,500
The Chinese foreign ministry wrote,

111
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,510
“We have noticed reports and hope

112
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,049
that each country will uphold

113
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,939
peace and tranquillity in outer space.”

114
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:09,939
Translation:

115
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,430
We hope *everyone else*

116
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,809
will uphold peace and tranquillity in outer
space.

117
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,500
The Chinese head of Interpol Meng Hongwei

118
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,980
went missing in China last year.

119
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,440
Now he’s been expelled from the Communist
Party.

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,360
And charged with living an “extravagant
lifestyle”

121
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,000
That was a “serious violation of law and
discipline.”

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,380
So is he being taken down as part of

123
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,960
Xi Jinping’s “anti-corruption campaign”?

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,000
Eh.

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,250
The reality is,

126
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,500
Meng had ties to former Chinese leader Jiang
Zemin.

127
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,380
Jiang is current Xi Jinping’s arch nemesis.

128
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,350
And so Meng was just a pawn in their power
struggle.

129
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,560
But if Meng gets thrown into a dark hole somewhere,

130
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,470
at least he won’t be alone.

131
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,500
Because the former head of China’s Internet,
Lu Wei,

132
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,450
is also being thrown into that dark hole.

133
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,540
Lu Wei used to be in charge of

134
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,220
keeping China’s internet sanitized—

135
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,660
that is, clear of all those pesky facts

136
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,220
that make the Chinese regime look bad.

137
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,930
But now he’s been found guilty

138
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,130
of taking 5 million dollars in bribes.

139
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,600
Does sacking the internet chief mean Xi Jinping

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,540
will be loosening up control of the internet?

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,620
Haha, of course not!

142
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,080
Lu Wei is also tied to Jiang Zemin.

143
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,190
“Lu had spent most of his career

144
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,900
working in the CCP’s propaganda agencies

145
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,740
under Liu Yunshan,

146
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,120
the former propaganda chief

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,990
who is also a key associate

148
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,740
in the Jiang faction.”

149
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,530
I guess that just shows that if you pick the
wrong side,

150
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,050
nothing will save you from being purged in
a power struggle.

151
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,740
Not even commissioning a great propaganda
song

152
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,780
about China’s internet power.

153
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,360
Internet Power!

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,100
The Web is where glorious dreams are!

155
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,500
An oldie but a goodie.

156
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,430
And finally, the Chinese Communist Party

157
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,520
has spent years pushing anti-Japanese propaganda.

158
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,460
So when two men showed up to

159
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,210
a cherry blossom festival in at Wuhan University,

160
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,830
one of them wearing a kimono,

161
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,270
security guards stopped them.

162
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,430
One man was “violently pushed to the ground,

163
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,370
while his friend is restrained in a choke-hold

164
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,760
by another guard before collapsing.”

165
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,620
Now, the two men were not Japanese.

166
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,060
They were Chinese.

167
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,860
And as the guy yells at the end of the clip
above,

168
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,900
he wasn’t wearing a kimono.

169
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,270
He was wearing an ancient Chinese garment

170
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,550
that inspired the kimono.

171
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,950
But you know, close enough.

172
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,200
The university released a statement in response,

173
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,230
saying all are welcome but asking

174
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,120
“the public to abide by school regulations,

175
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,210
behave in a civilized manner and dress appropriately.”

176
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,000
And before you go, now is the time I answer

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
a question from a member

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,620
of the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army—

179
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
fans who support the show

180
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,720
with a dollar or more per episode

181
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,260
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

182
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,720
Lukáš asks,

183
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,600
“Chris, who would bring more suffering to
the world,

184
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,110
if they seize the power

185
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,900
and what are your scientific arguments for
that?

186
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Cthulhu, Goa'uld or CCP?”

187
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,040
Ohhh, that’s a tricky question.

188
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,620
Hypothetically,

189
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,800
I’m pretty sure Cthulhu

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,460
would be pretty bad news.

191
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,580
However, since you ask for scientific arguments,

192
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,780
I’m going to have to go with the CCP.

193
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,660
Why?

194
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,720
Well, because the Chinese Communist Party

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
already long ago seized power in China—

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,660
and killed tens of millions of people

197
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,240
with total disregard for human life.

198
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,130
And so we have real evidence of

199
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,880
all the suffering the CCP has caused,

200
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,560
whereas Cthulhu and the Goa’uld are still
unknowns.

201
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,220
Maybe Cthulhu would be a loving caretaker.

202
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,450
Thanks for your question, Lukas.

203
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,630
If you’d like to hear your question

204
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,060
answered on the show,

205
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,560
sign up to support China Uncensored

206
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,400

207
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,010
It’s less than the cost of your daily cup
of coffee.

208
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,770
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

209
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,550
