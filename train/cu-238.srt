1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,870
The People’s Republic of China Celebrates
its Birthday

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,359
With a show of military strength

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,120
And Hong Kong celebrates...

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,320
in its own way

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,440
The Chinese Communist Party

6
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:18,100
faces unprecedented challenges.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,270
The US-China trade war.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,240
An economic slowdown.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,970
And growing criticism for its human rights
atrocities.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,300
But who cares about that?!

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,890
Today’s a party!

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,700
A Communist Party.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,290
October 1 is China’s National Day.

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,400
And this year,

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,600
the People’s Republic of China

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,290
is celebrating its 70th birthday.

17
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,620
That’s right, China’s communist government

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,990
is almost as old as your grandmother.

19
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,730
In mainland China,

20
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,760
celebrations included floats featuring

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,500
China’s happy ethnic minorities—

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,610
especially the Uighurs.

23
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,399
And...whatever this is.

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,130
Oh, don’t forget the giant missiles.

25
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,190
They’re clearly compensating for their lack
of...

26
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,350
human rights.

27
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,679
Plus, lots of goose-stepping soldiers.

28
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:09,330
And proof that China is a leader in robotics.

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,479
Yeah, that shot was creepy four years ago,
too.

30
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:16,830
And there was even a portrait of Xi Jinping
waving at..

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,170
.Xi Jinping!

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,109
And here comes former leader Jiang Zemin,

33
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:23,899
who is...possibly alive.

34
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:24,899
And oh hey,

35
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,069
it’s Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam!

36
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,130
Clearly nothing is happening right now in
Hong Kong

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,009
that would require her attention.

38
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,221
That’s right, the Communist Party

39
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:36,859
wants the world to know everything’s fine.

40
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,060
Especially here in Hong Kong,

41
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,069
where people love the Communist Party.

42
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,770
I don’t care what you’ve heard!

43
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,780
Everywhere you look,

44
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,459
there are signs celebrating the 70th anniversary
of the Party.

45
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:49,679
Mostly around all the closed shops.

46
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,130
And empty streets.

47
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,159
And barricaded subway stations.

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,319
Why, it almost feels like martial law.

49
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,359
They're just not calling it that.

50
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,909
At this point, even being outside is a form
of protest.

51
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,680
But Hong Kong police have warned about possible
terrorism today.

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
Police said in a recent press conference that

53
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,030
“some demonstrators were planning to kill
officers,

54
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,000
set fires and bomb shopping malls.”

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,040
The police’s claim was partly based on social
media groups

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,890
with very few followers that have sent almost
no messages...

57
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,060
And were registered in Madarin instead of
Cantonese.

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,060
Wow, Hong Kong protesters love China so much

59
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,060
they’ve started making their secret plans
in Mandarin.

60
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,830
This sounds like a job for China’s People’s
Armed Police!

61
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,030
Good thing they’ve been secretly moved into
Hong Kong.

62
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,720
Between practically shutting down the city

63
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
and warning about terrorism,

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,810
it seems that the message from the Hong Kong
government is:

65
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,120
stay home and cower in fear.

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,370
Which...is a pretty appropriate way

67
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,440
to celebrate 70 years of rule

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,000
under the Chinese Communist Party.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But even though the police

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,050
are trying to keep people off the streets,

71
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,930
that didn’t stop Hong Kongers from coming
out and showing

72
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,630
how they truly feel about Communism.

73
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,150
They feel not good.

74
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,810
Protesters are crashing the Party.

75
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,810
Literally.

76
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,430
“So the Hong Kong police have made it pretty
clear

77
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,130
that they don’t want people coming out today.

78
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,280
Why did you come out?”

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,730
“The more they don’t want us to come out,

80
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,610
ctually that makes us even more of us will
be coming out.

81
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,830
This is their tactics,

82
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,840
they’re trying to scare us with violence.”

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,240
“Are you concerned about what might happen
today?”

84
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,990
“Of course, that’s why I’m covering
up myself!

85
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,480
But, ah, there must be consequences

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,060
for everything that we have to do,

87
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,400
but then I feel like I still want to fight
for what I stand for,

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,760
and I’m willing to take up the consequences.”

89
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,130
“Our government has not been respecting
for us for so long,

90
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,590
since June,

91
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,840
and they haven’t heard any of our demands,

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
any of what we want.

93
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,900
And they have keep on denying any of our human
rights.

94
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,130
I think this is very important for us to show

95
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,240
that we are not afraid of what they do.”

96
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,010
“We are concerned whether there will be
more police violence,

97
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,280
there will be more people in jail,

98
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,750
but I think the people of Hong Kong are ready
to fight.”

99
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,709
“Do you have a birthday message you’d
like to send to the CCP?”

100
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:18,659
“If you want me, asking my feelings,

101
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,650
I would just: ‘Screw you, Chinese government.’

102
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,650
That’s it.”

103
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,979
More than a hundred thousand people

104
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,229
protested throughout Hong Kong,

105
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,599
the majority here on Hong Kong island.

106
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,840
Even though it was illegal.

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,740
And after crowds of citizens marched with
defiant hope,

108
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,639
riot police showed up to ruin everything.

109
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,180
But the celebration wasn’t over yet.

110
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,879
It just turned into...the afterparty.

111
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,759
It’s dance party out here.

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,740
Whoo whoo!

113
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,500
Yeah, there’s some cool new moves on the
street.

114
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,750
Check out the police-man shuffle.

115
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,360
The Umbrella Hop.

116
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,680
And the please stop tear gassing us we’re
reporters

117
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,610
and we’re the only people up here...boogie.

118
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,930
I bet someone in Beijing right now

119
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,360
is looking at these celebrations and thinking,
boy,

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,710
since Hong Kongers love the Communist Party
so much,

121
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,939
maybe we should just get rid of the one country,

122
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,600
two systems policy!

123
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,759
As the heart of Hong Kong

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,900
descends into an apocalyptic hellscape,

125
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,759
it almost seems like the Communist Party’s
authoritarian rule

126
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,490
isn’t much to celebrate.

127
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,940
And then elsewhere in Hong Kong,

128
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,039
a police officer shot a teenager point blank
in the chest.

129
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,319
I think the party’s over.

130
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,840
So that was Hong Kong during the 70th anniversary

131
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,330
of the People’s Republic of China.

132
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,389
It makes you wonder if there will be a 71st.

133
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,020
I’m Chris Chappell.

134
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,200
See you next time.

135
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,040
Maybe.
