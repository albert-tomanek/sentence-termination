1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,229
Tensions between the US and China are on the
rise

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:07,400
The Pentagon is in a panic about relying on
Chinese tech

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,910
Because the US military depends on China for
small drones

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,060
But the Pentagon has an idea to break its
Made in China habit

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,700
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,250
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,349
As if China's military build-up in the South
China Sea

8
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:28,009
and its constant threats over Taiwan

9
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,039
weren't enough to worry about,

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,970
the Pentagon now has a new cause for concern.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,000
No, not giant military cats.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,440
Although those are concerning.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,980
No, I’m talking about the US military's

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,250
reliance on Chinese drones.

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,510
“The idea is for small units on the battlefield,

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,770
that you have small drones that soldiers

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,070
can quickly unpack and get in the air,”

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,070
says Michael Horowitz,

19
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,180
a University of Pennsylvania professor.

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,719
“These quadcopters are also inexpensive
enough

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,840
that if one crashes or you lose one,

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,370
it’s not that big a deal.”

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,730
The drones we’re talking about here

24
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,550
are a type of small Unmanned Aerial System—or
UAS.

25
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,860
This kind.

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,540
They’re used by the US military

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,660
mostly for reconnaissance missions.

28
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,790
But even little drones can be lethal.

29
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,840
"All it takes is something literally as simple
as this.

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,430
Here is a device that is built to drop a payload.

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,860
So this actually hooks onto the sides of this,
underneath.

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,860
And this closes.

33
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,520
And all you have to do is,

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,329
with something less than a hundred bucks,

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,220
is literally put it on the bottom of this

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,520
and it allows you to trigger a mechanism

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,009
that can release a payload."

38
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,560
"It can kill somebody but it's not at the
lethality

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,100
that a Hellfire missile would have."

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,079
But the Pentagon is not so much worried about

41
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,840
the Chinese military sending a swarm of drones
over

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,799
to attack the US mainland...

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,670
since Amazon’s already got that covered.

44
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,040
No, the Pentagon is worried about the Chinese-made
drones

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,440
that the US government has been buying of
its own free will.

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,810
Specifically, this Chinese technology

47
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,440
could potentially have built-in security flaws—

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,130
designed to give the Chinese military

49
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,920
an advantage in case of conflict.

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,450
For example, a secret piece of code

51
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,710
that would send sensitive information to China.

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,760
According to this 2017 memo,

53
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,510
the Department of Defense ordered troops to
stop using drones

54
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,340
made by Chinese company DJI

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,210
because of "increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities."

56
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,210
According to the memo,

57
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,450
DJI was at the time

58
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,040
one of the most widely used brands of drones
by the US Army.

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,010
Citing a classified report into

60
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,100
“DJI UAS Technology Threat and User Vulnerabilities,”

61
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,200
the Army ordered troops to “cease all use,

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,700
uninstall all DJI applications,

63
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,170
remove all batteries/storage media from devices,

64
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,650
and secure the equipment.”

65
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,700
The Pentagon didn’t reveal

66
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,340
the specifics of the national security threat.

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
And at the time,

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,530
a DJI company spokesman complained to the
BBC that

69
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,850
"The US Army has not explained

70
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,630
why it suddenly banned the use of DJI drones
and components,

71
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,950
what 'cyber-vulnerabilities' it is concerned
about."

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,310
Somehow I don’t think the cyber-vulnerability

73
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,480
was that the drones had too many feelings.

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,410
But to illustrate the problem,

75
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,380
in 2017, “[DJI’s] Phantom series of [Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles drew]

76
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,370
the attention of hackers who’ve been able
to break into

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,950
and manipulate the drone’s GPS software,

78
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,150
punching holes in the ‘geofences’

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,160
that sought to keep the drones out of no-fly
zones.”

80
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,870
Obviously, that hack was not good PR for DJI.

81
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,900
So in early 2019, DJI released this video,

82
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,490
promoting its new line of drones designed
for government use:

83
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,060
“DJI has developed a new hardware and software
solution

84
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,150
that allows government agencies to confidently
use drone technology

85
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,760
while keeping in accordance with stringent

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,660
IT and data security requirements.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,080
We call it DJI government edition.”

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,060
I mean, it’s essentially the same drone
technology,

89
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,270
but now with bigger promises.

90
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,430
“It actually allows us to tell our clients

91
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,140
that all of their telemetry data—

92
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,130
meaning where the drone is flying—

93
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,330
is stored securely and not shared with anyone
but them.”

94
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,030
I mean, if DJI got a guy in a Patagonia vest
to say it,

95
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,130
it must be true.

96
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,000
Even if that guy is the CEO of a company

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,610
that stands to make millions

98
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,590
off of helping government agencies implement
DJI drones.

99
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,490
That video, which is targeted at

100
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,110
no...government...in...particular...

101
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,930
does aim to address one of the specific concerns

102
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,890
that the US government just happens to have:

103
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,660
If the US military personnel on covert missions

104
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,790
are using DJI drones in secret locations,

105
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,730
those missions could be compromised

106
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,830
by something as simple as leaked flight logs.

107
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,370
Or shutting down a drone in mid-flight.

108
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,620
“There are U.S. special operators in Syria
using DJI products,”

109
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,270
the CEO of Expert Drones told the publication
Defense One.

110
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,390
“So I get it.

111
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,670
I’m glad [the Army is] finally doing something
about this.”

112
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,070
Because given the growing clarity that China
is,

113
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,500
in fact, America's chief strategic adversary,

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,970
being hooked on technology that's made in
China

115
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,990
may be, well, un-strategic.

116
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,820
And there are fears that the Chinese regime

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,040
is secretly installing backdoors in commercial
technology

118
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,520
for potential military advantage.

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,010
And it certainly wouldn’t be the first time

120
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,350
the Chinese regime has been accused of using

121
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,280
seemingly innocuous commercial technology

122
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,510
to gain a potential advantage.

123
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,510
Huawei.

124
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,200
Sorry. I meant “Huawei”.

125
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,900
The company that makes knockoff iPhones and
5G technology.

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,610
The Pentagon’s national security concerns

127
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,800
about Chinese-made drones were echoed

128
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,110
by the Department of Homeland Security in
May this year.

129
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,350
Which is several months after DJI

130
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,040
made that video promising the government edition
of their drones

131
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,360
is totally secure,

132
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
there’s nothing to worry about.

133
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,300
In a notice titled “Chinese Manufactured
Unmanned Aircraft Systems,”

134
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,870
Homeland Security warned that U.S. officials

135
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,470
have “strong concerns about any technology
product

136
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,139
that takes American data into the territory
of an authoritarian state

137
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,970
that permits its intelligence services

138
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,630
to have unfettered access to that data

139
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,500
or otherwise abuses that access.”

140
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,700
That being said, it appears the US government

141
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,740
*has* given security clearance

142
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,830
to the government edition of DJI.

143
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,890
And that’s probably because there just aren’t

144
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,150
good alternatives made in America.

145
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,580
“[The US doesn’t] have much of a small

146
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,080
[Unmanned Aerial System] industrial base

147
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,100
because DJI dumped so many low-price quadcopters
on the market,

148
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,860
and we then became dependent on them,”

149
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,780
said Ellen Lord, the Pentagon’s chief weapons
buyer,

150
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,690
in a recent press conference.

151
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,610
So how can the US wean itself

152
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,440
off of dependence on Chinese drones?

153
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,340
By diving headlong into the world of American
tech startups.

154
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,910
This fall, the Defense Department is launching
something

155
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,830
called a “Trusted Capital Marketplace”

156
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,280
to connect investors with small tech firms
t

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,340
o boost domestic production of small drones.

158
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,950
A kind of Shark Tank,

159
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,050
where even the Pentagon itself can be one
of the sharks.

160
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,470
Although the Pentagon will never be

161
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,840
as intimidating as Mark Cuban.

162
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,460
“Mark”

163
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,160
“What are you doing?”

164
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,590
But if you need a million bucks to launch
your project

165
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,470
of a tiny drone that shoots massive Hellfire
missiles,

166
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,230
the Pentagon can’t wait to hear your pitch.

167
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,130
After all, once they have the drone problem
solved,

168
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,850
they can focus on the real threat.

169
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,580
And turn it to their advantage.

170
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,740
So what do you think about the US Army’s

171
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,120
dependence on Chinese drones

172
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,669
and its idea to boost domestic manufacturing

173
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,350
of Unmanned Aerial Systems?
