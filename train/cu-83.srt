1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:01,950
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,120
got something critical to say

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,829
about the Chinese Communist Party?

4
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:07,100
Good luck with that.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,360
Hi, welcome back.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,560
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,940
We take you once again to the land Down Under,

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,909
which is rapidly become a land under pressure

9
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,740
from the Chinese Communist Party.

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,720
That’s the topic of the book Silent Invasion

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,919
by Australian professor Clive Hamilton.

12
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:29,599
It’s set to be published next April.

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,330
It’s about how the CCP is influencing

14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,000
the highest levels of Australia’s politics

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,140
and news organizations.

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,140
But now,

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,330
we can add one more sphere

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,830
to the CCP’s influence:

19
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,530
Book publishers.

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,800
Because the upcoming book

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,080
has been censored by the Chinese government.

22
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,510
Not in China,

23
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,920
but in Australia!

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,990
More specifically,

25
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,060
his publisher Allen & Unwin

26
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,620
has decided to indefinitely delay the publication.

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,300
Indefinitely delay…

28
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,820
Kind of like how

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,960
every time I asked out Connie in middle school,

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,620
she always said,

31
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,580
“I’m busy tonight,

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,640
maybe some other time.”

33
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,070
The publisher told Mr. Hamilton

34
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,390
they were concerned about getting sued

35
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,250
by people his book alleges have connections
to

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,830
the Chinese Communist Party.

37
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,712
“What we’re seeing now, in this case,

38
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:20,250
is the first instance, I believe,

39
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,920
where a major Western publisher has decided
to

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,670
censor material critical of the Chinese Communist
Party

41
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,170
in its home country.”

42
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,479
So Hamilton’s book is about how Australia

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,480
is influenced by the Chinese Communist Party.

44
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,979
And the publishers are delaying it

45
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,420
because they’re worried that they might
get in trouble

46
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,549
with Australians who were influenced

47
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,850
by the Chinese Communist Party.

48
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,850
That is...

49
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,670
the opposite of irony.

50
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,670
Either that,

51
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,830
or the publishers really knew

52
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,040
how to get publicity.

53
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,060
I mean,

54
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,480
look at the international headlines!

55
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,520
But no, Allen & Unwin

56
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,330
is probably not just pining for publicity,

57
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,420
and secretly planning to publish the book
after all.

58
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,850
Like many large corporations

59
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,530
with millions of dollars and armies of lawyers,

60
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,330
they’re scared of the big bad CCP.

61
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,060
Clive Hamilton says a lawyer had reviewed
his book

62
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,770
and he had carefully revised it

63
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,480
to avoid potential defamation.

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,209
But the CCP or someone it influences

65
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,730
could still in theory punish the publisher

66
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,730
by dragging them through long-term,

67
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,620
expensive litigation.

68
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,569
There are already ongoing lawsuits

69
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,400
against two major Australian media companies

70
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,650
for covering similar topics.

71
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,170
Those lawsuits aren’t from the CCP itself,

72
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,150
but rather from a Chinese Australian

73
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,520
with alleged connections with the CCP.

74
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,840
Hamilton has now taken his manuscript back

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,349
and is looking for another publisher.

76
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,709
And for anyone that thinks that the CCP

77
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,580
getting someone to sue Hamilton or his publisher

78
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,959
would be a little too on the nose, well...

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,599
more information is coming out about

80
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,680
how petty the Party can really be.

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
For example,

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,760
please don’t think that every Chinese Australian

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,060
is an agent for the CCP.

84
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,620
Some of them are standing up to the CCP,

85
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
like John Hughes,

86
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,630
a former city councillor for Parramatta,

87
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,040
a suburb of Sydney.

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,099
John Hughes spoke up for

89
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,930
the Australian Falun Gong community—

90
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,599
a meditation practice severely persecuted

91
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,069
in Mainland China.

92
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,910
That’s earned him some unwelcomed attention

93
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,690
from the Chinese consulate.

94
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,489
In 2014,

95
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,400
he and several other officials were due

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,940
to make a six day trip to China and Taiwan.

97
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,560
When the consulate found out,

98
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
they invited him over for a little chat.

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
You know,

100
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,670
if he wanted to get that visa.

101
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,640
“They went straight onto my close association

102
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,349
or friendly ­association with a local Chinese
community group,

103
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,530
namely Falun Gong.”

104
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,780
He refused the their demands

105
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,069
to stop speaking out about Falun Gong,

106
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,240
but that wasn’t the end of it.

107
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,480
Instead, consulate officials went to the lord-mayor

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,750
and demanded Hughes be removed from the trip.

109
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,370
When the mayor refused,

110
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,950
the consulate tried to make Hughes sign a
statement

111
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,590
promising he would no longer support Falun
Gong,

112
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,930
and specifically that he wouldn’t talk about

113
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,849
how the Chinese regime harvests organs

114
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,379
from Falun Gong practitioners

115
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,129
and other prisoners of conscience.

116
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,129
To his credit,

117
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,540
Hughes stood his ground,

118
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,579
and got a visa for the trip anyway.

119
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,350
Now, the Chinese consulate

120
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,120
tried to bully Hughes back in 2014.

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,810
But we’re only learning about it now

122
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,560
because of the recent reporting on how

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,470
the Chinese regime is influencing Australia.

124
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,990
Now if only someone would write a book about
that.

125
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,669
But the Chinese regime puts out

126
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,550
an absurd amount of pressure globally

127
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,979
to silence any criticism of...

128
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,240
a regime that needs to put out

129
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,160
an absurd amount of global pressure

130
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,370
to silence criticism.

131
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,370
These kinds of stories

132
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,580
are more common than you think.

133
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,690
Earlier this month,

134
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,000
the world’s largest academic book publisher

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,050
Springer Nature—

136
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,300
they put out Scientific American—

137
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,479
also self-censored after getting pressured
by the CCP.

138
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,040
The Financial Times discovered they

139
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,250
“removed more than 1,000 articles,”

140
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,970
from their Chinese website,

141
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,370
because they had politically sensitive keywords

142
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,980
like “Taiwan”, “Tibet” and “Cultural
Revolution”.

143
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,910
In August, Cambridge University Press

144
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,830
did the same thing—

145
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,370
removing sensitive journal articles

146
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,000
at the CCP’s request.

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,580
The Chinese regime is increasingly successful

148
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,160
at bullying the world into silence.

149
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,240
Fortunately,

150
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,930
the Western world still has enough independent
media

151
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,740
to expose the CCP’s influence.

152
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,990
And in the case of Cambridge University Press,

153
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,990
they actually reversed their stance

154
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,070
and re-posted those sensitive articles.

155
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,700
They did it to, you know,

156
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,479
“uphold the principle of academic freedom”.

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,900
Totally not because of the outspoken complaints

158
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,210
from hundreds of academics.

159
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,980
And all the bad publicity.

160
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,100
While the Communist Party rules China,

161
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,220
these kinds of things are probably not going
to stop.

162
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,280
A company, or an organization,

163
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,640
or a city councillor from an Australian suburb,

164
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,509
does something that the CCP doesn’t like.

165
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:06,990
The CCP pressures them,

166
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,460
and they then have to decide whether to

167
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,139
give in to the CCP

168
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,850
or to stand up.

169
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,431
And sometimes it’s helpful to have a huge
crowd

170
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,919
of outraged people to encourage them to stand
up.

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,800
“We as Australians living in a free society

172
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,650
should not allow ourselves to be bullied into
silence

173
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,300
by an autocratic foreign power.”

174
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,830
And speaking of huge crowds of outraged people,

175
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,070
you—our viewers.

176
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,270
Here at China Uncensored,

177
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,110
we also do our best to speak out on behalf
of people

178
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,930
persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party,

179
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,710
and to shed light on all the things the CCP
is doing

180
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,330
that they’d rather people didn’t know
about...

181
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,509
like how they try to infiltrate other countries.

182
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,300
Not a lot of companies want to advertise with
us

183
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,789
for this reason,

184
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,270
which is why we rely mostly on direct support

185
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,500
from viewers like you.

186
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,860
If you want to help China Uncensored

187
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,250
