bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
China s Dino Juice! (aka oil) Hi, welcome

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,370
to China Uncensored. I m Chris Chappell. You
know, big oil is a wonderful thing. No one

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,060
s here to say otherwise. Well, except for
maybe these guys. These are residents in Ningbo

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,300
city, in China s Zhejiang Province. Last month,
they protested against the 8.8 billion dollar

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,911
expansion of already the largest oil refinery
in China, owned by state-run Sinopec. They

6
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:35,370
were concerned about environmental damage.
And there was also the chemical plant that

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,600
was making 500,000 tons of a toxic chemical
paraxylene that can damage the central nervous

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,400
system, liver and kidneys, and can cause cancer
and death. But only if you re exposed to a

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:55,020
lot of it. Liberal hippies. And so the police
hit them with tear gas. I mean come on, when

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,280
have toxic chemicals ever hurt anyone. If
there were any danger, why would companies

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,740
like BP manufacture so much of it?. They care
about the environment. China s state-run Xinhua

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,569
responded saying it was groundless to say
paraxylene can cause cancer, and they do have

13
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:15,729
a point. There aren t a whole lot of studies
about its effects. Which is kind of strange,

14
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:22,280
when you think about it. With all these extremely
wealthy oil companies like BP, Chevron, Sinopec,

15
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,499
making so much of it, you d think they d be
able to fund some studies on what the effects

16
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:32,859
are. But they aren t. Hmph. China is the second
largest oil consumer next to the United States

17
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:38,320
and oil is getting kind of tricky to find,
so besides potentially poisoning its own citizenry,

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,600
Beijing has had to sometimes really bend over
backwards to get oil. Take Syria as an example.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,170
China is Syria s main importer, but just because
there s a little civil war going on, the Western

20
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,759
powers slap sanctions on it, despite China
s attempt to prevent any international intervention.

21
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,789
Fortunately, Iran helped China break the embargo
and provided a boat to ship an estimated $80

22
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,750
million dollars of oil to another of China
s state-owned oil companies. Actually it turns

23
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,450
out that several Chinese oil companies are
giving billions of dollars in assistance to

24
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:17,439
the Syrian regime to expand its crude operations.
As for the citizens of Ningbo, officials said

25
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,340
they d put the construction on hold, so they
re safe for now. At least until the 18th Party

26
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,590
Congress is over this week. That does it for
this episode. Once again, I m Chris Chappell

27
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,590
and this is China Uncensored. Thanks for watching.
