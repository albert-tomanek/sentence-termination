00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:01,859
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,680
China's on a shopping spree

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,220
Down Under!

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,060
G’day Mate!

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,580
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,250
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,700
Now at first glance,

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,299
China and Australia might seem like

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,680
they don’t have all that much in common.

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,760
But really, they have so much.

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,540
Australia is known for its exotic animal life.

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,340
And so is China.

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,700
Australia has dangerous beaches.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,740
And so does China.

15
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,040
Australia’s iconic bear

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,180
isn’t actually a bear.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,469
And neither is China’s.

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,840
What's that, Shelley?

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,850
The giant panda is actually

20
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,589
a bear after all?

21
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,140
Thanks for ruining everything.

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,199
Anyway, with so much other stuff

23
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,350
they have in common,

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,209
it’s unsurprising that both countries

25
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:54,700
have pledged to deepen bilateral relations.

26
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,980
In fact, China is already

27
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:59,360
Australia’s biggest trading partner.

28
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,769
Australian exports of iron ore,

29
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,199
coal, and natural gas

30
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,140
make up a huge part of it.

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,880
So the economy of Australia is deeply tied

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,570
to its relationship with China.

33
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,140
What could go wrong?

34
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,040
I mean, Chinese state media

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,460
says it’s a win-win!

36
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,700
But more and more,

37
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,960
concerns are being raised that,

38
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,250
“The Chinese Communist Party is waging

39
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,649
a covert campaign of influence in Australia—

40
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,740
an aggressive form of “soft power”—

41
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,289
and while loyalists are rewarded,

42
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,819
dissidents live in fear.

43
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,160
Because as you may have noticed

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,539
from watching this show,

45
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,450
the Chinese regime has a long reach.

46
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,180
This is Chen Yonglin.

47
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,540
He was the Chinese Consul for Political Affairs

48
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,119
in Sydney until he defected in 2005.

49
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,159
He said he had knowledge

50
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,280
of more than 1,000 Chinese agents

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,399
operating in Australia.

52
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,109
One of their tasks was kidnapping Chinese
nationals

53
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:53,020
and sending them back to China.

54
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
After he defected,

55
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,540
he said his source inside China warned him

56
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,800
the CCP sent an assassination squad after
him.

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
They failed.

58
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,670
But recently he’s said the number of

59
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,160
agents in Australia has only increased.

60
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,149
How is it the Chinese Communist Party

61
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,840
feels like it can get away with this?

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,010
Money.

63
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,110
The Chinese regime has been gradually buying

64
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,730
influence in Australia.

65
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,730
And today,

66
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,290
I’m just going to focus on politics

67
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,380
but there is so, so much more.

68
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,440
Unlike the US,

69
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,860
Australia has very few

70
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,400
campaign finance restrictions.

71
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,480
For example,

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,870
foreign political donations

73
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,520
are perfectly legal.

74
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,140
I know what you're thinking.

75
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,160
It's like when you're watching a movie,

76
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,960
and the car full of attractive young people,

77
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,900
or, middle-aged Australian politicians,

78
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,180
breaks down in front of a creepy abandoned house.

79
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,180
And you start yelling,

80
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,519
don't go into the house!

81
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,519
And of course,

82
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,160
they go into the house.

83
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,420
This is Australia’s former Transport Minister,

84
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,420
Andrew Robb.

85
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,049
He's a member of the Liberal Party,

86
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,290
which despite its name,

87
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,810
is the equivalent of the Republican Party
in the US

88
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,400
or the Conservative Party in the UK.

89
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,860
Things are different Down Under.

90
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,300
Anyway, Robb was responsible

91
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,690
for a major Free Trade Agreement with China

92
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,400
in 2014.

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,330
The day it was signed,

94
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,430
several influential Chinese businessmen

95
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,680
donated 50 thousand Australian dollars

96
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,360
to his campaign.

97
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
And a few days later,

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
he took an insanely lucrative part time job

99
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,629
as a consultant to a Chinese billionaire,

100
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:26,629
Ye Cheng.

101
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,680
A billionaire who just happens to be a member

102
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,639
of the Chinese government’s main advisory
body.

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,580
This is Australian Labor Party politician,

104
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,580
Eric Roozendaal.

105
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,989
The Labor Party is the major liberal party

106
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,329
in Australia.

107
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,670
In 2013,

108
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,950
he resigned to take an executive job

109
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,950
at a property development company o

110
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,420
wned by a different Chinese billionaire,

111
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,849
Huang Xiangmo—

112
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,160
who also has Chinese government connections.

113
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,820
But how could Roozendaal just resign

114
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,489
and abandon his public duties, you ask?

115
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,130
Don’t worry.

116
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,219
Three weeks later,

117
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,180
Huang Xiangmo’s friend nabbed up

118
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,900
Roozendaal’s vacant council seat.

119
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,900
And hey,

120
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:05,900
you know how the Chinese regime

121
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,319
has been building fake islands

122
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,319
in the South China Sea

123
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,420
and putting weapons on them?

124
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,680
Well it upset a lot of people

125
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,980
in Australia's Labor Party.

126
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,320
But not Senator Sam Dastyari.

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,660
He “told the Chinese media

128
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,531
that Australia shouldn’t interfere

129
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,140
with China’s activities in the South China
Sea.”

130
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,700
And during Senate proceedings in 2014,

131
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,400
Dastyari said this:

132
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,720
“The strong and enduring relationship and friendship

133
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,160
between both the governments

134
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,600
of China and Australia

135
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,540
is something we can, rightly,

136
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,630
be very proud of.”

137
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,600
Yes, I bet he’s very proud

138
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,250
of the 5,000 Australian dollar contribution

139
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,420
he got from Chinese billionaire,

140
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,780
Huang Xiangmo.

141
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,410
I assume he’s also proud

142
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,290
of the sixteen hundred dollars he received

143
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,070
from another Chinese businessman

144
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,700
with links to the Chinese government.

145
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,070
Again, this is perfectly legal

146
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,360
under Australian law.

147
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,920
Though it is perhaps a bit

148
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,830
“outside voter expectations.”

149
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,570
So this seems concerning, you say,

150
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,890
but the donations don't seem to be

151
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,220
that large.

152
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,700
Maybe the house isn't haunted after all.

153
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,580
Well, a six-month joint investigation

154
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,300
by Australian media companies,

155
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,250
Fairfax Media and Four Corners,

156
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,000
found that in four years,

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,980
Huang Xiaomo gave almost 2.7 million dollars

158
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,980
to the three biggest Australian political
parties.

159
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,630
And yet another Chinese billionaire,

160
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,980
who has possible connections

161
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,870
to the Chinese Communist Party,

162
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,880
donated 4.1 million dollars

163
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,810
over 10 years.

164
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,300
So yeah,

165
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
the house is pretty haunted.

166
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,680
But I’m not done.

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,900
This is Bob Carr,

168
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,960
former Minister of Foreign Affairs.

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,650
He stepped down from office in 2013,

170
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,990
and the next year founded a think tank

171
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,080
with the help of a $1.8 million donation

172
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,000
from our billionaire friend,

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,150
Huang Xiangmo.

174
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,260
What’s wrong with starting a think tank?

175
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,480
Well, it’s that has been accused

176
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,440
of operating as a China propaganda arm.

177
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,840
Which is ridiculous.

178
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,150
He’s just trying to help Australians

179
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,420
get a better understanding of China.

180
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
Especially the media.

181
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,330
“Recently six journalists were brought to
Beijing

182
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,720
by former foreign minister Bob Carr,

183
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,230
on a trip sponsored by the Communist Party’s

184
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,140
All China Journalist Association.”

185
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,160
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party

186
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,660
is also buying influence in Australian media.

187
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,940
But that’s a whole other topic.

188
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,040
The good thing is,

189
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,290
they haven't bought influence

190
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,780
in all Australian media.

191
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,330
Now you may be wondering,

192
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,760
while this was happening,

193
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,490
did anyone notice?

194
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,470
Was no one telling these politicians

195
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,120
to get out of the haunted house?

196
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Well back in May,

197
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,300
the head of the Australian Security Intelligence
Organisation,

198
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,330
or ASIO,

199
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,530
which is Australia’s equivalent

200
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,890
of the Department of Homeland Security,

201
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,170
warned that foreign interference in Australia

202
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,630
was increasing on

203
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,080
"an unprecedented scale".

204
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,620
And then the media investigation I mentioned earlier

205
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,580
uncovered that ASIO had explicitly warned

206
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,900
the political parties that taking money

207
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,420
from these Chinese billionaires

208
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,990
was an issue, back in 2015.

209
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,020
And then after the warning,

210
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,460
the political parties

211
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,460
kept on taking money

212
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,690
from Chinese billionaires.

213
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,880
So ASIO was screaming at the politicians

214
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,280
to leave the house,

215
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,640
and they decided to stay instead.

216
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,160
Which is not going well for them.

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,200
But the good news is,

218
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,540
in the light of this political donation scandal,

219
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,160
the Australian government is considering

220
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,860
reforming their foreign interference laws.

221
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,620
Maybe they can stop other people

222
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,590
from going in the house.

223
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,120
So what do you think of the Chinese Communist

224
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,120
Party’s

225
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,570
influence on Australian politics?
