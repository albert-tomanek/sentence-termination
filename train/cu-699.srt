00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,280
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,280
Call all you want,

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,839
but there’s no one home.

4
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,710
And you’re not gonna reach my thousand dollar
iPhone.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,930
Speaking of, not using your phone?

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,780
Then its reeducation camp for you!

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,780
And finally,

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,810
China comes up with a great way

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,740
to make money off saving the environment.

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,740
This is China Uncensored.

11
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,720
Hi.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,380
Welcome to China Uncensored.

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,210
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,539
Breaking news, everyone:

15
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,470
The CCP may be spying on people.

16
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,040
We recently aired a 10-minute segment

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,910
focused exclusively on how the WeChat app

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,010
has helped the CCP monitor Chinese citizens

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,380
by collecting data on every aspect of their
lives—

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,380
like where they travel,

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,380
who their friends are,

22
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,719
the content of their messages,

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,780
even what food they like—

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,559
and then sharing that WeChat data

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,649
with the Chinese government.

26
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:53,760
Well it turns out,

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,930
there’s an even better way

28
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,330
to monitor everyone’s phones.

29
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,330
It was recently revealed that

30
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,989
Trojan horse malware called xRAT

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,280
was going around WeChat

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,030
and another Chinese messaging app

33
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,049
owned by the same company

34
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,580
during the 2014 Hong Kong Umbrella Movement.

35
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,190
It basically allows the perpetrator

36
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,979
full admin access to your phone.

37
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:14,979
In other words,

38
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:17,060
it’s like if you handed your phone to a
stranger

39
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,119
and told them all your passwords.

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,210
“All of your phone is exposed.

41
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,550
Photos stored, downloads, documents,

42
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,780
any Apps to other services installed,

43
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,560
chat logs, phone records,

44
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,090
contact lists, and of course,

45
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,120
your browser and its entire browsing history,

46
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,600
which may include credit card

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,570
and password and login information.”

48
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,630
But before you jump to blame the CCP,

49
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,880
there’s no evidence that this app

50
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
was created or spread by the CCP.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,630
It might just be a coincidence that xRAT

52
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,100
happened to target Chinese dissidents,

53
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,340
and was found on the mobile phones

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,160
of a lot of pro-democracy protesters

55
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,689
in Hong Kong.

56
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:54,689
Just like it’s a coincidence

57
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,000
that Bruce Wayne and Batman

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,250
are never seen in the same room

59
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,280
at the same time.

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,610
Speaking of monitoring people,

61
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,380
WeChat users are freaking out about

62
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,710
a new law that will go into effect this October.

63
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,629
It makes, “creators of online groups responsible

64
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,919
for managing information within their forums

65
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,430
and the behavior of members.”

66
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,159
Not just “responsible.”

67
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,620
The creators of those chat groups

68
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,269
could be criminally liable

69
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,620
and face both administrative detention

70
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,090
and political consequences

71
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,090
if their group members

72
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,069
discuss one of nine prohibited topics.

73
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,260
Topics include:

74
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,730
news from Hong Kong or Macau

75
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,419
that has not been officially reported

76
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,480
by Chinese state-run media.

77
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
So for example,

78
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,260
if you create a WeChat group,

79
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,470
and someone in your chat group

80
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,370
that you don’t even know

81
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,939
pastes a direct quote from a Hong Kong newspaper,

82
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,379
you could go to jail.

83
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,180
And if you’ve ever been on the Internet,

84
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,389
you know you don’t want to be responsible

85
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:50,950
for the crazy stuff other people say online.

86
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,199
I mean, what if I were responsible

87
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,269
for all the stuff people say in the comments

88
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,659
to our YouTube videos?”

89
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,180
Um...Shelley?

90
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,239
The CCP can’t see our comments section,
right?

91
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,080
’Cause YouTube is blocked in China?

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,709
Anyway, chat groups scare the Chinese regime

93
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,749
because they’re a way for a lot of people

94
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,620
to share information, organize,

95
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,560
and mobilize if they ever felt so inclined.

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,239
Oh, and did you know that

97
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,499
if you say something bad online,

98
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,000
the Chinese government can lower your credit
score?

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,079
There is a silver lining to this though.

100
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,540
It probably won’t be happening

101
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,900
to the latest iPhone model sold in China.

102
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,879
Not because it’s more secure in any way.

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,879
No.

104
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,190
It’s because Chinese people may not buy
it.

105
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,190
“With the iPhone 8 set to sell at a higher
price,

106
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,190
Chinese shoppers may skip this year’s model.

107
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,470
Lots of supply chain experts expect that

108
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,019
this phone to be over a thousand dollars,

109
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,549
and that’s double the average Chinese salary.”

110
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,299
If true, this would be a big blow to Apple.

111
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,629
I mean, the whole reason

112
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,439
Apple has been bowing to Chinese censorship
demands

113
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,849
is so they can keep selling iPhones in China!

114
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:53,849
But frankly,

115
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:54,959
I don’t think the high price tag

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
will stop sales.

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
People are going still going to buy iPhones.

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Not everyone.

119
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,120
I mean, nearly a billion people in China

120
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,150
live on less than $10 a day.

121
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,150
But fortunately,

122
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,099
China also has a huge wealth gap,

123
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,719
so there’s lots of rich people, too!

124
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,019
And how will their friends know they’re
rich

125
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,340
if they don’t have the latest gold iPhone?

126
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,609
But with the thousand-dollar price tag,

127
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:22,190
even the wealthy may have to make sacrifices.

128
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,560
Like the son-of-a-billionaire

129
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,470
who bought eight iPhone 7s for his dog last
year.

130
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,720
Well he’s going to have to cut back

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,020
for the iPhone 8.

132
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
But really,

133
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,020
what kind of dog needs

134
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,159
more than four iPhones?

135
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,159
Speaking of phones,

136
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,460
I told you a couple months ago

137
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,949
about how the Communist Party

138
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,080
is forcing people in the Xinjiang region

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,270
to install surveillance apps

140
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,220
on their mobile phones.

141
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,500
Well a lot of people have been resisting.

142
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,250
So what can the poor CCP do?

143
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,620
The answer is,

144
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,620
send them to reeducation camps!

145
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,819
They’ve sent about 2,000 people so far.

146
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,379
At first the reeducation camps were branded
as

147
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,840
“Counter-Extremism Training Schools”

148
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,000
because they were for Muslims.

149
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
After all,

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,669
you’ve got to counter that extreme behavior,

151
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,710
like feeling uncomfortable being monitored

152
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,789
at all times.

153
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,759
So the CCP imprisoned people

154
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,770
and cut off their contact with their families.

155
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,509
It’s only logical that when you round people
up,

156
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,479
isolate them, and abuse them,

157
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,819
they become less extreme.

158
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,460
But the name “Counter-Extremism Training
Schools”

159
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,840
didn’t sound so good.

160
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,139
So the CCP re-branded these camps as

161
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,100
“Socialism Training Schools.”

162
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,990
Hmm...still kind of suspicious.

163
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,650
But then they re-re-branded them as

164
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,139
“Professional Education Schools.”

165
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,199
Who could be opposed to that?

166
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,629
It’s like the Auschwitz School for Manual
Labor and Chemical Engineering.

167
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:44,629
What?

168
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,349
Too soon?

169
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,590
Now it’s hard to find a place

170
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,199
as terrible as the Auschwitz School.

171
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,500
But there are lots of places

172
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,069
I wouldn’t want to be stuck in

173
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,919
even for one night.

174
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,410
Like the 2017 Alibaba Annual Party.

175
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,810
When your boss is the richest man in China,

176
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,319
you put up with some eccentricities.

177
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,389
It’s what you do.

178
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:06,669
Well at this year’s event,

179
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,749
a mysterious masked figure appeared.

180
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,069
Kind of dressed like Michael Jackson.

181
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,240
And kind of dancing like Michael Jackson.

182
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,879
Who could it be?!

183
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,939
Jack Ma.

184
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,229
It was the Alibaba CEO.

185
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,069
Then, all the other slightly out of shape
bosses

186
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,849
joined him on stage for...

187
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,129
an even lamer dance.

188
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,500
This wasn’t really a first for Ma.

189
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,719
In the past he’s appeared on stage as a
princess!

190
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,530
And, well there’s a lot to process here.

191
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,719
At least Alibaba events aren’t boring.

192
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:41,360
Unlike that two-hour long iPhone announcement.

193
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,499
I mean, I don’t even know who this guy is!

194
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,570
And speaking of billionaires

195
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,249
who do things in an unusual way,

196
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:49,249
Donald Trump.

197
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,120
rump is likely to make his first

198
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,069
presidential trip to China in November,

199
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,650
according to a US official.

200
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,370
Trump will be in Asia anyway,

201
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,439
to attend acronym-based summits

202
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,129
like ASEAN, APEC and EAS.

203
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,440
So it would be rude if he didn’t drop by
China

204
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,310
and check out Xi Jinping’s cool digs.

205
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,349
Maybe he can also check out

206
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:11,539
that flattering Trump statue in Taiyuan.

207
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,319
Hopefully Trump won’t stay long, though,

208
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,759
because a new study claims

209
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,000
the pollution in China is so bad,

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,039
it’ll take three and a half years off your
life.

211
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,150
Chinese premier Li Keqiang

212
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,860
has promised a war on pollution.

213
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,120
So I guess casualties are to be expected.

214
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,020
Now, China is looking into a plan

215
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,830
to ban gasoline and diesel cars.

216
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,449
It’s unclear when the ban would go into
effect,

217
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,449
but I agree,

218
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,789
it’s a great idea.

219
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,449
Switching to electric vehicles

220
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,710
will make big difference

221
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,180
in reducing pollution.

222
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,979
Now, cars can run on clean electricity...

223
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,139
from China’s growing number of coal-fired
power plants.

224
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,190
Speaking of pollution,

225
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,330
China is cleaning up the countryside.

226
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,009
And the latest project:

227
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:56,979
Cleaning up 300 tons of dead pigs

228
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,699
that had been buried in a hillside,

229
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,289
rotting away for four years.

230
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:02,349
It turns out they were dumped there

231
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,680
by a medical waste treatment company.

232
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,430
Tragically, the manager responsible

233
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,779
probably won’t be indicted for this—

234
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,840
since apparently he’s already in prison

235
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
for a separate,

236
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,639
unrelated crime.

237
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,639
Speaking of tragedy,

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
the price of Tungsten has doubled, thanks
to China.

239
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,030
Tungsten is used as filament

240
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,650
in old fashioned lightbulbs,

241
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,650
also known as...

242
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,509
regular light bulbs.

243
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,779
Tungsten is a hard metal

244
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:29,129
that’s also used to strengthen industrial
tools.

245
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,020
Tungsten is hard on the environment, too.

246
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,870
That’s the reason China gave

247
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,949
for putting a quota on the output of Tungsten.

248
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,899
Technically, China already had a quota,

249
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,039
but in June they announced that this time,

250
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,039
they’re going to be enforcing that quota,

251
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,600
for realsies.

252
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,639
This was a smart move by China,

253
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,970
because China mines 80% of the world’s Tungsten,

254
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,170
and the restrictions have made the price of
Tungsten

255
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,830
double in the last three months.

256
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,950
Of course, this move is all about

257
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,589
protecting the environment.

258
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,270
Those mines are so polluting,

259
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,810
they just had to be shut down.

260
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,720
Cha-ching!

261
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,500
China has us by the precious metals.

262
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,630
And coming up after the break,

263
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,680
we’ll take a look at a fair and open trial
in China.

264
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,520
I know.

265
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,040
You’re upset about the price of tungsten.

266
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,160
But if you want to really light up your day,

267
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,570
go to ChinaUncensored.tv.

268
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,150

And that’s more precious than gold.

271
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,510
Or tungsten.

272
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,050
