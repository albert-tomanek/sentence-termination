00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,340
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,009
all aboard the Chinese train line in Kenya

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,880
everyone loves!

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,700
Uh...almost everyone.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,060
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,890
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,890
Well folks,

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,000
great news!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
China has built

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,300
a new railroad line in Kenya!

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,400
Hooray! Fireworks!

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,660
It’s a freight and passenger line

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,340
that connects Kenya’s capital Nairobi

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,280
to the coastal port of Mombasa.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,660
It’s called the Standard Gauge Railway,

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
also known as the Madaraka Express.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,460
With a top speed of 75 miles per hour,

18
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,120
it’s not exactly a high-speed rail,

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,780
but it is three times faster

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,260
than old British train line it’s replacing,

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,540
which was finished in 1901.

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,090
The one nicknamed the “Lunatic Express”

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,670
because of the huge costs

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,400
and the thousands of people

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
who died constructing it,

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,430
including being eaten by lions.

27
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,489
It was also subject to

28
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,500
constant delays and breakdowns.

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,060
But it did profusely apologize for each delay.

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,079
"Oh dear.

31
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,520
Terribly, terribly sorry.

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,200
My apologies.

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,490
Does anybody fancy a spot of tea?"

34
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,700
My apologies.

35
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,810
Anyway, this new Madaraka Express

36
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,880
is supposed to speed up travel,

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,499
reduce transportation costs,

38
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,939
and transform Kenya

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,340
into an economic powerhouse.

40
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,020
The rail was built by China Road and Bridge
Corporation,

41
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,329
a Chinese state-owned company.

42
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,579
Which explains the awkward slogan,

43
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,060
“Connecting Nations,

44
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,060
Prospering People.”

45
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,060
Yes,

46
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,380
may you live long and prospering, people.

47
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,859
The train line is part of China’s

48
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:47,130
“One Belt, One Road” Initiative.

49
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,179
In a nutshell:

50
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:49,760
One Belt, One Road is China’s plan

51
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,020
for global domination.

52
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,439
It involves building huge infrastructure projects

53
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,709
around the world—

54
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,979
like seaports, train lines, and bridges.

55
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,860
They’re supposed to help with trade,

56
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,500
which, in China’s view,

57
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,569
means extracting raw materials

58
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,569
from poor countries

59
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,810
at low prices,

60
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,849
and selling finished made-in-China goods

61
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:08,849
back to them.

62
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:11,970
Oh, and putting everyone in debt to China.

63
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,420
Kind of like colonialism,

64
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,739
but with less guns.

65
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,129
So the Chinese regime

66
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,379
has big plans for Kenya.

67
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,379
The new Madaraka Express

68
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,769
created thousands of jobs in Kenya.

69
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,340
Let’s check in with the locals

70
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,440
and see how happy they are.

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,200
“The youth stormed the Chinese rail camp
site,

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,500
attacking and driving away workers indiscriminately.”

73
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,190
So, pretty happy.

74
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,659
That footage was from a riot last August.

75
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,500
You see, the railway did create

76
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,329
thousands of new jobs.

77
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,849
But not for Kenyan locals.

78
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:44,849
According to Quartz,

79
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:45,920
“One of the biggest gripes

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,069
is that Chinese companies in Kenya

81
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:50,409
import \htheir own labor.”

82
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,540
So a lot of jobs just go to Chinese workers.

83
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,230
As for the Kenyans who do get work,

84
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,099
well, those protests happened

85
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,209
because workers wanted a raise—

86
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,930
from two dollars fifty cents

87
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,560
to five dollars...

88
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,989
a day.

89
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,060
People who asked for a raise

90
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,299
were allegedly fired.

91
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,390
But paying low wages

92
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,780
is not the biggest problem.

93
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,430
Since China Road and Bridge Corporation

94
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,939
began construction of the railway

95
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,090
a few years ago,

96
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,090
it’s been accused of firing workers

97
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,329
without cause,

98
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,140
dredging sand from Kenyan beaches

99
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,989
for construction material,

100
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,470
and even stealing water

101
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,690
from local communities.

102
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,360
To be fair though,

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,900
they have organized basketball games

104
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,030
for local employees,

105
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,090
a point they're very proud of.

106
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,650
Why, just look at all of these proud Kenyans!

107
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,459
And China Road and Bridge Corporation’s

108
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,459
treatment of workers

109
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,590
is not an isolated incident.

110
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,810
This article by the Open Society Initiative
for Southern Africa

111
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,680
talks about the horrible conditions

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
in Chinese-owned firms across Africa.

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,730
One Chinese mine had to be

114
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,120
“closed down five times,

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,389
largely because of non-conformity

116
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,859
to mine safety rules and poor sanitation.”

117
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:00,349
There was “an outbreak of cholera.”

118
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,080
And at one construction company,

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,719
“Almost all workers lacked

120
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,330
individual protection items

121
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,430
such as helmets, boots, and gloves.”

122
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,219
But back to the rail line in Kenya.

123
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,360
It cost 3.2 billion dollars to build,

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,989
and there are more rail line extensions

125
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,640
with even bigger price tags

126
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,080
in the works.

127
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,310
But the Kenyan government is only paying

128
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,020
for 10 percent of it in cash.

129
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,230
The other 90 percent is financed

130
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,210
with a loan from China’s Export‑Import
Bank.

131
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,320
Basically, it buries Kenya in debt.

132
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,280
According to the South China Morning Post,

133
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
“Kenya’s external debt now amounts to

134
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,250
seven times its annual budget,

135
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,810
with China accounting for nearly

136
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,560
60 per cent of those loans.

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
Loans from China have grown by 54%

138
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,190
between 2010 and 2014.”

139
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,270
And as this Kenyan commentator points out,

140
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,810
“That’s our tax money.

141
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,810
These are loans

142
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,620
that our children will pay.”

143
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,750
Oh, and there are concerns about corruption.

144
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,010
Now I’m no expert in how much

145
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,620
large scale railway projects cost.

146
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,910
The most I ever owned

147
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,180
was Reading Railroad and B. & O.

148
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,840
One day, Short Line,

149
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,370
you will be mine!

150
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,720
But this railway in Kenya

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,630
is apparently way more expensive

152
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,490
than it should have been.

153
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,180
Al Jazeera reports that

154
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,400
‘‘Kenya’s railway costs [per kilometre]

155
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,550
are almost 40 to 50 percent higher’

156
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,290
than some of Kenya’s neighbouring countries.”

157
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,290
To be fair,

158
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,290
part of the higher costs

159
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,290
are related to technology,

160
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,420
but that doesn't account for all of

161
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,210
the large price tag.

162
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,860
Where did the rest of the money go?

163
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,800
There are also environmental concerns

164
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,500
that many critics feel weren’t addressed.

165
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Phase two of the railway

166
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,960
will cut right through an important national
park.

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,040
And some are concerned construction was rushed

168
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,260
so that the current president

169
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,950
could have his flagship project completed

170
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,920
just in time for elections in August.

171
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,420
So all aboard the Madaraka Express!

172
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,110
The price is just decades of debt

173
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,550
to a new colonial power.

174
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,600
So what do you think about this stunning example

175
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,100
of the One Belt, One Road Initiative?

176
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,560
Leave your comments below.

177
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,630
Thanks for watching his episode

178
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,630
of China Uncensored.

179
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,250
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

180
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,260
See you next time.

181
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
Good news, everyone!

182
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,930
Today we’re launching the China Uncensored

183
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,610
Mystery Crate!

an assortment of items related to topics

187
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,480
we've talked about on the show,

188
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,420
personally curated by me!

189
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,200
Let’s see what’s in this month’s box.

190
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Oh, a bottle of China’s sacred territorial waters.

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,740
A facemask designed to protect against Beijing smog.

192
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,050
A slightly used suicide net from Shenzhen—

193
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,860
don’t ask.

194
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,860
A handwritten note...

195
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,500
"Help, I'm stuck in a Chinese labor camp

196
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,360
making cardboard boxes."

197
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,620
Hmm, wonder how that got in there.

198
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,970
And finally,

199
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,420
powdered rhino horn

200
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,780
from the extremely rare silverback rhino,

201
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,450
the last of which was killed to make

202
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,420
this potent male vitality powder.

203
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,640
What’s that Shelley?

204
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,000
Ok, the powdered rhino horn

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,100
is extremely illegal.

206
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,740
The box was made by Chinese slave labor.

207
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,210
And no one wants a used suicide net.

208
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,820
What do you mean,

209
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,620
I'm terrible at picking things to go in boxes?

210
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,580
Fine.

211
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,320
You know what?

212
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,860
It's time for Plan B.

213
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,000
I’m going to leave this mystery box stuff

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,310
to the professionals,

215
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,050
by partnering with Loot Crate!

216
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,930
It is also a monthly mystery box,

217
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,530
but it will contain actually cool

218
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,980
and totally legal stuff like collectibles,

219
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,960
apparel, gadgets, art,

220
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
and epic gear.

221
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,360
It’s basically Comic-Con in a box.

222
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,250
And they’ve agreed to give China Uncensored fans

223
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,720
a 10% discount.

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280

227
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,290
And I'll throw in some powdered rhino horn.

228
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,990
Just kidding.

229
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,780
Because that would be illegal.
