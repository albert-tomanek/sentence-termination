1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,380
Can China Outlast Trump?

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,189
Amnesty International gets Chinese pushback...

3
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:07,930
in New York!

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,670
And the worst boy band ever.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,960
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,800
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,810
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,740
Months of trade negotiations with China have
failed.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,610
And are you really surprised?

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,830
Now the Trump administration is preparing
25% tariffs

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,199
on an additional 300 billion dollars worth
of Chinese goods.

12
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,170
Obviously the Chinese Communist Party is not
happy about the tariffs.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,719
Chinese leader Xi Jinping called them foolish.

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,970
No, “foolish” is the Chinese Communist
Party censoring the letter N,

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,010
believing that will somehow stop people from
criticizing Xi Jinping.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,339
Side note, it didn’t work.

17
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,499
Anyway, with respect to the tariffs,

18
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:56,309
state-run People’s Daily released this snappy
graphic

19
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,639
on its official WeChat account.

20
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,589
It says “Negotiate, sure!”

21
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,219
“Fight, anytime!”

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,750
“Bully us, wishful thinking!”

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,939
So the Chinese Communist Party is obviously
upset.

24
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,140
But I doubt surprised.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,420
The Trump administration was demanding reforms

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,460
that the authoritarian regime is simply unwilling
to make.

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,829
That could be why the Chinese regime blew
up the trade deal.

28
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,880
According to Reuters,

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,460
“In each of the seven chapters of the draft
trade deal,

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,050
China had deleted its commitments to change
laws

31
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,740
to resolve core complaints

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,009
that caused the United States to launch a
trade war:

33
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,000
Theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade
secrets;

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,829
forced technology transfers;

35
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:37,930
competition policy;

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,890
access to financial services;

37
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,619
and currency manipulation.”

38
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,230
Maybe they expected the US government

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,090
to back down and sign the deal anyway.

40
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,200
But that’s not what happened.

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,219
So what impact will this have on China?

42
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,270
Well, the Chinese regime has kept their economy
afloat

43
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,370
no matter what disasters they’ve faced so
far—

44
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,640
bad debt, corruption,

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,700
a housing bubble, you name it.

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,030
They’re really good at finding short term
solutions.

47
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,030
In this case,

48
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,369
there’s the “hundreds of billions of dollars

49
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,730
that Beijing has pumped into the country’s
economy in recent months,

50
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,100
as well as the loans that officials have pressed

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,190
state-run banks to make to businesses.”

52
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,640
My guess is that the Chinese regime

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,600
is trying to hang on till the 2020 elections,

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,550
in the hopes that Trump will be replaced with

55
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,080
someone a lot softer on China.

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,890
And when it comes to election interference,

57
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,880
they’ve already been racking up experience
points.

58
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,350
But if the Chinese regime thinks it’ll get
easier for them

59
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,770
as long as a Democrat wins in 2020,

60
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,460
they should think again.

61
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,260
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,380
tweeted that Trump should “hang tough on
China.”

63
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,910
And most of the current Democrats running
for president

64
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,540
are now also hangin’ tough on China.

65
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,980
And while former Vice President Joe Biden
recently said

66
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,240
he didn’t see China as a competitor,

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,680
he was criticized by Bernie Sanders—

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,420
yes, Bernie Sanders.

69
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,100
I can’t wait for those two to debate.

70
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,950
Two Canadian citizens in China

71
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,800
have been charged with spying:

72
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,010
Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

73
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,520
Chinese authorities arrested them both in
December.

74
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,450
That was after Canada arrested

75
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,460
Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou

76
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,520
for extradition to the US—

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,030
and the Canadian government refused

78
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,960
to simply let her go arbitrarily.

79
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,640
But don’t worry,

80
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,910
the Chinese charges against the two Canadians

81
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,020
are not arbitrary.

82
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,150
They’re definitely guilty...

83
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,630
of being Canadians in the wrong place at the
wrong time.

84
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,590
Amnesty International has spent years

85
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,070
criticizing the Chinese Communist Party.

86
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,880
But Chinese backed companies have spent years

87
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,650
buying up real estate in New York.

88
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,330
So guess who’s winning?

89
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,390
Amnesty International just had their lease
denied by China.

90
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,330
They were trying to move their New York Headquarters

91
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,560
to a building in lower Manhattan called Wall
Street Plaza.

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,030
“But just as the organization was about
to sign a lease last week,

93
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,190
the building’s owner said that its new parent
company,

94
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,810
a giant shipping conglomerate owned by the
Chinese government,

95
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,650
decided to veto the offer.”

96
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,210
Such a troll move.

97
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,130
Which is why I’m giving this a rating of
four Pepe the Poohs.

98
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,130
Huawei.

99
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,130
The Chinese telecom company

100
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,510
the US says is a national security threat,

101
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,350
and probably receives funding from the Chinese
military.

102
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,190
A lot of countries have banned Huawei

103
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,720
from building sensitive tech infrastructure.

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,760
But not the UK.

105
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Why not?

106
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Aren’t they concerned?

107
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Of course not!

108
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,940
Because Huawei has told them they’re ready
to sign

109
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,530
a “no spy, no back door” contract.

110
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,860
I mean when was the last time

111
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,730
you heard Verizon give that guarantee?

112
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,610
The Huawei chief said,

113
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,130
“We are willing to sign ‘no-spy’ agreements
with governments,

114
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,000
including the UK government, to commit ourselves,

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,820
to commit our equipment to meeting the no-spy,

116
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,880
no back-door standards.”

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,450
Now believe it or not, there are still some
people

118
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,440
who are not satisfied with a “no spy agreement”

119
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,340
and still consider Huawei a threat.

120
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,600
I mean, there’s just no pleasing some people.

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,990
Speaking of not pleasing people —

122
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,740
Google.

123
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,250
Last year, The Intercept revealed

124
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,950
a secret project Google was working on

125
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,930
to create a censored search app for China.

126
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,070
Google spent a long time denying its existence.

127
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,860
Well, in an interview with the BBC,

128
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,830
former Google CEO Eric Schmidt,

129
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,840
defended the censored app that Google

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,080
had to eventually admit really existed.

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,720
It would have “many benefits”

132
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,340
and would “help change China to be more
open.”

133
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,870
Which is obviously why Google

134
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,400
spent so much time lying about its existence

135
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,900
and not even telling most of their employees

136
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,310
what they were actually working on.

137
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,700
Sounds like something to be proud of.

138
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,810
Unlike Google,

139
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,930
Wikipedia was unwilling to censor their website
in China.

140
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,870
Which is why the Chinese language Wikipedia

141
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,120
has been blocked in China since 2015.

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,860
Well, Now it’s been totally banned in all
languages.

143
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,200
Oh no.

144
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,230
Now Chinese trolls will have to use a VPN

145
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,040
to alter Wikipedia’s controversial China
content

146
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,710
for the rest of the world.

147
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,240
Now sure, Chinese internet censorship

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,820
and surveillance seem bad.

149
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,400
But on the plus side,

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,290
they’re giving us the latest greatest boy
band experience!

151
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,560
China Youth Credit Management is a group

152
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,870
working with the Communist Youth League.

153
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,500
They’ve recently designed an app

154
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,669
to incentivize “positive action”

155
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,860
by putting its users under constant surveillance.

156
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,540
But just in case this amazing-sounding app

157
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,440
doesn’t sell itself,

158
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,510
China Youth Credit Management

159
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,120
has created a music video to promote it.

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,950
It features China’s popular boy band TFBoys

161
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,540
and some other celebrities.

162
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,660
I love how clean cut and obedient they all
look!

163
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,889
I bet they all get good grades,

164
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,919
return library books on time,

165
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,770
and stay away from subversive content on the
Internet.

166
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,330
But this is great news for TFBoys.

167
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,060
Everyone knows you’re not a real boy band

168
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,480
until you make a propaganda music video.

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,650
Just like NSYNC’s famous Bye Bye Bye music
video

170
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,860
extolling the virtues of being puppets of
American imperialism.

171
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,970
And finally, a man in China has been arrested

172
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,330
for giving dogs illegal names.

173
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,710
Apparently he named his dogs after two common
job titles:

174
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,400
Chengguan and Xieguan.

175
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,150
“‘Chengguan’ are officials employed
in urban areas

176
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,790
to tackle low-level crime,

177
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,120
while ‘Xieguan’ are informal community
workers

178
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,380
such as traffic assistants.”

179
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,930
Local law enforcement,

180
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,950
and I use that term loosely in regards to
China,

181
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,500
said the man “caused great harm to the nation

182
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,790
and the city’s urban management,

183
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,440
in terms of their feelings.”

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
And hurting the feelings of law enforcement
is not very nice.

185
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,830
So they threw the guy in jail for 10 days.

186
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,480
That’ll teach him to respect the rule of
law!

187
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,810
And now it’s time for me to answer

188
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,169
a question from one of you—

189
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,850
a fan who support China Uncensored

190
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,740
with a dollar or more per episode,

191
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,140
by contributing through Patreon.

192
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,229
Today’s question comes from:

193
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,770
Uhhhhh, David Schwimmerer’s Russian twin:

194
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,340
“Chris, what is your favorite type of computer
password,

195
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,760
is it like a phrase about something absurd

196
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,960
and funny relating to the CCP,

197
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,110
making it hilarious for everyone as they watch
you?”

198
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,210
Great question!

199
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,210
My password is

200
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,419
“Winnie the Pooh Free Tibet Pro Taiwan Tiananmen
1989”.

201
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,000
Not only is it basically uncrackable,

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,410
it makes me laugh everytime I type it haha.

203
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,440
Cyber security is important.

204
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Thanks for your question.

205
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,090
And thanks to everyone watching!

206
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,750
We could not make this show without your support.

207
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,699
Whether it’s supporting us through patreon

208
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,280
or just watching and sharing the show

209
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
with your friends and family.

210
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
So thank you from me

211
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,860
and everyone on the China Uncensored team.

212
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,100
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

213
