00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,960
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,860
anti-China protests in Vietnam explode into
street violence.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,340
Hi.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,340
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,140
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,060
Anti-China protests broke out in Vietnam this
past weekend.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,250
People charged through barricades.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,860
Riot police showed up in full force.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,980
People threw stuff at the police.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
The police charged at people.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,860
And dragged some of them away.

12
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,210
Let’s just say, there were reports of police
brutality.

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,370
A citizen journalist posted this video, with
the caption

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,329
“Protesters are being killed

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,329
by the Vietnamese communist government.”

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,600
And at least one kid was so upset by the whole
thing

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,820
that he couldn’t hold back his tears.

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,239
I think he’s crying because so many people

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,200
were shooting vertical video.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,210
Hold your phone horizontally, people!

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,450
Horizontally!

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,620
Now viral social media moments aside,

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,040
protests in Vietnam are actually fairly common.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,670
It’s a communist regime, and that typically
means

25
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,780
no shortage of reasons for people to get upset.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,020
And since Facebook is popular in Vietnam,

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,560
a lot of people there are organizing protests
using Facebook,

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
and uploading their vertical videos by the
thousands.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,990
Anyway, we’re talking about these particular
protests

30
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,700
because they were fueled mainly by anti-China
sentiment.

31
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,340
The Vietnamese government wants to pass a
law creating

32
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,780
Special Economic Zones.

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,729
These are places where foreign companies

34
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,610
get special incentives

35
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,700
and fewer restrictions to set up factories—

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,960
factories the size of small cities.

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,880
A bit like the infamous Foxconn factory in
China,

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,760
where workers were so happy they were jumping
for joy.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,300
Out of windows.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,310
Which is why the company had to install suicide
nets.

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,979
But it wasn’t bad working conditions

42
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,270
Vietnamese protesters are worried about.

43
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,140
They’re worried that the Vietnamese government’s
Special Economic Zones

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,320
will be dominated by Chinese companies—

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,140
giving the Chinese regime too much power and
influence.

46
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,590
One of the specific things was the idea that
Chinese companies

47
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,650
could lease land in these zones for up to
99 years.

48
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,859
I mean, it’s not like that’s ever happened
before, right?

49
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:21,939
Right.

50
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:25,069
But with anti-China sentiment running high
in Vietnam,

51
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,400
it didn’t take much for violence to erupt.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,689
Even though most protesters were peaceful,

53
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,519
all it takes is a few bad eggs.

54
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,629
And a small pile of rocks.

55
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,999
People in Vietnam are already angry with China

56
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,739
over South China Sea disputes.

57
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,309
Vietnam has a long-standing claim that’s
being

58
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:47,019
aggressively challenged by the Chinese Communist
Party.

59
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,669
The Chinese military has built artificial
islands on outcrops,

60
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,980
and then turned islands into weaponized fortresses.

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,870
And they spray Vietnamese ships with water
cannons

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,010
when they get too close.

63
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,579
So it’s little wonder that anti-China sentiment

64
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,650
is running high in Vietnam.

65
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,430
And when you’re angry at the actions of
the Chinese regime,

66
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,969
it’s easy for that idea to bleed into being
angry

67
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:13,069
at China as a country,

68
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,480
and even at Chinese people.

69
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,620
This protest banner says

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,819
“No leasing land to China even for one day.”

71
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,849
The Chinese embassy even issued a warning

72
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:26,459
to Chinese citizens in Vietnam to be careful.

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,120
And in a statement that doesn’t at all make
it appear

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,859
that China is interfering in

75
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,999
the internal affairs of another country,

76
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,959
the embassy blasted the protests

77
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,589
for having “anti-China content”

78
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:38,839
and called them “illegal.”

79
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,519
Well amazingly,

80
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,849
the protests over the weekend seem to have
worked.

81
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:44,849
Partly.

82
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:45,849
On Monday,

83
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,219
Vietnam’s National Assembly agreed to delay
their vote

84
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,729
on the Special Economic Zone bill.

85
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,290
Because why deal with problems today

86
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,019
that you can put off into the future?

87
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,469
Possibly in a sneaky way

88
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,299
that doesn’t arouse so many protesters?

89
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,169
So, problem solved.

90
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,489
Except, there’s more to it than that.

91
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,579
There’s another element to the protests.

92
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:08,739
They were also calling out

93
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,390
a dangerous new cybersecurity bill.

94
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,879
As much as the Vietnamese regime hates how

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,480
the Chinese Communist Party acts in the South
China Sea,

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,400
they love how the they do cybersecurity.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,819
Vietnam’s National Assembly had plans to
enact

98
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,300
a harsh new law straight out of the Chinese
regime’s playbook.

99
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,210
It would give Vietnamese authorities “

100
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,789
wide discretion to determine when [online]
expression

101
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,550
must be censored as ‘illegal.’”

102
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,400
It would also help them stifle dissent

103
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,110
by forcing internet providers to remove offending
content—

104
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,710
and it would require providers to give user
data to authorities

105
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,310
without a court order.

106
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,159
The US and Canada have both officially urged
Vietnam

107
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,430
to delay passing this law.

108
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,560
Amnesty International warned that this

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,810
could turn companies into “state surveillance
agents.”

110
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,259
And so a lot of protesters were upset about
this too.

111
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,310
And it turns out they were right to be upset,

112
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,729
since on Tuesday,

113
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,470
Vietnamese authorities did pass the cybersecurity
law.

114
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,050
Although it doesn’t officially go into effect
until January 1, 2019.

115
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,330
But in a weird twist, there’s also a conspiracy
theory

116
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,590
that these protests could have been a false
flag

117
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,569
created by the Vietnamese regime.

118
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,610
Specifically, it says that Vietnamese authorities

119
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,509
planted people to make sure the anti-China
protests

120
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,780
turned violent.

121
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,520
That way, they’d have an excuse to crack
down harder—

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,240
and more importantly,

123
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,949
have an excuse to say,

124
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:45,990
“See?

125
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,009
Vietnam needs a new cybersecurity law,

126
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,870
because you people are using the internet

127
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,810
to organize your violent protests.”

128
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,800
Now that’s just a theory so far.

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,970
And I haven’t seen solid evidence.

130
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,490
But it’s not inconceivable that an oppressive
communist regime

131
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,150
would be willing to use underhanded tactics
to get what it wants.

132
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,530
And while it’s unclear whether any part
of the protests

133
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,039
were actually orchestrated by the Vietnamese
regime,

134
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,449
one thing does seem pretty clear:

135
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,749
Now that the cybersecurity law has passed,

136
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:21,090
this could be the last time the public

137
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,539
gets to see videos of protests in Vietnam.

138
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,090
So what do you think about the protests

139
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,389
that rocked Vietnam over the weekend?

140
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,810
Leave your comments below.

141
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,810
And before you go,

142
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,080
it’s time for me to answer another question

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,040
from a China Uncensored fan on Patreon.

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,100
Forrest Goodman asks...

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,030
“Will the corruption in the CCP ever

146
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,629
reach a breaking point and collapse,

147
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:47,289
or is the party just too big to fail?”

148
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,590
That’s the million yuan question, Forrest!

149
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,129
People have been predicting for a long time

150
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,509
the fall of the Chinese Communist Party.

151
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:56,699
And it makes sense.

152
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,800
Rampant corruption,

153
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
shadow banking,

154
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
a housing bubble,

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,480
capital flight—

156
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,719
those are just a few of the issues that threaten

157
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,710
to tank the economy.

158
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,029
Not to mention every year,

159
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,550
there’s about 200,000 mass protests across
the country.

160
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,439
Even Communist officials talk about the danger
the Party faces.

161
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,949
But if the Party were a boat on the ocean,

162
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,280
it’s done a remarkable job duct taping up
any leaks.

163
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,990
That’s the kind of power an authoritarian
regime

164
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,990
can bring to bear when it has, say,

165
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,990
total control over the economy.

166
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,620
But that kind of iron grip is exactly the
reason

167
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,259
all these problems keep popping up.

168
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,680
The Party is big,

169
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,110
but you know what they say,

170
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,639
the bigger you are,

171
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,820
the harder you fall.

172
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,319
It’s only a matter of when.

173
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,090
Thanks again for your question!

174
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,090

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:57,909
click the link below to go to our Patreon
site.

182
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,689
And if you’re already a supporter,

183
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,659
leave your question for us there.

184
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,639
Also, people have been complaining that

185
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,639
YouTube isn’t notifying them when a new
episode is up.

186
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,199
So be sure to enable that bell icon so you
get

187
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,439
the latest from China Uncensored.

188
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,439
Thanks for watching.

189
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,289
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell,

190
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,540
see you next time.

191
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Thanks for watching.

192
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,639
China Uncensored is supported mainly through

193
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,699
contributions from viewers like you.

194
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,960
Without our viewer support,

195
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,849
we’d have to stop the show.

196
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,009
So click this orange button

197
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,699
and visit Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

198
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,769
You can contribute a dollar or more per episode.

199
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,380
You can also set a monthly limit if you need.

200
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,140
When you join,

201
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,480
we’ll give you some cool perks—

202
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,020
and you’ll be making a big difference for
us.
