00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:24,020
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

2
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,890
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,949
Spies.

4
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:27,949
They're everywhere.

5
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,890
"As first reported by the New York Times,

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,240
the Chinese government has deployed spies
inside the US."

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,980
Uhhh, no, I'm not talking about the surge
of Chinese spies in the US.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,070
I'm talking about spies inside China.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,080
Hostile foreign forces.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,170
And believe me,

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,250
I should know.

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,210
Spies in China are out of control,

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,670
as you may have seen from this recent documentary.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:58,100
And 
the Chinese people must be vigilant against

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,000
these foreign spies.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,180
Fortunately the Communist Party's days of
helplessness are over.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:10,220
No longer will spies be able to freely walk
down the streets of China without consequence.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,680
Because according to Xinhua News Agency,

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,909
China has created a hotline you can call to
report on spies.

20
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,380
Now, I know what you're thinking…

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,000
"But what about your phone bill?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,080
Oh don't be silly, just dial…

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
12339.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
That's right.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,170
Just dial 12-3-3-9 to report a spy.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,170
And don't worry,

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,590
making false accusations against people is
illegal so there's no way this could devolve

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,000
into some kind of Hitler Youth thing.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,740
But how do you spot a spy?

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,740
Well, as someone from the hotline told the
New York Times,

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,810
"Anyone can be a spy.

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,740
And anyone can also not be a spy."

33
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
You see?

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,759
All you have to do is separate out the spies
from the not spies.

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,720
Here, let's take a look at a typical scenario.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,650
"Excuse me, do you happen to know any national
secrets?"

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,540
Can you tell who's the spy in this scenario?

38
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,470
Why of course the young woman is.

39
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,259
Why else would she be standing here instead
on the hotline reporting a suspicious looking

40
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,280
foreigner?

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,650
How about this one?

42
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,650
Haha, wessels.

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,120
But if you're still confused,

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,760
last year, the China Folk Counterespionage
Manual,

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,870
whose origin is dubious,

46
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,260
began circulating on the Chinese Internet.

47
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,410
And it has some useful tips for weeding out
spies.

48
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,349
For example...do you know any "socially active
students?"

49
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,880
They're probably spies.

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,220
The most nefarious of which are the "illogical
science majors" who get emotional about politics.

51
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,580
Why would science majors care about politics,
hmm?

52
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,450
Remember the last time illogical students
showed an interest in politics?

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,490
Of course you don't remember,

54
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,170
because you're a good Chinese citizen who
doesn't who doesn't listen to online rumors

55
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,780
about alleged massacres.

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,220
And clearly, China's new hotline is working,

57
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,550
because when the New York Times called on
Monday at 4:30 pm,

58
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,860
they were told they were the only call of
the day.

59
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,860
See?

60
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,150
No more spies.

61
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,489
Mission accomplished.

62
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,550
So what do you think about China's new spy
hotline?

63
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,599
Have any tips you'd like to offer about spotting
spies?

64
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,780
Leave them in the comment section below.

65
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,190
But if you think this whole spy thing is just
a witch hunt,

66
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,190
well in India,

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,710
witch hunts are actually a thing.

68
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,840
Check out this video from Seeker Daily.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,239
"The mob rushed into Orang's house and dragged
her out,

70
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,750
took her to a nearby stream,

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,459
almost stripped her naked,

72
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,530
and beheaded her in broad daylight"

73
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,260
Her accuser was self-proclaimed goddess.

74
00:03:35,260 --> 00:04:11,239
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
