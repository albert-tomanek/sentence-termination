1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,960
A coup attempt in China?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,220
Sounds like a coup for the show!

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,990
Did somebody cut the cheese?

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,990
And finally,

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,570
the Communist Party’s version of the Voice.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,600
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,420
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,920
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,400
I have to start off this episode

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,670
by giving a big personal thank you

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,430
to the man responsible for it all—

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,030
Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,579
According to one Chinese official speaking
on the sidelines

15
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,379
of the 19th Party Congress,

16
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,649
Xi Jinping “saved the party,

17
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:38,670
saved the military

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,730
and saved the country over the past five years
...

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,269
He saved socialism.”

20
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:45,269
Which means...

21
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,840
he saved China Uncensored!

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,620
If the Communist Party fell,

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,589
what would I do with myself?

24
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,019
Make an America Uncensored?

25
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:57,409
That official was not just praising Xi Jinping
in general,

26
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,989
he was also specifically referring to Xi Jinping

27
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,179
stopping an attempted coup.

28
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,859
And he named names.

29
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,950
Just like a good Communist.

30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,190
That was just one of many bombs dropped

31
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,310
during the 19th Party Congress.

32
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,500
Fortunately none of them were from North Korea.

33
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,460
We’ll have the full story on the 19th Party
Congress

34
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,640
later in the episode.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,390
But let me just say,

36
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,260
something’s rotten in the state of China…

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

38
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,340
I’m talking about cheese.

39
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,350
China has lifted a ban on stinky cheese.

40
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,130
That’s right,

41
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,480
stinky cheese can now proudly take its place
again

42
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,810
on the shelves of Chinese supermarkets,

43
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,000
alongside Durian and stinky tofu.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
Just don’t go to any store

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,880
that specializes in all three.

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
So why the change?

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,310
Well, in September,

48
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,430
the Chinese regime put a quarantine on

49
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,160
the bacterial and mold strains

50
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
that make several types of soft

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,340
and mold ripened cheeses.

52
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,550
They were probably cheesed off at

53
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,780
the European Union for something.

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,560
But following a recent meeting with EU officials,

55
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,810
that got sorted.

56
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,640
Chinese sales are expected to reach

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,310
800 million dollars this year,

58
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,640
according to research firm Euromonitor.

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,950
And now the Chinese people

60
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,140
can look up to Xi Jinping

61
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,450
for yet another thing—

62
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,530
cutting the cheese.

63
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,740
Don’t ever say that, though.

64
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,810
He’ll know.

65
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,420
Seriously, he’ll know.

66
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,569
According to Human Rights Watch,

67
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,569
the Chinese regime

68
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,670
“has been collecting the voice patterns

69
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,640
of tens of thousands of people,”

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,890
to aid its dystopian surveillance network.

71
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,060
And you won’t believe the person they hired

72
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,620
to collect those voices.

73
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
Never trust a creature

74
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,320
with more than four tentacles.

75
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,490
And the best part is,

76
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,900
the CCP isn’t even telling the people

77
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,720
that are being sampled.

78
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,950
Police are allowed to collect

79
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,120
“fingerprints, palm prints, and profile
photos,

80
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,820
as well as urine and DNA samples”,

81
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,600
not just from criminals,

82
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,180
but also from anyone suspected of a crime.

83
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,310
And in China,

84
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,690
human rights aren’t the only thing that’s
disappearing.

85
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,340
So are the glaciers.

86
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,330
Xinjiang is home to 20,000 glaciers.

87
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,080
That’s half of all China’s glaciers.

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,060
But “Since the 1950s,

89
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,950
all of Xinjiang's glaciers have retreated

90
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,950
by between 21 percent to 27 percent.”

91
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,480
That’s about 30 feet a year.

92
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,099
At this rate, in 50 years,

93
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,490
more than half will be gone.

94
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,120
But don’t worry!

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,060
That means more land for development.

96
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,489
But even you if you can’t enjoy the gentle
sound

97
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,790
of snow crunching under your feet,

98
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,130
you can at least enjoy the sound of glass

99
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,550
giving way under you feet

100
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,240
on the latest of China’s glass bottomed
walkways.

101
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,280
Take a look:

102
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,700
Yes, it's a fun gag.

103
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,280
Sensors detect pedestrians

104
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,220
and trigger the special effect,

105
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,690
and mortal terror.

106
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,590
Just another day in China.

107
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,590
What do you think?

108
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,700
Leave your comments below.

109
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,580
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

110
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,260
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

111
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,380
See you next time.

112
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,060
Hello?

113
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,480
Uncle Chang’s Stinky Cheese, Tofu and Durian
Emporium?

114
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,830
I’d like to place an order for five pounds
of each.

115
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,140
Yes, and I’d like that delivered to one
Shelley Zhang.

116
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,040
No it’s not a prank!

117
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,070
Yes, charge upon delivery.
