1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:01,959
Was he a spy?

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:04,649
Ooh, no.
More towards the dark end of those arts.

3
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:06,259
Was he a spy at night?

4
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,819
-- No...
-- With Patrick Moore!

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,601
Impersonator!

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,120
Ooh, very...
I'm looking for a particular word...

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
Like, impersonator implies he... what are
you cackling at?

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,279
Sean Connery on with Patrick Moore!

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,199
It's "The Spy at Night" with Patrick Moore!

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,320
"Today, I'm sat here behind someone's head

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,310
"watching if he's a philandering husband.

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,610
"Now here's Brian May with a large telescope
into his wife's bedroom."

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,210
Brian May looks like Russ Abbot peering out
of a cloud.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
He's not wrong. He's not wrong.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,750
Google Russ Abbot and Brian May, he's right.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,980
It's just the thought of, like, a...

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,200
Where did that come from?!

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,680
The Sky at Night!

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,720
Patrick Moore's in the suit and everything

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
but just, like, camouflage paint on his face.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,609
"I'm using my large telescope to spy on the
lady next door."

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
[Translating these subtitles? Add your name here!]

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,200
Sorry, I'm slobbering.

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,120
Lovely!

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,780
No, it--
