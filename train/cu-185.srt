1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,580
a foreigner's confession in China.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,690
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,260
You know, it seems like everyone's giving
a confession

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,720
on Chinese state-run CCTV these days!

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,540
Like 70-year-old journalist Gao Yu,

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,300
who confessed in 2014 to illegally giving

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,800
internal Communist Party documents to an overseas
website.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,820
Or Dong Rubin, who admitted to falsely claiming

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,109
in 2009 that his fellow prison inmate had
been

12
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:36,019
brutally killed by guards, rather than—

13
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,339
as the guards reported—died accidentally

14
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,799
while playing a game of "hide and seek."

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,179
Or just last week, a bookseller in Hong Kong—

16
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,479
who's also a Swedish citizen—

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,549
who was abducted—er, arrested—by Chinese
authorities,

18
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:54,519
who apologized for a crime that has surprisingly
little

19
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,170
to do with his real crime

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,879
of selling politically sensitive books.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,600
So I just wanted to jump on the bandwagon.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,260
Because this week there was yet another state-run
confession.

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,680
"We have been made aware, become aware that..."

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,100
This is Swedish citizen Peter Dahlin.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,820
He disappeared while on his way to the

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,930
Beijing International Airport on January 3,

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,500
while attempting to travel to Thailand.

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,200
And he reappeared here, on state-run CCTV,

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,780
apologizing for, among other crimes,

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,060
hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.

31
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,000
"I've hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,780
I apologize sincerely for this,

33
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,990
and I'm very sorry that this ever happened."

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,580
Actually it's more accurate to say that he

35
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,330
endangered state security.

36
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,530
Well, it's actually more accurate to say he

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,570
trained human rights lawyers in China.

38
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,220
But you say potato, I say potato.

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,640
Shelley, you know the prompter doesn't give
me intonations.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,560
Anyway, Mr. Dahlin has been living in China
since 2007.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,160
In 2009, Mr. Dahlin co-founded the

42
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,770
Chinese Urgent Action Working Group,

43
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,530
an organization that trains activists and
lawyers to,

44
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,710
according to the group,

45
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,860
"promote the development of the rule of law

46
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,980
and counter abuses of basic human rights."

47
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,920
And by that I assume they mean they

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,260
"got involved in hot-topic issues and sensitive
cases,

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,389
and intentionally escalated conflicts and
disputes

50
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:19,909
that were originally not severe,"

51
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:22,200
and "instigated the people to confront the
government

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,240
and produce mass incidents."

53
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,819
At least that's what Xinhua said.

54
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,319
Don't worry about the group anymore though

55
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,839
because police have smashed it.

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,779
In his confession, Mr. Dahlin also admits

57
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,339
to writing reports without "real or full facts."

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,580
Spreading rumors.

59
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,820
You know how the Communist Party hates rumors!

60
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,849
And anything the Communist Party 
doesn't like is a rumor.

61
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,279
Wow, I guess I really am guilty of spreading
rumors on this show.

62
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,459
Anyway, at first, the Chinese Foreign Ministry

63
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,579
denied any knowledge of Mr. Dahlin's detention.

64
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,969
But later they said he was involved in activates

65
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,639
that "endangered state security."

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,440
What proof did they offer?

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,350
Well, who needs proof when he's already confessed!

68
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,240
Man, Chinese law works so much better than
America's!

69
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,060
I mean, why even bother with courts

70
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,040
when people just confess on their own!

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,380
Now Mr. Dahlin also suffers from Addison’s
disease,

72
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,359
a rare hormonal disorder that requires daily
medication.

73
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,399
If he doesn't take it, he'll die.

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
I wonder how Chinese authorities convinced
him to confess.

75
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,269
Anyway, with now the second Swedish citizen
in a week

76
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,450
giving a confession on CCTV,

77
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,350
the Swedish government's response has been
somewhat muted.

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,830
Here's what the Swedish ambassador had to
say.

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,840
Yee bork a doo doo york mmm bork bork bork!

80
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,240
And that's actually more than the real Swedish
ambassador

81
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:48,949
said about Mr. Dahlin in public.

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,340
So what do you think about the confession?

83
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,590
Leave your comments below—

84
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,219
then turn yourself in to authorities

85
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,769
and confess to spreading rumors online.

86
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,079
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see you next
time.

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,180
Foreign anti-China forces have never stopped
slandering

88
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,920
and attacking the Chinese government.

89
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,320
A few of the Western media with hostile attitudes

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,380
towards China have added fuel to the flame.

91
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,560
On January 22, a well-known Western television
host

92
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,900
apologized on camera to the Chinese people

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,120
for his anti-China activities.

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,500
"I would like to apologize for spreading rumors
and undermining China."

95
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,540
The New York-based "China Uncensored"
program

96
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,260
is dedicated to collecting and spreading

97
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,140
false information about China,

98
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,820
with the intention to make trouble

99
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,740
and interfere with the development

100
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,360
of China's harmonious society,

101
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,660
so as to achieve ulterior political motives.

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,010
"I understand now that I have

103
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,070
endangered the security of the Chinese government,

104
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,410
and I have hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people.

105
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,580
I apologize sincerely for this

106
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,060
and I regret this ever happened."
