00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,409
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:07,439
what happens when a Chinese jet and a US spy
plane stop being polite,

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:09,679
and start getting real.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,630
You know, many of the truths we cling to

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,580
depend greatly on our own point of view.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,380
And nowhere is that more evident than in the
South China Sea.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,270
“At least two Chinese J-11 tactical aircraft

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,750
—those are fighter jets—

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,330
they carried out what's called an unsafe intercept

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,460
of a US reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea.”

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,960
That's according to a US Pentagon Official.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,880
But according to Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hong Lei,

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,030
the US statement was, "Not true."

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,180
Well how can that be? Is one side lying?

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,239
Haha, lying is such a strong term.

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,829
You see, the US spy plane was flying in international
airspace.

18
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,220
Unless you consider China’s point of view,

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,990
which is that pretty much the entire South
China Sea belongs to China.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,140
In which case it’s like Hong Lei says:

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,600
“It must be pointed out that U.S. military
planes frequently carry out reconnaissance

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,210
in Chinese coastal waters,

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,010
seriously endangering Chinese maritime and
air security.”

24
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,400
You see it was the US acting dangerously in
Chinese airspace.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,040
“At one point these jets, according to this
official, came within 50 feet of the American aircraft."

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,979
Whoa! 50 feet?!

27
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,080
Do you realize how dangerous that is?!

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,480
It's like that jerk in the Porche who
tailgates you on the highway.

29
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,830
But at airplane speeds.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,700
But you can’t say the Chinese jets flew
within 50 feet of the American plane,

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,670
without also accurately saying the US plane
flew within 50 feet of the Chinese ones.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,590
Here's China Uncensored’s Force Ghost for
more!

33
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,330
So what I told you was true, from a certain
point of view.

34
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,170
This is not a first either.

35
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,229
Pretty much the same thing happened back in
September 2015.

36
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,769
Though that unsafe interception was 500 feet.

37
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,450
Which, while being dangerously unsafe,

38
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,659
is still ten times less unsafe than 50 feet.

39
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,599
There was also that spy plane incident in
2001

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,370
which shows you just how risky flying close
can be.

41
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,659
Because that time, unfortunately, the Chinese
jet actually collided with the US spy plane,

42
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,379
and the Chinese pilot was killed.

43
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,219
And the US plane was forced to make an emergency
landing in Hainan.

44
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,739
Whose fault was that?

45
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,259
Well, China forced the US to apologize before
they’d release the 24 American air crew members.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
That took 11 days.

47
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,109
Don't think that’s how it should have gone?

48
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:51,400
Well, I guess it’s a matter of your point
of view.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,200
And the point of view of my favorite Chinese
state-run media, the Global Times,

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,129
is that if the US keeps sending in more planes,

51
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,249
“the odds of another collision will go up.”

52
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:05,150
It’s the foreign policy equivalent of a
windmill attack.

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,599
I’m just going to keep swinging my arms,

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,209
and if you get hit it's your own fault.

55
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,719
And it will be the Pentagon's fault.

56
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,459
Now, last week’s dangerous spy plane encounter
happened just a few days ahead

57
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,139
of US President Barack Obama making his first
trip to Vietnam

58
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,039
where he lifted the US’s long-standing embargo

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,299
on sales of lethal weapons to the communist country.

60
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,359
“The United States and Vietnam are united
in our support for a regional order including

61
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,169
in the South China Sea.”

62
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:41,769
So China had better watch out! Unless you
instead believe this other thing he said.

63
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:51,629
"The decision to lift the ban was not based
on China or any other considerations.”

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,139
Yes, I believe that as much as I believe this.

65
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,609
“We would gladly see Vietnam develop

66
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:05,930
a normal, friendly and cooperative relationship
with all countries, including the United States.”

67
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,309
Anyway, last week’s spy plane intercept
also occurred just ahead of an international

68
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,279
tribunal in The Hague.

69
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:18,340
The Philippines filed a legal challenge over
China’s claims to the South China Sea.

70
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,560
And there’s no better way to solve a legal
dispute based on international law

71
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,500
than international arbitration.

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,070
Unless, from your point of view, arbitration
is illegitimate and you ignore its decision.

73
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,700
Now we don’t know for certain where last
week’s encounter actually happened.

74
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,700
But the Chinese Foreign Ministry says it was
near China’s southernmost Island province Hainan.

75
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,710
That’s where the Chinese regime bases its
growing fleet of nuclear submarines.

76
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,830
Those are a big concern for India,

77
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,960
and at the beginning of May,

78
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,830
the US began talks with India about submarine
warfare.

79
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,690
I’m sure against no one in particular.

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,660
Just like selling weapons to Vietnam is about
no one in particular.

81
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,100
So what’s your point of view about last
week’s incident?

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,460
Be sure to express it with full vigor in the
comment section below.

83
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,800
Once again I’m Chris Chappell. Thanks for
watching this episode of China Uncensored
