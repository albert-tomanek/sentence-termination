1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,460
China is outraged by a Taiwanese video game

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,729
Unexpected side effects

3
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:08,760
to Chinese genetically engineered babies

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,290
And facial recognition technology—

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,090
it’s not just for humans anymore!

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,000
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,360
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:23,589
I’m Chris Chappell.

each time we publish a new episode.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,269
This week’s China news headlines.

15
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:35,550
A video game is causing tensions

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,320
between China and Taiwan to get...

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,910
even more tense.

18
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,190
This is Devotion,

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,699
a Taiwanese psychological horror game.

20
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,260
You can tell it’s really scary

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,570
because you have to do math.

22
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,230
It’s set in the 1980s,

23
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,920
in a creepy run down apartment

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,769
of a family of religious devotees.

25
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,510
And you need to figure out what happened.

26
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,570
Speaking of figuring out what happened,

27
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,600
people were trying to figure out why the game

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
suddenly disappeared on Steam.

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,430
That’s a website where you can buy video
games.

30
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,950
It has to do with an ancient curse.

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,260
The ancient curse being China’s plan to
take over Taiwan,

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,880
by force if necessary.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,720
You see, sharp-eyed Chinese gamers spotted
this.

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,120
Spooky, eh.

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,020
It’s called a Fulu talisman.

36
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
Daoist priests

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,560
would draw talismans to ward off evil spirits

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,920
or give instructions to spirits.

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,360
This one is a curse spell.

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,850
In traditional Chinese culture

41
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,220
this is considered very evil.

42
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,370
It’s the equivalent of stabbing a voodoo
doll.

43
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,100
And this one has written on it,

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,550
Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh Moron.

45
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,690
Chinese players were not happy.

46
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,690
If you don’t know,

47
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,200
Xi Jinping has often been compared with

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,870
the lovable Pooh bear,

49
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,290
which oddly makes Xi Jinping, not happy.

50
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,700
So Chinese players responded by flooding the
game’s page

51
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,290
with thousands of negative reviews.

52
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,400
And then at some point,

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,790
it was taken down from Steam.

54
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,020
By the way, Valve, the parent company of Steam,

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,490
is trying to open a local Chinese version.

56
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,960
Though apparently Chinese netizens aren’t
happy about it.

57
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,250
They can already access

58
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,010
the global version of Steam with a VPN.

59
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,280
And they’re concerned that if there’s

60
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,780
a separate Chinese version of Steam,

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,620
it would have all the good games censored.

62
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,690
Really?!

63
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,140
Well, anyway, after the Devotion game

64
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,720
disappeared from Steam,

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,760
the company that made it wrote a public apology.

66
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,940
And they said the game was pulled

67
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,980
because of technical issues.

68
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,650
Well, I guess in a sense that’s true,

69
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,600
since this did cause the game to crash and
burn.

70
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,130
Now Red Candle Games is creating a patch

71
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,740
that will remove the cursed talisman,

72
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,580
but there’s another problem.

73
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,480
“Chinese players have downloaded

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,380
a pirated version of Devotion

75
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,920
that couldn’t be patched

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,810
and still continued to offend Chinese users.”

77
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,200
LOL.

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,400
So yes, US warships just recently

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,480
sailed through the Taiwan Strait.

80
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,630
But it’s a video game that’s really upsetting

81
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,710
cross-strait relations.

82
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,440
But the youth of China might have

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,640
a bigger problem to worry about—

84
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,380
internet censorship.

85
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,220
Of themselves, not of others.

86
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,990
This year alone WeChat has blocked

87
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,560
more than 40,000 accounts.

88
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,720
Pretty good for only two months.

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,070
And a new target is sang culture.

90
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,070
According to Tech in Asia,

91
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,660
“It loosely translates to funeral or mourning,

92
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,069
but it can also mean hopeless or dispirited.”

93
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,590
Working 12 hours a day at a job

94
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,760
that won’t even cover rent in Beijing?

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,430
That’s sang.

96
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,460
Weibo has also blocked accounts

97
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,319
that “peddle anxiety.”

98
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,150
So don’t look to these web platforms

99
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,290
as an outlet for your existential angst anymore,

100
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,680
Chinese millennials.

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,540
Because you can’t have Communist Party spirit

102
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,410
if you’re so sad.

103
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,569
Not to worry though!

104
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,569
Teenage angst

105
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,750
will soon be a thing of the past in China!

106
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,650
Because, well, teenagers may also be

107
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,370
a thing of the past.

108
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,170
Birth rates are falling in China.

109
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,260
Like, a lot.

110
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,740
Even though the Communist Party ended the
One Child Policy

111
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,390
by implementing a slightly more liberal Two
Child Policy,

112
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,680
“There were 15.23 million new births in
2018,

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,120
down by more than 11 percent from the year
before.”

114
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,629
And the downward trend has been going on

115
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,240
for a couple of years now.

116
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,279
In fact, birth rates started dropping in the
1960s,

117
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,219
well before the One Child policy even started.

118
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:34,319
So why was the One Child Policy necessary
in the first place?

119
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,129
Good question.

120
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:39,319
China’s overall population growth is slowing,

121
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,370
but it hasn’t yet started to actually shrink.

122
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,900
But China is rapidly becoming a country of
old people,

123
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,979
as birth rates go down and life expectancy
goes up.

124
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,520
Now to be fair, old Chinese people can be
amazing.

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,770
But they’re also not necessarily economically
productive—

126
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,389
especially when so much work

127
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,080
is still farming or factory work.

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,789
So this puts more of a burden

129
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,530
on those young people who do work.

130
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,210
And according to the New York Times,

131
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,729
“Should China increase welfare benefits

132
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:12,949
in line with high-income countries—

133
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,430
a stated aspiration of the Chinese leadership—

134
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,759
[welfare benefits] could take up to 32 percent
of

135
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,669
the gross domestic product by 2050.”

136
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,730
But hey, it’s the same Communist Party

137
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,071
that felt just fine with a One Child Policy

138
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,379
that resulted in hundreds of millions of abortions.

139
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,410
So I’m sure they could “solve” the problem

140
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,949
of too many elderly people with a brand new
snack food

141
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,919
that’s truly of the people—Soylent Red.

142
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,669
One more reason not to eat food that’s made
in China.

143
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,159
So birth rates are down.

144
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,280
But there’s been a dramatic increase

145
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,650
in the number of genetically engineered super
babies!

146
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,900
There were zero a year ago,

147
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,419
and now there are two.

148
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,659
In November,

149
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,589
a Chinese scientist announced

150
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,770
he had successfully created GMO babies,

151
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,750
which was very against the rules

152
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,759
according to Chinese authorities.

153
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,439
The scientist behind the experiment, He Jiankui,

154
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,150
deleted a gene in the fetus’s DNA.

155
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,250
And in doing so,

156
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,229
he may have granted the twin girls immunity
to HIV.

157
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,270
But there could be another upside, too.

158
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,800
According to this MIT Technology review,

159
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,190
this may have also enhanced their brains.

160
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,759
New research seems to show that removing that
gene

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,729
not only makes mice smarter,

162
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,569
but also improves stroke recovery in humans

163
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,650
and has been linked to success in school.

164
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,250
So...the genetically modified twins

165
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,539
will do better in school

166
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,559
because part of their DNA was removed?

167
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,789
I feel bad for all of their schoolmates,

168
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,161
whose parents will ask them why they didn’t
have

169
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:48,710
their genes illegally edited to be smarter.

170
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,080
In other tech news,

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,719
the Chinese Communist Party has created

172
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,550
an unparalleled surveillance state,

173
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,659
complete with AI facial recognition technology.

174
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,999
So that’s done.

175
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,349
What next?

176
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:01,900
Turn it on the pigs!

177
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
That’s not a slur.

178
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,449
I’m being serious.

179
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,199
Yes, China is creating

180
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,289
“A database of every pig’s face.”

181
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,490
Supposedly, it’s to fight swine flu.

182
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,839
China has been hit hard by it.

183
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,409
So by mapping pigs’ faces

184
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,059
and installing voice recognition software,

185
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:20,159
no more swine flu.

186
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,629
Wait, I feel like there’s a step missing
somewhere.

187
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,300
Supposedly the idea is you’ll be able to
predict

188
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,240
if a pig is getting sick.

189
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,630
And there are several Chinese companies

190
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,560
working on the technology.

191
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,749
But a lot of Chinese farmers are skeptical

192
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:35,990
that this technology could even work,

193
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,349
saying it won’t happen until pigs can fly.

194
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:41,370
Which has prompted another Chinese tech company

195
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,699
to work on a cutting-edge pig aviation app.

196
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,399
Speaking of flying pigs,

197
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,180
Chinese telecom company Huawei

198
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,139
has been on a PR tear,

199
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,389
trying to convince other countries

200
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,899
that Huawei is a private company

201
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,160
that has nothing to do with the Chinese government.

202
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
Have you ever given

203
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,740
any information to the Chinese government

204
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,979
in any way, shape, or form?

205
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,529
For the past 30 years, we have never done
that,

206
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,889
and in the next 30 years to come,

207
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,669
we will never do that.

208
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,679
And then my favorite state-run media the Global
Times

209
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,169
tweeted what looks like a propaganda video

210
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,720
of children singing about how much they love
Huawei.

211
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,040
Huawei is good

212
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,380
Huawei is beautiful

213
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,240
Huawei makes me more intelligent

214
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,460
Teacher teaches me to love the motherland

215
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,420
Made in China cellphone, love Huawei

216
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,539
Huawei then came out with a statement

217
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,240
that this video was done independently

218
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,770
by Chinese netizens who just really love the
company.

219
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,000
Because Huawei is a totally private company

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,860
that has nothing to do with the Chinese government.

221
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,570
And finally, relations between China and Canada

222
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,459
may not be so hot after Canada detained

223
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,240
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou,

224
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,870
But things are at least warming up a bit,

225
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,500
now that China will be getting its first Tim
Horton’s.

226
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,949
And really, isn’t that the best news you’ve
heard all day?

227
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,430
And before you go, it’s time when I answer
a question

228
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,079
from a fan of the show who supports China
Uncensored

229
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,040
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

230
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,089
Raunak Chhatwal asks,

231
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,130
“I saw an advchina Video where they said
China

232
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,980
knows vpns are operating inside the country

233
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,519
and are allowing them to exist.

234
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,990
Why do you think they’re doing this?”

235
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,081
Well you see, the Chinese Communist party

236
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:31,950
worked hard to build the massive system

237
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,569
of government surveillance and internet censorship

238
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,290
for the good of the people.

239
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,070
The Great Firewall of China is there for a
reason—

240
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,269
to keep the Chinese internet walled off

241
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,209
from the rest of the Internet.

242
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,180
But then people just use VPNs to get around
it.

243
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,199
So irresponsible.

244
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,540
That’s why the Party started a major crackdown
on them.

245
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,810
And decided to replace them with state backed
versions.

246
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,800
It’s all to create a more harmonious internet,

247
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,380
without all the pollution of alternative facts,

248
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,620
such as the truth.

249
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,150
Another reason is that the regime knows

250
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,089
that if it completely blocked VPNs,

251
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:10,150
foreigners and foreign companies wouldn’t
stand for it,

252
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,660
and they’d leave China.

253
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,430
So they’d rather just let people use VPNs,

254
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,029
but only the kind the Chinese government can
control.

255
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,810
And maybe monitor.

256
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,480
Thanks for your question.

257
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,430
So why am I answering questions on the show?

258
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,649
It’s because a lot of advertisers don’t
dare to work

259
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,850
with a show that criticizes the Chinese Communist
Party.

260
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,579
So we rely on support from viewers like you

261
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,350
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

262
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,350
Answering your questions on the show

263
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,670
is one of my ways of saying thank you.

264
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,769
So head over to patreon.com/chinaucnensored

265
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,509
to find out how you can keep China, uncensored.

266
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:46,910
Thanks for watching.

267
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,440
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

268
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,520
See you next time.
