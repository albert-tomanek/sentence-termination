1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,250
Rare earth metals

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,740
Exotic minerals used in loads of products

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,840
From phones, to batteries, to bombs.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,610
And China supplies rare earths to the US.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,660
But amid the trade war,

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,180
China has threatened to America’s cut rare
earth supply.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,060
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,500
I'm Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,320
What do Lanthanum, Neodymium

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,570
and Yttrium have in common?

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,920
Other than being your ace in the hole

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,759
during your next game of Scrabble,

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,880
they’re all rare earth metals—

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,620
also known as “rare earth minerals” or
simply “rare earths.”

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,600
There are a total of 17 rare earth metals
on the periodic table.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,060
Rare earth metals are used in everything from
batteries,

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,060
to cell phones,

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,760
to precision-guided missiles.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,140
“Rare earths are quite distinct among themselves,

20
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
within that family,

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,790
but one of the characteristics that they do
all share

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,059
are these fantastic magnetic and conductive
properties.”

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,840
For example, if you combine Neodymium with
Iron and Boron,

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,020
you can make a powerful permanent magnet.

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,950
Those magnets can be used in things from small
headphones

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,479
to big motors.

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,130
And one country dominates the market for rare
earth metals—China.

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,329
“They decided more than a decade ago

29
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,079
that it was an incredible strategic asset.

30
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,680
Having all of these rare earth minerals

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,529
they knew would put them in a dominant position

32
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:29,670
to manufacture everything from missiles technology,

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,319
to guidance systems and magnets

34
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,359
that go into guiding the fins of missiles

35
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,850
to the touch screens that we use on our iPhone.

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,219
They knew that they would be in charge of
all of that.”

37
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,020
China has around 44 million tons of rare earth
reserves.

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,719
That’s twice as much as Brazil or Vietnam,

39
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,859
and way more than the United States.

40
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,439
In 2018, China produced 70% of the world’s
supply of rare earths.

41
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,529
But that wasn’t always the case.

42
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:55,829
There was a time when the US

43
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,880
was the world’s top manufacturer of rare
earths.

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,859
James Litinsky is the CEO of a capital group

45
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,549
that bought the Mountain Pass Mine in California,

46
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,810
after it went bankrupt.

47
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,810
“Mountain Pass,

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,470
the site that we acquired out of bankruptcy,

49
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,780
from the 1960s through the 90s

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,010
was the leading rare earths producer in the
world.

51
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,590
But essentially in China

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,640
they have a lot less stringent environmental
controls

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,900
and so about 20 years ago they took over the
industry.”

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,280
The problem with rare earth production isn’t
so much the strip mining.

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,960
That makes for an ugly landscape,

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,610
but it’s a mostly harmless hole in the ground.

57
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,340
The real problem is the toxic chemicals

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,760
used to process the rare earth ore.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,500
“It is an incredibly destructive and poisonous
process.

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,430
Going through the incredible amount of soil

61
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,310
you have to go through to get these minerals
out of the earth.

62
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,540
And so we just don’t abide by those standards.

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,340
We won’t poison our croplands the way China
has been willing to.”

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,210
And if any country is willing to poison its
own farmland, it’s China.

65
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,030
Like in the Chinese city of Baotou,

66
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,140
the biggest industrial city in Inner Mongolia.

67
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,520
It’s home to the ginormous Baogang Steel

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,890
and Rare Earth complex.

69
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,260
Inside the plant, toxic chemicals are used

70
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,130
to process the ore and extract the rare earth
metals.

71
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,430
Then radioactive waste gets dumped in a massive
lake of toxic sludge.

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,560
The BBC calls it a “dystopian lake filled
by the world’s tech lust.”

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,230
Farmers living near Lake Dystopia

74
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,050
complain the wind whips up cancer-causing
toxins

75
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,890
and dumps them on their land.

76
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,550
Which poisons the soil and water.

77
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,890
And causes the farmers’ teeth

78
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,280
to fall out and their hair to turn white.

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,400
And now, the US gets 80% of its rare earths
from China,

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,570
including places like Baotou.

81
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,670
And even if you don’t care about environmental
pollution,

82
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,000
there’s another problem:

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,990
China is using its dominance of the rare earth
market

84
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,020
as a weapon in political disputes.

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,350
Like back in 2010,

86
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,270
when China got into a territorial spat with
Japan

87
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,830
over control of the Senkaku Islands.

88
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,850
In retaliation,

89
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,810
China hiked rare earth prices 10 times for
Japan,

90
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,730
the world’s biggest buyer of rare earth
metals.

91
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,600
“100 percent of our rare earth minerals
come from China.”

92
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,790
His company makes magnets for laptops,

93
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,949
and depends on a steady supply of rare earths.

94
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,039
By choking off the supply,

95
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,060
China put his business in a stranglehold.

96
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,620
And then in May of this year,

97
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,199
China signaled that it might weaponize rare
earths

98
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,000
as part of its escalating trade war with the
US.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,279
“China will meet the reasonable demand

100
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,849
of other countries for rare earths.

101
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,960
But it would be totally unacceptable to us

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,669
if these countries were to use rare earths

103
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,840
to produce products used against China

104
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,770
or to oppress us.”

105
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,310
The CCP mouthpiece the People’s Daily

106
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,629
also ran an editorial, asking,

107
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,729
“Will rare earths become a counter weapon
for China

108
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,529
to hit back against the pressure the United
States

109
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,229
has put on for no reason at all?

110
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,800
The answer is no mystery.”

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,650
Wow, they’re not very good at subtlety,
are they?

112
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,130
Then the Global Times ran this editorial,

113
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,169
quoting a senior academic who said “the
‘ace’ in China's hand

114
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,159
is a complete ban on exports of rare earths
to the US,”

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,529
adding that “this is not the only way to
make the US economy feel pain.”

116
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,110
The trouble is, weaponizing rare earth exports

117
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,830
seems to be backfiring on China.

118
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,580
Burned by the rare earths price hike over
the Senkaku Islands,

119
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,199
Japan decided to cut its dependency on Chinese
rare earths.

120
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,110
“Japanese government with Japanese company

121
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,949
will collaborate together to looking for another
countries like Vietnam,

122
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,770
Mongolia and Central Asia, Kazakhstan.”

123
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,689
And then last year,

124
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,381
Japan discovered a huge underwater deposit
of rare earth metals

125
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:01,259
that will last for centuries.

126
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,259
And China—

127
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,379
by squeezing supply and causing prices to
rise—

128
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,729
has also given America the opportunity to
free itself

129
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,909
from *its* dependency on Chinese rare earths.

130
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,781
“The United States used to be

131
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:18,919
the single most important producing country
for rare earths.

132
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,300
From a single mine,

133
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,129
called the Mountain Pass mine.”

134
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,819
The Mountain Pass mine is located in Southern
California

135
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,219
near the border with Nevada.

136
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,409
After it went bankrupt,

137
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,250
the mine was bought by JTL Capital Group,

138
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,050
which hired more people and invested in the
facility.

139
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,409
“We bought the facility out of bankruptcy
in 2017.

140
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,580
At the time it had 8 employees and it was
in care of maintenance.

141
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,190
Over the last two years we’ve been doing
a ramp-up in two stages.

142
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,699
Over the last two years we’ve hired 200
people,

143
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,500
so we’ve created 200 American, hard-working
jobs.”

144
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,550
But what about the toxic pollution?

145
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,210
Well, it turns out the mine’s previous owner
invested

146
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,939
in a cutting-edge facility that allows rare-earth
processing

147
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:02,180
with minimal environmental impact.

148
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,229
“One good thing they did is that they spent
1.7 billion dollars

149
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,199
building a state-of-the-art environmentally-friendly
facility.”

150
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,129
Right now the plant only makes a rare earths
concentrate

151
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,680
that it ships to China for processing.

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,900
But, within a year, its owner says,

153
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,879
Mountain Pass will be fully decoupled from
China.

154
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,409
“At that point we will be fully self-sufficient
from China

155
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,379
and one of the major global producers.”

156
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,569
So it turns out, by weaponizing rare earths,

157
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,089
China may have inadvertently shot itself in
the foot.

158
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,529
By restricting its own exports market,

159
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,490
it is helping the US become rare-earth self-sufficient.

160
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,139
And, by shifting the refineries to America,

161
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,020
it’s also better for the environment.

162
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,720
This is what I call,

163
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,550
win-win non-cooperation.

164
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,400
So what do you think about how China’s

165
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,080
weaponizing rare earth exports has backfired?

166
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,500
Leave your comments below.

167
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,900
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

168
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,880
See you next time.
