00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,119
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,760
Taiwan's new president needs to lean in.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,320
Welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host
Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,450
Two weeks ago,

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,270
Taiwan's first female president, Tsai Ing-wen,

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,060
was sworn into office.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,880
And despite the fact that Tsai

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,200
promised to maintain the status quo between
China and Taiwan,

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,100
her inauguration speech did not explicitly
endorse the "one China" policy.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,079
That's the agreement where both China and
Taiwan agree

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,870
that they both belong to the same China,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,870
while being intentionally vague about which
China each one is talking about.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,630
So Chinese officials threatened to stop communication
with Taiwan

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,530
unless Tsai publicly acknowledges that there
is only one China.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,079
And then last week,

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,079
criticism of Tsai took a more personal turn.

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,350
State-run Xinhua News published a commentary
that accused Tsai

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,100
of being emotional, extremist, and erratic
because she's single.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,830
This completely levelheaded and non-emotional
article

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,570
was written by Wang Weixing,

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,560
a PLA officer and member of

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,310
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits,

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,310
the semi-government body that deals with Taiwan.

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,780
And his article got so controversial that
the propaganda department

25
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,950
ordered for it to be deleted.

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,729
But thanks to webcache,

27
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,500
it will live on the internet forever.

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,210
Like that embarrassing photo of me from college.

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,360
Here to talk about cross-straits relations
and extreme emotional reactions,

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,430
here’s the only woman on the China Uncensored
team, Shelley Zhang.

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,549
Thanks Chris.

32
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,529
What are you doing?

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,800
Finding balance, Chris.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,760
It's what I do, as a woman.

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,950
It's in my yoga.

36
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,850
It's in my work-slash-life.

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,229
It's even in my tea.

38
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,360
So you're not surprised that Wang Weixing
accused Tsai Ing-wen of being unbalanced?

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,970
It's hardly the first time an unmarried female
leader has been through this.

40
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,659
Look at South Korean president Park Geun-hye.

41
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,960
Or former Australian prime minister Julia
Gillard.

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,090
Frankly, I think Wang is probably the kind
of guy

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,530
who would find any woman who became the leader
of a country unbalanced,

44
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,600
even this woman:

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,440
That's pretty good.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,970
I wonder if I could learn to do that.

47
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,989
No.

48
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,500
Anyway, do you think the Xinhua article

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,920
revealed a difference in sexism across the
two straits?

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,720
In a way, yes.

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,360
If the All-China's Women's Federation

52
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,810
considers educated 27-year-olds "leftover
women",

53
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,550
then 59-year-old Tsai,

54
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,629
who has a master's degree from Cornell,

55
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,810
and a PhD from the London School of Economics,

56
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,390
is the moldy lasagna in the back of my fridge
that I'm afraid to look at.

57
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,090
Also, Taiwan has a much higher portion of
women politicians than mainland China,

58
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,590
almost double the percentage in their legislature.

59
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,560
But all this is ultimately a distraction.

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,450
How so?

61
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,620
The Party doesn't really care about Tsai being
an unmarried woman.

62
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,330
What they're really worried about is how she
keeps using the "c" word

63
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,760
when talking about Taiwan.

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,069
Which "c" word is that?

65
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,830
“Country,” Chris.

66
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:33,110
Tsai called Taiwan a country several times
during her inauguration speech.

67
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,030
The same speech where she didn't refer to
China and Taiwan as "one China."

68
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,000
Yep.

69
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,220
And Party officials are getting worried that
their plan to subtly retake Taiwan

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,190
with economic incentives and promises of autonomy

71
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,629
aren't looking so good lately.

72
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,080
Yeah, especially since Hong Kong is turning
out

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,209
to not be the shining example of “one country,
two systems”

74
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,010
that they were hoping would convince Taiwan.

75
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,510
So that's why Wang called Tsai erratic.

76
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,209
Classic distraction.

77
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,260
Look at that craaaazy woman,

78
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,830
taking out her repressed need to have a family
by calling Taiwan a country.

79
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,090
And, in a way, I don't blame Wang for his
article, Chris.

80
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,859
You see, mainland Chinese of his generation

81
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,479
grew up being told that China and Taiwan weren't
really separated.

82
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,210
They were just, on a break.

83
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,409
They were both still part of one big, happy
China.

84
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,409
And people like Wang hoped that someday,

85
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,539
Taiwan and China were going to get back together.

86
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,319
It was looking up, for a while there.

87
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,580
Closer economic ties.

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,059
Increasing tourism.

89
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,409
Their leaders met in person for the first
time ever.

90
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:47,889
But now, it's looking like that break might
have been a break up after all.

91
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Thanks Shelley...

92
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:53,150
for opening the wounds of divorced families
everywhere.

93
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,979
