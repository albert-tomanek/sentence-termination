00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,860
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,840
Dunkirk makes a huge retreat in the Chinese market.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,880
The CCP wants to treat all foreign companies
equally...

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,800
badly.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,160
And finally, smile, you have KFC.

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,660
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,700
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,040
You know, the Chinese regime has always said

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,940
it doesn't want other countries to interfere

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,300
in its internal affairs.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,700
When it comes to the Chinese regime

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,910
interfering with other foreign companies,

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,210
the more interfery, the better.

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,170
The Chinese Communist Party has always required

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,230
that local Chinese companies above a certain
size

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,030
must have Communist Party branches

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,149
within their organization.

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,730
Well now, CCP “has exerted political pressure

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,809
on some [foreign] companies

20
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:55,789
to give CCP representatives in the joint ventures

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,149
the final say over business operations.”

22
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,180
This is great news for foreign companies,

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,589
because they're finally being treated equally
in China.

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,630
And you know what’s great about

25
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,280
having the CCP control your company?

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,700
Many things, I’m sure.

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,020
But one that comes to mind

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,090
is that the CCP will encourage companies

29
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,470
to make investments that

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,020
align with political objectives.

31
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,810
Like how the CCP told Chinese companies,

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,330
“You ought to invest in Venezuela.

33
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,100
Their socialist economy is gonna do great.”

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,159
Oops.

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,939
Chinese companies have lost between

36
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,869
3 and 5 billion dollars in Venezuela,

37
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,600
as the economy there continues to sputter.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,030
And those are just private investments,

39
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,509
outside the tens of billions the Chinese regime

40
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,310
has directly poured into the country.

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,310
According to a study

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,900
by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,

43
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,950
investing in Venezuela is even riskier

44
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,240
than investing in Iraq and Sudan.

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,640
Unsurprisingly,

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
many Chinese companies

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,409
have now left the Venezuelan marketplace.

48
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,009
But that’s not a retreat.

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,479
Because retreating is not a Chinese value.

50
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,049
That’s at least what I learned

51
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,860
from my favorite state-run media,

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,090
the Global Times,

53
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,479
in its review of the World War II film, Dunkirk.

54
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,930
“Dunkirk depicts a disastrous evacuation,

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,440
which is very different from traditional Chinese
values.”

56
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,970
Dunkirk is about the evacuation

57
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,760
of British troops in World War II

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,230
who were stranded across the English Channel

59
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,440
after retreating from the Nazis.

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,410
The British originally hoped they could rescue

61
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,239
30,000 of them,

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,239
but in the end

63
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,459
they rescued more than 330,000.

64
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,319
But that’s still a retreat.

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400
I mean, take the uber patriotic

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,190
Chinese film Wolf Warrior 2.

67
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,850
This hero doesn’t retreat.

68
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,720
He just kills... everybody.

69
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,900
Global Times calls it

70
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,019
“a Chinese-made patriotic movie

71
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,650
that literally sent a message that said:

72
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,269
‘The citizens of the People’s Republic
of China:

73
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,250
When you encounter danger overseas,

74
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,629
do not give up!

75
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:56,629
Please remember,

76
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,680
right behind you,

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,150
there is a powerful motherland!’”

78
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,970
I wonder what they’d have to say

79
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,130
about the Long March.

80
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,810
The guerrilla Chinese Communist army

81
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,780
was forced to, uhh,

82
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,310
heroically move backwards,

83
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,140
to avoid being killed by the army

84
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,970
of the government ruling China at the time.

85
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,590
And it was a great victory for the Communists.

86
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,220
Sure 19 out of every 20 soldiers

87
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,930
died or deserted.

88
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,459
But it was absolutely not a retreat.

89
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,250
In fact, it was uber patriotic.

90
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,030
Like China’s national anthem,

91
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,040
which is about marching ahead

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,099
in the face of enemy fire.

93
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,730
The lyrics might not be an accurate description

94
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,150
of what really happened in the Long March,

95
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,260
but you’d better not mince words when you
sing it.

96
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,950
Because a proposed Chinese law

97
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,470
could send you to jail for improper anthem
use.

98
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,720
So what constitutes improper use?

99
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,580
Well according to my less favorite state-run
media,

100
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Xinhua,

101
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,239
it would be playing it at “improper” occasions.

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,760
Or “maliciously” modifying the words.

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,620
What’s even more concerning

104
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,269
is that there’s talk of implementing

105
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,280
the same law in Hong Kong.

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,430
Which is just further proof that

107
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,000
when the Chinese Communist Party told the
UK

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that Hong Kong would have

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,020
“50 years no change,”

110
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,189
they actually meant 20 years.

111
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:13,910
You know, the 5 and the 2,

112
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,480
it’s easy to get confused.

113
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,030
Speaking of needless regulation,

114
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,310
I know you like your Netflix,

115
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,320
but in China,

116
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,930
the government is clamping down

117
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,500
on online dramas.

118
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,350
Because you know how to make good TV?

119
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,540
Get the government involved.

120
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,460
“The government will encourage

121
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,020
good television production…

122
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,900
[with] oversight of the ideological

123
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,509
and artistic merit of content.”

124
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,770
And now, Chinese dramas

125
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,520
will never ever surpass Korean dramas.

126
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,270
Way to go.

127
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,680
But it does make sense, in a way.

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,810
A lot of Chinese dramas are period pieces,

129
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,810
especially from the early days

130
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,150
of Communist Party rule.

131
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,750
Producers could accidentally make

132
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,210
some mistakes about history.

133
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,210
Political mistakes,

134
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,300
not factual mistakes.

135
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,830
Especially because the Chinese Communist Party

136
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,720
is in the middle of rewriting history.

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,380
Researchers have just discovered

138
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,770
that as historical documents from the 50s

139
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,009
are digitized,

140
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,830
dozens of articles have been removed,

141
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,610
“that questioned the Communist party’s
commitment

142
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,270
to the rule of law at the time.”

143
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,930
Wow, they were pretending

144
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,750
they had rule of law way back then too.

145
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,110
But while China in the 50s

146
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,870
saw terrible mass killing and famine,

147
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,669
today you can smile

148
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,639
and eat as much fried chicken as you want.

149
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,250
Because KFC in Hangzhou

150
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,660
has launched a pilot program

151
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,350
to let users pay...

152
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,410
with a smile.

153
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,410
To be clear,

154
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,639
you still have to pay with money.

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,660
It’s just that you can use your smile

156
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,840
to activate the payment

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
instead of your phone or credit card.

158
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,020
It uses that same kind of creepy

159
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
facial recognition software

160
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,500
the Chinese regime wants everywhere.

161
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,389
Now if that’s not a reason to smile,

162
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,820
I don’t know what is.

163
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Just don’t smile too much

164
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,680
or you might get a double charge.

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,210
Fortunately, if you’re like me,

166
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,800
after eating KFC,

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,470
you won’t want to smile for days.

168
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,910
And coming up after the break,

169
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,600
what do you think these two

170
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,860
just agreed to pay for?

171
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,980
Hey, if you really want to smile,

172
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,889
get on over to China Uncensored.tv.

173
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,981
There you’ll see loads more China Uncensored

174
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,850
you won’t see anywhere else,

175
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,080
including full half hour episodes.

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,250
And you don’t even have to pay for it.

177
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,400
However if you’d like to support China Uncensored,

178
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,729
also make a trip to the website

179
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,080
Patreon.com/ChinaUnceosred,

where you can contribute to the show!

181
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,660
That would make me smile.
