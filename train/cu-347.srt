00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,880
China launches the Three Child Policy

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,720
Is this reform?

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:15,920
Or more authoritarian madness?

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,800
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

be sure to hit that subscribe button,\h\h

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
and the notification bell. We have new\h

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,320
and Saturday. And YouTube often isn’t notifying\h
you, or it could be secretly unsubscribing you.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
This week, China announced a new three\h\h

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,280
child policy! That’s up from the\h
two child policy launched in 2016.

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,560
Reuters says this three-child\h
policy is a major policy shift.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,160
The New York Times says China\h
is “relaxing the policy”.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,200
And the Washington Post calls\h
it “a further unwinding of its\h\h

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,080
once-draconian regime of population control.”

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,640
Amazing. Every word of what they said is wrong.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
The Chinese Communist Party is not unwinding\h
its once draconian regime of population control.\h\h

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
It’s still there. Did you miss the\h
part where they called it a policy?!

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,000
The Party is still telling people\h
how many children they can have.\h\h

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,760
And the “family planning system” they set\h
up four decades ago is still in place.

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
The family planning system was\h
set up for the One Child Policy,\h\h

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,040
and it’s caused, “tens of millions\h
of abortions and sterilizations”

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
...with the “corrupt and brutal\h
family-planning officials\h\h

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
[who] demolished the homes of some who resisted”.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,840
Where, “Women had their menstrual cycles\h
recorded on blackboards, for all to see.”

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,960
And the three child policy certainly isn’t,\h\h

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,520
“a tacit recognition of the damage\h
done” as the Washington Post says.

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,600
Because the Communist Party will never\h
admit it did anything wrong. Even silently.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,720
For instance, have you heard\h
about the Hundred Childless Days?\h

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
It happened here, in Guan\h
County, Shandong Province.

29
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,960
Locals also call it the slaughter of lambs.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,280
In 1991, when you were watching\h
Rugrats , this Chinese county\h\h

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
“was deemed to have too high a birth\h
rate by the provincial government”.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,560
And so local officials marked 100 days where no\h
one was allowed to give birth. Think about what\h\h

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,080
that means. Anyone who was pregnant was forced\h
to have an abortion. It didn’t matter if it\h\h

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,440
was their first child. It didn’t matter how far\h
along into the pregnancy they were. Baby, gone.

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,160
Even if a woman had already\h
given birth, it didn’t matter.

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,880
“One local official claims that these ‘procedures’\h
were sometimes no more than a kick in the stomach\h\h

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,360
from an out-of-town mercenary. Children who did\h
make it into the world were reportedly strangled,\h\h

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
and their bodies tossed into open pits.\h\h

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,480
The families of pregnant women were publicly\h
shamed in reprises of the Cultural Revolution.”

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,160
Now that’s socialized medicine\h
with Chinese characteristics.

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,960
What the Chinese Communist Party will never do\h
is give Chinese people freedom. The freedom to\h\h

42
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,080
decide for themselves how they think they\h
should live, even in their private lives.\h\h

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,320
And when the Party tells people what’s best\h
for society—the Party always screws things up.

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,520
You see, back in the day, Chairman\h
Mao Zedong had the great idea that\h\h

45
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,800
a huge population would be good for China.\h
Well, not so much for China, but for him.

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,760
He said he wasn’t afraid of nuclear war\h
because, “China has a population of 600 million;\h\h

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
even if half of them are killed, there\h
are still 300 million people left.”

48
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,920
And so in the early 1950s, the Party began a mass\h
political campaign to encourage people to have\h\h

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,560
babies. They limited access to birth control.\h
And surprise! There was a population explosion.

50
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,840
But then, oh no, there was a population\h
explosion! Time for a mass political campaign.\h\h

51
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,840
The One Child policy started in 1979, and the\h
Party claims it prevented 400 million births.

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,080
But then, oh no! The population is shrinking!

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,640
I know, let’s have a mass political campaign\h\h

54
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:55,920
to encourage people to have more kids! And\h
in 2016, that meant the Two Child Policy.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,400
But even so, “Births have\h
dropped for four straight years.”

56
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Wow, sounds like the two child policy didn’t work.\h
I know! Let’s have a mass political campaign.\h\h

57
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,680
If the people didn’t like the two child\h
policy, they’ll love a three child policy!

58
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
This poll from state-run Xinhua asks, “Are\h
you ready for the three child policy?”\h\h

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,880
20,000 out of the 22,000 answers\h
said “I won’t consider it at all.”

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,960
Wrong answer! The poll was quickly deleted.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,280
There are deeper societal problems in China\h\h

62
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,840
that aren’t going to be solved just\h
by letting people have more kids.

63
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,560
Some Chinese men are literally\h
choosing vasectomies over kids.

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,960
There’s a lifestyle called “Double Income, No\h
Kids,” or DINK, for couples who don’t want to\h\h

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,680
have children. And it’s an increasingly\h
popular thing with Chinese millennials.\h

66
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,160
Yeah, after decades of the one child policy,\h\h

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Chinese people today don’t want more\h
kids. They kind of want no kids.

68
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,720
One problem is, “Intense workplace competition,\h
inadequate child care and widespread job\h\h

69
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
discrimination against pregnant women have made\h
childbearing an unappealing prospect for many.”

70
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,960
Again, those things aren’t\h
solved by a three-child policy.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
China is still a relatively poor country.\h\h

72
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:34,240
900 million people—that’s more than two thirds of\h
China—live on less than five dollars a day. Still.

73
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
A lot of parents had to leave their\h
kid behind in the countryside,\h\h

74
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,520
so they could move to cities and make enough\h
money to send back home to support that kid.\h\h

75
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
They couldn’t take their kid with\h
them, because of China’s hukou system,\h\h

76
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,520
which controls where people are allowed to\h
live. Yes, the Party controls that, too.

77
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,560
The New York Times interviewed one man who’s\h
living the DINK lifestyle, vasectomy and all,\h\h

78
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,760
because “[His] parents were factory\h
workers in southern Guangdong Province\h\h

79
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,120
and rarely came to visit\h
him in Hunan, his hometown.\h\h

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,640
They never developed a relationship with\h
him, even though he was their only child.”

81
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,920
So now he doesn’t want kids.

82
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
This is a big problem for the Communist Party.\h\h

83
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
“Demographers have long warned that the\h
rising number of Chinese people choosing\h\h

84
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,840
not to have children is a major reason\h
for the country’s shrinking population.”

85
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,680
So the real problem here is that the Party is\h
still letting people *choose* not to have kids!\h\h

86
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,280
Clearly the only thing to do is to *require*\h
people to have more kids. Problem solved.

87
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,520
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
fans who support us and our efforts to expose the\h\h

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,840
truth about the Chinese Communist Party\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

90
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
Nikolay asks,\h\h

91
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,760
“Chris, Can you speak Mandarin? I would love\h
to hear you saying "Taiwan is a country."

92
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,920
Nikolay’s question is in response to an episode\h
we did on Monday about John Cena. He got in\h\h

93
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,000
trouble with the China market for calling Taiwan a\h
country in a Mandarin interview he gave in Taiwan.

94
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,760
Now, obviously my Mandarin\h
cannot compare to John Cena.\h\h

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,400
However I do speak a little. But unlike John Cena,\h
I can say “Táiwān shì guójiā.” (台湾是国家) And I won’t\h\h

96
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,040
even apologize to the Chinese\h
Communist Party for saying it.

97
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,320
Thanks for your question\h
and your support, Nikolay.

98
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,000
And a big thank you to everyone who supports China\h
