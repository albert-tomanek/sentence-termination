00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,460
it's that time of year again...

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,300
time to walk the dog!

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,920
Not like that!

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,460
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,239
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,070
Every year, there’s a dog-eating festival

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,539
in southern China.

9
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,539
You may have heard of it:

10
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,820
The Yulin Dog Meat Festival.

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,949
But back in May,

12
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,770
Chinese animal rights activists announced

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,259
that after many years of protests,

14
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,039
local officials had finally told them

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,269
that this year,

16
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:32,800
they were banning dog meat sales

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,040
ahead of the festival.

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,260
Victory!

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,260
And that’s it!

20
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,850
Thanks for watching this episode of...

21
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,030
just kidding.

22
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,030
It turns out

23
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,710
there’s been a bit of a misunderstanding.

24
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,930
What officials actually meant was that t

25
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,250
he festival would continue as normal,

26
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,580
dog meat sales unbanned.

27
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,620
But don't worry.

28
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,600
officials and the dog meat vendors

29
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,859
reached a satisfactory agreement

30
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,970
that should satisfy the millions of people

31
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,970
around the world

32
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,880
who object to the festival.

33
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,240
“Vendors and officials reached a compromise

34
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,410
setting a limit of two dogs

35
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,050
displayed per stall.”

36
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,160
See, a two-dog limit

37
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,540
is almost as good as a ban, right?

38
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,780
Only two dogs per…

39
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,740
Okay, so that limit was ignored.

40
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,380
But at least some vendors

41
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,860
changed their signs,

42
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,840
so instead of dog meat,

43
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,180
it said tasty meat.

44
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,530
Much better.

45
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,530
Calling something tasty

46
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,960
definitely makes people think it's tasty.

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,500
About ten thousand dogs are killed

48
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,240
every year for the Yulin Dog Meat festival.

49
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
And every year,

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,780
it causes a huge international outcry,

51
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,790
because, well, puppies are only cute

52
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,380
when they're dressed as food.

53
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,220
But perhaps you’re like

54
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,880
my favorite state-run media,

55
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,170
and ask what’s the big deal

56
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,250
with eating dog?

57
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,410
I mean, Americans slaughter almost

58
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,640
10 million pigs per month!

59
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,170
This is a case of us American Imperialists,

60
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,790
“demanding non-Westerners change their eating
habits,

61
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,170
because they think their cultures and feelings

62
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,590
deserve more respect than others.

63
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,980
Such a condescending attitude

64
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,580
is not comfortable.”

65
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,640
Well, Global Times,

66
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,280
it’s not so much the fact

67
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,719
that they’re eating dog meat

68
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,520
that bothers most people.

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
It’s that the dogs are tortured and boiled

70
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,740
alive,

71
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,860
because “there is a belief that the adrenaline

72
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,480
released through the pain

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
makes the meat more tender

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,840
and provides health benefits.”

75
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,580
Right.

76
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:29,900
But even if you believe in

77
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,599
the supposed health benefits

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,550
of eating tortured animals,

79
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,900
you still might want to stay away.

80
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,959
Because most of these dogs are slaughtered

81
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,189
in disgustingly unsanitary conditions,

82
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,720
and a lot of them are extremely sick.

83
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,720
So yes,

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,859
we American imperialists, with our humane...

85
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,500
What's that shelley?

86
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,799
Do I know how factory farmed chickens are
killed?

87
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,330
Electrified water?

88
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,260
Throat-cutting machines?

89
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm...never eating drumsticks again.

90
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,080
Well, point taken about factory farming,

91
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,150
but at least animals in factory farms

92
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,450
aren’t tortured for the specific purpose

93
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,200
of making them tastier.

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,700
But more importantly,

95
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,020
there’s this one other fact—

96
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,200
and I don’t think this happens in America.

97
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,799
“About 90 percent of the dogs

98
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,650
are stolen on the streets

99
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,139
and stolen from people's yards

100
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,840
so a lot of the dogs that we rescue

101
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,530
have actual collars on."

102
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,640
Can’t we all agree

103
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,939
that stealing other people’s pets

104
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,700
and eating them is deeply uncool?

105
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,620
But before you start accusing Chinese people

106
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,940
of being dog-eating barbarians,

107
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,930
I have to tell you:

108
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,860
Dog-eating is really not mainstream Chinese
culture.

109
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,740
In fact, Chinese people

110
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,380
are some of the loudest voices

111
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,580
calling for an end to

112
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,660
the Yulin Dog Meat festival.

113
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,660
In fact,

114
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,340
throughout most of Chinese history,

115
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,650
eating dog was considered distasteful

116
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,860
and not at all common practice.

117
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,370
A lot of Chinese people

118
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,080
really love dogs,

119
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,120
and in China today,

120
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,459
pet ownership is on the rise.

121
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
So it’s little wonder

122
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,639
people are kind of upset

123
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,510
about their pets being stolen,

124
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,629
boiled alive,

125
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:06,019
and then eaten.

126
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,780
Now you’d think the local government ought

127
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,540
to do something about this.

128
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,960
Well, remember:

129
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,100
local officials are the ones

130
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,849
who came up with the compromise

131
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,499
that vendors could display, at most,

132
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:16,499
two dogs—

133
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,000
a regulation that wasn’t even being adhered
to.

134
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
And what about all the protests?

135
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,460
The government’s response to protests

136
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,750
has been to either crackdown on activists

137
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,880
or simply ignore the problem.

138
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,600
“What has the Yulin city government done?

139
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,070
They covered it up.

140
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,260
Firstly they don't mention

141
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,620
this extremely sensitive word anymore,

142
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,100
and secondly, they haven’t prevented

143
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,010
the killing of dogs or selling their meat.

144
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,410
They just require that businesses

145
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,290
selling dog meat in the market

146
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
cover up the words,

147
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,940
‘dog meat’ on their signs.”

148
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,060
Ah yes, if it doesn't say “dog meat”

149
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,060
on the signs,

150
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,460
then no one will know that the meat

151
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,170
at the “dog meat,”

152
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,230
excuse me,

153
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,820
“tasty meat” festival

154
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,160
is actually dog.

155
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,940
It’s a foolproof plan.

156
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
But each year,

157
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,190
the Yulin Dog Meat festival brings controversy

158
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,970
and tons of bad publicity to Yulin.

159
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,700
So why doesn’t the local government stop
it?

160
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,630
Well, because it relates to an even greater
issue

161
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,180
the Communist Party wants to cover up:

162
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,560
poverty.

163
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,780
Yulin is in Guangxi—

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,860
one of China’s poorest regions.

165
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,071
There is a huge number of people

166
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,380
who can’t find jobs

167
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,740
and many families struggle

168
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,530
to make ends meet.

169
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,760
According to The Independent,

170
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,280
“many of the dog meat sellers

171
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,640
are peasants or farmers

172
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,420
on a low income.

173
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,130
These people rely on dog meat

174
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,300
to raise money for their families...

175
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,900
the festival draws in big money

176
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,380
for local meat traders.”

177
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,460
So for these people,

178
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,080
the choice is grinding,

179
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,330
inescapable poverty,

180
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,910
or stealing people’s pets

181
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,910
and making some money

182
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,120
at the Yulin Dog Meat Festival.

183
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,810
A mainstay of Party propaganda

184
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,140
is that the Chinese regime

185
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,800
has liberated people from poverty.

186
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
The Party definitely does not want

187
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,970
the desperately poor rural masses

188
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,770
questioning that.

189
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,090
But how do local officials

190
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,340
keep up the money-making festival,

191
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,440
but get rid of the bad publicity?

192
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,420
Well, local officials came up with a briliant plan:

193
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,610
They tell animal rights activists on the down-low

194
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,460
that they’re going to ban the sale of dog
meat.

195
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,140
That makes headlines.

196
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,060
Then Yulin gets lots of good publicity

197
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,000
that the dog meat festival is over!

198
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,330
And then once the protests die down,

199
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,330
bam!

200
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,000
It’s hot dog season.

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hot dog season...

202
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,330
wait a minute,

203
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,160
I've got an idea!

204
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,960
One that could save Yulin's economy

205
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,510
and stop the dog meat industry.

206
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,550
What if instead of the Yulin Dog Meat Festival,

207
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,060
they changed it to the Yulin Hot Dog Festival.

208
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,220
Locals can stop killing pets

209
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,210
and start making sausages.

210
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,860
Nathan's could sponsor it.

211
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
And they'd get tons of great publicity.

212
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,940
Think about it.

213
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,860
Yulin:

214
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,640
Home of the World's Biggest Hot Dog.

215
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
And even we American imperialists

216
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,840
wouldn’t be able to say

217
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,730
anything bad about the festival,

218
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,020
since we have our own sacred

219
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,160
hot dog traditions,

220
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
passed down through tens of years.

221
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
So what do you think of

222
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,640
the Yulin Dog Meat Festival

223
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,560
or future Yulin Hot Dog Festival?
