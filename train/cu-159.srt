1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,080
The biggest sandstorm in a decade hits Beijing

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
What’s causing the pollution?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,120
And is the CCP’s solution working?\h

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,920
Or is it making things worse?

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,280
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,960
After a long, cold winter, spring\h
is finally just around the corner.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,600
Birds are chirping. Flowers are\h
blooming. And the air is full of...sand.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,160
Beijing on Monday was covered with thick\h\h

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,320
brown dust. China’s meteorological agency\h
called it the biggest sandstorm in a decade.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,520
The sky literally turned orange\h
as the sandstorm and pollution\h\h

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
sent air quality readings off the scale.\h

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,240
How far off the scale?

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,960
Some of you longtime viewers of China Uncensored\h
may remember me talking about the time the US\h\h

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,280
Embassy in China called the air quality\h
crazy bad. That happened back in 2010.\h

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Crazy bad was when the PM 2.5 air\h
quality index hit more than 500.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,640
This past Monday, it hit 700. And the PM 10 index,\h\h

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,760
which measures slightly bigger air\h
pollution particles, was over 9000.\h

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
Life imitates art.

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
And 9,000 is more than 180\h
times the healthy amount.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,840
So if more than 500 is Crazy Bad, more than\h
9,000 is Time to Get Out of China bad.\h

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah, definitely time to get out of China.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,800
"It looks like the end of the world.\h
Feels like it’s impossible to go outside."

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,240
But you know what, humans are resilient.\h
Even during the end of the world,\h\h

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
people were walking around,\h
constantly looking at their phones.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
That must be a really important email.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Maybe everyone is on their phones because\h
they’re checking the air quality index.\h

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,440
But you know what? At least everyone has\h
masks now, thanks to the coronavirus.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Although you have to wonder whether\h
a surgical mask is really enough to\h\h

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
keep you from inhaling all that dust.\h

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,320
This guy has the right idea. Until he’s\h
arrested for looking like a Hong Kong protester.

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,760
But as some people braved the sandstorm\h
outside, Chinese netizens responded to\h\h

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,840
the post-apocalyptic environment the\h
only way they could: they memed it.

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
Like I said, humans are resilient.\h

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,040
Although the photos I just\h
showed you were all from Beijing,\h\h

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,320
the sandstorm actually stretched across China.\h\h

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,520
It whipped across 12 different provinces, from\h
Beijing all the way to Gansu and Xinjiang.\h

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,320
But of course it makes the international\h
news because it affects Beijing,\h\h

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,960
where all the foreign correspondents are.

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,320
Plus, if we were talking about\h
a sandstorm that hit Gansu,\h\h

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,720
Americans would be like, what’s a\h
Gansu? Oh wait, is that the knife?

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Meanwhile, in Xinjiang, the sandstorm was actually\h
a good thing, because the persecuted Uyghurs\h\h

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
could use it to hide from all\h
of the surveillance cameras.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,880
Years ago, there were frequent sandstorms\h
in Beijing, as well as just terrible air\h\h

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,240
pollution in general. Smog and sandstorms would\h
be especially bad around this time of year.\h

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,600
After tons of bad press, the\h
Chinese Communist Party did take\h\h

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,360
action to improve air quality,\h
like by banning coal usage.\h

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
And it did improve the air\h
quality in general in Beijing.\h

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,440
But that may be in jeopardy again. Because\h
the Chinese Communist Party is once again\h\h

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
expanding their coal plant\h
capacity to boost the economy.

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Which means more air pollution. But don’t\h
worry! Under the Paris Climate Agreement,\h\h

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,120
China has until 2030 to\h
reach peak carbon emissions.\h

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
That’s plenty of time to build more coal plants.\h

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,720
But my favorite Chinese state-run media,\h\h

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
the Global Times, would like everyone to know\h
that there are blue skies again in Beijing.

55
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,800
And also that the sandstorm\h
originated in Mongolia.

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,000
And that it’s definitely not related\h
to the failure of one of the Communist\h\h

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,120
Party’s biggest environmental projects.\h
Which I’ll tell you about after the break.

58
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,960
Welcome back. Northern China has seen the worst\h\h

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,200
sandstorm in a decade. And the Chinese\h
Communist Party would like you know,\h\h

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,080
it has absolutely nothing to do with the failure\h
of China’s Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program.

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,320
What is the Three-North\h
Shelterbelt Forest Program?\h\h

62
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,680
It’s also known as the Great Green Wall\h
or sometimes the Green Great Wall. They\h\h

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,560
really should get their names straight.\h
Anyway, it’s a massive plan started in 1978\h\h

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,280
to plant millions of trees to stop\h
the northern deserts from spreading.\h

65
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,800
Sure, it sounds cool. But it’s just like\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s other massive\h\h

66
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,840
environmental engineering projects, like\h
the South-North Water Transfer Project,\h\h

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,960
or the Three Gorges Dam. The plan is to conquer\h
nature, whether that’s a good idea or not.

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,960
The most recent phase of the Great\h
Green Wall, started in the mid-2000s,\h\h

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,680
called for “planting more than 9 million acres\h
of forest at a cost of up to $8 billion.”

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,520
But it turns out there’s a problem. It’s\h
hard to plant trees in areas that have\h\h

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,960
been desert for thousands of years.\h
And it’s probably also a bad idea.

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
One prominent ecologist has talked about how\h
the Great Green Wall has “accelerated ecological\h\h

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,400
degeneration by putting pressure on precious\h
water resources in arid and semi-arid regions.”

74
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,480
In one arid part of Gansu province, “Of the 53,000\h
hectares of trees planted in the last few decades,\h\h

75
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,440
a quarter has died and the rest are dwarf trees,\h
lacking any capacity to protect the soil.”

76
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
Meanwhile, the trees sucked up what little water\h\h

77
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,840
was in the soil. That caused the groundwater\h
level to drop by as much as 131 feet.

78
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,760
So this attempt to conquer\h
nature by planting trees\h\h

79
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,640
has actually caused the region to become\h
even more of a desert than it was before.

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,560
Another problem is that authorities have planted\h
mostly the same tree species, which means\h\h

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,360
that disease can easily wipe them out.

82
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,480
“The vulnerability to disease, compounded with\h
its rapid exhaustion of soil and water resources,\h\h

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,080
makes single-species forests ‘green deserts.’”

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
So this Great Green Wall is\h
costing billions of dollars,\h\h

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
it’s not really working, and in some areas\h
it’s actually making the problem worse.

86
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,960
Environmentalism with Chinese characteristics.

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,360
Ecologists have proposed just restoring\h
the natural grasslands instead,\h\h

88
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
which would be much easier and\h
better for the environment.\h

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,480
Well that’s not going to happen.\h\h

90
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,560
Because this massive political campaign is\h
about planting trees, not stupid grass. Local\h\h

91
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,880
officials need to be able to claim they’ve planted\h
millions of trees, so they can get promoted. Duh.

92
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
And according to Chinese state-run media,\h\h

93
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,760
the Green Great Wall is definitely\h
keeping the sand at bay.

94
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
Except when it’s not.

95
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,680
And now it’s time for me to answer\h
a question from a loyal viewer who\h\h

96
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,640
supports China Uncensored on the\h
crowdfunding website Patreon.

97
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,360
Ringleader asks,\h

98
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,640
Chris, we know that most of the China/Russia\h
deals are a marriage of convenience.\h\h

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,360
How long do you think it will take till\h
they decide to turn on one another?

100
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,240
Why Ringleader, are you suggesting that these\h
bestest buddies might turn on each other\h\h

101
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
when their relationship is no longer useful?\h\h

102
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
Do gold-plated friendship\h
medals mean nothing anymore?\h

103
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,720
What about pancakes? They bonded over pancakes!

104
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,720
I mean, Xi Jinping even got special Russian\h\h

105
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,000
ice cream from “best and bosom\h
friend” Putin for his birthday.

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,520
I never want to see the words Putin, Xi,\h
and bosom in the same sentence again.\h

107
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,680
Anyway, Ringleader, you’re right these\h
BFFs could drop each other at any time.\h\h

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
But they won’t in the foreseeable future.\h

109
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,040
That’s because there’s one thing that unites these\h
two, more than friendship medals, or ice cream,\h\h

110
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,760
or even pancakes: Their common enemy, the United\h
States. And as long as they need each other to\h\h

111
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,640
oppose the US in the United Nations, or elsewhere\h
around the world, this friendship is rock solid.

112
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Thanks for your question, Ringleader.\h\h
