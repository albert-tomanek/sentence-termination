1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,860
This Chinese banker had a big apartment

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,399
full of luxury goods.

3
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:09,580
But it left her feeling so empty.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:18,099
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:20,630
Is it possible to have too much money?

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,460
If you have massive student loan debt, the
answer is probably no.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,189
But if you’re a corrupt Chinese Communist
Party member, the answer might just be yes.

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,590
It happens when you have so much money, you
can’t spend it, because then people would

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,670
get suspicious.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,000
Yet people keep bribing you with more and
more money.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,890
And if you turn it down, people will also
get suspicious.

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,289
So what’s a poor corrupt Party Member to
do?

13
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,000
The answer is, buy a second apartment to hide
all your luxury goods.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,120
That’s what happened to Chinese banker Wang
Li.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,229
From the young age of 17, hardworking Li had
successfully climbed her way into the Chinese

16
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,520
Communist Party as Secretary and eventually
Chair of the Bank of Qinghai.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,850
Most recently, she held the role of Deputy
Director of the Qinghai Provincial Local Financial

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,659
Supervision Administration.

19
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,090
That job included regulating financial institutions
to make sure they’re not corrupt.

20
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,570
And along the way, she accepted a huge amount
of bribes.

21
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,780
Li took advantage of her position as chairman
and president of Qinghai Bank to embezzle

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,860
public funds.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,040
The amount was so large, she may have suffered
a mental breakdown...from too much power and

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
greed.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,450
“[Wang Li] took herself to be more like
a private boss.”

26
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,649
“She compared herself with her associates
who were bosses of private enterprises, and

27
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,130
that caused a psychological imbalance.”

28
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,520
Li had surrounded herself with the heads of
various financial corporations, and watched

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,729
as they spent lavish amounts of money.

30
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:12,451
And since she had invested most of her working
life to the development of Qinghai Bank, she

31
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:16,819
got the idea that the bank’s money was basically
her own.

32
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:23,370
Li began accepting whatever bribes came her
way, whether it was money or luxury goods.

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,819
And she even took out loans from Qinghai Bank
that she never paid back.

34
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,940
It got to the point where she had to buy a
separate apartment without her husband’s

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,370
knowledge—just so she could have a place
to hide all of the luxury goods she’d accepted.

36
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,140
Eventually, she got caught.

37
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,920
And the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection made a video exposing her secret

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,379
life, including her apology-slash-forced-confession.

39
00:02:53,379 --> 00:03:01,099
The possessions that Wang Li accumulated included
piles of watches, gold bars, stacks of US

40
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:08,400
dollars, as well as jars of a local Qinghai
province treasure: Musk!

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,630
If you’re wondering what musk is, it’s
“The dry secretions of mature [musk deer]

42
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,590
males located in the gland between the belly
button and the genitals, and it was once used

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,750
as a raw material for perfume.”

44
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,030
Yes, rich people want to smell like the glands
of a dead deer.

45
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,510
Unless they want to smell like whale poop.

46
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,830
And just like whale poop, musk is very expensive.

47
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,330
Musk deer are an endangered species, and the
trade in musk is highly regulated.

48
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:46,549
So Wang Li had her musk, but couldn’t do
anything with it except keep it in a jar.

49
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:48,030
Just like her feelings.

50
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,189
Wang Li also kept a hidden safe in her apartment,
which supposedly contained keys to other safes

51
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,159
that held information about her corrupt associates.\h

52
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,340
But Wang Li’s secret apartment was a sanctuary
only she could enjoy.

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,000
She had an entire dresser stocked with luxury
brand silk scarves, each one worth upwards

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,629
of 600 US dollars.

55
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:19,660
Plus a closet full of more than 40 famous
name brand bags estimated to be worth more

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,980
than 60,000 dollars.

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,950
But as I mentioned, Wang Li had a problem.

58
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,660
She could not actually enjoy the luxury items
she received over the years, because she was

59
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,480
too scared to be seen outside of the house
wearing them.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,640
“[Wang Li] said her biggest sorrow was that
her apartment was the only place she could

61
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
find peace.

62
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,590
Her biggest happiness was that she could wear
all these luxury items and look at herself

63
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,590
in the mirror.

64
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,440
In fact she was awfully conflicted and suffered.”

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,760
So she’d just stand alone in front of the
mirror wearing her favorite silk scarves?

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,510
Does luxury really mean anything if you can’t
show it off?\h

67
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,030
In her final repentance video, this is what
Wang Li had to say.

68
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,870
“I think all money comes and goes, really.

69
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:24,750
Especially for someone like me who was fortunate
enough to be under the care of an organization.

70
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,390
I was already well off.

71
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,400
In fact, the money was entirely unnecessary
for me to have.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Yet…

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,550
I still accepted many things I should not
have accepted.

74
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:47,053
Truth be told, all the money and luxury items
in the end just go with you to the grave.

75
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:48,053
They have no purpose.”

76
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:49,053
“After leaving my job and my organization,
I felt soulless and spineless.

77
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,053
Just a pile of skin and bones sprawled on
the floor.

78
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:52,010
I didn’t know what I had until I lost it.

79
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,810
This is my greatest despair.”

80
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,030
Poor rich Wang Li is hardly alone.

81
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,240
The scale of corruption among Chinese Communist
Party members is hard to imagine.

82
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,820
We know a little bit from videos like this
one that come out from time to time.

83
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,520
We also showed you one a few weeks ago, about
the Chinese official who had 100 mistresses

84
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,470
and 3 metric tons of secret cash.

85
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,210
One little slip up and you’re done.

86
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,210
Like this guy, Yang Dacai.

87
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:30,940
A local official who was caught on camera
back in 2012 wearing luxury wristwatches.\h

88
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,340
Chinese netizens started calling him Brother
Wristwatch.

89
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,390
And then he was sentenced to 14 years in prison
for corruption.

90
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,940
Yeah, that’s why Wang Li only wore her fancy
scarves in her secret apartment.\h

91
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,660
But Wang Li and Brother Wristwatch are only
the few people who get caught—or get taken

92
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,500
down in anti-corruption campaigns.

93
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,880
And there are lots more who don’t get caught.

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,560
But that doesn’t mean they’re living the
good life.

95
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,460
What good is money and luxury if you’re
living in fear that one day, you’ll be the

96
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,580
next Wang Li?

97
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,900
And this is the problem with the Communist
Party.

98
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,270
A lot of high ranking Chinese officials are
extremely rich.

99
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,180
For example, China’s National People’s
Congress has 93 billionaires, and countless

100
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,310
millionaires.

101
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,210
But since so many of them got their money
through corrupt means, they can be taken down

102
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,180
at any time if they fall out of favor.

103
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,400
And that’s one reason why they have to do
whatever the Communist Party tells them.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,080
It’s a tough life.

105
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,680
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a viewer who supports China Uncensored

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,150
on Patreon.

107
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,990
Leslie Soule asks: “With Gavin Newsom (governor
of California) having completed a $1 billion

108
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,460
mask deal with China, and Dianne Feinstein
having had a Chinese spy on her payroll for

109
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,590
years, what other connections do you think
might exist, between California leadership

110
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,020
and China and/or the CCP?

111
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,360
Well Leslie, there are lots of connections.

112
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,910
Not just the people you mentioned.

113
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:16,230
There’s a long string of San Francisco mayors
connected with China, as well as other politicians.

114
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,310
For example, current San Francisco mayor London
Breed, pictured here with the Chinese Consul

115
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,800
General.

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,990
In February last year, Chinese state-run media
praised her for hosting Chinese New Year at

117
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,020
City Hall, and inviting the Consul General.

118
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,940
“He pledged to work with San Francisco to
bolster its ties with Shanghai.”

119
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,330
And later London Breed said that photos of
China locking up its own people during Covid

120
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,520
helped convince her to lock down San Francisco.

121
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:56,500
Because the China model really screams success.

122
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,810
Now some California politicians simply don’t
understand the nature of the Chinese Communist

123
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,010
Party.

124
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,130
They think they’re dealing with a normal
government, and such-and-such trade sounds

125
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,260
like a good deal.

126
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,220
But they’re actually dealing with a gangster
regime.

127
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,520
And it affects policy.

128
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,580
Like when the California state legislature
shelved a resolution that would have supported

129
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,890
Falun Gong—because they got pressure from
the Chinese consulate.

130
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,270
Falun Gong is a spiritual group that’s persecuted
in China.

131
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,530
They’re beaten and often sent to labor camps
to be killed for their organs.

132
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,100
Or as the California legislature would say...

133
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,630
Good job, California.

134
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,280
It’s not just California, though.

135
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,610
For years, the Chinese Communist Party has
spent a lot of effort trying to get local

136
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,720
and state officials on their side.

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,360
After all, a local California city councilman
could one day get elected to Congress.

138
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,710
So it’s a great idea to start spying on
him early.

139
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,760
In fact, maybe I should do an episode on how
the Chinese Communist Party targets local

140
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
US officials.

141
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,200
Let me know if you’d like to see that in
the comments below.\h

142
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,190
