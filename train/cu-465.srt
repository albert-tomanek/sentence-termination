1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,670
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,030
I wonder what China will buy

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,430
with its new military budget.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,050
The US sends an Aircraft Carrier to Vietnam.

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,940
And finally, the sky isn’t falling.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,580
That’s just China’s out of control space
station.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,540
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,080
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,470
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,160
First, an update from last week.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,849
The Chinese military got the big pay raise

12
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:30,920
they were asking for.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,190
175 billion dollars.

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,210
That’s a jump from last year.

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,690
But it still can’t compare to the United
States.

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,149
The Pentagon is asking for one of

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,559
the biggest budget boosts in US history.

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,620
“We will have a military like we’ve never
had before.

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,780
We’re going to have an incredible military.”

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,140
I assume that means we’re finally getting
Jaegers.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,010
The increase in China’s military spending

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,670
comes along with China keeping

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,690
a projected GDP growth

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,140
of six and half percent this year.

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,010
At least, that’s what Chinese premier

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,080
Li Keqiang announced.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,449
Think they’ll succeed?

28
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:08,270
Well, considering Li Keqiang also once said,

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,860
“China’s GDP figures are ‘man-made’

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,930
and therefore unreliable,”

31
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,210
...I’d say yes,

32
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,210
they have a pretty good chance

33
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,920
of hitting that six and half percent target.

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,409
has criticized Chinese investment in Africa.

36
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,160
“Chinese investment does have

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,300
the potential to address

38
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,729
Africa's infrastructure gap

39
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,870
but its approach has led to mounting debt

40
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,230
and few, if any, jobs in most countries.

41
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,299
When coupled with the political

42
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,409
and fiscal pressure,

43
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,820
this endangers Africa's natural resources

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,690
and its long-term economic,

45
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,720
political stability.”

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,860
Recently, the Chinese Communist Party

47
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,189
has been using what’s called

48
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,450
the One Belt, One Road Initiative

49
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,720
to offer big loans to developing nations

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,340
around the world.

51
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,490
But the Party has been offering

52
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,799
infrastructure loans to African countries

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,799
for years.

54
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,549
It’s been called a new form of colonialism.

55
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,520
In particular, it’s been a great way

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,130
for the Chinese regime to drain

57
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,520
African countries of their natural resources.

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,150
But it still has been unable to make inroads

59
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,290
into the wealthiest African nation:

60
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,290
Wakanda.

61
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,030
The Communist Party would love to get

62
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,730
their hands on some of that sweet,

63
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,099
sweet vibranium.

64
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,360
A US aircraft carrier visited Vietnam,

65
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,120
and, unlike last time,

66
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,200
it didn’t kill anyone.

67
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,209
This is the first carrier visit to Vietnam

68
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:31,080
since the fall of Saigon in 1975.

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,770
It’s a four day port of call.

70
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,340
Crew will visit a hospital and center

71
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,370
for victims of some rather nasty weapons

72
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,400
used by the US during the Vietnam War.

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,420
Like Agent Orange.

74
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,379
That sounds like fun.

75
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,770
The reason the US and Vietnam

76
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,500
are burying the hatchet,

77
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,620
or the Agent Orange as it were,

78
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,540
is because Vietnam is at least

79
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,930
less upset at the US than at China.

80
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,180
The Chinese regime has been

81
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,379
aggressively expanding in the South China
Sea,

82
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,970
in waters claimed by Vietnam.

83
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,650
And considering the violent history

84
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,480
between China and Vietnam over

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,510
the last, say, thousand years,

86
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,980
Vietnam is having flashbacks.

87
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,500
Of course Chinese state-run media

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,349
says they totally don’t care.

89
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,470
Totally.

90
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,690
And it’s not just Vietnam.

91
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,970
The Chinese regime has angered

92
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,650
a lot of its neighbors because of

93
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,910
territorial conflicts in the South China Sea.

94
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,470
But at least the Chinese Communist Party

95
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,070
cares deeply about the region’s environment.

96
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,540
That’s why they’re building a marine park.

97
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,569
My favorite state-run media

98
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,060
the Global Times wrote,

99
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,239
“Protection of unique and rich resources

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,170
in the South China Sea has always

101
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,840
been given great importance,

102
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,470
especially when some of the resources,

103
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,720
such as coral reefs,

104
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,530
are very fragile.”

105
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,000
And the Chinese regime really does

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,390
care about protecting the coral reefs.

107
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,520
Especially now that the coral reefs

108
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,630
in the region are almost complete gone.

109
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,990
Because they were destroyed

110
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,450
by the Chinese regime.

111
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,049
And the most powerful man, Xi Jinping,

112
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,189
may have another title added to his growing
list—

113
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,540
one that already includes General Secretary

114
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,930
of the Communist Party,

115
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,250
President of the nation,

116
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,940
and Commander-in-Chief of the military.

117
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,930
His newest title:

118
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,930
Living Bodhisattva.

119
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,470
That’s a sort of buddha-on-earth,

120
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,850
who carries out acts of compassion

121
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,550
to help mankind.

122
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,980
Ok, this may not be his official

123
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,580
Communist Party title—

124
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,440
remember, they’re atheist.

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,711
But the Party secretary

126
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,580
of the largely Tibetan province of Qinghai,

127
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,500
Wang Guosheng, said that Tibetans who live
there

128
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,110
have been saying they view Xi Jinping

129
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,110
as a deity.

130
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,889
I mean, it makes sense.

131
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:44,889
Xi Jinping

132
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,030
is incredibly powerful.

133
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,500
He just granted himself the role

134
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,270
of president-for-life.

135
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,310
People have photos of him in their homes and
even churches

136
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,340
And he can use supernatural powers to generate
GDP growth.

137
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,750
Ok, so in Chinese,

138
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,180
it’s kind of like calling someone

139
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,510
“a living saint”

140
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,320
so Party Secretary Wang

141
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,009
might not have been that serious.

142
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,550
But it was still some impressive brown-nosing.

143
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,690
Especially since it’s also a slight dig

144
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,460
at the Dalai Lama.

145
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,770
Traditionally the Dalai Lama

146
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,990
is considered the living reincarnation

147
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,360
of a specific bodhisattva.

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,940
And Party Secretary Wang said that

149
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,910
the Tibetans see only Xi Jinping

150
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,150
as a living bodhisattva.

151
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,790
Ooo, burn.

152
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,590
And just a friendly reminder.

153
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,030
China’s out of control space station,

154
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,680
called Tiangong-1, is expected to crash land

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,830
somewhere on Earth in the next few weeks.

156
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,030
Usually when a satellite falls out of orbit,

157
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,930
it mostly burns up in the atmosphere.

158
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,520
But according to the US funded Aerospace Corporation,

159
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,900
“There is a chance that

160
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,980
a small amount of Tiangong-1 debris

161
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,330
may survive reentry and impact the ground.”

162
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,230
Where will it fall?

163
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,230
Aerospace uses this map to show

164
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,630
where it’s most likely to land.

165
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,750
The highest probability is in the yellow areas.

166
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,280
Hey, wait a minute,

167
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,020
I’m in one of the yellow areas.

168
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,000
What’s that, Shelley?

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,260
The odds of it hitting anyone

170
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,220
are a million times smaller

171
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,150
than winning the lottery?

172
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,150
Oh good.

173
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,150
I think.

174
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,150


175
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,150
If you do end up having

176
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,340
a close encounter with Tiangong-1,

177
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,920
there may be a highly toxic

178
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,600
and corrosive fuel on board,

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,370
so please, don’t touch the debris

180
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,390
or inhale any vapors it may emit.

181
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,390
So what do you think?

182
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,710
Leave your comments below.

183
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,710
Thanks for watching this episode

184
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,759
of China Uncensored.

185
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,380
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

186
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
See you next time.

187
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,580
Well the Chinese Communist Party

188
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,940
