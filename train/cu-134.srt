1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,959
Is there a bright side to the deadly Coronavirus
outbreak?

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,060
The Chinese Communist Party has found one

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,260
In the most horrifying way you can imagine

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,160
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,369
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:19,630
You know, say what you will

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,540
about the Chinese Communist Party,

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,070
you have to admire their relentless optimism.

9
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,720
Take the coronavirus outbreak for instance.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,460
Now *you* might be completely overwhelmed

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,320
by this immense human tragedy.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
But the Communist Party can see the silver
lining.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,690
For example, greenhouse gas emissions are
down!

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,899
How’s that for some good news?

15
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,010
Or how about this,

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,850
China spares no effort to improve

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,090
governance capability amid epidemic.

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,570
That sounds impressive right?

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,989
Until you realize that “governance capability”

20
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:54,410
is a nice way of saying Mao-style social control.

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,180
Now to be fair to the Communist Party,

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,239
it’s not clear if it is using the coronavirus
as an *excuse*

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,649
to ratchet up the authoritarianism.

24
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,970
Or if ratcheting up the authoritarianism

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,659
is the only way they know how to deal with
the coronavirus.

26
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:09,350
It’s a “which came first,

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,880
the chicken or the egg” situation.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
Either way, I think we can all agree that

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,130
the people in China had too much freedom.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,530
Which is why, as authorities “crack down”
on the coronavirus,

31
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,210
they’re abducting and beating up citizens
across the country.

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,420
And holding them to the ground and...

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,150
spraying them with disinfectant?

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,649
I don’t think that’s how this works.

35
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,899
Or simply welded into their homes,

36
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,950
where I really hope they have enough food.

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,420
These people were playing Mahjong,

38
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,210
when authorities busted in

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,550
and really showed that table who’s boss.

40
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,580
That’s because mahjong and card games have
been banned.

41
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,649
There’s a reason why an epidemic disease

42
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,540
is being treated the same way the Party

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,990
treats political dissidents.

44
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,610
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has fired

45
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,829
both the party secretary of Hubei province

46
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,320
and the party secretary of the city of Wuhan,

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,409
where the coronavirus outbreak began.

48
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,049
In case you don’t know,

49
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:07,610
the Party secretary outranks

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,230
the governor or mayor of the same region.

51
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,730
In Communist China,

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,830
it’s the Party members who are really in
charge.

53
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,290
So who did Xi Jinping replace

54
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,800
the Party secretary of Hubei province with?

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,850
Why, Xi Jinping’s close ally Ying Yong.

56
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,020
He’s a good friend of Xi Jinping’s.

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,020
He,

58
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,530
“rose through the political ranks in Zhejiang
Province,

59
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,790
where Mr. Xi himself began his climb to power.”

60
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,190
And Ying Yong got loads of experience dealing
with sick people

61
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,970
when he worked in the “Public Security Bureau,

62
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,110
including [positions] overseeing antidrug
and antiterrorism agencies.”

63
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,000
Because anyone who is against the Party,

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
must be sick.

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,470
Like the young woman in Hubei province

66
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,990
who became an internet celebrity

67
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,690
for complaining about the lack of treatment
she got at a hospital.

68
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,250
“She was coerced into making a ‘confession’
video

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,030
in which she told her followers not to ‘spread
false rumors’

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,140
and to respect the country and its communist
leaders.”

71
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,500
Fortunately, these kinds of complaints will
happen less and less.

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,820
Because censors are using WeChat and Twitter

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,150
to find and silence people who are sharing

74
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,790
non-state approved messages about the coronavirus.

75
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,420
Giving the state apparatus more power to control
people

76
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,210
is also very effective at helping them distribute
aid.

77
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:28,340
Sure, warehouses full of donated food in the
city of Ezhou go to rot.

78
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,000
But the family members of police get plenty.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,450
This video is from the wife of a police officer
in Ezhou.

80
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,700
She talks about getting so much food that

81
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,740
she’s going to give extras to her relatives.

82
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,740
Sharing is caring.

83
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,520
Of course most grocery stores still manage
to get supplies.

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,160
Unless police come in to confiscate the goods.

85
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,460
Don’t worry,

86
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,150
they put it back after they got caught on
camera.

87
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,200
Now obviously, in the pursuit of doing what’s
best for the people,

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
Party officials might make a few mistakes.

89
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,660
Like how their severe lockdown meant that
a child

90
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,800
got locked in his home with his dead grandfather.

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,380
But as of two weeks ago,

92
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,380
Party officials in Wuhan

93
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,050
had the crematoriums working 24/7.

94
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,640
And effective quarantine procedures are strictly
enforced,

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,020
like by putting people in boxes on the back
of trucks.

96
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,760
Wow, she sure is screaming.

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,100
I mean, the box is tiny,

98
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,470
but how scary could it be?

99
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,080
Unless you believe this account from a former
patient in Wuhan,

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,240
who told a taxi driver about seeing other
patients

101
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,840
being put in body bags

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,160
and being sent to crematoriums while still
alive.

103
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,800
Now, this video hasn’t been independently
verified.

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,230
And we haven’t heard other reports like
it.

105
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,480
But, considering the Chinese Communist Party

106
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,430
is killing political and religious prisoners
for their organs...

107
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,070
...the idea they’ve uh, “disposed of”

108
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,590
sick patients who are still alive,

109
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,930
becomes unfortunately less far fetched.

110
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,620
But don’t worry,

111
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,860
because the Chinese Communist Party

112
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,560
has definitely ensured basic human rights
in its virus fight.

113
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,740
What do you think about the growing authoritarianism
in China?

114
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,320
Let me know in the comments below.

115
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,990
Take a moment to subscribe to this channel
before you go,

116
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,070
even if you already subscribed,

117
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,500
because YouTube has apparently been unsubscribing
fans

118
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,550
with no notification.

119
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,550
And remember,

120
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,080
YouTube is targeting all our coverage of the
coronavirus.

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,150
They try to pressure us to stop covering it

122
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,870
by demonetizing our episodes.

123
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,300
But they can’t stop us as long as we have

124
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,980
the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army.

125
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,900
Those are the fans of the show who support
us

126
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,460
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

127
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,460
As a thank you to them,

128
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,510
I answer their questions at the end of some
of my episodes.

129
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,470
Today’s question comes from Logan.

130
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,680
“Did YouTube tell you exactly what Chris
said

131
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,790
that got you guys in trouble?

132
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,230
Do you have any strikes against your channel?”

133
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,910
Ah, I think Logan is talking about our recent
episode,

134
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,320
China’s Coronavirus “Cure.”

135
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,480
If you need a reminder what that cure was,

136
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,960
it was this.

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,640
A lot happened after we published that episode.

138
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,430
First YouTube instantly demonetized it.

139
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,870
No reason was given.

140
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,870
We appealed.

141
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,810
It was reviewed by a human,

142
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,580
and then permanently demonetized.

143
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,500
No reason was given.

144
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,130
Then three days after it was published,

145
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,970
YouTube completely removed the video from
the internet.

146
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,900
No reason given.

147
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
We appealed it and made

148
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,160
a lot of noise about it on social media,

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,050
and then YouTube relanted and put it back
up.

150
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,770
But then YouTube age restricted the video.

151
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,780
Again, no reason given.

152
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,880
This all means you still can’t see it

153
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,160
if you’re not signed into a YouTube account.

154
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,230
That kills the views.

155
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,230
We appealed that,

156
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,460
but so far, no response.

157
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,370
Now obviously none of that makes any sense.

158
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,400
And since YouTube is being entirely silent
on it,

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,530
we have no idea what happened.

160
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,550
So far there are no actual strikes against
our channel.

161
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,400
We’ve published more than a thousand episodes,

162
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
and there have been zero strikes

163
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,460
for anything like copyright violations,

164
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,620
illegal things, etc.

165
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,870
Strikes would actually risk

166
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,710
the entire channel getting shut down.

167
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,460
Of course I really can’t say I know

168
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
what would constitute a strike

169
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,590
and who we would talk to if someday YouTube

170
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,540
really did decide to take down China Uncensored.

171
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,010
But that’s why your support on Patreon is
so important.

172
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,260
It gives us the flexibility

173
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,710
we need to be able to keep making the show

174
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,960
no matter what curveballs YouTube and Google
try to throw at us.

175
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,830
Thanks for your question Logan.

176
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,210
And if you’d like to join the China Uncensored
50-cent army,

177
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,340
go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn
more.

178
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,669
