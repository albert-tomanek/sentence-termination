00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,760
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,060
Look! Up in the sky!

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:03,860
It’s a bird!

4
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,120
It’s a plane!

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,220
It’s the Chinese Dream!

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,500
Bad news everyone.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,480
Superman is dead.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,900
Yes, the Man of Steel, and of Tomorrow,

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,930
the Last Son of Krypton

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,180
Clark Kent

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,860
died tragically of a lingering illness

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,320
after once again saving the world.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,240
By his side were Wonder Woman,

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Supergirl,

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,370
the guy whose mother was also named Martha,

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,540
whoever these people are,

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,920
and of course, Lois Lane.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,120
Also present at his death

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,920
was a bearded version of himself from an alternate
dimension.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,300
I don’t know, it's the comics.

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,560
How will DC comics fill this hole in our hearts?

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,120
After all, they've only killed Superman nine
or ten times before.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,660
Once when He-Man stabbed him in the chest.

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,530
Well, it turns out there's no need to worry,

26
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,870
because DC Comics has a little something up
their sleeve.

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,120
This guy!

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,950
The New Super-Man.

29
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,780
You know, something looks a little different.

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,720
Something that more traditional Superman purists
may take issue with.

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,030
Yes, I'm of course talking about

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,560
this dash in the middle.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,700
The copy editors are going to be upset over
this one.

34
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,881
Oh, and I don’t think this Superman

35
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,119
will be fighting for Truth, Justice, and the
American way.

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,039
Although, does the alignment of the stars
on that Chinese flag look a little off to

37
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,079
anyone else?

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,009
Anyway, the fictional Ministry of
Self-Reliance

39
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,959
is able to transfer part of the dying Superman’s
powers to Kenan Kong

40
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,459
Like I said, comics.

41
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,700
Oh there’s also a Chinese batman and wonder
woman.

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,469
They’re part of the Justice League of China.

43
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:55,799
Yeah.

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,689
New Super-man is written by Taiwanese-American
Gene Luen Yang,

45
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,740
who is actually pretty awesome.

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,819
He’s a former computer science teacher

47
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,240
who started writing comic books.

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,970
Kind of important ones like “American Born
Chinese,”

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,849
one that I highly recommend.

50
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,629
The Library of Congress has named him

51
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,210
the national ambassador for young people’s
literature.

52
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,390
The point is this guy’s got talent.

53
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,200
And with New Super-Man,

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,080
he’s trying some interesting things

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,090
to bridge an iconic American property with
traditional Chinese culture.

56
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,970
For one, the traditional triangular chest
emblem

57
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,140
has been replaced with an octagon.

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,940
Here’s what he said about that in an interview
with KPCC:

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,079
“The octagon is actually a reference to
'bagua,'

60
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,099
which is a Taoist concept,

61
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,459
and it's fundamental to a Chinese view of
the universe.

62
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,300
And that'll play, like Taoism,

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,360
Taoist concepts at least, will play a vital role in
this character's journey."

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,900
He’s also taking a page from one of the
Four Classics of Chinese literature

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,980
Journey to the West.

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,330
You see, Kenan Kong starts off as kind of
a bully.

67
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,080
You know who else starts off as a bully?

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,609
Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.

69
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,170
“The Monkey King also has a similar story
arc.

70
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,099
He starts off as a bully

71
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,760
and he has this process of enlightenment

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,290
where he arrives at a more selfless character.

73
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,730
So by doing this with Kenan Kong,

74
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,890
we are referencing both an American story

75
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,580
— the story of Clark Kent —

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,519
and a very Chinese story—the story of the Monkey King."

77
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,469
So that’s all very cool.

78
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,620
And DC Comics has been looking for ways

79
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,989
to add more cultural and ethnic diversity.

80
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,140
One thing that's not clear though,

81
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,379
is whether the New Super-Man will ever be
released in China.

82
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,650
That could be difficult,

83
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,629
unless the comics completely ignore

84
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,579
the political and human rights situation in
China.

85
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,969
And for the people who are concerned that
Super-Man

86
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,109
will end up being a stooge of a communist
government,

87
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,650
well, they already did that one.

88
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,999
The Great American Icon...

89
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,499
Reimagined as a Soviet Hero!

90
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:02,799
Comics!

91
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,379
But supposedly Kenan Kong’s father was a
social activist

92
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,400
so there could be an interesting story arc
there.

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,260
Here he is talking about the importance of
truth, justice, and democracy.

94
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,180
Uh oh.

95
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,780
I hope Super-Man's dad doesn't get invited
to drink tea

96
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,830
with the Ministry of Self Reliance.

97
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,580
I for one am interested in seeing where this
story goes.

98
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,500
Since the Chinese regime doesn’t even like
individual groups amassing power,

99
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,370
somehow I don’t think they’ll be too happy

100
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,090
about a possibly independent-minded super
man.

101
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,320
What do you think about the New Super-Man?

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,560
Leave your comments below.

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,600
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

104
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,060
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
