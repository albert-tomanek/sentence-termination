00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,320
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,720
welcome to the Danger Zone!

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,420
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,869
A Chinese-American woman has been sentenced
to 50 months in prison

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:18,769
for, quote,

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,380
“conspiring to export and cause to export”

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,360
a few small items.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,660
Little things,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,720
like several advanced US fighter jet engines.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,150
As well as a Reaper Drone

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,470
the kind that shoots Hellfire missiles.

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,640
I mean,

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,180
Christmas shopping is hard

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,560
when you’re buying for the Chinese Communist
Party.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,760
They’re the regime that has everything

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,230
because they’ve already knocked it off.

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,470
Unfortunately for 45-year-old Wenxia Man,

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,230
also known as “Wency,”

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,430
she tried to buy her jet engines and Reaper
Drone

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,050
missiles sold separately

22
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,440
from someone who turned out to be

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,430
a Homeland Security agent.

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,500
It’s illegal to sell US weapons to China,

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,080
since the US government has had an arms embargo

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,890
in place since 1989.

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,440
I wonder why that happened.

28
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,590
But perhaps Wency Man’s biggest crime

29
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,829
was introducing the world to the name “Wency.”

30
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,369
I mean, what’s next?

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,280
Beberly?

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Elizabreth?

33
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,420
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Oh.

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,040
Moving on.

36
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,720
According to court documents,

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,420
Man worked with a man whom she called a “technology
spy.”

38
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,409
Who was a spy?

39
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:26,129
What?

40
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,900
No, she didn’t work with Hu.

41
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,580
No!

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,360
When did I say Xi worked with Hu?

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,300
The spy’s name is Zhang Xinsheng!

44
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,210
And while Wency Man is in prison,

45
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,450
he’s safely inside China.

46
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,180
He “worked on behalf of the Chinese military

47
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,469
to copy items obtained from other countries,”

48
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,240
according to the official press release by
the US Department of Justice.

49
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,340
The Chinese regime was offering 50 million
dollars,

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,340
a million which would go to Wency Man.

51
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,160
And considering the maximum penalty she faced
was 20 years in prison,

52
00:01:58,179 --> 00:01:59,179
she got off pretty easy

53
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:02,429
with just over a 4 year sentence.

54
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:06,049
The Chinese regime has been rapidly building
up its military.

55
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,489
But there are major technological gaps that
they haven’t figured out yet.

56
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,980
So why not just steal and replicate the technology

57
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,080
from countries that already have it, right?

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,500
China has particular problems designing jet
engines.

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,590
They have lots of little parts that move really
fast.

60
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,220
That’s the technical explanation.

61
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
And that’s why

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,530
“engines accounted for 30% of all its imports,

63
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,189
according to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute.”

64
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,739
Now this is shocking.

65
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,560
Imagine if the United States had to spend
billions

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,890
buying jet engines from Europe.

67
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,860
That wouldn’t instill too much confidence

68
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,560
in the latest multi-million dollar jet fighters

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
the US is rolling out,

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,879
like the F-35.

71
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,250
But that’s what the Chinese military has
to do.

72
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,920
Last November, the Chinese regime spent 2
billion dollars

73
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,400
to buy 24 Russian Su-35 fighter jets.

74
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,720
This is even when,

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,580
supposedly,

76
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,379
they have their own fighter jets

77
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,699
that should be capable of matching them.

78
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,600
But it turns out China’s air force gets
a lot of packages

79
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,169
marked “From Russia: With Love.”

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,720
One of the reasons the Chinese regime is so
dependent

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,849
on Russian and stolen US military tech is

82
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:17,849
say it with me

83
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:20,220
corruption.

84
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,069
In this article by the Epoch Times,

85
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,140
a manager at the Shenyang Aircraft Corp spelled
it out.

86
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,129
Company executives embezzled 16 million dollars
every year.

87
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,129
I mean,

88
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,590
why pay for expensive experts

89
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,859
when you can hire temp workers from 8 different
factories,

90
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,730
none of whom have the necessary training?

91
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,409
And since they were working on key parts to
the J-8 fighter jets,

92
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,849
Shenyang Aircraft Corp had to have repair
teams

93
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,989
on hand in case anything went wrong.

94
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,819
This is one reason why the Chinese military
has to steal.

95
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,299
They even steal for their movies.

96
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,299
Wait,

97
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:57,579
the Chinese military makes movies?

98
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,709
Check out Sky Fighters,

99
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,189
China’s 2011 answer to the 1986 American
movie

100
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,319
Top Gun.

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,300
There’s the runway scene,

102
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
the flying upside down scene

103
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,749
and the gifting of tampons to the female pilot
scene.

104
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:12,890
Oh wait,

105
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,150
that was just Sky Fighters.

106
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,590
And so when Wency Man,

107
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,810
running a struggling tech company in California
with her husband,

108
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,180
gets approached with a million dollar deal
to be a Chinese spy,

109
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,440
we really know that is the best China’s
military has to offer.

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
So what do you think about the case of Wency
Man?

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,419
And what can be done to stop the Chinese regime

112
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:36,560
from stealing US technology?

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
Leave your comments below.

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,820
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

115
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,550
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,560
See you next time!
