1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,720
China rams a Filipino fishing boat

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,890
and you won't believe how Duterte responded.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,800
Or maybe you will

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,220
Huawei employees have been secretly

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,420
working with China's military.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,520
What a surprise.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,920
And Trump and Xi will meet at the G20.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,700
What will they talk about?

9
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,380
Probably chocolate cake.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080
Hi, welcome to China uncensored I'm Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,140
I'm Shelley Zhang.

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,760
So we're here in Hong Kong

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
covering the protests however we figured
is probably pretty important to cover

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,620
some of the other China news going on
out there

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,180
So we're gonna do sort of off-the-cuff
run down to some of the biggest China

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,290
news stories that have been happening.

17
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,400
Shelley why don't you lead us off with

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,900
the top one?

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,640
Okay so two weeks ago a
Chinese boat rammed a Filipino fishing

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,720
boat in the South China Sea.

21
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,219
So it was in this area called Reed Bank which falls

22
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,280
in the Philippines exclusive economic
zone.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
So that's pretty close to actual

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,440
Filipino territory; this is not disputed
waters.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,060
Exclusive economic zones are

26
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:07,799
about 200 nautical miles outside of the
actual land of the Philippines so yeah

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,820
it's still I think within some area
where the Chinese obviously have these

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,540
vessels in the area that are fishing
boats...

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,250
in quotation marks were very low.

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,220
She made quotation marks.

31
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,280
There are fishing boats and they are part of

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,170
what's called the you know China's
maritime militia and if you'd like us to

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,560
do a video on that in the future please
let us know in the comments below it's

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,460
pretty interesting.

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,990
But anyway so 22 fishermen were thrown into the water and

36
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,840
then the Chinese boat kind of fled the
scene but luckily the fishermen were

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,480
rescued by a boat from Vietnam.

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,060
Now the interesting thing about this is how much

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,080
Duterte has kind of downplayed it.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,480
He called it he just called it a maritime incident.

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,580
These are not ironic quotation marks.

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,220
No these are actually said a

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,440
maritime incidence.

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,080
A maritime incidence and there was no confrontation.

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,600
People have gotten so upset about this like
there's talk about actually trying to

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,170
impeach Duterte sort of based on the
idea that

47
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,620
part of his duty is to protect the like
territorial integrity of the Philippines

48
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,940
and now people are kind of saying well
you're not doing that

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,080
Duterte had a very interesting response
event though, Shelly.

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,200
I think the headline

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,320
here says impeach me I'll put you all in
jail.

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,200
Duterte also said that you know

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,310
China could fish in the Philippines
exclusive economic zone because China

54
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,160
the Philippines are friends.

55
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,040
That got a little taken out of context in some of

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,239
the media where it seemed like oh he was
giving China permission because we're

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,019
all friends here but actually what he
meant was he didn't think China would

58
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,480
fish in the exclusive economic zone
because their friends.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,640
The full quote is I don't think that China would do that, why? Because we're friends.

60
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,820
So yeah you know China would never do
anything bad to their friends.

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,740
That is the issue that a lot of smaller
countries feel with dealing with China

62
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,500
is that you know we're a small country
what can we do to China if we tell them

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,460
not to do this I was just laughs and do
it anyway.

64
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,850
Well one last thing though is

65
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,160
that you know after he said this and
became very controversial then his

66
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,480
spokesman came out and said that no no
the president will not relinquish the

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,120
Filipino Philippines sovereign rights
over our country's exclusive economic zone.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,560
So just to clarify that's not what
he said.

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,780
It's nice when the president

70
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,720
needs a spokesman.

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,500
The other big story is
in the u.s. the Democratic debates are

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,440
happening and one thing that has come up
a lot is the threat China is to the US.

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,540
So there was a question there two nights
of democratic debates...

74
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,250
Oh god it's like nobody gets
voted off the island after these they

75
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,220
keep going but anyway the the first
night there were the candidates, almost

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,540
said contestants, were asked what
America's greatest geopolitical threat

77
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,640
was and four out of ten said China in
some capacity.

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,180
These are contestants and

79
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,440
not candidates is that does that mean
there's gonna be swimsuit competition?

80
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,740
I sincerely hope not.

81
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,220
I don't know, Andrew Yang...

82
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,860
And then on the

83
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,700
second night there was again a couple of
questions about China.

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:31,160
Okay, so mayor Pete Buttigieg... got that right... said that we have to recognize the China challenge as

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,440
a serious one and that China's using
technology for the perfection of

86
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,940
dictatorship.

87
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,980
Senator Michael Bennet said
the president's been right to push back

88
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,600
on China but he's done it the wrong way.

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,560
Similar with Andrew Yang who said

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,699
acknowledges of China's an economic
threat but says the tariffs are not the

91
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,740
right way to go.

92
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,080
So you know ultimately
it's a democratic debate they're gonna

93
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,210
talk a lot about US domestic issues but
China is shaping up to be one of the

94
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,680
things that's gonna be big in this
election.

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,440
And what's interesting it's

96
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,100
like it's clear at this point to
everyone that China is a bipartisan

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,599
issue so they have a challenge of saying
yes we agree with Trump that China is an

98
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,530
issue but he is totally wrong on
everything how he's doing with it that's

99
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,240
why we have to be voted in.

100
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,980
Well the interesting thing is that when you got

101
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,120
10 candidates on a stage none of them
actually said what they would do about China.

102
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,300
Like a couple of them said that
they wanted to reset the us-china

103
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,920
relationship but what does that mean? Unclear.

104
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,490
And then there's a whole issue

105
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,620
of Biden and his family's questionable
ties.

106
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,300
That's a story for another time so

107
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,750
In other news pro-beijing
forces in Taiwan have actually been

108
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,780
acting up.

109
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,680
That was a big deal in recent
elections in Taiwan that the Chinese

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,180
Communist Party was doing a lot of
things to sort of promote candidates

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,549
that were more in line with the
Beijing's agenda.

112
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,600
Yeah now there's been a

113
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,630
Foreign Policy to piece that's kind of
gone into that which is pretty

114
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,320
interesting.

115
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,740
Maybe we'll do an episode
about that later.

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,880
Meanwhile tens of

117
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,080
thousands of people in Taipei stood in
the rain for four hours that was Tuesday

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,360
I believe calling for a ban on Pro CCP
media outlets in Taiwan and that's a big

119
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,370
way
the Chinese Congress party is sort of

120
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,120
United Front works and countries around
the world as they buy Chinese language

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,600
media or invest in certain ways and then
that's the sort of subverts the message

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,470
Yeah it's interesting because there's
been such a big pushback against these

123
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:42,080
what they call in Chinese red media so I
don't think this this parade this

124
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,050
protest was scheduled before the Hong
Kong protests started happening but

125
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,820
there was definitely kind of increased
turnout because of what's happening in

126
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,288
Hong Kong and probably a greater fear
among Taiwanese people.

127
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:56,460
Yeah because I'm

128
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,050
gonna change the dynamic of it and one
of those pro-beijing groups I think

129
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,300
there was a quote from one who said our
God is China.

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,260
That's totally

131
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,460
normal and not you know worrying at all

132
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,350
That God demands human sacrifice: organs

133
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,220
It's the same thing! The Chinese Communsit Party's like the Aztec religion it's all

134
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,660
about ripping out people's hearts.

135
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,140
Moving on you know how do Chinese people feel

136
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,800
about pork products?

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,220
Um, honestly I think
that if you were to lose all pork

138
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,580
products in China that might cause the
downfall of this Chinese Communist Party

139
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,770
So it's a bad news that the African
swine fever is devastating

140
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,960
pigs in China.

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,600
It's really putting them
on the spit...

142
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,120
Uh or the opposite since you

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,000
don't want to eat those.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,760
Yes yeah so so
there are official figures that's

145
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,960
something like 25 percent of the of the
pig population is being culled inside

146
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,760
mainland China.

147
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,300
It's very bad it's like bird flu but...

148
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,720
Well I you know we've also read that the

149
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,640
actual figures are much higher than that.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,290
Because when do they ever report

151
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,160
accurate figures into Chinese media?

152
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,060
Yeah
very very bad situation.

153
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,320
Nevertheless, despite how bad the pig situation is Chinese actually banned meat imports

154
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,080
from Canada as part of their you know
general not liking the Canadians very much.

155
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,820
Well there was a banned meat additive
that was found in one shipment of

156
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,960
Canadian meat and so of course that is
very dangerous and they need

157
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,920
ban all meat shipments from Canada.

158
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,440
The Chinese Communist Party is very big on food safety,

159
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,780
as you all know.

160
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,520
So then the interesting twist of this story is that

161
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,180
now Canada is looking into suspected
foul play regarding the origins of that

162
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,760
bad meat.

163
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,858
Fowl play?

164
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,260
I thought we were talking about pigs.

165
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,980
If it wasn't clear what I was
going for.

166
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,400
No I think it was I think it

167
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,700
was pretty clear.

168
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,810
But anyway so
they're they're saying that it looks

169
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,460
like some of the you know customs
documents are forged in that shipment

170
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,510
and maybe it didn't actually come from
Canada so more to come on this breaking story.

171
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,020
A real pig-headed conspiracy.

172
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,600
Alright moving on moving to more interesting

173
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,240
developments with Huawei.

174
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,650
According to Bloomberg, Huawei employees have been

175
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,514
working with the Chinese military on
research projects.

176
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,660
Here's my shocked face.

177
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,420
I am shocked. I thought it was a private in the

178
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,740
private company was owned by employees.

179
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,640
Now to be fair to Huawei

180
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,180
the way Bloomberg discovered this is
they did some research into publicly

181
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:49,680
available so they did some research into publicly disclosed studies and in these studies

182
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,880
they said there was evidence of Huawei
employees not the company itself but

183
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,050
just individual employees doing research
with the Chinese military kind of things

184
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,400
like artificial intelligence or radio
communication.

185
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
Or maybe Huawei had no

186
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,860
idea that they're doing this.

187
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,250
Like no, we know we had no idea this was going on

188
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,880
I mean sort of Bloomberg's thing is
saying like you know we we we know this

189
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,260
is happening from just the very few
publicly disclosed studies that are

190
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,910
actually available most of these
military studies are you know never make

191
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,920
it to the public never make it online so
this could be a much bigger thing than

192
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,580
Huawei says is absolutely not a thing

193
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,120
Well I mean the whole thing about China

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,610
talking about civil-military fusion
right that we've done a few episodes

195
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,950
about so a lot of these are kind of
technologies that could be used in

196
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,660
non-military applications but also are
used in military applications.

197
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,480
And this is entrapping a lot of Western tech
companies

198
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,340
like Microsoft and Google they've all
been doing research with Chinese

199
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,820
military universities who then are
probably using this same kind of

200
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,440
technology like AI facial-recognition
in like Xinjiang to help wipe out an ethnicity.

201
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,060
I mean there was also
Australian universities that had that

202
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,960
same issue.

203
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,260
Yeah as well all over the
world yeah so research projects with

204
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,370
China maybe if someone asks you the
Chinese military asks you to work on its

205
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,580
research project you don't want to do that.

206
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,720
Yeah this is the sad thing because

207
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,660
you keep hearing more about how China's
building like this

208
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,880
techno authoritarian dystopian society
and it's not like they're coming up with

209
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,780
this themselves they're getting this
technology from Western tech companies

210
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,790
so these Western tech companies are sort
of involved in creating a system that is

211
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,760
trying to replace freedom and democracy.

212
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,600
It's a terrible thing

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Cicsco!

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,640
Okay okay moving on.

215
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,460
Well still more with Huawei.

216
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,860
So the Trump

217
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,710
administration has put a ban on US tech
companies selling a lot of technology to

218
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,620
Huawei however some US companies have
found loopholes to still supply Huawei

219
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,320
despite the export ban.

220
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,730
And this this first came out you know in The Wall

221
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,420
Street Journal.

222
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,520
So basically there's like
this loophole to the export ban that if

223
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:10,070
foreign-made products include no more
than 25 percent us content then they're

224
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,300
able to kind of get it in.

225
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,660
Now the nice thing is according to Kevin Wolfe a

226
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,820
former us Assistant Secretary of
Commerce for the export administration

227
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,100
The Commerce Department could fix this
pretty easily.

228
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,180
Yeah yeah basically

229
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,290
without and doesn't even need to go
through Congress for approval so this is

230
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,210
a loophole that's pretty easy to close
but it just shocks me that like as like

231
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:40,970
it's so transparent like the reality of
Huawei of how it's very very tied to the

232
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,020
Chinese Communist Party and yet US tech
company are still like oh gosh is there

233
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,260
any way we can do business with them?

234
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,470
Other Huawei news, Huawei actually has

235
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,140
sued a US company CNEX,

236
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,780
Or C-N-E-X. I'm gonna go with CNEX.

237
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,680
Sounds cooler.

238
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,760
Say they stole Huawei intellectual property but a US

239
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,660
jury ruled that the semiconductor
company CNEX did not do that.

240
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,540
CNEX also filed a countersuit
against Huawei saying that they, it was

241
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,320
them trying to steal their technology
and the jury did find that Huawei did

242
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,578
misappropriate their secrets but didn't
award them any damages.

243
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,660
And in our final

244
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,620
story for the day, the G20 is about to
start.

245
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,980
I know you're all excited you've

246
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,540
been waiting for that I mean who doesn't
love geopolitical summits.

247
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,860
Oh well these

248
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,480
are technically an economic summit.

249
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,850
Geo economic political whatever.

250
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,360
Alright so the big news is like everyone
wondering what's gonna happen with the trade war.

251
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,500
The US-China trade war.

252
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,130
So far President Trump has

253
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,060
held off on doing new tariffs however he
has said that is on the table if a trade

254
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,080
agreement can't be reached.

255
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,720
According Trump's schedule he's meeting

256
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,240
with Xi Jinping on Saturday the second day
of the G20 for 90 minutes so everybody's

257
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,640
kind of wondering what's gonna happen
when with that meeting.

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,380
Meanwhile Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has said that got the markets a little

259
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,240
excited by saying that the US and China
were about 90 percent of the way to a

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,860
trade deal before it became a no deal
and then he says that he thinks that

261
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,620
there's a path to complete the trade
deal.

262
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,500
He is a China optimist.

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,760
He is a you

264
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,120
know what is the path, we're not sure.

265
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,280
Yeah I think you read a funny

266
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,600
tweet about that.

267
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,430
Oh that like there was somebody who

268
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,900
tweeted about you know I am you know 90%
of the way to going to the gym I've

269
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,380
bought all my clothes I've bought all the
weights I've all I have to do is

270
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,180
exercise and then I will lose weight so...

271
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,280
Yeah yeah

272
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,660
So that's kind of what the 90 percent
means is they got almost all the way

273
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,560
there until they actually deleted all
the enforcement mechanisms which meant

274
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,340
that it meant nothing anymore..

275
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,360
That was the last time

276
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,560
so yeah we'll keep you updated with
things on the G20 and obviously stay

277
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,810
tuned for all to our Hong Kong coverage
since we're here we're expecting July

278
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,160
1st to be a pretty big day.

279
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,400
July 1st is obviously the anniversary of when the UK

280
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,520
gave Hong Kong to China.

281
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,500
So it's like an un-independence day.

282
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,920
Exactly un-independence day.

283
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,340
And you know in our
last video if you haven't seen it we

284
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,020
talked about how Hong Kong protesters
were protesting to all these countries

285
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,100
ahead of the G20.

286
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,420
They're buying ads in
newspapers, ads came out in 10 different newspapers.

287
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,900
Try to get these countries to actuall bring up Hong Kong.

288
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,660
So that's a G20, save Hong Kong.

289
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,160
You know so they're really looking for some quality foreign

290
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,120
interference and that's pretty
embarrassing especially after the

291
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,940
Chinese authorities said that nobody was
allowed to talk about Hong Kong at the G20.

292
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,290
So sure they're gonna listen to yeah

293
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,500
Speaking of, hey Chris,

294
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,547
Yeah, what's that, Shelley?

295
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,240
Do you know who

296
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,480
brought up the Hong Kong at the G20
already?

297
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,640
Who?

298
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,820
Everybody's favorite

299
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,780
Japanese prime minister.

300
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,980
Shinzo Abe?

301
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,920
Yes, so Shinzo Abe has already talked

302
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,660
about Hong Kong with Xi Jinping.

303
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,080
He has stressed the importance of a free and

304
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,440
open Hong Kong under one country two
systems in light of the extradition bill

305
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,520
and he also mentioned the importance of
the human rights situation in Xinjiang with the Uyghurs.

306
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,540
Well if the Chinese
Communist Party didn't already hate

307
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,040
Japan I'm sure they do now.

308
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,820
All right so I think we're gonna sign off for now.

309
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,300
Stay tuned for more and let us know what
you think of this kind of a format for
