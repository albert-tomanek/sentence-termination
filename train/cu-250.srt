00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,390
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,640
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,190
If you were living under a brutal, authoritarian
regime,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,100
how would you change things?

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,190
Would you rally your fellow citizens to take
up arms

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,830
against the tyrant?

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,490
Or would you use nonviolent civil resistance?

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,339
I’m willing to bet you already have a strong
feeling about

9
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,199
which way you would go.

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,800
But what if I told you that according to historical
data,

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,590
the most likely way to make meaningful change

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,690
is through nonviolent resistance?

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,239
You might not believe me.

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
But I sat down with a man who wants to convince
you otherwise—

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,569
Dr. Peter Ackerman,

16
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:47,340
founder of the International Center for Nonviolent
Conflict.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,620
Nonviolent, conflict?

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,260
Sounds like an oxymoron.

19
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,719
But his organization has advised dissidents
in dozens of countries

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,809
on how to create lasting regime change without
using violence.

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,600
Thank you for joining me today, Dr. Ackerman.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,100
So, why nonviolent resistance?

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,590
Well, why totalitarian rule?

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,440
It's a response to totalitarian rule,

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,890
to the kind of rule that people feel oppressed
under,

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,259
that makes their lives miserable, and puts
them under threat of death,

27
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,550
pestilence, bad education, injustice.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,430
All the horribles that one can think of for
humanity

29
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,130
correlate with tyrannical rule,

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,159
and one of the responses to tyrannical rule
that I believe

31
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,329
has been effective for decades if not millennia
is civil resistance, o

32
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,659
r nonviolent resistance, or people power,
when understood

33
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,610
and used with the most strategically sound
methods.

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,399
But can nonviolent resistance really stand
up to a bloodthirsty dictator?

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,759
Remember, a bloodthirsty dictator can't shoot
everybody with his own gun.

36
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,799
He can try.

37
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,570
Yeah, but even he doesn't try.

38
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,690
What he can, what he must do,

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,579
is he must have people who will do it for
him.

40
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,640
Even Hitler had people who had to do it for
him.

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,650
He has to muster an army, a police,

42
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,120
and not all these organizations remain loyal.

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,220
Sometimes, the more bloodthirsty you are,

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,430
the more brittle you are, because the bloodthirstiness

45
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,720
carries over to your own military.

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,480
Remember, the newest head of North Korea took
his uncle,

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,180
put him on a fence post, and shot him with
an artillery round,

48
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,620
in front of the cadets on graduation day,
as I understand it.

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,880
Look at how solid True Korea is.

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,370
Yeah, it's as stable as you can imagine.

51
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,180
The American Revolution was a violent revolution,

52
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,569
and America's the greatest country on Earth,

53
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:55,430
so how can nonviolent revolution be better
than violent revolution?

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,580
Well, there were important nonviolent tactics
used,

55
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,580
like the tea party.

56
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,590
The Boston Tea Party was a nonviolent tactic.

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,470
No one is saying ...

58
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,200
We can't be absolute.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,670
No one is saying that violent tactics

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,680
linked into a strategy can't be effective.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,640
It was against the British,

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,610
but there are also factors that were not military
in character

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,519
that also impacted the outcome.

64
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,690
An occupation is a difficult thing from across
an ocean.

65
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:38,580
Now, we have done a study of 323 insurrections
between 1900 and 2006.

66
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,379
They were divided into two kinds of insurrections,

67
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:47,090
those dominated by violent tactics, guerrilla
warfare, insurrection, terrorism,

68
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,390
whatever you might want to think of,

69
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,200
and those that are dominated by tactics that
maintain nonviolent discipline,

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,540
strikes, boycotts, mass protests.

71
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,750
There's hundreds of them, bank holidays, consumer
boycotts.

72
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,220
Where people stop supporting the system.

73
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,239
Or disrupt the system.

74
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,239
Disruption.

75
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,630
What we found was that of the two-thirds

76
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,840
that were dominated by violent tactics,

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,270
based on their own goals as articulated,

78
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,050
they reached their goals 26% of the time.

79
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,530
With respect to campaigns of civil resistance

80
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,760
or people power movements,

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,850
those goals articulated by them were reached
53% of the time,

82
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:39,010
and the transfer of power that occurred was
10 times more likely to be

83
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,550
democratic after a civil resistance movement
than a violent insurrection.

84
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,840
You're saying nonviolent resistance is actually

85
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,800
a more effective means at achieving democracy.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,430
That data would suggest just that.

87
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,430
Wow.

88
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,230
People like to use the term nonviolence and
confuse it with nonviolent conflict.

89
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,910
When you think about nonviolence, you think
about people who are there to

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,650
basically convince you of the error of your
ways,

91
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,830
to sit cross-legged with incense and say,

92
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,090
"Beat me until you basically have sympathy
of my views

93
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,730
so you'll change your ways."

94
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,690
It has a component that's very moral in its
impetus,

95
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,420
which is a wonderful thing,

96
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,690
but it doesn't overthrow dictators.

97
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,060
Because I have yet to meet a dictator,

98
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,530
or hear about one, when he's asked to give
up some of his power,

99
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,670
he says back, "Would Tuesday be soon enough?"

100
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,630
They don't give their power up. It has to
be taken,

101
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,000
so nonviolent conflict is the act of disruption

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,100
that leads to defections that undermines the
legitimacy of a dictator

103
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,740
or an authoritarian.

104
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,640
You're saying this is an aggressive form of
nonviolent conflict.

105
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,570
No. All nonviolent conflict is aggressive.
It's just that nonviolence,

106
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,490
which is peaceful, tranquil, has nothing to
do ...

107
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,500
It's not a strategy.

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,970
It's a morality.

109
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,970
It's a fine morality.

110
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,050
Now, one of the things that confuses people
is,

111
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,780
what about Gandhi and King?

112
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,530
They both were committed pacifists, true,

113
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,910
but nobody would care about Gandhi if, in
1930,

114
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,900
he didn't leave his ashram, walk 210 miles
to Dandi Beach,

115
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,470
pick up a handful of mud, throw it into a
pot of boiling water,

116
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,030
turn it into salt, which was illegal to make,

117
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,870
and have 250 million people follow him,

118
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,180
do the same thing,

119
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,990
and then read from the viceroy of India that
if this disruption continues,

120
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,000
and the local constabularies around India,

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,890
if only 100,000 basically defect,

122
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,631
we're going to have to leave.

123
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:39,970
This is basically a targeted strategy of regime
change.

124
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,950
Power shifting. It may lead to regime change,

125
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,740
or it may lead to a new mode of coexistence

126
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,130
between the tyrant and the opposition,

127
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,530
but it's a power shifting,

128
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,270
a dramatic power shifting to restore human
rights,

129
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,740
to restore justice, liberty, property rights,

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,980
the things that basically advanced societies
have a lot of and enjoy.

131
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,880
What are some of the tactics that you encourage

132
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,190
dissenting groups around the world to use?

133
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,580
We don't give advice about what tactics to
use,

134
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,980
but we try to make them understand that there
is

135
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,910
a tremendous variety of tactics.

136
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,950
Let's take in Poland,

137
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,000
it was the Gdansk shipyard strike.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,630
In South Africa, it was the boycott in Port
Elizabeth.

139
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,970
In India, it was the salt march.

140
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,270
We did the story of the Nashville lunch-counter
boycott

141
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,130
in the civil rights movement.

142
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,300
In Chile, it was a referendum that undid Pinochet.

143
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,030
He thought he was going to win.

144
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,030
He didn't.

145
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,390
He told the military, "Please, let's forget
we ever had a referendum."

146
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,400
The military says, "You're done." Remember?

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I do.

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
He wants to shoot them. They won't shoot.

149
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,260
They're in big trouble. In Ukraine, it was
a protest in Maidan

150
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,430
for a month that basically led to a military
defection.

151
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,220
In Egypt, which is I think yet to be successful,

152
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,080
we had Tahrir Square, which was that eruption.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,830
Let's shift over to China.

154
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,260
Then of course Tiananmen in China.

155
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
...that didn't exactly go so well.

156
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,910
Now, when you say it didn't go well,

157
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,520
that tactic alone didn't get the job done,

158
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
but there's a difference between tactics and
strategy.

159
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,480
A strategy that works is when you knit a series
of tactics together.

160
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,540
It went very well if you measure the tactic
in terms of

161
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,310
successfully disrupting the status quo.

162
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,969
It certainly did that.

163
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,890
The question wasn't about that tactic,

164
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,540
but what would come next.

165
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,840
The only way you know what comes next is if
you're trained

166
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,120
to think about how to link tactics into a
strategy,

167
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,110
and that's what the International Center on
Nonviolent Conflict does.

168
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,950
Our site is very rich. We help dissidents
around the world.

169
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,510
We don't tell people who we're helping,

170
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,990
but we've now helped probably dissidents in
70 countries

171
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,030
over the last 15 years.

172
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,400
That's what we do.

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,110
It's a coaching mechanism to make people think
strategically

174
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,860
about the campaign of civil resistance.

175
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,130
How do you coach that?

176
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,710
Because in the Tiananmen protest as well as

177
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,740
many other grassroots movements around the
world,

178
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,620
the question is always, who is in charge?

179
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,280
Who is making these decisions?

180
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,470
Now, often, they end up shooting themselves
in the foot.

181
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,840
There's a lot of different ideas.

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,130
First of all, who's shooting who in the foot
in a nonviolent conflict?

183
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,250
Themselves. It's a metaphor.

184
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,490
Did they shoot them? Yeah, it's a metaphor,

185
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,530
okay, but there's a lot there that needs to
be unpacked.

186
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,520
A nonviolent resistance movement done badly,

187
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,000
people will shoot themselves in the foot,

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,130
but they won't shoot themselves in the foot.

189
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,200
They might shoot themselves in the foot,

190
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,090
but it might hit the little toe.

191
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,690
A violent insurrection that screws up,

192
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,630
they shoot themselves in the head.

193
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,230
There's no coming back from it.

194
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,260
We have data to show that a civil resistance
movement

195
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,180
that even is not successful lays the seeds,

196
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,240
potentially, for another one four, five, or
six years later.

197
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,790
That's exactly what's happening in Iran today.

198
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,990
Or like in Hong Kong,

199
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,500
where they had the Umbrella Movement in 2014.

200
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,760
Even though that did not necessarily achieve
all of their goals,

201
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
that movement is still alive.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Exactly.

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,340
In a country like China,

204
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,470
how can the population that is under so much
propaganda ...

205
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,010
The Communist Party has this thing called
patriotic education,

206
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,280
where from a young age, people are taught
that the Party

207
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
is there for them,

208
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,300
that they have to love the Party,

209
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,580
that the Party is China. In an environment
like that,

210
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,420
how can people decide to begin a nonviolent
resistance movement?

211
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,480
Well, let's answer this by referring to Natan
Sharansky,

212
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,760
who was the great refusenik in the Soviet
Union,

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,960
where that ideological indoctrination was
just as intense.

214
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,480
He asked a very interesting question.

215
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,370
How was it that the people in the gulags,

216
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,420
the people who basically were under the most
pressure,

217
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,260
lived the most miserable\hlives,

218
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,730
were able to predict the end of the Soviet
Union

219
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,150
where all the intelligence agencies of the
world

220
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,130
and all the smart people who were Russian
experts couldn't?

221
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,820
Because they knew something that's profoundly
true,

222
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,920
that in every authoritarian regime, there's
four kinds of people.

223
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,970
There's the population that's apathetic and
just doing nothing.

224
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,510
Then, there's the part of the population that's
willing to dissent.

225
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,460
Then, they're in opposition to the third group,
which is the true believer,

226
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,090
who basically is at the very top and believes
the ideology,

227
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,200
whatever ridiculous justification it may have
for mistreating people

228
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,570
the way they do.

229
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,370
Then you have the latent double-thinker,

230
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,300
who is a normal human being,

231
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,730
who hates to see the collateral damage of
what the true believers

232
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,730
are trying to inculcate.

233
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,210
They become disillusioned.

234
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,710
That's exactly it.

235
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,470
Double-thinkers are the subject of disillusionment,
exactly.

236
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,530
Perfectly expressed.

237
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,620
So, the strategy is for the activists to convert
the double-thinkers,

238
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,340
or make them go from latent to active.

239
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes. Now, China, we know there's lots of double-thinkers,

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,980
and they're latent.

241
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,980
The question is, how do they-

242
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
Take action?

243
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,180
First, how do they expose themselves safely
to find other double-thinkers,

244
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,680
and then take action? The disruption, like
I told you in India,

245
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,060
and I don't think there was 250 million people
saying before that,

246
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,090
"I want the Raj over," but as soon as the
guy made salt,

247
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:47,970
it was easy for people to say that that's
what they wanted.

248
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,360
People need to see that they can win.

249
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,029
They can win, or more importantly, it's that
they can express

250
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:58,150
their double-thinking without fear of terrible
reprisals.

251
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,050
They're always afraid of being the one head
that's above

252
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,380
the other that gets chopped off.

253
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,850
One of the tactics I know you talk about is
signage.

254
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,900
What do you mean by signage?

255
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,770
One of the questions I've been asked all the
time is,

256
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,540
"Won't the Internet make all this right?"

257
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,300
The answer is it may or it may not.

258
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,910
The Internet is interesting in terms of its
ability to

259
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,790
distribute information individual to individual,

260
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,850
but it's also a problem,

261
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,300
because it basically allows people to be tracked
individual to individual.

262
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,430
You can have granularity of communication,
granularity of tracking.

263
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,800
The Chinese Communist Party is especially
good at using social media.

264
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
So I'm told, yeah.

265
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,860
Now, the one thing that's interesting,

266
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,730
that I've been trying to tell people to think
about,

267
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,470
is stop this obsession with the Internet,
because the Internet is great,

268
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,160
but it's also a choke point.

269
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,540
Unless they're watching this show,

270
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,270
in which case they should still be on the
air.

271
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,370
Then you're unclogging the artery that's been
clogged,

272
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,120
and thank you for doing that, but the one
thing, people have to go outside.

273
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,920
There have to be buildings, and lots and lots
of signs expressing dissent

274
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,970
have a virtue of being out there.

275
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,290
They show that people are not in control,
that they claim to be.

276
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,420
They can offer directions. They can interact
with the Internet.

277
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,790
You know, "Click here." We haven't done nearly
enough technologically

278
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,920
to make sign-making instantaneous and hard
to track as to who is doing it.

279
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,020
If you want to say about the Internet, "Go
here," like in Tahrir Square,

280
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,190
everybody thought it was a Facebook revolution,

281
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,600
because people always refer to things based
on

282
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,770
what they're experiencing at the moment.

283
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,029
Facebook was taking off, but the fact is that
6% of the population

284
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:54,640
only were Internet-savvy, Internet-connected,
and the Internet was shut off

285
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,250
before Tahrir Square, but we don't want to
get into those facts.

286
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,940
It may be a choke point, but it may be an
addendum to something,

287
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,880
a form of communication that's not a choke
point,

288
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,450
but becomes a magnifier to something that
already exists.

289
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,930
That's what signage can be.

290
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,930
I wonder if this would count.

291
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,950
One of the largest groups of nonviolent resisters
in China right now

292
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,690
is practitioners of Falun Gong.

293
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,350
I know one of the tactics they use is to write
messages on Chinese money

294
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,720
and pass that around.

295
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,290
Same idea.

296
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,800
What can groups like that in China do to effect
change?

297
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,110
If we're talking about the logistical support
of

298
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,770
nonviolent tactics through signage,

299
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,839
one of the things we also have to realize
is that Facebook is not a strategy.

300
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,880
You've got goals, and you've got tactics,
boycotts, strikes, and then you have

301
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,920
a strategy that knits them together.

302
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,730
Then you have logistics that support a strategy.

303
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,860
Facebook is communications logistics.

304
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,240
It's nothing more than that.

305
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,300
We get enamored with Facebook and think it's
secure for everything,

306
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,110
but it's just a logistical tool.

307
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,110
We need to understand that.

308
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,110
Then we say,

309
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,710
"What other logistical tools can achieve the
same things?"

310
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,290
Once you basically sharpen your logistical
tools, your knives,

311
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,300
for the tactics you're going to use, that's
all they're used for.

312
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,250
Then there's the selection of tactics,

313
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,580
and the selection of tactics is far more important,

314
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,600
because the disruption you create will lead
to

315
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,190
a certain level of repression.

316
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,670
It might lead to obedience,

317
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,790
or it may lead to a certain level of disruption.

318
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,670
That may lead to defection.

319
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,290
The authoritarian regime wants to have as
much obedience

320
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,080
with as little repression as possible.

321
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Of course.

322
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,740
The nonviolent resistance-

323
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,300
The civil resisters want to have as much defection

324
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,640
with the least amount of disruption.

325
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,100
That's where the competition is,

326
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,839
because if you have too much disruption and
too little defection,

327
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,880
the public will become apathetic.

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,840
If you have too little obedience with too
much repression,

329
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,110
the repression will backfire, and then-

330
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,720
People will defect.

331
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,960
the authoritarian has lost his main tool.

332
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,980
things the authoritarian wants you to stop
doing,

333
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,400
like a protest or a march,

334
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,059
and stop doing things they want you to continue
to do,

335
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,699
which is what you're talking about here.

336
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,319
The most important thing I would do is think,

337
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,090
what else can we do in combination?

338
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,240
Because it's the combination of tactics that
create a strategy.

339
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,920
Tactics on their own is not a strategy.

340
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,890
The power is in the combination.

341
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:44,630
At the end of the day, it's a game of chess
between

342
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,600
the authoritarian regime and the resisters.

343
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Right.

344
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,870
Each using their tactics to try and defeat
the other.

345
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,740
Each using their tactics to create the best
strategy.

346
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,720
To create a strategy.

347
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,160
What the authoritarian is most worried about
is that the opposition

348
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,110
will actually have a strategy,

349
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,150
because what they want to do is disrupt that
possibility.

350
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,860
That's their best. They want to basically
make sure nobody unifies.

351
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,140
They want to make sure that nobody's thinking
about

352
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,150
different ways to disrupt.

353
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,179
They want to make sure nobody's planning.

354
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:23,160
Eisenhower said that plans are useless, but
planning is everything.

355
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,520
The ability to constantly think about how
to piece together a string of tactics,

356
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,059
always thinking about that, is very, very
powerful.

357
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,059
My son's a wrestler.

358
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,950
You don't just bull-rush an Olympic wrestler.

359
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,840
You have to basically pull his arm,

360
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,580
pull his head, touch his knee, and it's called
chain wrestling,

361
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,740
until basically if you do it properly, he'll
fall over.

362
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,559
You cannot talk about a tactic in isolation.

363
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,080
Let me say one thing.

364
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,130
A tactic in isolation, or a tactic combined
with another tactic,

365
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,000
or a tactic combined with a second tactic,

366
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,260
that first tactic has completely different
outcomes

367
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,720
depending on whether you combine it and what
you combine it with.

368
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,690
So that's the danger of violent resistance,

369
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,560
because it's very easy to just not think,
attack.

370
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,410
Yes. The real danger, why I think violent
tactics

371
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,840
and violent strategies are generally a loser,

372
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,950
is because the people who start with the guerrilla
movement

373
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,860
basically start with an inferior military
position.

374
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,490
The only way they can right that position,

375
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,660
which is a key to their having any hope of
success,

376
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,980
is to kill enough people on the other side,

377
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,750
who are mostly authoritarians.

378
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,060
But before that,

379
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,720
the people they're killing also are seeking
protection,

380
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,790
so they will go and basically strengthen

381
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,810
their relationship with the authoritarian
for protection.

382
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,810
They won't want to defect.

383
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,280
So, they won't want to defect.

384
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,429
I think a violent insurrection tends to work
against itself,

385
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,140
and that's why the data has shown very low
incidences of success.

386
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,650
Do you think we'll see a nonviolent resistance
movement

387
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,929
taking down the Chinese Communist Party?

388
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,190
I don't know what “taking down” means.

389
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,710
I know that a violent insurrection will never
have a meaningful impact.

390
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,549
I think it's a loser,

391
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:14,650
but remember the point that taking down is
a loaded phrase.

392
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,260
Do I think that over time, a nonviolent resistance
movement

393
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,299
is likely to create a complete new compact
of power

394
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,250
between those at the top and citizens?

395
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,730
I think there's a good chance of that.

396
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,490
Whether it means regime change or it comes
in a different form,

397
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,000
where the current practices are embedded with
other,

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,180
more democratic practices,

399
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,640
and individual rights are basically protected,

400
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,350
I can't say what the endgame is.

401
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,940
I know that civil resistance, if persisted
on, is highly likely,

402
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,600
over a 50% chance of creating a better,

403
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,400
more democratic endgame,

404
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,170
but we also know that violent ...

405
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,740
This is an interesting fact.

406
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,630
A violent insurrection takes nine years, on
average,

407
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,100
a civil resistance movement, three years.

408
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,840
If people can plan and persist for three years,

409
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,920
there will be a change.

410
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,980
That's what they need to know.

411
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,630
That's what we're in business to tell them.

412
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,040
I see what you mean about the importance of
language,

413
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,370
because taking down implies violence.

414
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,570
Really, what you want is a conversion.

415
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,680
A transfer of power.

416
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,500
That's brilliant.

417
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,320
