1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,810
the real winner in the US presidential debate!

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,480
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
On Monday,

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,789
we witnessed the first of three US presidential debates

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,610
between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,600
Now that I’ve mentioned Clinton and Trump,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,960
I’m sure a portion of you have stopped watching

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,009
and are busy attacking me in the comment section below.

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,460
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,210
You've already started doing that before even
watching this video.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,380
To those of you who’ve stayed:

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,720
After watching the debates,

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,440
there was one clear winner…

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,680
Democracy!

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,880
That’s right.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,230
This has been a crazy election cycle

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,730
that has seen the United States

20
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,390
more deeply divided than ever before.

21
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,030
And it’s still better than what many people
in the world have.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,140
In America,

23
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,190
we have a system where anyone can be president.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,690
Of course,

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,420
that means anyone can be president.

26
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Still,

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,390
people with radically different ideas

28
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,280
can debate them freely on national television,

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,549
without censorship…

30
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,929
…or even moderation.

31
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:10,969
You know where you can’t do that?

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,180
China!

33
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,320
You know how the “president” of China
gets “elected?”

34
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,119
First, they have an internal power struggle

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,740
at the top levels of the Communist Party.

36
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,259
Whoever survives the purges rises to the top.

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,909
And then that group selects among themselves

38
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,960
who the leader of the Communist Party should be.

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,270
Then the Communist Party tells China’s rubber-stamp congress

40
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,479
who to vote for,

41
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,950
and surprise surprise,

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,510
that person gets “elected” president.

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,200
Then it gets announced to the public.

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,359
So what an embarrassing contrast for the Chinese
Communist Party

45
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,030
to have US presidential candidates debating
so freely!

46
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,509
But fear not!

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,840
They have a solution:

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,400
Don’t let Chinese people watch it.

49
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,409
Yes,

50
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,009
the America’s presidential debate was censored
in China.

51
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,780
China Digital Times uncovered this leaked
censorship directive

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,759
that pulled the plug on the debate,

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,760
saying no news service is allowed to livestream it.

54
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,840
Even state-run CCTV’s livestream

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,500
“went black shortly after the debate began.”

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,640
Same goes the two biggest Chinese news websites.

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,620
And with Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter already banned in China,

58
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,560
you weren’t going to see it there, either.

59
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,170
So as more than 80 million Americans tuned
in to watch the Battle Royale,

60
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,170
in China,

61
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,320
people had state-run media to tell them their
opinions for them!

62
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,080
And if you missed the debate,

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,420
because your totalitarian government censored
it,

64
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,580
don’t worry.

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,240
My favorite state-run media Global Times assures
us it was trite.

66
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,090
And this is just the latest in a long line
of presidential censorship.

67
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,740
For more on that, here’s Shelley Zhang...

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,180
from 8 years ago!

69
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,820
US President Barack Obama’s inauguration address on Tuesday

70
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,030
was broadcast live around the world.

71
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,670
But for Chinese state media,

72
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,480
some of his comments apparently hit too close
to home.

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,560
Recall that earlier generations faced down
fascism and communism,

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,100
not just with missiles and tanks,

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,340
but with the sturdy alliances

76
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,090
and enduring convictions.

77
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,480
As soon as the translator said the word “communism,”

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,140
the live broadcast from China's main propaganda
station,

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,960
CCTV, faded out the audio.

80
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,220
And embarrassingly,

81
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
the anchor was caught totally off guard.

82
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,850
Which didn’t happen with Monday’s debate—

83
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,990
because, again,

84
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,060
the Chinese Communist Party just censored
the entire thing.

85
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,120
And they’re still a bit worried about these
debates.

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,690
Because despite their efforts,

87
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,830
people in China still figured out how to watch.

88
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,540
China’s version of Twitter,

89
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
Weibo,

90
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,800
somehow was able to livestream the debate
to nearly a quarter million people.

91
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,610
And that’s because more and more,

92
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,960
people in China are showing an interest in
US elections.

93
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
For decades,

94
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,550
Chinese state-run media has been telling people
that the

95
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,710
Western-style democracy is dangerous and chaotic.

96
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,880
But China’s middle class is increasingly
making their own observations—

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,280
as Chinese tourists travel to every corner
of the globe,

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,030
and more and more people figure out how

99
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,269
to get around China’s Internet firewall.

100
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,540
So if you’re still watching,

101
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,949
and not busy angrily accusing me of bashing
your favorite—

102
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,580
or least un-favorite candidate—

103
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,979
I’d like to end with this:

104
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,250
At least we can all watch the debate on TV,

105
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,199
and type our uncensored comments below.

106
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,570
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

107
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,470
see you next time.
