00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:02,310
Hong Kong’s Iron Lady

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,190
Knows How to Fight for Freedom

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,009
For decades, Emily Lau

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,920
Has been on the frontlines of the battle for
Hong Kong

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,820
Welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,060
I'm Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,500
Joining me now is a woman who was

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,780
a household name in Hong Kong, Emily Lau.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,000
She's been a journalist, a politician,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,630
and a major thorn in Beijing side.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,610
Perfect for China and Censored.

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,210
Emily, thank you for joining me.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,210
Hi.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,440
So in 1996, you and other legislators laid
down

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,870
in a major road to protest how Hong Kong's

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,101
chief executive would be selected.

17
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:43,460
So you're basically the first umbrella movement
protestor.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,460
I guess you're right!

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,719
And if you tell those kids out there they
would say,

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,719
“Oh, what?

21
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,329
Really?”, because that was before they were
born.

22
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:50,410
And that's true.

23
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,640
And then of course I get a very bad nickname
for that,

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
but that's true.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,739
What was the nickname?

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,039
Well, in Chinese it's [foreign language],

27
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,940
that means 'someone lying in the street'.

28
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,220
And actually, I ran into

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,539
a high court judge a few months later,

30
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:09,560
and he said, “Emily.

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,610
Haven't you got a bed to lie on?”.

32
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,200
So, what do you think of the tactics and strategies

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,310
protestors have been using in the umbrella
movement,

34
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,930
and the current extradition bills?

35
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,880
Well, the umbrella movement started out as
the occupation movement,

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
and we have the Occupy trio;

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,990
Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man, and Reverend Chu.

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,159
And my party, the democratic party,

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,770
was the first to come out to support them.

40
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,190
Because they say, where we have been fighting
for democracy

41
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,670
for so long and get nowhere,

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,009
maybe we should use civil disobedience to
fight.

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,940
Occupy central with peace and love.

44
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,400
No violence.

45
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,860
No disorder.

46
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,530
So my party said, "OK, well, let's have a
go."

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,009
So we supported it,

48
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,670
but then when it did happen two years,

49
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,210
which of course got everybody very impatient.

50
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,719
And then we have the students rushing into
the government complex,

51
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,820
they were arrested, and the people got very
excited.

52
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,310
They want to come and save the students.

53
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,360
So, the whole movement changed from a peace
and loving occupation,

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,900
to something that we want to rescue the students.

55
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,940
Are you talking about now or during the Umbrella
Movement?

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,750
The Umbrella Movement.

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,170
Yeah.

58
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,560
It was initiated like that.

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,380
Because of the students climbing into government
complex

60
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,050
and were arrested, it changed.

61
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,100
And then the occupied trio were in a bind

62
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,270
because they wanted to do it on October 1st,

63
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,120
outside the Mandarin hotel.

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,620
Actually they wanted to do it for two days.

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,740
And they had already briefed the police!

66
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,130
They say we'll have hundreds,

67
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,760
maybe a thousand people lying down in the
street,

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
and we'll be arrested,

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,210
and it should be over in one or two days.

70
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,510
But because of the students and all that,

71
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,710
many people rushed into [inaudible]

72
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,770
outside the legislative council complex,

73
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,940
and the government offices there.

74
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,410
And the trio were forced to say,

75
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,020
“Oh, don't wait for October 1st!

76
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,940
Forget about your plan, let's do it now!”.

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,500
The students just took the reigns.

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,580
Well, not the students.

79
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,700
And they felt quite difficult

80
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,580
because some people said, “Go ahead!”,

81
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,020
and then say, “Don't go ahead!

82
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,570
Don't you hijack our movement!”.

83
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,350
So there was already some argument then.

84
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,290
And in the end they decided to call it there,

85
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,630
instead of coming to the Mandarin hotel.

86
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,530
And then many people came.

87
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,400
It was very peaceful.

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,350
And it was amazing.

89
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,970
And many people who came,

90
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,970
foreign journalists,

91
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,180
where did they come from?

92
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,540
They come from Syria.

93
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,560
They come from Yemen.

94
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,580
Venezuela, Iraq,

95
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,840
where there is carnage and slaughter every
day.

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,760
But here, we have hundreds of thousands of
people

97
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,070
occupying the main thoroughfare,

98
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,239
but doing homework,

99
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,290
doing waste separation.

100
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,290
So peaceful!

101
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,870
That's why it's news.

102
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,500
Otherwise, if there's carnage,

103
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,770
you can not be more violent than Syria.

104
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,020
So it was very good.

105
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,680
But, of course, the government would not relent.

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,209
We were asking for democratic elections, and
Beijing said no.

107
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,790
So the government here, of course, said no.

108
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,190
And in the end, it dragged on for seventy-nine
days.

109
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,530
In fact the occupied trio pull out earlier,

110
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,050
because they said, “Well, that's it.

111
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,440
They're not going to clear us out.

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,470
And the people do not want us to continue.

113
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go home.”

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
But the young people did not want to go.

115
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,030
So, it dragged on for seventy-nine days

116
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,890
and finally they came to Admiralty to arrest
us one by one.

117
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,680
And, still, I have not yet been charged.

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,060
But they still can charge me

119
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,840
with taking part in illegal assembly.

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Public nuisance.

121
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Or whatever, yeah.

122
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,500
And if they charge me with that I'll say,

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
“Yes, guilty.”

124
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,010
That's about civil disobedience,

125
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,550
but they haven't charged me.

126
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,570
Just like back in 1996, they did not charge
me.

127
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,980
You do seem like public nuisance,

128
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,470
like a very dangerous figure.

129
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,200
Is that right?

130
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,940
That's right.

131
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,530
So maybe you should've, in your '96 protest,

132
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,070
stayed on the streets for seventy-nine days.

133
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,190
How long were you out there for?

134
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,250
Well, we were there for maybe one hour.

135
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,710
You gave up too soon.

136
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,710
Well, no!

137
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,490
Actually, what happened was the police people...

138
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,040
The road was closed, and they were calling
up Chris Pattern,

139
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,730
who was the last governor,

140
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,730
"Hey gov!

141
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,740
Emily Lau here is lying on the street."

142
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,500
Actually we were not blocking anything

143
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,970
because they were having the fast inside,
co-election.

144
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,210
And we were just lying there,

145
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,130
so they picked us up one by one,

146
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,660
and took us back to the Wan Chai police station.

147
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,820
Sitting in there, I got a call from the BBC.

148
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,130
So the police allowed me to go out

149
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,810
and I dial a collect call to the BBC.

150
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,090
I say, "Emily Lau calling you.",

151
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,090
"Oh, Emily!

152
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,090
Good.

153
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,260
We are about to go on air, hang on.

154
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,570
Let's put you on!

155
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,570
Top of the news.

156
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,600
Today in Hong Kong they elected the first
Chief Executive

157
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,460
of the future Hong Kong special administrative
region.

158
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,960
Outside the convention center,

159
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
there were demonstrations,

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
and the demonstrators were arrested.

161
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,610
One of them is legislator Emily Lau.

162
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,430
Emily, where are you?".

163
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,021
I said, "I'm in the Wan Chai police station.",

164
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,021
"Oh!

165
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:33,070
Have they beaten up?", I said, "Not yet!".

166
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,490
Was that a risk?

167
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,490
No risk.

168
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,900
No, that's the thing about Hong Kong,

169
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,320
even from then up to now,

170
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,580
Hong Kong is one of the safest and most peaceful
city in the world.

171
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,560
Definitely in China, but in the world.

172
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,139
So, they say, "We have to pass this extradition
bill,

173
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,500
if not, we will become a haven of fugitives."

174
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,919
I said, "We've been negotiating with China

175
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,639
for twenty years about an arrangement, and
we can't do it."

176
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,780
And no one called us a haven of fugitives.

177
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,550
Everybody said, "We are a booming city",

178
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,190
they should come and invest.

179
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,660
What's going on?

180
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,520
Well I think, because of that, what you mentioned,

181
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,910
when the police cracked down so hard on the
extradition protest

182
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,860
on Wednesday June 12th,

183
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,130
I think that really shocked a lot of people
in Hong Kong

184
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,610
and help contribute to the 2 million strong
protest,

185
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,080
the march that happened that Sunday.

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,570
Yes, exactly.

187
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,250
And the police, their behavior was really
terrible.

188
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,910
And the thing is, they did not wear their
badge and no number,

189
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,520
and also they were wearing all the gear

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
that you could not recognize them.

191
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
Some people were saying,

192
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,580
“Oh, they actually don't look like Hong
Kong policeman!

193
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,550
They might be China national security.”

194
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,320
Well, who knows?

195
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,240
But people are very, very suspicious,

196
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,210
and they are very, very angry.

197
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,280
So they just suspect all kinds of things.

198
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,520
And it was terrible, because in the past,

199
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,120
maybe during the Umbrella occupation,

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,550
relations between the police and especially
young people, was tense.

201
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,770
But, by and large it's OK the relations.

202
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,680
Now, having seen them beating people up like
that

203
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,320
and then going to hospitals to arrest patients,

204
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,900
and all these things make people very angry.

205
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,690
That's why we are demanding an independent
inquiry

206
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,350
and to make sure it is a fair and just investigation,

207
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:36,209
we hope that it would be chaired by a very
eminent judge.

208
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,300
But the government still refuse.

209
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,410
Why do you think the extradition bill protests
have been so intense?

210
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,740
Many people have said the administration,

211
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,800
particularly Carrie Lam,

212
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,390
have underestimated the Hong Kong's people's

213
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,329
fear of the communist party.

214
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,600
Because this thing goes through the heart,

215
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,369
and they fear that if the bills pass, one
day,

216
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:09,490
they themselves, or their friends or relatives,

217
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,860
could be sent to China.

218
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,019
And why is it so terrible to be sent to China?

219
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,250
Because over there, it's complete lawlessness.

220
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,470
Here, under the British tradition, we have
the rule of law.

221
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,970
We have an independent traditionary.

222
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,629
People are presumed innocent until they are
found guilty.

223
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,540
Defendants would not be tortured.

224
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,399
All these things are non-existent over there.

225
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,910
So the people are very fearful.

226
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,600
But Carrie Lam obviously did not sense that.

227
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,670
But why?

228
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,149
If you look at the time when she become Chief
Executive,

229
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:51,420
two years ago, she went through several difficult
things.

230
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,550
Very difficult.

231
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,630
Like disqualifying legislators,

232
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,939
disqualifying candidates for election, from
the pro-democracy camp.

233
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:04,730
And then the Beijing National People's Congress
standing committee,

234
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,899
issued an interpretation of the basic law
to justify those things.

235
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,629
And then she passed,

236
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:15,259
[inaudible] passed a bill on co-location,

237
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:19,629
that is co-locating the immigration and customs
authorities,

238
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:23,160
both of China and Hong Kong, just over there,

239
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,980
next to the Star Ferry,

240
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,629
which we think is in bridge of the joined
declaration.

241
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:30,899
But all these things went past,

242
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,690
and it seems not too many people bat an eyelid.

243
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,740
When I travel overseas, people say,

244
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
“Hey!

245
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,790
How come all these things happen.

246
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,000
Hong Kong people seem to just take it.”

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,129
And so, I guess in the words of a bible,

248
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,779
she thinks she could walk on water.

249
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,889
So this time round she said, “Jesus!

250
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:50,889
Nothing.

251
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,019
Look at all the things I have conquered!”

252
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,949
And she thought this would be the same.

253
00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:00,139
But this time, she got it terribly wrong.

254
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:04,269
Well let me challenge you on how you said
China is lawless.

255
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,980
Their courts have a 99.9% conviction rate.

256
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,079
I mean, that's law right there.

257
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,619
That is law, but it's not the legal system
as we know it.

258
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,360
I mean, I speak with a bit of authority, although
I'm not a lawyer.

259
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,249
But I am sitting on the board of directors

260
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:29,269
of the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern
Group.

261
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,439
We set up the group here eleven years ago,

262
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:36,480
to offer support to the human rights lawyers
in mainland China,

263
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,860
who are very brave.

264
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,110
Some of them are in jail, being tortured,

265
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,209
and some have disappeared, but they still
carry on.

266
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,970
If they have a chance, sometimes they don't,

267
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,600
if they have a chance to come here to meet
with us,

268
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,300
they would tell us how terrible it is.

269
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,110
Some of them cannot practice.

270
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,040
It's been taken away, the license,

271
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
and they cannot argue for their client in
court.

272
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,819
And so, it's really terrible.

273
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,439
And they may say, I think the Chinese judicial
system

274
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,420
looks excellent on paper.

275
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,100
But in practice, it's something else.

276
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,459
And that's why even ordinary Chinese people
know,

277
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,939
because they have relatives and friends over
there, and they know.

278
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,459
And who are the people who are most fearful?

279
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,630
It's the business people.

280
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,970
And some have said it publicly.

281
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,220
They say, “If you do business in China,

282
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,579
you have to pay bribes.”

283
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,429
So, under this bill, they're all guilty,

284
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,129
and you don't know which day they will be
nominated

285
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,480
as targets for extradition.

286
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,750
So they are very fearful.

287
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,489
Well I can see why the people of Hong Kong

288
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:43,800
would be very concerned about this extradition
bill,

289
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,999
but do you think meaningful reform can happen
in Hong Kong,

290
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,580
as long as the Chinese communist party is
the ultimate power broker?

291
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:59,510
Since 1997, because we were handed over to
Chinese rule in 1997,

292
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,470
I think for the initial ten years things seemed
OK,

293
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,730
although we have no democracy, we still don't
have it,

294
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,709
but we have the rule of law.

295
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,749
We enjoy freedoms, civil liberties, and personal
safety.

296
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:16,269
These are things which are very close

297
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,930
to the Hong Kong's people's hearts, not democracy.

298
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,759
We don't even know what a democratic Hong
Kong is like.

299
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,660
But these freedoms, personal safety, are very
close to our hearts.

300
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,120
So, our institutions, they may not be perfect,

301
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,889
but they ensure that we enjoy these things

302
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,230
which are our core values.

303
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,790
And I am sure they are core values of people
in many countries.

304
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,690
And ironically, the level of freedoms and
personal safety,

305
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,300
and the rule of law we enjoy here,

306
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,989
is much higher than that of many democratic
countries.

307
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:55,420
If you look around Asia or elsewhere,

308
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,249
you can count till your face turns blue.

309
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:00,769
There are many countries which have periodic
elections,

310
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,480
but their people certainly do not enjoy

311
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,819
the level of personal safety and freedoms,

312
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:08,959
and the rule of law,

313
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,800
independence of the judiciary that we enjoy.

314
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,960
So, we cherish what we've got, we want to
reform it,

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,249
make it better.

316
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:24,110
And we know China can come down on us like
a ton of bricks,

317
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,399
but as I've told many people in the last two
weeks,

318
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,959
Hong Kong is not Tiananmen Square.

319
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,160
Just on June 4th this year,

320
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,379
we had a commemoration of the massacre thirty
years ago.

321
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,730
And we had about one hundred and fifty thousand
people

322
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,329
turning up to the candlelight vigil, at Victoria
Park,

323
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,300
which is the starting point for the big marches.

324
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,079
So, I think China can do it.

325
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,290
The People's Liberation army is just there.

326
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,290
Yep.

327
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,709
That used to be their British barracks.

328
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:03,850
So, the tanks, the machine guns, everything
are there.

329
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,920
But will they deploy them on us?

330
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,639
And if they did, it would be at a very high
price.

331
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:11,730
And not just for us,

332
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,999
you should also remember many Chinese rich
people

333
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:22,230
and their children have invested a lot here.

334
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,329
That's why some people say to me,

335
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,319
“Actually, this fight over the bill is a
fight

336
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,389
between former President Jiang Zemin

337
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,579
and current President Xi Jinping.”

338
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:36,759
Because, Jiang Zemin has a lot of business
interest.

339
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,609
His friends, and relatives.

340
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:40,899
And this bill, of course,

341
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,189
goes to the heart of those people.

342
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,850
And the Chinese government have also said
publicly,

343
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,509
that we need this bill because there are close
to

344
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:53,019
three hundred fugitives from the mainland

345
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,999
who have come here, who are hiding here,

346
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,620
and I can tell you most of them are staying

347
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,259
at the Four Seasons hotel over there.

348
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,040
They abducted one business man from there
a few months ago,

349
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,920
that guy did not file a report with the police.

350
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,089
So they have people here,

351
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,879
but if the two communist leaders are at loggerhead,

352
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,439
they are fighting it out,

353
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,339
it's very sad that we are just caught in the
middle.

354
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:20,389
But Hong Kong as it is,

355
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:21,869
we will always be like that.

356
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:26,430
But, I say, if they try to destroy us,

357
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,110
the price is very high.

358
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,610
Not just for us, but for them too.

359
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,679
And now we are caught in-between the war

360
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,800
between President Trump and President Xi.

361
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,139
And again, because America has a lot of interest
here,

362
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,569
they have many people living here, working
here,

363
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,389
many companies are here.

364
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:45,410
So they have a stake.

365
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,339
And of course they should speak out.

366
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,179
Well I know we've certainly covered on our
show

367
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,079
the battle between Xi Jinping and Jiang Zemin,

368
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,829
so I hope people will check out those episodes.

369
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,619
What do you think others countries like the
US

370
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:03,970
can do about this situation at Hong Kong?

371
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,360
Because Hong Kong is very much dependent on
the US

372
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,839
because many of our business people,

373
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,680
they trade with the US,

374
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,569
they think the US is a very important market
for Hong Kong,

375
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,429
and it's no secret.

376
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,400
And of course, there is the United States–Hong
Kong Policy Act,

377
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,409
which was enacted before 1997 to give Hong
Kong special treatment,

378
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:28,319
especially the bid on us being an independent
custom's territory.

379
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,319
And some people say,

380
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,680
“Oh well, if Hong Kong loses one country,
two systems,

381
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,029
then maybe the bill should be amended!"

382
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,660
We take away that independent custom territory.

383
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,720
The leader of the liberal here Felix Chung
said,

384
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,779
“If that should happen,

385
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:45,779
the game is over.”

386
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:48,059
He said the game is over,

387
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,750
not just for the business community,

388
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,169
but for the whole of Hong Kong.

389
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,580
And we certainly don't want that sort of

390
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,580
catastrophic thing to happen to us.

391
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,970
But some Americans and others are suggesting

392
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,620
maybe we should have a law,

393
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,059
targeting those people who try to undermine

394
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,769
human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong.

395
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:13,130
Particularly senior government officials

396
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,409
who perpetrate such acts so that they would
be banned

397
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:21,240
from entering the United States and their
assets.

398
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,070
The United States would be frozen.

399
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,150
And I say, that is tremendous!

400
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,150
I think that's great.

401
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,690
Sort of like the Magnitsky Act?

402
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,420
Yeah, maybe something like that.

403
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,669
So you only target the guilty individuals

404
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,159
and not harm all the other Hong Kong people,

405
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,980
because we are friends with the Americans.

406
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,289
They don't want to harm us.

407
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,380
But there are certain individuals who have
done such evil acts,

408
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,350
so they should be targeted.

409
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,990
What about the upcoming G20?

410
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,500
Well, we certainly hope that not just President
Trump,

411
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,940
but the other leaders attending the summit

412
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,970
would also use the occasion to voice their
concern,

413
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,840
and voice their support for Hong Kong.

414
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,100
I've noticed many have already spoken out.

415
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,480
A few days ago, over there in Western,

416
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,559
in the central government liaison office,

417
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,080
which is the representative of Beijing here.

418
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,190
And they summoned many of the probation politicians

419
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,789
there to give them a lecture and to tell them
to support Carrie Lam,

420
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:22,659
and say Beijing supports Carrie.

421
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,100
And afterwards one of them came out, Mr Tam,

422
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,670
and he told the media,

423
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,270
“They told us to support Carrie,

424
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,770
and they say the bill was OK.

425
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,480
Except then, there was foreign interference.

426
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,980
And they said in the last few days,

427
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,210
there were sixty-seven statements issued by
foreign governments.”

428
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,840
I said, “What?

429
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,929
Big deal!

430
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,159
If you don't care about them,

431
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:51,169
even if it's six hundred and seventy statements,

432
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:52,169
what the hell?

433
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:53,820
It's not sixty-seven bombs!”

434
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,080
Now the fact they counted it so closely, shows
they care.

435
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,399
And that's what the human rights lawyers told
us, when we met.

436
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,100
They said, “Don't believe it.

437
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,130
If someone tells you China

438
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,669
doesn't care about international public opinion.

439
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,669
It's not true.”

440
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,000
I said, “Really?”

441
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,600
They said, “Yes.

442
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,060
China does care.

443
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
Why?

444
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,630
Because China cares about face.”

445
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,059
So sixty-seven statements.

446
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,850
To me, that's not enough.

447
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,390
I want a lot more!

448
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,370
I hope they will be issued before the G-summit,

449
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,990
or during the summit in Osaka, and of course,

450
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,779
when they meet President Xi Jinping,

451
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,519
I hope they will raise it too.

452
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,470
Tell President Xi that Hong Kong people

453
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,170
don't want the extradition bill,

454
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:43,610
they don't want erosion of civil liberties
and the rule of law,

455
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,260
and we want to have democratic government.

456
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,880
We want to have the ability to elect our government.

457
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,029
We're not fighting for independence.

458
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:53,490
We're not fighting for self-determination,

459
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,360
we know we are part of the People's Republic
of China,

460
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,679
but China has made a promise of one country,
two systems.

461
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,529
China's now negating on it, and we are very,
very angry.

462
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,370
Well in 1994, I know you ask Margaret Thatcher

463
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,580
if it was morally defensible to hand a city

464
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,370
of over five million people,

465
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,990
to a communist dictatorship.

466
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,140
Do you think the UK has upheld its side of

467
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,850
the Sino-British Joint Declaration?

468
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,850
The UK is terrible, really.

469
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,420
The UK is always looking after its own interests,

470
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,520
like the question I ask Mrs Thatcher.

471
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,830
They want money, they want trade and all that.

472
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,980
And it's very sad when they pulled out of
Hong Kong,

473
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,000
Hong Kong had no democratic institutions.

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,340
They left nothing behind.

475
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,039
And when they pulled out,

476
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,010
there were over three million British citizens,

477
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,419
but citizens who have no right to live in
the UK.

478
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:54,159
They created a form of citizenship called
British National Overseas,

479
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,710
the BNO, which they cannot pass on to their
children,

480
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,190
but they can use it during their lifetime

481
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,690
as some form of travel document.

482
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,660
So whenever I meet British officials, I said,

483
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,179
“Do you know what BNO stands for?”

484
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:09,350
This Britain's says, “No?”

485
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,870
But, whether you like it or not,

486
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,880
there are still several million British citizens
here.

487
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,909
And many of them are very angry and very frightened.

488
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:25,399
So Britain has a responsibility towards these
people,

489
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:26,890
and the rest of us too.

490
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,269
Because you ran this colony for one and a
half centuries.

491
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:33,389
And now the people here are very, very fearful.

492
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:36,090
So what the least Britain can do is to speak
up.

493
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,880
I know Brexit is a big problem, but still,

494
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,350
not only them but Parliament,

495
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,030
the British people should look at Hong Kong
and say,

496
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,950
“Hey, can we not do something for Hong Kong
people?

497
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,660
Speak out, tell the Chinese to stop cracking
down on them.

498
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,710
Respect one country, two systems.”

499
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,220
And Britain should talk to its allies,

500
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,179
if it still has some.

501
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:59,480
I hope it does!

502
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,070
Tell the allies to speak out too,

503
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,029
because international public opinion does
matter.

504
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:11,190
I can see why some people call you Hong Kong's
Iron Lady.

505
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,429
So what's next for the future of Hong Kong?

506
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:15,429
No.

507
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:17,840
I think we will just keep on fighting.

508
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,409
Although I stepped down from the legislative
council

509
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,840
after serving for twenty-five years,

510
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,690
but I've said I will never step down from
the fight

511
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,659
for human rights, democracy, and the rule
of law.

512
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,710
And we will continue to have marches,

513
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,450
but we will do it in a peaceful and orderly
way,

514
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,130
and the next one is on the 1st of July,

515
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,991
I hope you'll be around to see it.

516
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:41,991
We will.

517
00:23:41,991 --> 00:23:47,330
And I tell you, like a bad penny, we will
keep turning up.

518
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,309
Thank you so much for joining us today.

519
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,929
It's a pleasure.

520
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,360
Thank you.
