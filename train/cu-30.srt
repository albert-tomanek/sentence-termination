1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,379
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:03,530
move over pizza rat,

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,370
there’s a new rodent in town!

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,870
On the Internet.

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,370
And by the way,

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,460
this episode has some graphic photos.

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,270
So hide your children.

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,220
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,130
Ahh, childhood in China.

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,300
It’s come a long way since the days of Mao’s
cultural revolution.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,340
Kids are no longer encouraged to

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,360
purge rightist elements in society

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,830
with stolen military weapons.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,160
Now they mainly just have to take exams.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,530
But that doesn’t mean childhood

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,760
is without its joys!

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
In China,

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,200
the land of knockoffs,

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,820
there’s always fun-filled slightly imperfect
versions

21
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,760
of beloved Disney Classics.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,980
From toys,

23
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,280
to movies

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,940
To...oh my gosh!

25
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,720
I don’t remember that scene in Ratatouille…

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,960
This image has become the biggest thing on the Chinese internet

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,470
over the past several days.

28
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,140
Yes, even bigger than using fake Donald Trump tweets

29
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,990
to wish your family a happy new year.

30
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,970
Now I don’t know who ratted him out,

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,280
but apparently this little guy was caught
stealing rice.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,510
And rather than a simple extermination,

33
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,640
it was given the Cultural Revolution treatment.

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
This sign says

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,360
“I won’t dare do it again.”

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Get it?!

37
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Cause he’s dead...

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
or I guess he will be soon.

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,880
Honestly, people just don’t have a sense
of humor anymore.

40
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,770
Apparently, of the almost 6,000 comments this
image got

41
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,670
on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter,

42
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,659
many “weren’t finding it funny.”

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,510
What’s wrong with a little unnecessary cruelty

44
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,409
against a helpless creature

45
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,810
that also conjures up memories of a time of
constant inhuman torture

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,100
and suffering the Chinese Communist Party
forced upon its citizens?!

47
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,840
That’s the problem with kids these days.

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,189
They weren’t brought up committing

49
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,920
or being victimized by atrocities that will
haunt them

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,439
for the rest of their lives.

51
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,200
This is a sign of changing social mores in
China.

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,770
In the early days of the Communist Revolution,

53
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,590
life was, how shall we say...

54
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,729
cheap?

55
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,900
Like when Chairman Mao said this in 1957,

56
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,379
when talking about why he wasn't afraid of
nuclear war:

57
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,129
There are 2.7 billion people in the world;

58
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,499
it doesn’t matter if some are killed.

59
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,779
China has a population of 600 million;

60
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,700
even if half of them are killed,

61
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,529
there are still 300 million people left.

62
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:29,730
Demonstrating a strong grasp of math and population
control,

63
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,739
both of which would continue to guide the
Party for decades.

64
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:36,329
People back then were encouraged to kill pests,

65
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,200
whether they be sparrows

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,519
or landowners.

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,519
Seriously,

68
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,260
that was a landowner about to be shot.

69
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,800
But don’t start hating on Chinese people.

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,859
You should actually be hating on

71
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,269
the Chinese Communist Party.

72
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,269
It was the Party that wiped out China’s
traditional values

73
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,329
as a way to establish its own ideology.

74
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,799
It was the Party that told people

75
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,360
it was fine to kill landowners for the crime
of...

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,870
owning land—

77
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,909
and then forced or brainwashed its citizens

78
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,819
into taking part.

79
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,299
So after one or two generations of this,

80
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,469
well, you can see why even today,

81
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,969
you’ll find cases of people doing things
like,

82
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,700
oh I don’t know,

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,450
adopting dogs, plural,

84
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,430
and feeding them to their pet snake.

85
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,559
He posted a video of it online.

86
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:25,409
And no, I’m not going to show it to you.

87
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,409
But on the other hand,

88
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,730
there’s a growing movement of Chinese people

89
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,669
going the other way.

90
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,669
Remember the story I ran

91
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,040
about the world’s saddest polar bear?

92
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,129
Thousands of Chinese citizens petitioned

93
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,839
and got him removed from his horrible display
case

94
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,499
at the mall.

95
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,629
And even Chinese celebrities

96
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,889
are speaking out for animal rights.

97
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:54,560
You don’t have to play ball to be a great
shot blocker.

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,860
Never buy illegal wildlife products.

99
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,140
I know what you’re thinking.

100
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,729
Who releases an elephant and Yao Ming into
a basketball court

101
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,720
and then starts shooting?

102
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,239
But the mind of a poacher is a hard thing
to understand.

103
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,239
By the way,

104
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,599
Yao Ming was part of a selective breeding
program by the state

105
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,459
to create a basketball superstar.

106
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,160
Just a fun little aside.

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
But there is a growing animal rights movement
in China.

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,340
And they’re trying to change the fact

109
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,380
that China is the only major industrialized
nation

110
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,530
with no serious legislation against animal
cruelty.

111
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,120
And that could affect things like the

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,920
Yulin Dog Meat Eating Festival,

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,970
where 10,000 dogs are served as food every
year.

114
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,980
That’s not how you wok the dog.

115
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,910
Or the practice of making tiger wine.

116
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,330
Or whatever’s going on here.

117
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,580
Oh my gosh.

118
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,650
Poor Yogi.

119
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,950
And Boo-Boo.

120
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,070
So from now on,

121
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,220
if you’re going to reference the cultural
revolution in a photo,

122
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,970
at least leave it for your graduation photo.

123
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,630
So what do you think about the picture?

124
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,900
Does the rat’s punishment fit its crime?

125
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,380
Leave your comments below.

126
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,790
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

127
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,530
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

128
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,790
see you next time.
