1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,579
From poisons

2
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:02,579
to road accidents,

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,940
a lot of things in China can be deadly.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,759
Hi. Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,120
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,480
Be sure to subscribe for the latest China news.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,400
The world is full of delightful deadly dangers.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,460
From natural disasters to disease,

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,090
from toxic waste to toxic food.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,620
And China’s certainly got its fair share
of things that could kill you...

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,620
eventually.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,720
So today, I bring you five things to look
out for in China

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,280
if you’re not yet ready to meet Marx.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,920
Karl, not Groucho.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,680
Number 5

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,860
Tainted food.

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,100
Now, I love Chinese food.

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,570
Whether it’s soup dumplings,

19
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,760
or red-cooked pork,

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,989
or hand-pulled noodles—

21
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,480
there’s no cuisine that tantalizes the taste
buds like Chinese food.

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,870
But when you eat Chinese food in China these
days,

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,930
well, you may be putting yourself at risk.

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,760
I don’t want to be alarmist here—

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,780
you’re probably not going to die,

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,710
but you might wish you were dead.

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,790
For example, if you’re visiting China,

28
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,190
you’ll definitely want to try the street
food.

29
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,160
Just think of it like playing Russian roulette

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,360
with your digestive system.

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,690
Vendors may not washing things,

32
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,550
or maybe they let meat sit around in the open
for hours.

33
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,690
Sometimes street food can be great.

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,100
Other times, let’s just say it can come
back to bite you.

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,810
And consider that some of the delicious foods

36
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,320
that you may be eating might have been prepared

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,530
using recycled gutter oil.

38
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,040
“It’s all in a day’s work for this woman.

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,720
She opens up a manhole cover and scoops out

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,220
as much slop as she can.”

41
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,310
According that Radio Free Asia report,

42
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,060
business is so good,

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,270
in just a few short years of scooping out
gutter gunk,

44
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,020
that woman made enough money to build a house.

45
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,070
“Her slop eventually ends up at a processing
plant like this one,

46
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,450
where it’s combined with other animal fat
refuse,

47
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,170
to create recycled cooking oil.

48
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,030
Workers put the oil in barrels for delivery

49
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,430
to restaurants and hotels.”

50
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,950
Now that video is from 2013.

51
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,710
So have things changed since then?

52
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,610
Well, since at least 2010,

53
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,670
Chinese authorities have repeatedly cracked
down

54
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,390
on the use of gutter oil,

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,849
but there’s no sign that it’s gone.

56
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,960
Especially since authorities have to keep
ramping up the crackdown.

57
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,810
Now you might think going to a Western restaurant

58
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,360
like KFC or McDonald’s would be safe—

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,370
since they have higher standards.

60
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,460
Well, not necessarily.

61
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,050
A video surfaced in Chinese media a few years
back,

62
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,980
showing disgusting practices in a Shanghai
food-processing factory

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,870
that supplies ingredients to a lot of international
restaurant brands.

64
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,720
“It began with this grainy video shot by
local TV,

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,810
showing workers allegedly processing expired
meat.

66
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,270
Mixing raw and recycled meat,

67
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,170
and pulling raw meat directly off the floor
with their bare hands.”

68
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,720
The plant supplied meat in several Chinese
cities

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,700
to McDonald’s, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut,
and Papa John’s.

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,850
Which I didn’t even know they had in China.

71
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,530
Food scandals in China are disturbingly common.

72
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,840
From ‘seriously mouldy’ meals on Chinese
trains...

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,920
to kindergartens feeding kids ‘rotten, worm-infested
food’...

74
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,750
restaurants and institutions may not be

75
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,090
a safe haven of food safety in the least.

76
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,870
A quality control and compliance service provider
called Qima

77
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,270
found that almost half of Chinese food-processing
plants

78
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,360
fail to meet internationally acceptable standards.

79
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,100
The company conducted several thousand inspections,

80
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,410
audits and tests on food-processing plants
in China

81
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,980
and found abnormal levels of pesticides, antibiotics,

82
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,740
heavy metals, bacteria, or viruses

83
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,810
that could put consumers at risk.

84
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,160
The Qima’s vice president said,

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,110
“There are horror stories, obviously”...

86
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,920
after the company published a report that

87
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,620
48% of the thousands of food processing plants
in China

88
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,470
did not meet the requirements set by Western

89
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,020
food trading companies and retailers.

90
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,490
Oh, and careful what you wash down your meals
with, too, because...

91
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,050
Number 4

92
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,610
Toxic drinks.

93
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,780
The company that makes Jack Daniel’s, Brown-Forman,

94
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,970
estimates that around 30% of all alcohol in
China is fake.

95
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,570
But perhaps more shocking is a recent report
that

96
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,190
nearly 40% of Chinese people knowingly buy
fake booze.

97
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,500
Fake booze means it’s not what the label
says it is.

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,430
It could be anything from a cheaper brand

99
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,520
poured into a more expensive bottle,

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,990
to straight-up poisonous bootleg liquor

101
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,910
made in a bathtub.

102
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,780
And in some cases, fake booze can kill you.

103
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,950
Just like real booze—

104
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,440
except fake booze can also kill you

105
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,980
in ways you don’t expect.

106
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,080
That’s what the World Health Organization’s

107
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,090
representative in China says.

108
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,389
“Where counterfeit alcohol

109
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,220
is made from poor quality ingredients

110
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,680
or toxic industrial chemicals,

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
consuming it could lead to

112
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,080
serious acute illness or worse.”

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,930
The nasty chemicals he’s referring to

114
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,820
include antifreeze and methanol,

115
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,770
which can make you go blind.

116
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,410
And bottling conditions can be,

117
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,770
as one British newspaper reported,

118
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,540
“perilously unsanitary.”

119
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,370
Which is a nice way of saying that counterfeiters

120
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,980
were caught bottling the booze in toilets.

121
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,660
In a recent case 22 people were poisoned

122
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,350
after drinking fake whisky at a bar southern
China.

123
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,620
It’s unclear how much they drank,

124
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,520
but according to local reports,

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,690
some experienced visual impairment,

126
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,300
dizziness and some even vomited.

127
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,199
Now while for some people that might sound
like

128
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,000
just another Friday night,

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,550
it turns out the whiskey was poisonous,

130
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,790
and some of them ended up in intensive care
unit

131
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,410
and nearly died.

132
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,410
Now you might think:

133
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,420
“Liquor then beer,

134
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,190
you’re in the clear.”

135
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,010
But even beer in China can make you sick.

136
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,180
In this video,

137
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,610
workers at an underground factory in Dongguan

138
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,790
are dunking used Budweiser cans into a tub
of cheap beer

139
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,610
with their bare hands to fill them up.

140
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,050
Then the Budweiser-branded cans run along

141
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,590
a filthy conveyor belt where they get capped
and presto,

142
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,290
ready to quench the thirst—

143
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,290
or claim the life—

144
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,060
of the unsuspecting night club goer.

145
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,800
Authorities estimated that the underground
factory

146
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,389
churned out about 600,000 crates of fake Budweiser
a month,

147
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:27,430
which were then distributed to bars and nightclubs.

148
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,449
Fake alcohol won’t always kill you,

149
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,430
but you’ll definitely have the worst hangover
of your life.

150
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,770
For a quick recovery,

151
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,830
just remember,

152
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,620
drink plenty of water.

153
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,270
Just not the fake kind,

154
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,670
like from the illegal bottling plant near
Shanghai,

155
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,620
where a man was busted filling empty jugs
with dirty tap water

156
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,680
and passing them off as well-know brands like
Nestle.

157
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,570
So...China is full of fake liquor and water.

158
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,710
I think I’ll just stick with milk.

159
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,000
Unless, of course, it’s...

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,150
Number 3

161
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,770
Tainted milk powder.

162
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,600
Back in 2008, 300,000 babies got sick

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,699
after drinking tainted milk powder

164
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,610
from the Chinese company Sanlu.

165
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,919
At least six of the babies died from kidney
damage.

166
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,170
Eventually, two Sanlu executives also died.

167
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,960
From being executed.

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,509
The scandal was one of the worst consumer
product scares

169
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,610
in modern Chinese history.

170
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,389
Partly because authorities tried—

171
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,389
and failed—

172
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,540
to cover it up.

173
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,210
Although they did successfully cover it up

174
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,130
until after the 2008 Beijing Olympics,

175
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,250
so they get at least a bronze medal for saving
face.

176
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,960
Now Chinese authorities say they’re working
to solve the problem.

177
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,970
But the consumer market doesn’t seem to
think so.

178
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,940
That’s why the majority of Chinese parents

179
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,509
still prefer to buy their infant formula from
foreign brands.

180
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,020
There’s even a black market of infant formula
traffickers

181
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,220
who bring in powdered milk from abroad.

182
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,720
That’s like trusting your local drug dealer

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,970
more than a government-regulated company.

184
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,530
I mean, literally,

185
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,389
people are buying infant formula on the street.

186
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,930
Which is not smart, since big criminal syndicates

187
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,289
are also getting in on the racket.

188
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,960
In April 2016,

189
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,479
Shanghai authorities arrested nine people

190
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,180
for producing more than 17,000 tins

191
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,990
of fake milk powder with counterfeit labels—

192
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,810
so these products looked like those

193
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,310
from American infant formula brands.

194
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,199
Some Chinese parents are just crossing the
border

195
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,240
into Hong Hong to buy legit milk powder,

196
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
but the Hong Kong government

197
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,830
has now set restrictions on that.

198
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,381
The demand for high quality milk formula in
China right now

199
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:32,099
is so high, and the supply so limited,

200
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,199
that it’s become the most valued gift at
baby showers.

201
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:37,199
I guess I should return

202
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,789
that plush Cthulhu I bought for my niece.

203
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,240
What’s that, Shelley?

204
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,039
Ok, fine, it was for me.

205
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,170
On to other things that can kill you...

206
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,230
Number 2

207
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,369
Traffic accidents

208
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:53,100
Driving around China can be a killer experience.

209
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,040
In 2016 in China there were over 300 thousand
deaths

210
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,439
due to road incidents—

211
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,389
more than 800 people every single day.

212
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,309
When you compare that the US—

213
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,999
and adjust for the number of drivers in each
country—

214
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:11,379
you’re 6 times more likely to die driving
in China.

215
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,480
The best travel advice in China is to avoid
the roads—

216
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,069
and take the train.

217
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,929
Well...not always.

218
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:18,929
And...

219
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,720
Number 1

220
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,529
Air Pollution

221
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,100
In China, the skies aren’t always blue.

222
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,470
Air pollution is not only costing the Chinese
economy

223
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,149
around 38 billion dollars a year,

224
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,540
it’s killing 1 million people per year.

225
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,220
A new study from the Chinese University of
Hong Kong

226
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,779
says an average of 1.1 million premature deaths
each year

227
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,380
are caused by two types of air pollutants:

228
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,260
a fine particle called PM2.5 and smog-inducing
ozone.

229
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,379
PM2.5 are microscopic airborne particles small
enough

230
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,790
to lodge deep in the lungs and cause respiratory
problems.

231
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,129
That’s the number 3 cause of death in China,

232
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:01,209
according to the WHO.

233
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,040
Other studies link ozone pollution to an increase

234
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,209
in the number of deaths from cardiovascular
diseases,

235
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:09,559
which is the number one killer in China.

236
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,699
Beijing is one of China’s most-air polluted
cities.

237
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,050
It’s not good for kids...

238
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,709
or the elderly.

239
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,829
Air pollution is even a reason

240
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:19,269
many Western business people

241
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,459
want to get out of China.

242
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,990
Or maybe it’s just the food.

243
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,990
Or the booze.

244
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,139
Or the car accidents.

245
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:31,220
So what do you think about the top 5

246
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,220
things in China that could kill you?

247
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,379
Leave your comments below.

248
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:35,920
And before we go,

249
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,850
it’s time for me to answer a question from
a viewer

250
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,519
who supports China Uncensored

251
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,489
on the crowd-funding website Patreon.

252
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:43,529
Karan Joshi asks:

253
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,420
“Can the People's Republic of China

254
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,300
ever split up like the Soviet Union?”

255
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,569
Good question, Karan.

256
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,540
The difference is that in the Soviet Union’s
case,

257
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,439
it wasn’t just one country.

258
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,649
It was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,

259
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,930
essentially a country of countries.

260
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,889
The Soviet Union included Russia,

261
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,480
but also about 15 others,

262
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,380
like Ukraine, Latvia, Kazakhstan, and, well,

263
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,989
almost all of the Stans.

264
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,759
After the Soviet Union dissolved,

265
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:10,309
for the most part these countries

266
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,769
went back to being independent countries.

267
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,309
But the People's Republic of China

268
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,620
is basically a single country.

269
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,360
If that government collapses,

270
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,260
maybe Tibet would want to split off.

271
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,089
But under the current situation,

272
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,389
it would be difficult for it to succeed,

273
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,489
because now there are more

274
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,699
ethnically Chinese residents in Tibet

275
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,680
than ethnic Tibetans.

276
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,999
This the result of a decades-long campaign

277
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,509
by the Communist Party to permanently merge

278
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:36,559
Tibet into China.

279
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,559
My hope is that

280
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,119
when the Chinese Communist Party collapses,

281
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:42,279
Tibet could at a minimum have meaningful freedoms

282
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,079
under a more benevolent Chinese leadership.

283
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,120
The same difficulties exist for Xinjiang,

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
a.k.a.

285
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,440
East Turkestan.

286
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,489
And as for Taiwan,

287
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:53,699
it’s never been part of the People's Republic
of China,

288
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,989
and it has its own independent government.

289
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:58,040
So it’s in a completely different situation

290
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,180
than Tibet and Xinjiang.

291
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,970
But who can predict what’s going to happen

292
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,850
in China this century.

293
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,429
Thanks for your question, Karan.

294
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:06,429
And for everyone else,

295
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,299
we rely on support from viewers like Karan

296
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,290
who contribute a dollar or more per episode

297
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,639
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

298
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,639
Without viewer support,

299
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,730
we couldn’t continue China Uncensored.

Uncensored.

302
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,230
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

303
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,240
See you next time.
