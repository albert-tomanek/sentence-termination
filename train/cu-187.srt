1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,940
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,860
how China is trying to dominate India.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,500
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,440
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,079
India and China have a lot in common.

6
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,620
They're the world’s two biggest countries;

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,590
with the world’s most ambitious economies;

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,590
And they both...

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,440
like Lady Gaga?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,340
Uh, and of course,

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,750
they both love movies,

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,780
as we know from the world-famous Bollywood

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,840
and...Chollywood?

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,660
Ok, Chollywood is a terrible name.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,399
But, everyone loves Bollywood,

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,640
even Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,440
In a recent meeting

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,749
with Indian Prime Minister Modi, Xi Jinping
told him he’s seen Dangal,

19
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:46,319
the recent Bollywood smash hit.

20
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:47,780
Dangal has become the 20th

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
highest grossing film

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,440
in Chinese box office history.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,240
Another thing Xi Jinping loves—

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,460
yoga.

25
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,159
And not just because Premier Li Keqiang

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,580
looks great in yoga pants.

27
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,900
He’s been working on his downward slumdog.

28
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,330
No, it's because at the meeting with Modi,

29
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,980
Xi also made sure to remind him

30
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,910
of China’s recent Yoga day.

31
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,910
Because if there’s one thing

32
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,130
the Chinese Communist Party loves,

33
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,720
it’s people meditating.

34
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,260
Moving on.

35
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,080
But despite having so much in common,

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,210
India and China can at best be described

37
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,860
as frenemies.

38
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,470
And since both want to be top

39
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,710
slumdog in Asia,

40
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,900
that means trouble.

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,840
What’s that Shelley?

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,210
I should stop making Slumdog Millionaire puns

43
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,540
because it’s a British film?!

44
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,030
Next you’re going to tell me the James Bond
movies

45
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,450
are American.

46
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,510
What?

47
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,610
Co-productions?

48
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,700
Holding companies?

49
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,400
Wow, that's really complicated.

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,980
Anyway, back to the topic.

51
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,491
Here are 5 way China

52
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,920
is trying to dominate India.

53
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,170
Number 5:

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,850
The Friend of My Enemy

55
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,920
India and Pakistan don’t exactly get along.

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
They’ve had four wars since 1947.

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,920
But fortunately for Pakistan,

58
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,340
it has a friend in the Chinese Communist Party.

59
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,820
Pakistan was one of the CCP’s

60
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,920
earliest allies,

61
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,270
back when no one wanted

62
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,740
to be the CCP’s friend.

63
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,900
You know,

64
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,420
because of all the mass murder.

65
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,840
Starting in the 1970s,

66
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,170
the CCP helped Pakistan

67
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,870
build nuclear weapons—

68
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,230
by providing blueprints, t

69
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,420
echnical know-how,

70
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,400
and enriched uranium.

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,520
And today,

72
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,530
the CCP is working with Pakistan

73
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,400
to build the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,760
It’s a 62-billion-dollar plan

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,590
to flood Pakistan with Chinese investment—

76
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,590
everything from railways

77
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,280
to energy projects.

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
And for its part,

79
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,750
the CCP has used its influence in the UN

80
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,010
to shield a Pakistani

81
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,000
who India considers a terrorist.

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,150
Basically, Pakistan is India’s

83
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,350
biggest military threat.

84
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,360
And the CCP is taking full advantage.

85
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,630
Number 4:

86
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,440
Border Buddies

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Aside from China and Pakistan,

88
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
India shares a land border

89
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,849
with four other countries:

90
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,959
Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan.

91
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,290
And the Chinese regime is spending

92
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,090
billions of dollars to become friends

93
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,230
with those neighbors,

94
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,230
you know,

95
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,959
making them indebted to China,

96
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,070
often literally.

97
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,990
It’s part of China’s One Belt,

98
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,090
One Road Initiative.

99
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,080
That’s where the Chinese regime

100
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,260
drains developing nations of their resources

101
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,300
through large-scale infrastructure projects

102
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,860
and massive loans,

103
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,120
in exchange for making China

104
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
the economic center of the world.

105
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,300
It’s win-win.

106
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
The Chinese regime

107
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,480
gets money and power,

108
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,830
and the other countries get to become

109
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,870
tribute states.

110
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,770
At least they get high-speed trains.

111
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,890
This is Myanmar,

112
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,990
the country formerly and sometimes

113
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,810
still known as Burma,

114
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,800
which was confusing for everyone.

115
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,959
Until they complained about being

116
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,010
a slave to their record label

117
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,599
and said they would now be known

118
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,290
only by this symbol.

119
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,290
China has built the country

120
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,760
formerly known as Burma

121
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,370
a handy oil pipeline

122
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,250
that’s part of a 10-billion-dollar

123
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,599
Special Economic Zone.

124
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,030
China is using this to,

125
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,110
let’s say,

126
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,140
improve relations.

127
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,220
In Nepal,

128
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,770
China is the main financial backer

129
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,670
of “two special economic zones,

130
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,150
a pair of hydropower plants,

131
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,849
and an international airport.”

132
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:14,470
And that’s just part of the 8.3 billion
dollars

133
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,100
China has pledged to invest there.

134
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,120
India is also investing in Nepal,

135
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,550
but only less than one-twentieth as much.

136
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,570
Come on, India!

137
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,220
Don’t you know you catch more flies

138
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,000
with billions of dollars of investment?

139
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,900
Bangladesh is also getting wrapped up

140
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,620
in Xi Jinping’s One Belt.

141
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,040
And China’s belt is pretty high.

142
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,540
And as for Bhutan,

143
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,970
the tiny, traditional nation

144
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,590
that cares more about Gross National Happiness

145
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,919
than Gross National Product...

146
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,919
...well, they’re not super into

147
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,100
big infrastructure investments.

148
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,620
So China has sent “circus artists,

149
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,630
acrobats and footballers” to Bhutan.

150
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,630
Nice try, China,

151
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,010
but you’re not going to win Bhutan

152
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,830
with circus artists.

153
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,030
But the overall plan here

154
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,810
is for China to have more influence

155
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,070
on India’s neighbors

156
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,800
than India itself does.

157
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,130
Number 3:

158
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,729
Economic Corridors

159
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,130
India has boycotted China’s

160
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,160
One Belt One Road Initiative,

161
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,690
mainly because India thinks China

162
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,040
would use expensive infrastructure projects

163
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,910
to subjugate India and indebt it to China
forever.

164
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,950
But just because India is boycotting that
one initiative

165
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,411
doesn’t mean it doesn’t have

166
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,780
economic ties with China.

167
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,160
India is already part of the Bangladesh-China-

168
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,830
India-Myanmar—or BCIM—

169
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,100
Economic Corridor.

170
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,260
And earlier this month,

171
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,680
China’s National Development and Reform
Commission

172
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,010
and the State Oceanic Administration

173
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,360
announced the launch of the snappily named

174
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,100
China-Indian Ocean-Africa-Mediterranean

175
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,080
Sea Blue Economic Passage,

176
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,900
or…CIOAMSBEP.

177
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,970
It will connect the “Bangladesh-China-

178
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,900
India-Myanmar economic corridors,”...

179
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,740
...with the China-Pakistan Economic corridor.

180
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,850
Now you might be wondering:

181
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,540
Why would India go in for hooking up

182
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,380
with Pakistan like this?

183
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, it seems when China announced the plan,

184
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,729
they didn’t bother asking New Delhi.

185
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,400
But with the promise of such economic fortune

186
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,940
dangling over the heads of so many

187
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
of India’s neighbors—

188
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,830
neighbors China has already been courting—

189
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,110
how long can India hold out

190
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,930
before it has to go with the flow?

191
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,180
Number 2:

192
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,070
Playing Both Sides

193
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,400
Of course many of India and China’s neighbors

194
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,139
see what’s happening

195
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,350
and try to play both sides.

196
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,690
Take Sri Lanka, for example,

197
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,290
an island nation just off the southern

198
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,910
coast of India.

199
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,479
For years, the Sri Lankan government

200
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,100
fought a bloody war against

201
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,949
the Tamil Tigers.

202
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,050
It sounds like a high school football team,

203
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,050
but no,

204
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,050
it was a dangerous group

205
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,790
of rebels/freedom fighters,

206
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,640
depending on who you ask.

207
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,650
A lot of the civilians

208
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,680
were raped and killed on both sides

209
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,290
during the 25-year war,

210
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,520
and the Sri Lankan government

211
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,570
has been accused of war crimes.

212
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,889
Suffice it to say,

213
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,750
Sri Lanka isn’t too popular

214
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,480
on the international scene—

215
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,330
especially right after the war ended

216
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,600
in 2009.

217
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
But the Chinese regime

218
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,199
swept in with 8 billion dollars in loans

219
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,830
to build infrastructure,

220
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,699
and a promise not to get all judgy

221
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,229
about those human rights atrocities.

222
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,330
But now, India also wants access

223
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,740
to Sri Lanka.

224
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,600
And it’s actively competing with China for
it.

225
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,020
India’s prime minister visited Sri Lanka
in May

226
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,080
and talked about their “strong relationship.”

227
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,520
But then a few days later,

228
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,210
Sri Lanka’s prime minister went to

229
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,610
the One Belt One Road Forum in Beijing,

230
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,919
where China offered up 24 billion dollars

231
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,729
to the country.

232
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:33,090
It's like Sri Lanka is pitting

233
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,830
its divorced parents against each other

234
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,780
in order to get better Christmas presents.

235
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
And finally…

236
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,450
Number 1:

237
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,389
Boots on the Ground

238
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,610
Earlier this week,

239
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,610
Chinese troops crossed

240
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,060
part of the border with India,

241
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,350
and destroyed two Indian army bunkers.

242
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,030
The bunkers were part of a plan by India

243
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,830
to establish 17 Mountain Strike Corps

244
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,400
along the Arunachal Pradesh,

245
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,030
a disputed territory that,

246
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,870
according to China and nobody else,

247
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,310
is called South Tibet.

248
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,310
The new corps would have

249
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,180
“two new high-altitude infantry divisions

250
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,120
as well as armoured, artillery,

251
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,100
air defence, engineer brigades...

252
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,460
fully formed with 90,274 soldiers.”

253
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,030
That will be useful considering that

254
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,790
basically every year,

255
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,790
Chinese troops try to

256
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,319
march across the border there,

257
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,840
as seen in this shaky video.

258
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,430
Wow, so their border

259
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,260
is basically just a low pile of rocks.

260
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,290
What they really need is a wall.

261
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,979
Or at least a large fence.

262
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:30,979
So what do you think of

263
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,160
China’s plan to surround India?
