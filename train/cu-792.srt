1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,190
2018 has been a big year in China News.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,920
Here are the 10 biggest stories you need to
know.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,000
This is China Uncensored.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,320
Number 10

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,340
The Trade War Begins

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,010
Trump has shocked everyone as president.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,340
All presidential candidates talk tough on
China.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,500
But in Trump’s case,

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,850
he actually followed through.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,029
In fact, here he is in 2011,

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,040
long before he ran for president,

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,309
laying out what would become future US policy
toward China.

13
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,030
Well what are you going to do.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,120
What can you do?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
So easy.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,149
I’m going I’d drop a 25% tax on China.

17
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,460
And that may be coming true.

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,050
In July, this year,

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,530
Trump announced the first round of US tariffs
on China.

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,809
It was in response to decades of unfair trade
practices

21
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,750
and intellectual property theft.

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,879
And the trade war heated up quickly.

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,989
First, Trump announced a 25% tariff

24
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,989
on 50 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports,

25
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:04,549
divided into two chunks,

26
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:06,689
34 billion dollars to begin with,

27
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,310
then an additional 16 billion that came later.

28
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,549
The Chinese Communist Party was not happy.

29
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,630
“China has no choice but to fight back strongly

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,399
to resolutely protect its national interests

31
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,670
and the people's interests,

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,840
and to resolutely defend globalization

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,750
and the multilateral trading system.

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,740
We will immediately publish levies

35
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,109
of the same scale and same strength.”

36
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,509
And so China announced its own tariffs

37
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,740
on $50 billion dollars worth of American imports.

38
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,929
And then Trump responded with an additional

39
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:43,429
10% tariff on another $200 billion dollars
worth of Chinese imports.

40
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,429
“We’ve taken decisive action to address

41
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:46,889
our trade imbalance with China.

42
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:50,459
We’ve put tariffs on 250 billion dollars
in Chinese goods

43
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,750
and we could more than double that number.

44
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,750
But we hope for better.

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,649
The United States, though,

46
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,189
will not change course,

47
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,559
until China changes its ways.”

48
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,819
China did not change its ways.

49
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,779
It responded with an additional 60 billion
dollars in tariffs.

50
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:11,390
But the US buys more stuff from China than
vice versa:

51
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,010
So the US can hit China harder.

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,560
And the plan was, starting January 1, 2019...

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,090
the 10% tariffs on 200 billion dollars worth
of Chinese goods

54
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,080
would shoot up to 25%.

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,700
But on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in
December,

56
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,379
Trump agreed to delay those tariffs for 90
days.

57
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,690
That aims to allow both sides to reach an
agreement

58
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,870
on “structural changes with respect to

59
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,750
forced technology transfer,

60
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,670
intellectual property protection,

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,819
non-tariff barriers,

62
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,540
cyber intrusions and cyber theft.”

63
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,019
So, something to look forward to in the New
Year.

64
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,569
Maybe.

65
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,730
Number 9

66
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,430
Cold War 2

67
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,290
For years, the US policy toward China was
one of engagement.

68
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,189
If we keep engaging with the Chinese Communist
Party,

69
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:01,120
eventually they’ll reform and become a democracy!

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Yeah, didn’t work.

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,239
So 2018 saw a major shift in US policy toward
China.

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,730
In July, just as the trade war was about to
kick off,

73
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,120
FBI Director Christopher Wray called China

74
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,749
the biggest threat to the US.

75
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:21,170
“I think China from a counterintelligence
perspective,

76
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,569
in many ways represents the broadest,

77
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:25,569
most challenging,

78
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,239
most significant threat we face as a country...

79
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,959
We have economic espionage investigations
in every state,

80
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,340
all fifty states, that trace back to China.”

81
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,920
Shortly after, the CIA said the US is in another
cold war,

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,790
this time with China.

83
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,040
“By their own terms, and what Xi Jinping
himself enunciates,

84
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,849
I would argue that...what they’re waging
against us

85
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,549
is fundamentally a cold war.

86
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,409
A cold war not like we saw during THE Cold
War.

87
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,560
But a cold war by definition.

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,950
A country that exploits all avenues of power
licit and illicit,

89
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,950
public and private, economic and military,

90
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,060
to undermine the standing of your rival relative

91
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,859
to your own standing without resorting to
conflict.”

92
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,949
Unlike the Cold War between the US and the
Soviet Union—

93
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,060
you know, the one that almost ended the world
in nuclear fire—

94
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,360
turns out, this new Cold War is even more
difficult.

95
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,310
“The United States and the Soviet Union

96
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,830
had minimal interaction in the economic and
academic spheres,

97
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,930
as the two sides maintained strict barriers

98
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,190
to mutual trade and academic exchanges.

99
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,360
Today, by contrast, the United States and
China

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,370
are deeply intertwined in economic, trade,
academic,

101
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,259
and other realms, posing unique challenges

102
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,990
for the United States across a range of areas.”

103
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,229
Let’s just hope Cold War 2 doesn’t lead
to World War 3

104
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,389
Number 8

105
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:58,389
Secret Agent Man

106
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,550
Meng Hongwei is the president of Interpol,

107
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,740
the world’s largest police organization.

108
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,300
Sorry, he *was.*

109
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,319
Sometime in September,

110
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,280
he disappeared in China.

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,230
You see, Meng Hongwei also was the deputy
minister

112
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,400
of China’s Ministry of Public Security.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,500
I mean, until China’s Ministry of Public
Security arrested him.

114
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,870
Then they said the investigation against him
was very timely,

115
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,430
absolutely correct and rather wise.”

116
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,440
Meng was also linked to disgraced former security
czar Zhou Yongkang.

117
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,140
I’ve talked about Zhou Yongkang before.

118
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,629
He’s the one who looks like a fleshy Thwomp

119
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,509
from Super Mario Brothers.

120
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,820
Chinese leader Xi Jinping purged Zhou Yongkang

121
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,050
because he’s tied to former Chinese leader
Jiang Zemin.

122
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,379
And Zhou Yongkang was one of his top guys

123
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,539
in charge of China’s police.

124
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,740
So Meng was tied to that.

125
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,810
Ok, I know it sounds complicated.

126
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,830
So let me sum it up:

127
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,449
Everyone is corrupt.

128
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,360
The thing is, Meng Hongwei was one of

129
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,699
the few Chinese nationals who held important
positions

130
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,190
in international organizations.

131
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,699
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
at the time

132
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,420
it was a sign that China was ready to

133
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,319
“take on bigger responsibility and make
greater contribution

134
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,970
to push for global law enforcement.”

135
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,699
But...that did not work out.

136
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:19,930
Number 7

137
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,540
Another fateful arrest, eh…

138
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,240
In December, on behalf US authorities,

139
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,099
Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou.

140
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,440
She’s the CFO of Huawei,

141
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,620
one of China’s biggest telecom companies.

142
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,080
She’s not related to the Interpol guy,

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
Meng Hongwei.

144
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Just another Meng.

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,729
Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou faces extradition
to the US

146
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,440
for allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran.

147
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,000
Obviously, Chinese state-run media said her
arrest

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,470
was a huge violation of human rights.

149
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,879
Of course, their immediate arrest of a Canadian
citizen

150
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,979
right after that happened was totally cool.

151
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,580
The US State Department is considering

152
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,800
issuing a travel warning to US citizens going
to China.

153
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,419
But either way, this is a huge challenge to
the Chinese regime—

154
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,139
one that wouldn’t have been thinkable even
a year ago.

155
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:10,189
Number 6

156
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:13,139
Google changes its view on evil

157
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,360
Back in May, Google removed its famous

158
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,819
“don’t be evil” motto from its code
of conduct.

159
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,030
Well timed!

160
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,110
Because a few months later,

161
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,009
a Google employee leaked documents that the
company

162
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,970
was secretly building a censored search engine
mobile app for China.

163
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,820
The secret project is called Dragonfly.

164
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,659
China has a pretty big internet market:

165
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,889
750 million Internet users.

166
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,020
That’s bigger than the entire population
of Europe.

167
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,830
Basically, there’s a ton of money Google
could be making in China.

168
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,259
And now that Google isn’t concerned about
not being evil,

169
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,830
they can finally tap into it.

170
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,659
Top people at Google have been scrambling
to deny it,

171
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,219
without ruling out the possibility that they
might try

172
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,069
to get back into China in the future.

173
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,960
You know, to help spread information.

174
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,240
But Google has faced a lot of criticism.

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,789
Amnesty International protested.

176
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,729
And 500 Google employees signed a letter

177
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,759
calling for Google to drop Dragonfly.

178
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,000
And just recently, the CEO had to testify

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,009
before the House Judiciary Committee.

180
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,250
And in a turn of events that is totally not
suspicious,

181
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,729
Google’s office in Beijing caught fire.

182
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,750
It happens.

183
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,280
Number 5

184
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Presitator for Life

185
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,069
Did you know Xi Jinping is one of the

186
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,160
most popular leaders of China ever?

187
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,260
Yeah.

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,580
When he was “elected”

189
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,980
by China’s National People’s Congress
in 2013,

190
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,640
it was almost unanimous.

191
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,480
I say “almost,” because one person voted
against him.

192
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,330
I’m sure that one guy won’t make the same
mistake again.

193
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,810
But at the beginning of 2018,

194
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,020
the National People’s Congress decided Xi
Jinping is so great,

195
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,350
he should stick around a little longer.

196
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
Like forever.

197
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,890
“The Communist Party this weekend announcing

198
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,810
a proposal to scrap the two-term limit for
presidents,

199
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,810
meaning Xi Jinping could stay on indefinitely.”

200
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,450
“Changes to the constitution in the last
year

201
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,880
have made Xi the most powerful Chinese leader

202
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,270
since Mao Zedong—the founder of the People’s
Republic—

203
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,290
who died in office, having never retired.”

204
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,430
That was a move I predicted back in 2016.

205
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,870
That Xi would become, not quite a dictator,

206
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,130
not quite a president, but more of a presitator.

207
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,010
And now, he’s presitator for life.

208
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,950
And while they took presidential term limits

209
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,970
out of the government’s constitution,

210
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,120
they also added something:

211
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,190
Xi Jinping Thought for New Era.

212
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,320
It’s a special brand of thought that’s
All Xi,

213
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
All the Time.

214
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Number 4

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,790
Bumps in the Belt and Road

216
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,620
Malaysia had been a cornerstone of the Belt
and Road Initiative.

217
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,350
That’s China’s trillion dollar investment
scheme

218
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,680
that has trapped many countries in debt.

219
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,690
And even though a lot of this investment is

220
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,870
from so-called private Chinese companies—

221
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,750
it’s all connected to the Chinese Communist
Party,

222
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,080
including being financed by state-run banks.

223
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,480
But on the bright side,

224
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,990
Chinese state-run media make some pretty catchy
songs about it.

225
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,190
“The Belt and Road is how, oh oh oh oh”

226
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,850
But this year, Malaysia hit the brakes on
the Belt and Road.

227
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,640
And that’s thanks to the surprise election

228
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,560
of the 92 year old prime minister Mahathir
Mohamad.

229
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,910
One of the reasons he got elected

230
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,530
was his criticism of Chinese investment.

231
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,950
“None of our people are employed as workers.

232
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,550
None of our companies are used for designing

233
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,640
and planning and supervising, et cetera.

234
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,270
We gain nothing.”

235
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,990
He’s now canceled several major Chinese
investment projects.

236
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,280
And following this example,

237
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,010
other countries are starting to rethink Chinese
investment, too.

238
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,310
That seems to be a theme for the year.

239
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,350
Number 3

240
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,860
A love triangle

241
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,630
In 2017, President Trump spent

242
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,070
a lot time wooing Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

243
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,020
“A relationship with you and China is a
very important one to me.”

244
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,820
“The United States,

245
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,480
the feelings we have for China is a very warm
feeling,

246
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,680
and I really believe it’s only going to
get warmer.”

247
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
But in 2018,

248
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,420
Trump meet with another of Asia’s fearless
leaders.

249
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,750
“It was the handshake seen around the world….

250
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,620
Tuesday’s meeting is the very first

251
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,020
between a North Korean leader and a sitting
U.S. president.”

252
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,860
“Get a good picture so we look nice and
handsome and thin.”

253
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,260
A photo that makes this guy look handsome
and thin?

254
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,680
They’re photographers, not miracle workers.

255
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,780
But Trump really laid it on thick.

256
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,460
“Two men, two leaders, one destiny.”

257
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,660
Believe it or not, that’s a promo video
made by the White House.

258
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,540
But besides TV ratings,

259
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,560
there may be another good reason Trump

260
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,100
put so much effort into his meeting with Kim.

261
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,600
It helps him create a direct relationship
with North Korea,

262
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,110
without China in the middle.

263
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,930
China and North Korea have always been close.

264
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,180
From Deng Xiaoping

265
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,350
To Jiang Zemin

266
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,180
To the guy we all forgot about

267
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,740
To a reluctant Xi Jinping.

268
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,930
China always saw North Korea as strategically
valuable.

269
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,700
If the western world wanted to talk to China’s

270
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,630
nuclear crazed neighbor to the North,

271
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,020
China got to be the middleman.

272
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,670
And that gave China a lot of political leverage.

273
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,600
Want to talk to North Korea?

274
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,850
Best play nice with China.

275
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,940
But this handshake changed all that.

276
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,110
So it’s probably no wonder that after

277
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,430
Trump had the meeting with Kim Jong-Un,

278
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,600
Trump was ready to launch the trade war with
China.

279
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,970
A little less to worry about.

280
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,200
Number 2

281
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,060
Deal with the Devil

282
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,920
The officially atheist Chinese Communist Party

283
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,790
has long been fighting the Vatican

284
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,710
over who has the right to appoint Catholic
Bishops in China.

285
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,480
Yeah, really.

286
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,910
The Party has even in some places demanded

287
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,550
Christians take down pictures of Jesus

288
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,770
and replace them with pictures of Xi Jinping.

289
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,730
So it was a bit of a surprise to everyone
that all year long,

290
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,760
the Pope was trying to strike a deal with

291
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,740
the Chinese Communist Party.

292
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,820
And he eventually succeeded.

293
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,460
That was despite desperate pleas

294
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,720
from Hong Kong Cardinals who were like,

295
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,840
you know, this is probably a bad idea.

296
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,980
The Pope agreed to recognize seven bishops
appointed by Beijing.

297
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,260
Granted, two of them had mistresses

298
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,650
and one had been excommunicated.

299
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,830
But I guess Pope Francis decided to take what
he could get.

300
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,960
The problem is—

301
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,860
and I know this will shock you—

302
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,860
the Chinese Communist Party has already reneged
on its deal.

303
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,471
And they disappeared a Catholic Bishop

304
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,850
that the Pope had appointed earlier.

305
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,120
And finally, it’s time for the biggest China
news story of 2018.

306
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,350
Number 1

307
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,350
Uighurs

308
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,250
The biggest story of the year—

309
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,640
in terms of its impact on actual people—

310
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,410
has come from Xinjiang in western China.

311
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,620
As state-run media put it, the government
has set up

312
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,630
vocational training schools to create employment

313
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,720
and promote stability for all the Uighur people
living there.

314
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,430
And nothing proves they're vocational training
schools—

315
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,310
and definitely not prisons—

316
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,060
like the tools of the trade.

317
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,980
Purchase requisitions for one of those vocational
schools

318
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,190
shows that they purchased police batons,

319
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,730
electric cattle prods, handcuffs, and pepper
spray.

320
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,730
Important training tools.

321
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,120
Currently, there may be over a million Uighurs

322
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,510
in what might be more accurately described
as internment camps.

323
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,240
Which is perfect in a way.

324
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,160
Because it leaves plenty of room for the million
non-Uighurs

325
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,950
the Chinese regime sent over,

326
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,250
to stay in the homes of their families,

327
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,940
and spy on them.

328
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,890
China has built an advanced surveillance state
inside Xinjiang.

329
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,720
So really it’s not that different from anywhere
else in China.

330
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,130
Except for all the ethnic genocide.

331
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:06,870
So those are the top 10 Chinese news stories
of 2018.

332
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,030
Which was your favorite?

333
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,190
And hey, since it’s the start of the new
year,

334
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,850
why not let me know in the comment section
below

335
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,180
about how you first found China Uncensored.

336
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
Thanks for watching.

337
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,600
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

338
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,300
See you in 2019!
