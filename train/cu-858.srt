1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,719
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:06,399
China has agreed to stop selling oil to North
Korea.

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,060
So why does it seem like China

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,600
is still selling oil to North Korea?

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,160
I’m Matt Gnaizda.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,230
Chris is still on vacation

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,590
somewhere much warmer than New York.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,520
But unfortunately, I’m not.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,760
On today’s episode,

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,359
is the Chinese Communist Party violating UN
sanctions

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,840
by sending oil to North Korea?

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,610
This story was sparked by—yes,

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,590
another 140-character announcement

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,040
from the Leader of the Free World.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,220
President Trump wrote:

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,060
“Caught RED HANDED—

18
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,400
very disappointed that China

19
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,750
is allowing oil to go into North Korea.”

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,670
And the thing about Trump Tweets is that,

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,540
after he types just a few sentence fragments

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,680
with his thumbs,

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,840
the entire world feels compelled to respond.

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,700
Including us at China Uncensored, apparently.

25
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,680
So first, Trump uses Twitter

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,410
to accuse the Chinese regime

27
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,920
of allowing oil transfers to North Korea

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,660
despite UN sanctions that they agreed to.

29
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,040
Then, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,720
admitted everything.

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Just kidding.

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
She denied it.

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,040
I assume she was just taking advice from Shaggy.

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,870
It wasn’t me!

35
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,040
Specifically, the spokesperson said China

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,690
never allows Chinese citizens and companies

37
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,020
to engage in activities that violate

38
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,810
UN Security Council resolutions.

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,180
Except, for, um,

40
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,820
how South Korea seized that ship,

41
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,150
with a Chinese crew,

42
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,620
on its way to deliver oil to North Korea.

43
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,230
And then seized a second ship

44
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,530
suspected of providing oil to North Korea.

45
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,750
So yeah, except for those two times—

46
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,950
plus maybe a few other times authorities

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,229
hopefully don’t ever find out about—

48
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,350
Chinese citizens and companies

49
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,670
would never engage in activities

50
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,060
that violate UN Security Council resolutions.

51
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,060
By the way,

52
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,280
the first ship was actually caught in late
November.

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,620
South Korea said it had seized

54
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,080
the Lighthouse Winmore,

55
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,799
which had a Hong Kong flag.

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,040
It was suspected of transferring 4,000 barrels
of oil

57
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,900
to a North Korean ship.

58
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,740
The second oil ship, the KOTI,

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,440
was seized on December 19

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,790
at a South Korean port about 50 miles

61
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,140
south of the North Korean border.

62
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,640
It had a Panamanian flag,

63
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,890
but the crew was mostly from China...

64
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,110
and also Myanmar, weirdly.

65
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,110
South Korean media says

66
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,590
intelligence and customs agents are still
investigating.

67
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,620
But, c’mon, what difference

68
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,140
does a few thousand barrels of oil make?

69
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,100
Apparently, a lot.

70
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Over the past year,

71
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,400
the US has been pressuring China hard,

72
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,010
to get them to stop all trade with North Korea.

73
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,220
It’s a different tactic than the Obama administration
used.

74
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,171
The had tried to convince North Korea

75
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,170
to give up its nuclear weapons program

76
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,910
through Six-Party Talks,

77
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,209
and by issuing stern warnings.

78
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,600
“I’m uhhh very disappointed in uhhh your
behavior.

79
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,020
I want you to stop, or I’m uhhh

80
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,040
going to ask you again.

81
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,440
Nicely.”

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,959
But for some reason that didn’t work.

83
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,250
So the new administration is trying out a
tactic

84
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,470
from the guy who comes to the presidency

85
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,180
with a different kind of life experience:

86
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,380
“I’m rich.”

87
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,460
“I’m really rich.”

88
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,170
“The beauty of me is that I’m really rich.”

89
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,390
So the rich man’s solution

90
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,959
is to go after their money.

91
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,930
Squeeze the money until North Korea is in
so much pain

92
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,320
it cries uncle.

93
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,220
Oh wait, Kim Jong-un already killed his uncle.

94
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,319
Anyway, North Korean leader

95
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,020
and extreme hair clipper enthusiast, Kim Jong-un,

96
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,129
has been threatening the US with his nukes.

97
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,129
Kind of.

98
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,849
By saying “the entire United States

99
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,800
is within range of our nuclear weapons.”

100
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,709
Which is such a thinly veiled threat

101
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:42,130
that it’s pretty much see-through.

102
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,660
It’s like saying,

103
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,629
“You know, I’m standing close enough to
your face

104
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,790
that it’s within throwing distance of my
fist.

105
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,200
I’m not threatening you.

106
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,770
I’m just stating the fact

107
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,269
that you are within range.”

108
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,379
So at the US’s urging,

109
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:58,209
China has, in theory,

110
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,520
stopped oil exports to North Korea.

111
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
This is something that is

112
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,620
“painful and potentially destabilizing

113
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,840
to the regime of Kim Jong-un.”

114
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,510
Well, apparently, it’s working.

115
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,450
Despite the occasional accidental shipment

116
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,120
of 4,000 barrels of oil.

117
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,830
Because, again, according to prolific Tweeter

118
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,339
and also president Donald Trump,

119
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,169
“Sanctions and ‘other’ pressures

120
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:22,860
are beginning to have a big impact on North
Korea...

121
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,839
Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea

122
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,620
for first time.

123
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,100
Perhaps that is good news,

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
perhaps not—

125
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
we will see,

126
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,499
exclamation point.”

127
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:33,820
We will see, actually—

128
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,810
maybe even this coming Tuesday.

129
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,379
Because South Korea has proposed

130
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,740
high-level talks with North Korea.

131
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,999
Technically, the talks are supposed to be

132
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,000
mostly about North Korea’s participation

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,249
in the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.

134
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:50,029
But also, they might maybe hopefully talk
about

135
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,940
that other little thing.

136
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,479
Well, yeah, but specifically, that little
thing.

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,289
Fortunately, we know that talks with North
Korea

138
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,130
always work.

139
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,409
At least they might work now,

140
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:03,860
as long as Chinese authorities

141
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,300
actually cut off North Korea’s oil supply,

142
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,330
instead of just saying they’re definitely
not not doing it.

143
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,529
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

144
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,529
What?

145
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,860
Russia is supplying North Korea with oil?!

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,180
What do you think?

147
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,059
Will this new US strategy be at least

148
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:24,110
marginally more effective than the old one?

149
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,759
Leave your comments below.

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,820
Once again, I’m Matt Gnaizda.

151
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,840
Time for a loud beep.

152
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,620
Now I know why Chris needs a vacation.

153
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:34,749
Unfortunately for him,

154
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,400
he’ll be back at the end of next week.

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,430
In the meantime,

156
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,240
check out our website,

157
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,419
