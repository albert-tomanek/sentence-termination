1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:02,629
Traverse-le-alley, good grief.

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:07,910
Will, you have slotted into Matt's seat
just perfectly.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,840
When I ate him I stole his powers.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,080
That's how it works.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,580
You actually had a buzz cut, didn't you, before
you went in…

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,580
Yes.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,820
The man was clean shaven and five foot one.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,670
It's the kind of 'American Werewolf in London'
transformation.

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,040
"Augh!"

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,789
"I'm making puns!"

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,320
But a horrible werewolf, because you have
to eat the werewolf.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,640
Oh yes, that's…

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Oh yes.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,050
That's a horrible reverse werewolf.

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,740
Note to self: fairy story for later.

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,469
That's a wolf that under the full moon turns
into a really confused human.

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,239
"Huh?"

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,890
Scooby Doo!

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,360
Scientific basis for Scooby Doo.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,020
"Raggy?"

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,700
In the day, he is a mild-mannered
banker called David.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,420
And then when the full moon shines he…

23
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,329
I'm getting Heart of a Dog now, Bulgakov.

24
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,940
Have you not seen that?

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,900
Or read that?

26
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,550
Mikhail Bulgakov short story about a doctor
who transplants

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,040
the heart and testicles of a man onto a dog
and the dog slowly humanises.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,510
Oh, that's cool.

29
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,910
It's dark.

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,320
It's grim.

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,130
Scientists, please check, would that work?

32
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,860
Do we have any scientists in the audience?

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,070
We're not specialists…

34
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,690
No, it wouldn't work.

35
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,690
No.

36
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,220
We've been told that wouldn't work.
