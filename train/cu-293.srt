1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,380
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,140
wouldn't China make a better friend?

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,519
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,000
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,390
Well, the US and the Philippines are just
wrapping up

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,800
joint military drills.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,880
And it’s a bit bittersweet.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,770
Like the last days of high school.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,449
You and your girlfriend tell each other

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,400
you’ll totally stay in touch.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
That nothing can keep you apart.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,270
But deep down,

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,059
you both know it’s over.

14
00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:36,059
Because let’s face it,

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,200
the US and the Philippines are drifting apart.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Times have changed.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,010
And you’ve coupled together for the last
time.

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,469
I think the Philippine Defence Minister said
it best.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,480
Maybe we should re-assess (the relationship).

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,649
Are we benefiting,

21
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,200
are we getting what we should be getting

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,219
from the alliance or the Americans as well?

23
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:03,219
Is it time for us to look at other source
of our materials?

24
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,610
It is part of this growing up.

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,580
It’s part of growing up.

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,710
Sure, some harsh words have been said.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,110
And there’s been regret.

28
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,080
He regrets that his remarks to the press

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,970
have caused much controversy.

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,729
But also, forgiveness.

31
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,330
I don't take these comments personally...

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:29,620
so I’ll think it seems to be just a habit,

33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,299
a way of speaking for him.

34
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,570
And then some more harsh words.

35
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,909
Mister Obama,

36
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,349
you can go to hell.

37
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,720
Because the Philippines is seeing someone
else,

38
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,450
and it seems the relationship with the US...

39
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,450
is over.

40
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,840
I will break up with America.

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,860
I would rather go to Russia and to China.

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,680
Grr, China!!!

43
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,120
Yes, under their new president Rodrigo Duterte,

44
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,640
the Philippines is cozying up to China.

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,049
Because China is sooo much more supportive.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,840
Well, whatever.

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,660
The US is totally fine with it.

48
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
I mean,

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
if you love something,

50
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,590
let it go, right?

51
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,260
But this period of experimentation and self-realization

52
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,880
may not turn out too well for the Philippines.

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,770
Because if you hook up with China,

54
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,770
well,

55
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,870
Xi ain’t gonna treat you right!

56
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,320
So why is President Duterte leading the Philippines
towards this risky—

57
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,350
if exciting—new relationship with China?

58
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,250
It’s related to two major issues in the
Philippines right now.

59
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,170
One is the territorial dispute in the South
China Sea.

60
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,310
This is the Scarborough Shoal.

61
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,110
The Philippines and China both claim it.

62
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,940
And they have nearly come to blows over it.

63
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,151
The Chinese coast guard has at times blocked
Filipino fishermen

64
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:47,670
from the region.

65
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,730
Even fired their water cannons on them.

66
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,900
Then China alleged Filipino fishermen

67
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,950
threw firebombs at their ships.

68
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,820
The Philippines did recently win a major victory,
though.

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
In July,

70
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,750
a UN Tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines,

71
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,340
saying China has no right to a large part
of their claim

72
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,120
in the South China Sea, including the contested
Scarborough Shoal.

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,870
And US President Barack Obama

74
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,960
had the Philippines’ back.

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Before the ruling,

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Obama had warned the Chinese leader of serious
consequences

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,340
if China reclaimed land at Scarborough Shoal.

78
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,430
But after Duterte became president...

79
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,360
Mister Obama, you can go to hell.

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,070
And ahead of Duterte’s upcoming trip to
China,

81
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,140
he said he’s not even going to bring up
the Scarborough Shoal.

82
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,380
Why?

83
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,210
Because the Philippines, “can’t win.”

84
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,380
Why the 180?

85
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
Well,

86
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,640
it has to do with the second big issue

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,680
in the Philippines right now:

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,230
Duterte’s war on drugs.

89
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,490
In an attempt to rapidly solve the Philippines’
drug problems,

90
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,910
he’s gone after both drug dealers and users.

91
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,530
More than thirty-three hundred people have
been killed

92
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,160
in just a few months.

93
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,510
Of course, some drug users are being rehabilitated.

94
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,510
For example,

95
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,590
by organizations having them build…

96
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,890
coffins!

97
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,360
If they did not change their former way of
living,

98
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,230
they might be the one using the caskets,

99
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,750
but it's just a joke.

100
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,580
Ha HA!

101
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,560
What a joke!

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Obama isn’t laughing, though.

103
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,560
The US has been one of many governments

104
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,350
expressing serious concern over the extrajudicial
killings

105
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,130
of not just drug dealers,

106
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,150
but also drug users.

107
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,660
And Duterte has not taken the criticism

108
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,440
of his anti-drug campaign well.

109
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,120
I would like to just give an advice

110
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,220
to all the human rights (groups)

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,170
who are shouting now,

112
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,640
local or international.

113
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,380
I said you can all go to hell.

114
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,040
So yeah, he doesn't like criticism.

115
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,550
Look,

116
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,960
the Philippines does have a very serious drug
problem.

117
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,680
The previous president wasn’t able to do
anything about it.

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,050
That could be one of the reason why Duterte
is so popular

119
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,490
inside the Philippines.

120
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,260
And I get why distancing yourself from the
United States

121
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,660
has appeal.

122
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,160
For years,

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,260
the Philippines was basically a US colony.

124
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,030
My favorite Filipino dish,

125
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,400
sizzling sisig,

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,930
basically exists because the only meat people
could afford

127
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,110
were discarded pig heads

128
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,350
sold by US troops.

129
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,000
Pig heads it turns out,

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
are delicious.

131
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,380
But China is a bad alternative.

132
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,260
China and Russia are also carrying out

133
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,620
joint military drills in the South China Sea.

134
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,120
And while China might agree to let Filipino
Fishermen in...

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,961
...doesn’t that sound more like they’re
granting Filipino fishermen

136
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,160
access to Chinese territory?

137
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,870
And as for war on drugs,

138
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,890
well, President Duterte,

139
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,890
you said it yourself.

140
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,140
But most of the materials,

141
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,300
all of the machines and the boilers are from China,

142
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,400
what does that mean?

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,340
It means Xi ain’t gonna treat you right.

144
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,250
So what do you think of the President Duterte

145
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,410
“breaking up” with United States for China?

146
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,850
Leave your comments below.

147
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,100
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

148
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,490
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

149
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,250
see you next time.
