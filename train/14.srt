1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,560
A friend of mine's brother was Mr Wimpy.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,780
Wait, what?

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,380
In the Huddersfield branch of Wimpy, he was
Mr Wimpy.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,720
Is that like a mascot costume?

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,350
Yes, it's like a beefeater, but his eyes are
obscured by the hat.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,200
But you look through the mouth,
just mark you.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,470
But what happened was,
he wasn't allowed to talk at all,

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,470
that was one of the strict rules.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,910
Mr Wimpy must never talk to anyone,

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,900
because obviously you don't want this weedy
15-year-old accent coming through.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,900
"Hi, 'appy birthday!"

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,910
That kind of thing.

13
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,119
But what happened was he tripped up on the
way down the stairs to a kids' party,

14
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,160
rolled down and the kid just hoofed him in
the head for five solid minutes.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,100
You try not screaming
while dressed as Mr Wimpy.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,010
Apparently quite difficult.

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,640
I was going to go off on one about, like,
costume characters and how that-

18
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,170
I can't beat a kid
hoofing Mr Wimpy in the face.

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,170
I really can't.

20
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,460
While the guy screams silently within.

21
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,109
Now there's a metaphor in there,
I'm pretty sure.

22
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,660
Doesn't a friend of ours still have a £20
Wimpy voucher that he won?

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,800
Whoa, really?

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,600
He started…

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,220
Sorry - 2,000 pence.

26
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,620
Yes, I think he did some "banter" with them
on Twitter

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,220
and they decided to send him a voucher

28
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,220
and he hasn't got around to spending it,

29
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,650
because there aren't that many Wimpys…

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,650
There aren't.

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,650
Particularly not near him.

32
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,640
And he did once go up to the place,

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,670
look at it and just go,

34
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,670
"I can't."
