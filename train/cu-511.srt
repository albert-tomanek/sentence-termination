1
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,610
Here you go.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,610
Where's Matt?

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,610
Oh he's coming, with the bags.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
What's wrong?

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,140
Nothing.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,040
I don't really like Christmas.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,540
What?!

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,100
I love Christmas.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,820
Don't you like the presents, the lights, the music…

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,220
It's too commercialized.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,860
It's all run by brands and corporations

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,640
who only care about making money.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,480
And Christmas means presents.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,500
And presents mean shopping.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,510
I hate shopping.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,680
Don't you at least like the decorations?

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,740
No, they're too polished nowadays.

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,390
Everything has to be perfect.

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,149
What happened to fun, wacky Christmas decorations?

20
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,049
Oh, don't know, but I'm going to go see what Matt is doing.

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,560
I'll be right back.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,019
I wish I still believed in Christmas.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,900
Aggggh!

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,120
Who are you?!

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,110
I'm here to grant your wish!

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,000
My wish?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,590
You wished to believe in Christmas again.

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,110
So I'm here to show you the true meaning of Christmas!

29
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,350
Are you an angel?

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,830
No.

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,479
The ghost of Christmas Past?

32
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,960
Uh, she's kind of busy right now.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,470
Then who--WHOA!

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,470
Where are we?

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,170
We're at the Mall of Asia, one of the biggest
malls in Asia!

36
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,810
The Mall of Asia?

37
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,810
In the Philippines?

38
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,810
I know Christmas is a big deal here,

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,920
but shouldn't we be at a church or something?

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,580
Well, that’s not really my thing…

41
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,500
Wait, who are you.

42
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,420
I’m the fairy of Christmas...Consumerism.

43
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,200
Christmas Consumerism?

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,480
Look, a fairy’s got to survive, ok?

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,780
If people stop believing in you, that’s
it!

46
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,260
Wow, I had no idea.

47
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,200
I can still show you the true meaning of Christmas.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
Okay...lead the way!

49
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,100
Do you like Christmas carols?

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,760
I mean, yeah, sure, I guess.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Why?

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,180
Well because the Philippines has the longest Christmas
season in the world.

53
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,540
Four months of Christmas carols!

54
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,800
Wow, they really grab you by the jingle bells
here.

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,819
So are you in the Christmas spirit now?

56
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,640
Does it look like I am?

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,480
Ok...I've got another idea.

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,710
Wait, what?

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
What happened! Where am I?!

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,180
Christmasland in New Taipei City!

61
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,120
Argghh, what did you spray me with?

62
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,100
Uhh, the Christmas Spirit.

63
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,340
Ugh, my head really hurts!

64
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,819
Is my nose bleeding?!

65
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,519
No, no, that's just the joy of Christmas.

66
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,700
Ahh, what’s happening?!

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,460
So Christmas was brought to Earth by space
bears?

68
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,200
I don’t remember that part of the Bible.

69
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,720
Well, that kind of looks like a church.

70
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,640
Look traditions change.

71
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,550
The important thing is how Christmas brings
people together.

72
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,950
Let's take a look!

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Couldn't you have brought me here when it's
not raining?

74
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Look, I'm not the weather fairy.

75
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,540
Hey, you know, I've noticed a lot of people
on dates.

76
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,420
Oh yeah, that's because Christmas in Taiwan
is all about romance.

77
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,409
That's a weird way to celebrate the landing
of the space bears.

78
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,200
Well, the family togetherness holiday here
is Chinese New Year.

79
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,169
So Christmas is more like Valentine's Day.

80
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,960
Oh, what if you don't have a Valentine?

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,680
Er, Christmastine?

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
Then you go out with your friends.

83
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,880
Well, that's kind of nice, actually.

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,039
Sure beats Valentine's.

85
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,359
But seriously, can we get out of the rain?

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,220
OK!

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,780
Wait!

88
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,990
No!

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,300
I’m going to be sick!

90
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,220
Oh no! Do you get seasick?!

91
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,040
No, it’s that stuff you keep hitting me with.

92
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,640
Uh, welcome to Hong Kong!

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
No!

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I am serious.

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,849
I am concerned about the long term health
consequences of this.

96
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,190
You'll be fine.

97
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,260
Probably.

98
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,550
Anyway, just look around!

99
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,100
Is that a laser?

100
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,760
It's a symphony of lights!

101
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,270
Huge corporations like HSBC, Bank of China,
Bank of America,

102
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,650
all wishing you a Merry Christmas.

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,459
Wow, large multinational corporations care
about me?

104
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:40,700
Of course!

105
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,599
Without you, who would buy their products?

106
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:44,960
Huh, I never thought about it like that before...

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,100
Come on, there’s one more thing I want to
show you.

108
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,680
Is it just me, or are these snowmen a little
menacing?

109
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,960
No they're totally fine.

110
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,200
The paranoia will wear off in a couple of
hours.

111
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,209
I knew it!

112
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,240
I knew there were side effects!

113
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I didn't say that.

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
Uh, let's go.

115
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,110
So if Christmas in Taiwan is brought by the
space bears,

116
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,770
Christmas in Hong Kong is about asking for
the blessings of our snowmen overlords?

117
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,410
Not exactly.

118
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,190
Ok so the decorations are kind of weird.

119
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,900
But isn't it wonderful seeing all of these
friends and families taking pictures together?

120
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,560
Yeah, it is kind of nice.

121
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,620
So have you learned the true meaning of Christmas?

122
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,220
You know?

123
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,840
I think I have.

124
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,200
It’s about American cultural hegemony dominating
the world.

125
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,760
Uugggggh, ok, close enough.

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,060
Nooo!!!

127
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,680
Chris? Chris, wake up!

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,990
Noooooooo!!!

129
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,990
Are you ok?

130
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,690
Do you need to go to the hospital?

131
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,150
It was just a dream.

132
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,850
It was just a dream.

133
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,840
What happened?

134
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,520
I...had the weirdest dream.

135
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
You were there

136
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,380
and you were not there...

137
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,540
You sure you're ok?

138
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,670
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

139
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,170
Are we going shopping?

140
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,490
Let's go shopping.

141
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,600
But you hate shopping.

142
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,020
What's that on your hair?

143
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,920
What are you doing?

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm going to get this analyzed in a lab.

145
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,620
What?

146
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,960
Merry Christmas!

147
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,480
Merry Christmas!

148
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,980
You know, it's true,

149
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,120
wherever you find love, it feels like Christmas.

150
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,900
Wait, have you been watching The Muppet Christmas
Carol again?
