On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,750
is the US any better than China?

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,860
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm your host Chris Chappell

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:23,420
the big news last week was the US Senate's
release of its CIA torture report.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
what's that?

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,110
no no I'm completely fine I've just been

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,830
awake for the last 180 hours

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:38,950
seven-and-a-half days with no sleep, and I'm
totally okay

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,800
now I haven't been able to read the report
for myself

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,140
but I'm sure its not like the CIA has been
hiding

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,390
anything nefarious from the public

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,760
like waterboarding?

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,300
please,more like water bored.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,130
I mean how bad could that be?

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,980
like a "series of near drownings".

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,519
okay. that sounds pretty bad.

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:13,110
But hey the CIA had to do it to get the kind
of Intel that save lives and stop terrorism

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,580
they never got information about imminent
attacks and didn't learn anything they didn't

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,520
already know

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,690
well I remember CIA director Michael Hayden
saying they did get valuable information

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,490
They lied about it

23
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,520
okay but I mean the people they were torturing
were terrorists

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,390
they weren't all terrorists

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,000
barely at least one person was just a

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,170
case of misidentification

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,580
what kind of idiot approved this thing

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,520
so when the US senate released its findings

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,130
from an investigation into CIA investigation
techniques

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,060
they found that the enhanced interrogation
techniques they were using

31
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,869
were actually discredited coercive interrogation
techniques

32
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,060
such as those used by torturous regimes

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,880
during the Cold War to elicit false confessions

34
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,119
it was so bad that even the people doing the
torturing

35
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,340
were disturbed by it

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,730
the CIA did a terrible thing that

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,220
the US needs to face up to and make sure never
happens again

38
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,440
so from Beijing's perspective clearly

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,620
the moral of the story is chinese authorities

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,840
should be allowed to torture as many people
as they want

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,370
not that they tortured, of course they don't

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,270
you might have missed that moral, though

43
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,180
through the huge amount of schadenfreude

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,410
in Chinese state-run media's

45
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,930
in-depth reporting on the CIA torture story

46
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,720
for example Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,670
wrote an editorial condemning the US for doing
nothing

48
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,700
about its own human rights problems

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,900
that's right

50
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,620
why isn't the US talking about its own problems

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,769
except of course when the US Senate investigates
the country's intelligence

52
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:04,310
agency and releases a fully unclassified report
to the public

53
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,319
detailing the terrible atrocities they committed

54
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,220
but look I'm not trying to say the US is better
than China

55
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,480
or that the CIA is somehow justified for what
it did

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,970
i'm saying torture is bad especially when
people

57
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,430
being tortured haven't committed any crimes

58
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,129
but the reason we now know about this is because
people in the US government

59
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,599
spent 6 years investigating what happened

60
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,360
and now things can be done to stop it

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
no one's watching in China

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,720
there's no system of checks and balances

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,190
that's going to suddenly find the National
People's Congress asking the secret police

64
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,620
if they've been torturing political prisoners
again

65
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,480
so there need to be people and governments
outside of China

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,830
keeping an eye on things -

67
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,200
which really, it seems like they happen

68
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,989
since the Chinese regime still does basically
whatever it wants

69
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,489
while US companies keep tripping over each
other

70
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:02,659
to throw money at it

71
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,569
also the CIA torturing people

72
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,920
while completely terrible doesn't mean I or
any other individual

73
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,970
no longer has a right to want to see a better
China

74
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,909
now if you'll excuse me i've a letter to write
to congress

75
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:20,819
try doing that in China
