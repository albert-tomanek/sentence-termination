1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,710
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,340
sure, the Chinese Communist Party is trying
to steal

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,920
American innovation at every turn.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,200
But that doesn’t mean we can’t take their
money, right?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,650
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,650
Made in China.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,430
A symbol of quality workmanship and cutting-edge
technology.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,150
At least, that’s what Chinese leader Xi
Jinping

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,720
wants you to think.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,690
In 2015, Xi Jinping announced a new economic
model

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,300
called Made in China, 2025.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,260
It’s focused on “The task of upgrading

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,449
and accelerating technological development.”

15
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:43,499
On this show, we’ve talked about several
ways the Communist Party has,

16
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:47,620
uh, “accelerated technological development”
in the past.

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,570
Like by hacking and stealing US intellectual
property,

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,920
then reverse engineering it at Chinese Technology
Transfer Centers.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,929
So much faster and easier than starting from
scratch.

20
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,920
China has also weaponized trade,

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
according to Republican Senate Majority Whip
John Cornyn.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,630
“In many instances China has simply used
trade as a weapon,

23
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,810
coercing US companies into entering joint
ventures

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,290
and other business agreements that require
the company

25
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,969
to hand over key technology and know how,

26
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:21,289
the so-called secret sauce.”

27
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,729
And I always thought secret sauce was mayonnaise

28
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,430
plus high fructose corn syrup,

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,420
left out in the sun for three days.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,600
Today, we’ll be talking about a third way
the Chinese Communist Party

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,750
acquires American tech.

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,350
They simply buy the American tech companies!

33
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,109
Part of Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025
plan

34
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:41,930
is encouraging Chinese companies

35
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,409
to invest in foreign tech companies.

36
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,899
In particular—high tech industries like
artificial intelligence,

37
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,659
robotics and space travel.

38
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,400
You know, your basic Isaac Asimov novel.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,369
I guess Xi must be a fan.

40
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,979
The amount of money China has pumped into
US tech

41
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,399
skyrocketed after Made in China 2025 was announced.

42
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:10,990
Deals with Chinese investors jumped from 66
in 2013 to 165 in 2017.

43
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,750
Chinese companies have invested in everything
from Uber, to Airbnb,

44
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,280
to even Grindr!

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,890
I think the Chinese government might be getting

46
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,560
a little more data than they bargained for
with Grindr.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,250
Ok, Grindr jokes aside, in some cases,

48
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,770
Chinese companies are investing in tech companies

49
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,160
that are developing technology critical to
national defense or infrastructure,

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,780
or that possess a lot of data on Americans.

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,910
The Pentagon considers all this investment—not
just Grindr—

52
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,840
a serious risk for the United States.

53
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,930
This report from last year warns that the
Chinese Communist Party

54
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,600
is stealing the Crown Jewels of U.S. Innovation.

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,990
Yes, those are the jewels everyone on Grindr
is suddenly worried about.

56
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,850
China’s venture capital investment is at
an all time high.

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,300
And, according to the Pentagon’s report,

58
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,430
the US government isn’t doing enough to
address the risk.

59
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,940
The threat is so serious that both President
Obama

60
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,130
and President Trump agree on it.

61
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,780
And I thought they didn’t agree on anything.

62
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,510
In December 2016,

63
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,300
Obama stopped a Chinese takeover of the US
subsidiary

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,130
of a German semiconductor manufacturer.

65
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,850
The semiconductors industry makes the microchips

66
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,290
that are the core of any advanced technology

67
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,860
the Chinese Communist Party would like to
get their hands on.

68
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,600
Obama blocking that takeover helped curb

69
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,300
the amount of Chinese money going to into
US tech.

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,600
But Chinese companies potentially buying sensitive
US technology

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,470
was still a problem.

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,560
In September 2017,

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,310
Trump blocked a Chinese purchase of Lattice,

74
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,220
another US semiconductor maker.

75
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,310
And earlier this year,

76
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,280
Trump blocked the sale of yet another US chipmaker

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,960
because of Chinese security issues.

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,490
Obama and Trump weren’t doing this on their
own, though.

79
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,760
Although they blocked these deals using executive
orders,

80
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,850
they did it on the recommendation of

81
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,770
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States,

82
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,230
or CFIUS.

83
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,790
CFIUS is a committee that involves several

84
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,380
top-level US government agencies,

85
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,120
and it’s chaired by the Treasury Secretary.

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,090
It was founded in 1975 to oversee purchases

87
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,460
of critical US industries by foreign countries.

88
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,770
But the CFIUS committee hardly ever met.

89
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,900
Until after 9/11.

90
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,800
Then Congress passed new legislation

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,610
that increased the role of CFIUS.

92
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,330
And according to Politico,

93
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,880
CFIUS did not have the resources to keep pace.

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,380
One official described 80-hour work weeks
with no time off.

95
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,830
CFIUS carries so much weight that just their
recommendation

96
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,390
against a deal is often enough to make it
fall apart,

97
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,210
without even getting the president involved.

98
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,720
At the beginning of this year,

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,310
CFIUS rejected a planned Chinese takeover
of Moneygram

100
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,590
because of national security concerns.

101
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,970
A month later, CFIUS rejected a state-backed
Chinese company’s

102
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,850
acquisition of another US chip maker.

103
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,060
But, an overworked CFIUS can’t catch everything.

104
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,490
Here’s an example.

105
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,680
Last year, a semiconductor maker, ATop Tech,

106
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,290
filed for bankruptcy.

107
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,920
But, it had a market share of 1 billion dollars,

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,120
because of a ground-breaking product:

109
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,570
“an automated designer capable of making
microchips

110
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,010
that could power anything from smartphones

111
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,610
to high-tech weapons systems.”

112
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,290
So a company called Avatar Integrated Systems

113
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,340
swooped in and bought it.

114
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,400
Now no one in the semiconductor industry had
ever heard of them.

115
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,890
Turns out,

116
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,550
it belonged to a big shot in China’s steel
industry,

117
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,530
and it looked like he set up Avatar

118
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,580
for the sole purpose of buying ATop Tech.

119
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
At the time,

120
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,020
others in the semiconductor industry

121
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,889
and even a Pentagon official had warned the
bankruptcy court

122
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,340
that letting Avatar buy ATop Tech was a bad
idea.

123
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,050
But the deal went through anyway,

124
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,540
because the whole thing flew under the radar
of CFIUS.

125
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
Last year,

126
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,410
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned that

127
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,190
“CFIUS is both outdated and overburdened”

128
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,639
...and needed to be updated.

129
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,190
The Trump Administration said,

130
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,590
“modernizing CFIUS would strengthen our
ability

131
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,950
to protect national security and enhance confidence

132
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,639
in our longstanding open investment policy.”

133
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,460
There are two bipartisan bills going through
Congress

134
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,950
that aim to strengthen CFIUS.

135
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,090
They want to do things like expand the types
of transactions

136
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,440
CFIUS would look at,

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,940
including bankruptcy cases like ATop Tech.

138
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,820
But there are some serious challenges to CFIUS

139
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,870
even if one of the bills passes.

140
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,590
See, it’s not as simple as just blocking
a Chinese state-owned enterprise

141
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,280
from purchasing, say, American Secret Sauce
Inc.

142
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,090
What about a Chinese national,

143
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,410
who becomes a New Zealand citizen,

144
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,880
but gets his money from the Communist Party,

145
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,400
and wants to buy an American business?

146
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,710
What about a Mexican company whose stock

147
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,630
is partly owned by a Chinese conglomerate,

148
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,460
and that Mexican company wants to buy an American
business?

149
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,850
What about a local Chinese businessman in
the United States,

150
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,970
who’s a US citizen,

151
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,880
but the Communist Party is funneling money
to him through a relative?

152
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Things start to get very murky,

153
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,380
and you have deal with some unpleasant things

154
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,220
that the Chinese Communist Party would love
to exploit.

155
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,930
Like, the idea that stopping Chinese investment
is motivated by racism.

156
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,220
Then there’s the counter argument by those
who want to

157
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,390
see more Chinese investment.

158
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,000
An IBM policy executive said in a January
Congressional hearing

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,440
that the new bill “could constitute the
most economically harmful imposition

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,120
of unilateral trade restrictions by the United
States in many decades.”

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,380
I mean sure, China is run by an authoritarian
regime

162
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,960
with a national plan to systematically steal
Western technology.

163
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,180
But they’ve got a lot of money,

164
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,430
and we want it!

165
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,419
Why be a negative nancy?!

166
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,199
And it’s that kind of broad-minded policy
vision

167
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,640
that led IBM to sell punch-card technology
to the Nazis,

168
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,550
enabling them to “calculate exactly how
many Jews

169
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,590
should be emptied out of the ghettos each
day”

170
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,540
and onto trains to you-know-where.

171
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,320
A similar argument is made overall in Silicon
Valley—

172
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,669
that Chinese investment money is a good thing
and fuels innovation.

173
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,009
I get it.

174
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,009
It seems like,

175
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:39,009
it’s a free country,

176
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:40,120
why not take the money!

177
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,740
It doesn’t matter who it comes from.

178
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,069
And that fits in just fine with the Chinese
Communist Party’s

179
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,279
plan for Made in China 2025.

180
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,569
So what do you think about Chinese investment
in US tech?

181
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,060
Leave your comments below.

182
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,120
And before you go,

183
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,410
it’s that time when we answer a question

184
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,430
from a supporter of the show,

185
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,800
a member of our China Uncensored 50-Cent Army.

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,470
This question comes from...

187
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,699
Jonathan Swanberg

188
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:08,910
“Hi Chris,”

189
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,129
Hi Jonathan.

190
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,740
“What is the real cost of stolen Intellectual
Property (IP)

191
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,529
from the US to China?”

192
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,839
Great question.

193
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,250
The answer depends on who you ask.

194
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,869
The Intellectual Property Commission says
IP

195
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:27,709
theft costs the US economy $600 billion dollars
a year,

196
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:29,550
largely from China.

197
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,339
But it might be much bigger than that.

198
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,339
Casey Fleming—

199
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,639
whose company BLACKOPS Partners Corporation

200
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,220
consults for Fortune 500 companies—

201
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,070
he says the actual cost is closer to $5 trillion
dollars a year.

202
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,070
And that’s because

203
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,839
(a) You have to factor in the total future
value.

204
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,389
Not just products sold,

205
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,959
but also the loss of future innovation and
American jobs.

206
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:52,959
And (b)

207
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,430
A lot of big companies that get hacked, haha,

208
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,889
don’t report it publicly because it’s
too embarrassing

209
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,929
and could make stock prices drop.

210
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:05,579
It’s quite likely that the Chinese military
has hacked

211
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,790
just about every big American corporation.

212
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,700
It just doesn’t get publicized.

213
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,850
And that’s all for this episode of China
Uncensored.

214
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,290
I’m Chris Chappell.

215
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,860
See you next time.

216
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:19,920
On the one hand,

217
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,179
I’d love to take millions of dollars from

218
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,939
some mysterious company in China.

219
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:25,939
On the other hand,

220
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,850
that might sliiiightly affect the integrity
of China Uncensored.

221
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,319
