Declassified!

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,230
Just before leaving office\h

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,550
Trump releases a secret document

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,200
On countering China in the Indo-Paficic.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,750
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,369

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:32,340
As Donald Trump reluctantly hands the keys
to the White House to Joe Biden today, there’s

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,840
one thing he’s leaving behind.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,650
A giant painting of himself in the Oval Office!

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,390
Just kidding.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,140
I think.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,530
But Trump *is* leaving behind his administration’s
strategy to counter the Chinese Communist

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,730
Party in the Indo-Pacific.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,970
The Indo-Pacific is a term that the US government
started using under the Obama administration

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,780
to refer to the Asia-Pacific region plus areas
connected by the Indian Ocean.\h

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,690
Other countries are also using the term Indo-Pacific,
like Japan, which calls for a free and open

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,090
Indo-Pacific.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,490
And Australia, which has their own Indo-Pacific
strategy.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,580
The Indo-Pacific region is home to one third
of the world’s economy, and nearly two-thirds

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,480
of the world’s population.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,740
For decades, even centuries, the dominant
power in the region has been China.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,380
But the US has been trying to change that.

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,260
And we know that, because just one week before
stepping down, President Trump declassified

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,570
his administration’s strategic framework
for the Indo-Pacific.

27
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,640
The document was written in 2018 mainly by
Matthew Pottinger, a former China journalist

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,400
and Marine Corps officer who later became
Trump’s Deputy National Security Advisor.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,290
But it’s been kept secret—until now.

30
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,640
To sum it up: The Strategic Framework is largely
about countering the Chinese Communist Party’s

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,979
aggressiveness in the Indo-Pacific.

32
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,060
And aggressive, they have been.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,710
From militarizing artificial islands in the
South China Sea...

34
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,069
to sending jets into Taiwan’s airspace...

35
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,829
to trying to take over Indian territory along
the Himalayan border.

36
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:18,420
And on the diplomatic front, the Chinese regime
has successfully cozied up to governments

37
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,000
that used to be more allied with the US—but
felt the US let them down during previous

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
administrations.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,139
Like South Korea, which felt the US didn’t
protect them when China punished them for

40
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:34,870
installing the American THAAD missile defence
system.

41
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,390
And the Philippines, which felt the US let
the Chinese navy take over the Scarborough

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,390
Shoal.

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:47,269
And Thailand, which was angry that the US
backed off after the military coup in 2014.

44
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,689
As the US government backed off, the Chinese
Communist Party filled in the gap.

45
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:57,450
Part of the US strategy to counter the Communist
Party is ideological.

46
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,980
The Trump Administration believes that countries
in the Indo-Paficic region should have national

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,670
sovereignty, freedom of navigation, respect
for individual rights, rule of law, and free

48
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,700
markets.

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,359
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party believes
that countries should bow down.

50
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,830
“You will respect China’s authority!”

51
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,790
That reference is from 1998.

52
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,810
How does that make you feel?

53
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,879
So in many ways, the US Strategic Framework
is about laying out US beliefs.

54
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,999
But it’s also about action.

55
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:35,329
One of the goals in the strategic framework
is to create a “security framework with

56
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,079
India, Japan, Australia and the United States”—known
as the Quad.

57
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,790
And the Trump administration did it.

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,219
Through a series of collaborations, military
agreements, and joint naval exercises, the

59
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:54,529
US has helped strengthen the alliance with
these democracies to resist China’s influence.

60
00:03:54,529 --> 00:04:00,260
Another US goal is to enable Taiwan to develop
its own effective defense strategy, and the

61
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,689
ability to engage China on its own terms.

62
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,180
And the US has largely done that, too.

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,029
At least when it comes to weapons sales.\h

64
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:15,919
In 2020 alone, the US approved a 1.8 billion
dollar sale of rocket launchers and artillery

65
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,310
to Taiwan.

66
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,090
Then another 2.4 billion for coastal defense.

67
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,030
Then another 600 million for aerial drones.

68
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,949
Then another 280 million for communications
systems.

69
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,080
2020 was a great year to be an arms dealer.

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,460
But it was also a great year to be a US diplomat,
because the US has sent a number of top-level

71
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,120
diplomats to Taiwan.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
The message is clear: America won’t let
Taiwan down just because the Chinese Communist

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,479
Party is making threats.

74
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,979
And also, it would look really bad if the
next US administration didn’t continue this

75
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,580
policy, hint hint.

76
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,090
But there’s a lot more to this policy.

77
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,710
Which I’ll tell you about after the break.

78
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,490
Welcome back.

79
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,930
Another key part of the US strategic framework
is to “prevent China’s industrial policies

80
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,699
and unfair trading practices from distorting
global markets and harming U.S. competitiveness.”

81
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,830
One of the ways the US has done that is through
putting tariffs on Chinese imports.

82
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,539
Then more tariffs.

83
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,860
And then even more tariffs.

84
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,930
This policy has reduced the US trade deficit
with China—or at least made it grow less

85
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,930
quickly.

86
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,560
It’s also encouraged US companies to pull
out of China—even before the coronavirus.

87
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,180
Those companies are not necessarily returning
to America.

88
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,810
But at least the shift to other countries
has reduced the Chinese regime’s ability

89
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,759
to use unfair trading practices to distort
global markets and harm US competitiveness.

90
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,860
So, objective partially achieved?

91
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:05,530
A combination of US policy and the coronavirus
has also convinced US allies to pull out of

92
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,530
China.

93
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,060
The Japanese government is forking out half
a billion dollars to get companies to leave

94
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,729
China and return to Japan.

95
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,890
Another key US objective is to “maintain
an intelligence advantage over China” and

96
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,070
protect the US and its allies from Chinese
intelligence activities.

97
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,310
To that end, the US has done a lot.

98
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,950
The Trump administration strengthened the
Treasury Department’s ability to block Chinese

99
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,449
investments that pose a security risk to the
US.

100
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:40,410
The US has also gone after people at universities
who have been working as spies for China.

101
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,409
And last year, the US closed the Chinese consulate
in Houston, because it was being used to steal

102
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,370
trade secrets.

103
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,560
Plus the FBI has protected Chinese people
living in the US by countering the Communist

104
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,139
Party’s “Operation Fox Hunt” that tries
to force people to return to China where they’ll

105
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:00,139
be thrown in prison.

106
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,749
So 2020 was not a good year to be a Chinese
spy.

107
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:11,449
And overseas, the US created a 5G Clean Network
initiative to keep Communist Party espionage

108
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:17,479
operations out of global telecom networks,
and more than 50 countries have joined.

109
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,870
Plus the US worked with other members of the
Five Eyes intelligence alliance to build a

110
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,150
special coalition to counter Chinese espionage.

111
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,069
The Five Eyes includes the US, Canada, the
UK, Australia, and New Zealand.

112
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:36,860
And somehow, the Trump Administration even
got other countries to team up with Five Eyes—including

113
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,090
Germany!

114
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,760
And here I’d heard Trump wouldn’t even
shake their hand.

115
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,169
I guess that was wrong.

116
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,550
So this part of the strategic framework has
seen real success.

117
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,819
Also, I had mentioned that some former allies
had pulled back under the Obama administration,

118
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,889
like Thailand and the Philippines.

119
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,560
Well, there’s a section of the US Strategic
Framework about Southeast Asia.

120
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,759
A lot of it is redacted, but it does seek
to strengthen ASEAN—the coalition of Southeast

121
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,509
Asian Nations.

122
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:13,499
And in particular, it seeks to promote a development
model that provides an alternative to China’s

123
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:15,219
One Belt One Road.

124
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:20,419
Now as I mentioned, the U.S. Strategic Framework
for the Indo-Pacific is largely related to

125
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:21,419
China.

126
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,050
But it’s only one piece of the Trump Administration’s
China strategy.

127
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,470
In fact, the 10-page document repeatedly references
another document, called the “U.S. Strategic

128
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,040
Framework for Countering China’s Economic
Aggression.”

129
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,560
And that one is still classified.

130
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,090
If they showed me, they’d probably have
to kill me.

131
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,940
And that’s not worth it, just to read some
policy report.

132
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,250
There’s also a whole section about North
Korea, plus references to a separate strategic

133
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,110
document about North Korea, which is also
classified.

134
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,510
But I’m not going to get into Korea stuff
in this episode.

135
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,800
This isn’t North Korea Un-Juche’d.

136
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,390
Annyeonghaseyo and welcome to North Korea
Un-Juche’d, I’m your Dearest Leader, Chris

137
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,390
Chappell.

138
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,840
I wonder if that show would get demonetized,
too.\h

139
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,590
But I think the real success of this Strategic
Framework on the Indo-Pacific is not the accomplishments

140
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,590
so far.

141
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,760
It’s that the Trump administration has made
it public—and that puts pressure on future

142
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,010
administrations to stick with it.

143
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,320
It’s basically the policy equivalent of
Trump hanging a painting of himself in the

144
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Oval Office.

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I’m lookin’ at you, Joe!

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,380
