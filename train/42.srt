00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,719
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,300
Joining me today: he reads books, you know
— it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,480
I've not picked a letter!

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,609
The bounciest man on the internet, Matt Gray!

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,809
Hello YouTube.

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,789
And everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan!

7
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:13,789
All aboard the zipline to the poop deck!

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:16,400
[Laughing] In front of me I have an article...

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,480
Where's the zipline from?

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Soft landing!

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,320
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,520
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,600
and there's a special prize for particularly good answers, which is...

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,260
And today's article is: Sergeant Reckless.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,420
That is my rank in the army.

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,260
Have a point. [DING]

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,220
Sergeant Major — Sergeant Reckless!

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,600
You get a point —

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,360
Yay!

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,580
...for successfully saying this is something or someone in the military.

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,800
Is it someone called Sergeant Reckless, before we go too far?

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,160
"Someone" is putting it a little bit strongly.

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,000
Is it a dog?

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,460
Ooh, but you're close.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,300
Horse.

26
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,380
Point! [DING]

27
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,860
Although, to be honest, the horse is named Reckless.

28
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,580
Why might it have had the Sergeant?

29
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,880
Got a field promotion.

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,900
Point! [DING]

31
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,600
Started at the bottom and worked its way up.

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,500
Held official rank in the United States military.

33
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,880
— Okay.
— Did it order anyone?

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,880
Er, no.

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,120
Yeah, a lot of donkeys that were subordinate to it.

36
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,080
'Private Donkey, Private Ass...'

37
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,020
Although, if you think about it, privates in the platoon must have been technically outranked by the horse.

38
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,860
Yeah, they'd have to salute the horse.

39
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,240
Horse can't salute, can it?

40
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,780
Yeah, it can!

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,460
Can it?

42
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,900
Yeah! Balance on the other three.

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,220
Yes, but can it do that with the other leg?

44
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,940
Leg up!

45
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,300
Don't know. Have you seen a horse try?

46
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,300
I don't know about you, but most of the horses I've seen have not been in the army.

47
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,240
Oh, that's fair.

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,480
Most of the horses I've seen have been civilians.

49
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,520
Yeah, but they'd tend to use it to adjust their glasses or something, even if they weren't in the army.

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Monocle.

51
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,760
Can you imagine the length of the bridge of the glasses for a horse?

52
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,740
Yeah, that's fine. A monocle's still going to fall out.

53
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,940
They'll have two monocles!

54
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,020
All right, they'll fall out, but that's just the universal exhibition of surprise.

55
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,780
More of a windscreen for a horse, isn't it?

56
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,680
Wraparound cricket glasses.

57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,080
Can you imagine? A prescription windscreen basically — why don't you have those?

58
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Why don't I have a windscreen?

59
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm a human.

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,940
It'd be like one massive bit of glass that goes all the way round.

61
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,080
Poker visor things!

62
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,680
Yeah!

63
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,380
No, because it'd be massively heavy.

64
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,080
Glasses are really heavy.

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm not talking about — all right, for the 1940s horse in the army,

66
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,720
Yeah.

67
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes, impractical because of the size of the glass.

68
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,400
For the modern man of today there must be thin materials we could use for —

69
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,220
No, there really aren't. If you make the glasses thin,

70
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,400
the refractive index has to be high so they're really heavy.

71
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,540
Science!

72
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,360
I've...

73
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,680
He's asked. He's tried.

74
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,900
I've literally tried to order extra-extra-thin glasses,

75
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,460
and they basically kept falling forwards off my face because they were just so heavy.

76
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,300
In moments of surprise, or at any time?

77
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,140
Any time!

78
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,800
Because any glasses should fall off at any moment of surprise.

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,980
Yeah.

80
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,080
No, originally a racehorse,

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,300
Sergeant Reckless was purchased from a Korean stableboy at the Seoul racetrack

82
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,280
who needed money to buy an artificial leg for his sister.

83
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
Sergeant Reckless's sister?

84
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,040
No, no, the stableboy's sister.

85
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,940
Oh.

86
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,260
They didn't give the horse an artificial leg.

87
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,600
Sorry, I tuned out halfway through what he was saying.

88
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,580
It sounded like the horse's sister was in hospital.

89
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,700
That makes a lot more sense.

90
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,320
It's fine.

91
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,760
It was technically an open modifier; I could have...

92
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,260
It's a brown horse, but it's got a white leg because it's all they've got left.

93
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,420
I'm going to give you a point.
Sergeant Reckless was indeed a chestnut horse.

94
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,280
[DING]

95
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,840
With, I'm quoting here, "a blaze and three white stockings."

96
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,060
White head marking and three white legs, but not on the fourth.

97
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,340
Two points. [DING DING] Two points straight away. Well done.

98
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,900
Because it's the false — oh, no, that was his sister.

99
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,480
Yes, a blaze — a wide white stripe down the middle of the face.

100
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,180
Do you think they camouflage that before they go into battle?

101
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,320
It'd be an obvious target.

102
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,860
He didn't actually — 'Aim for this bit.'

103
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,260
He didn't have a bulls-eye on there.

104
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,320
There might as well be, if you've got a big —

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
you know, it's a nighttime battle,

106
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,800
Sergeant Reckless is in the trench with you,

107
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,420
See what's going on... [horse snort]

108
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,760
That's what made him reckless. He refused to camouflage it.

109
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
We've made a presumption here, folks.

110
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,400
Ahh.

111
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,340
Female.

112
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,060
Lady horse.

113
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,960
There we go. [DING] Her date of birth and parentage are unconfirmed.

114
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,100
What was the reason you would buy...

115
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,280
An army platoon — the Recoilless Rifles — why would they buy a horse?

116
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,940
Glue.

117
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,820
No.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Lucrative incomes via betting.

119
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,940
By the way, by 'recoilless rifle', it is basically, er —

120
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,200
A rifle that fires without recoil?

121
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,960
If you think rifle, you think small stuff.

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,520
This is basically a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher.

123
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,680
Was it a bit like — the Indian army, didn't they use elephants as gun platforms?

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,440
Er, no, it is just a pack horse.

125
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,900
That's bull****, it's a bloody racehorse.

126
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,600
To pack the tube of the rifle.

127
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,620
They needed a horse that was strong and powerful,

128
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,980
and could travel long distances at speed.

129
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,780
Nine-month military career.

130
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,960
Right.

131
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,280
In a single day, made 51 solo trips to resupply front-line units.

132
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,260
'Go over there, horsey.'

133
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,700
I think that may literally have been the order,

134
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,400
It was: Here are some shells; they've trained the thing...

135
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Slap it on the back and it goes out and back.

136
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,980
How do they know this horse wasn't trying to run away

137
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,920
and just kept getting caught and sent back in the other direction?

138
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,200
It's an equine shuttle bus.

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,100
Er... equine cargo platform.

140
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,000
Cargo lifter, if you want to go for that.

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
It's the original shipping container.

142
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,140
More like BigDog.

143
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,520
Yeah.

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Yeah, that robot Google is working on right now.

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,940
Oh! Ugh!

146
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,500
-- Yeah, their unnerving...
-- Google?!

147
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah, Google bought Boston Dynamics

148
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,280
Did they?

149
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,440
Because that's not scary at all.

150
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,400
The massive autonomous robots for military use,

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
basically, the electronic descendants of Sergeant Reckless,

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
yeah, Google owns that company.

153
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,440
(Boston Dynamics are owned by Google?)

154
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
Delivering your Amazon packages soon!

155
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah.

156
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,180
I love that we're slightly slagging Google,

157
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,460
and I wonder if the lights are going to go out any second now.

158
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,100
That's a good point. We are in YouTube's own studios here, which we're very thankful for.

159
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,560
Mister Google, who I assume owns it,

160
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,660
is just over a big red button on his desk.

161
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,440
Mister Google?!

162
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,660
Could be.

163
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,280
Terry Google and Sons,

164
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,860
are, when you type in your search query,

165
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,160
'Right, okay, better get the replies to that in.'

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
Straight over to the card index, pull it out...

167
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
I was going to say, old card index.

168
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,540
Yup.

169
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,580
Was that the sound of a cat trapped in a card index there?

170
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,560
[Riffling] Reowr!

171
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,620
It's filed under C.

172
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,180
Yeah.

173
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,100
For 'Cat'.

174
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Which actually, in YouTube's card index — quite big, these days.

175
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,440
Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,620
K for 'Kitten' outranks it, but...

177
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,860
Hold on, hold on, hold on, archivist question:

178
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,680
Do you file 'Kitten' under K,

179
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,100
or do you file it under 'Cat', bracket, 'kitten' or comma,  'young'?

180
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,680
If — and here we go technical — if 'Cat' is the collection,

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,580
I think 'Kitten' would be a series beneath it.

182
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,800
All right! I'm glad I asked that question.

183
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,640
If you were giving me cat videos to file, I probably would do, erm...

184
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,420
probably, yeah, by cat-egory, so...

185
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,260
I think I probably would put 'Kitten' underneath.

186
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,060
Okay.

187
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,680
Depends how they originally came.

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,200
But if it was Terry Google and Sons...

189
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,020
Yeah.

190
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,020
You type in 'funny cat photo', they'd have to get the cat out and the camera out

191
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,340
and take the photo to send you it.

192
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,980
That's true.

193
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,120
That's Victorian Google for you.

194
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
They telegram it over.

195
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,060
Send it round with a courier.

196
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,400
Lad turns up with a hand-cranked projector,

197
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,320
'You wanted a funny cat video, sir?'

198
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,640
Oddly, that is the same sound as taking the cat out of the file there.

199
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,480
I was going to say.

200
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,360
Sitting there with your brandy — 'Heh! Heh! Heh! Most amusing.'

201
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,620
The horse was known for a few things:

202
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,920
for her willingness to eat nearly anything, including...

203
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,700
Including ammunition.

204
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,400
Nearly. About thirty dollars' worth of something...

205
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,820
Gun cotton.

206
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,100
Poker chips.

207
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,060
Waiting for her to 'cash out' about a day later...

208
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,500
It's like a one-armed bandit.

209
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,180
Bar... bar... bar... hrm. Booomf!

210
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,700
Also the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated

211
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
in a certain type of military operation.

212
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
Formation skydiving.

213
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
I mean, I'd like to see that...

214
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,120
It's not technically a military operation.

215
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,760
I've just realized.

216
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Both military operations and medical operations happen in a theatre.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,500
Ahh!

218
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,980
You're right. Yeah. The theatre of war...

219
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,380
This is not funny, I've just realized they're the same words.

220
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,220
Profound.

221
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah. I mean, I can't give you a point for it...

222
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,480
Give him some biscuits, at least.

223
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
Really? It's not worth biscuits.

224
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,340
Come on!

225
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,180
I don't think it's worth a biscuit. I'm going to be — aaa!

226
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,500
Oooh! What happens now?

227
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,540
Biscuits!

228
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,980
Stolen biscuits!

229
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,420
We're looking for a type of military operation.

230
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,980
Some kind of big thing you wouldn't expect a horse to be involved in.

231
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,160
USO show.

232
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,040
Ocean landing.

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,620
Yes! [DING] Absolutely. Point.

234
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,340
In fact, that, you can have the biscuits you just stole for.

235
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,300
Amphibious landing.

236
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,940
Doors open: at the front is a grizzled-looking horse with a cigar in his mouth.

237
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,560
'Let's do this.'

238
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,180
'What's the matter with you? You wanna live forever?'

239
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,340
Was awarded, first of all, two Purple Hearts, which is the medal you get for...

240
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,200
Being wounded.

241
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,060
Point. [DING] Absolutely right.

242
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:13,040
The Marines taught Reckless battlefield survival skills, such as...?

243
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,580
We're talking 1950s here.

244
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,160
Negotiate spiky things put in the way to slow you down?

245
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,920
I'll take — literally, I'll give you a point for that. [DING]

246
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
How not to become entangled in barbed wire.

247
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,640
Helicopter.

248
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,420
How would you teach it? You'd just go: 'No. No!'

249
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,700
I don't know how you train a horse.

250
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,800
Put the carrots round the barbed wire rather than through.

251
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,400
And how to lie down when under fire.

252
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,260
Also, if she heard 'Incoming!' she would run for a bunker.

253
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
...killing soldiers in its path!

254
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,740
Smashing.

255
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,960
I don't know if a horse can fit in a bunker, but...

256
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,500
Is it stuck in the door with its hooves just clipping on the concrete? [Whinnying]

257
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,200
Winnie the Pooh wedged in Rabbit's burrow, legs going.

258
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,100
Putting on its flash goggles and radiation suit as well, obviously.

259
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,500
They should put webbing on the horse, so as it's cantering for the...

260
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,680
Guys just grabbing on the side and getting dragged to safety.

261
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,120
'Tell you what, boys — just follow the horse, eh? Ha ha.'

262
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,340
What happened the first time that the recoilless rifle —

263
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,000
basically, the rocket launcher — was fired near her?

264
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,740
Did it not properly not-recoil, and she was fired backward about a hundred yards?

265
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,220
No...

266
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,380
Not at her, near her?

267
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,020
Near her.

268
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,320
Did she run away?

269
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,420
Did she spit out her gum and go, 'Call that a bang?'

270
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,100
All four feet left the ground,

271
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,380
as she jumped — it's a difficult thing for a horse.

272
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,340
Wow.

273
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,660
Imagine if you could hear the horse's words, you'd see: '****!!'

274
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
"You never told me it'd be that loud!"

275
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,140
What did they do to train her? Pop paper bags behind her or something like that?

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,560
'Bang.'

277
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,520
Basically, by the end of the mission...

278
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,500
'Bang.' Hold up a flash card.

279
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,420
By the end of the mission she was used to it.

280
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,640
When learning a new delivery route, she would only need someone to lead her a few times,

281
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,540
and then she would make the trips on her own.

282
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,180
'Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. All right, I'll do it.'

283
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,840
Goes behind a bush, waits there for an hour.

284
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,400
Throws everything off and comes back, like you's'd do on your paper round.

285
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,040
'Yeah, I took it.'

286
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,280
There was a standing order not to ride her, but during the Battle of Vegas Hill...

287
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:07,980
Ohhh!

288
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,180
...what happened?

289
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,960
Somebody did.

290
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,460
[DING]

291
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,780
Went to a casino.

292
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,880
With a man on her back.

293
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,000
Obviously someone rode her.

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
What might they have travelled through?

295
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,820
Three casinos and a Siegfried and Roy show.

296
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
Did they traverse a river?

297
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,400
No.

298
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,220
Atomic test site.

299
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,020
More dangerous than that; less dangerous than that.

300
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,180
The enemy line.

301
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,080
Minefield.

302
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,240
Ah.

303
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
'Well, I've got a ton of horse between the mine and me, I'll be all right.'

304
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeah.

305
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
In my head... [Trotting sounds]

306
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,120
And there's an explosion and it's just rider and horse:

307
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,980
[Rising sound]

308
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
[Falling sound]

309
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,860
That's how she did the vertical takeoff when she was surprised.

310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Yeah.

311
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,700
But — antipersonnel minefield?

312
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,380
Or anti-tank minefield?

313
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,080
Doesn't say.
I didn't know there was much of a difference.

314
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah. Pressure.

315
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,420
Well, two differences. Pressure...

316
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,560
Anti-tank goes off when you put however many tons through it,

317
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,740
and goes off immediately.

318
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,240
Yeah.

319
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,920
Anti-personnel goes off under much lighter pressure,

320
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,020
but goes off after you pass by.

321
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,020
Why?

322
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,200
Blows up behind you,

323
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,520
and gets everyone.

324
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,560
And gets everyone in line, right.

325
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,000
So, my question to you is:

326
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,740
if you are travelling fast enough on a racehorse...

327
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,540
ALL: Oooh!

328
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,420
Do you get heroes-never-look-back explosions?

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,280
Can you imagine being the man in the enemy trench,

330
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,000
seeing someone riding a horse through a minefield,

331
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,440
with a following trail of explosions,

332
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,320
as a grizzled, combat-ready horse

333
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,480
strolls through with a cigar in its mouth?

334
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,620
You can just imagine the guy behind enemy lines going:

335
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,300
And as the horse comes up, spitting out the cigar and the chewing tobacco

336
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,580
and going, 'Got any more?'

337
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,660
The noise, though!

338
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,000
'What caused that?'

339
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
'...a horse...!'

340
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,160
I mean, the answer is still probably: no, you end up with chunks of horse.

341
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,660
Yes, let's be honest here.

342
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,360
Or as we call it now, delicious, delicious lasagna.

343
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,980
Yes.

344
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,740
But I do like the way that Gary is writing the comic book...

345
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,200
Yeah.

346
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Just writing the comic book character of this.

347
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,940
After retiring from active service,

348
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,520
there was a campaign to get her back to the United States,

349
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,980
to the country that she'd now served.

350
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,600
Does anyone want to guess how that played out?

351
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,100
Bit like Saving Private Ryan?

352
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,040
Another crack squad of horses is sent in...

353
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,460
No! Sailed from Yokohama —

354
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,560
Hold on... this horse served in the Pacific?

355
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,700
Yes, bought at Seoul Racetrack.

356
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
Oh yeah, I forgot all that bit. I thought...

357
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,620
In my head it was in Europe. I do apologize.

358
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,080
Horse with a flamethrower!

359
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,480
1950s.

360
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,460
— Ahhh. Korea.
— The Korean War.

361
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,220
Yup.

362
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,660
The ship went through a typhoon.

363
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,100
Horse: still fine.

364
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,940
Horse probably drove the boat.

365
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,540
The entire crew dead...

366
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,340
Horse at the wheel. 'We're getting home!'

367
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,320
[Whinny]

368
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,100
In horse, yes.

369
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,500
What was the first problem with getting off in San Francisco?

370
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,860
Seasickness.

371
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:05,840
Er, no.

372
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,100
Horse had vommed everywhere.

373
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,040
Not enough gimbals on the boat.

374
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
Thing is — yes, you can have a point, that did happen. [DING]

375
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
But we're talking problems when we get there.

376
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,540
Scurvy horse.

377
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,060
Nope.

378
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,140
Quarantine?

379
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,620
Er... yeah, I'll give you a point for that. [DING]

380
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,460
Customs were fine, but the Department of Agriculture insisted on full lab tests,

381
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,140
which would make her late for the banquet where she was to be guest of honour.

382
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,640
Two things. One: you're going to argue with a fully armed, combat experienced horse.

383
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,240
Yes.

384
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,060
Two: I'm glad she's going to a banquet where she's a guest and not the main course.

385
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,980
That's true, yes.

386
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,020
Why did the Marines consider that lab test to be a bit of an affront to her honour?

387
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,000
Did she have to pee in a jar?

388
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,800
You know, you're along kind of the right lines there.

389
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,380
It was a blood test, but...

390
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,780
Was it an STD test?

391
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,940
Point! Yes. [DING]

392
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,780
Oh my God.

393
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,980
They were testing for dourine, which is an equine STI.

394
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,700
Did she have it?

395
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,260
No.

396
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,420
She's been away a long time. It did happen a lot, you know.

397
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,320
No, she made it to the Marine Corps Birthday Ball,

398
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,980
in which she rode —

399
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,960
— in a dress! Sorry...

400
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,180
In a ball gown.

401
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,540
What did she get to ride in order to get there?

402
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
An even bigger horse!

403
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,240
An open-top carriage.

404
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,320
A carousel.

405
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,180
No, no.

406
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,880
I'll give you a hint: it was not held on the ground floor here.

407
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,100
In a lift?!

408
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,700
In a lift!

409
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,600
They put a horse —

410
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,780
Sorry, this horse has been in combat,

411
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,400
and the most amazing thing is they've put a horse in a lift?

412
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,360
[Elevator music]
[Whinny]

413
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,220
At which point, someone is on the third floor, has been drinking heavily all night,

414
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,160
the lift doors open and there's a horse in a ball gown — with medals...

415
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,240
Puts the bottle down, picks up something stronger...

416
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,700
Congratulations, Chris — you win this week's show.

417
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,740
Hahey!

418
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,200
You win a pigeon!

419
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,540
Just one?

420
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,160
Although you do have to collect it from Trafalgar Square.

421
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,840
Game on!

422
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,900
Bring him his butterfly net!

423
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,840
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel!

424
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,340
Matt Gray!

425
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,600
And Gary Brannan.

426
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
I've been Tom Scott, and we'll see you next time!

427
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,780
He's got the beard, I've got the bulk.

428
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,440
Wow.

429
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,300
That's a slogan there.

430
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,360
Let's make lots of money!

431
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Where's the hyphen in that?

432
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm trying to diagram the sentence.

433
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,260
Anywhere you can put a hyphen changes it.

434
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,200
Is it an Australian bird?

435
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,320
No, it's not.

436
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
If he didn't win a sporting event,

437
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,960
or invent some kind of metalworking process,

438
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,600
then quite frankly I am out of here.

439
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,040
