1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,080
Bangkok has him.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,920
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,930
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,120
And this is Joshua Wong—

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,400
one of the most prominent faces of the 2014

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,230
Hong Kong Umbrella Movement—

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,020
a mass protest lasting two-and-a-half months,

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,910
where young people stood up for freedom in Hong Kong

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,580
in the face of mainland Chinese encroachment.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,600
And I would have gotten away with too!

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,410
If it weren’t for you meddling kids…

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,260
That’s a simple way to put it.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,260
Needless to say,

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,260
Joshua Wong—

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,060
being a pro-democracy student leader and all—

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,280
is not on the Chinese Communist Party’s
list of Top 10 Faves.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,550
What a pain it is that Joshua Wong

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,309
lives in Hong Kong.

20
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,040
The most they could do to him there

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,260
was getting him sentenced to 80 hours community service

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,960
for getting people to care about their government.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,500
This other thing other thing that happened
to him last year?

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,050
Uh, it had nothing to do with the Chinese
regime...

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,620
that’s… provable.

26
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,320
I mean, accidents will happen, right?

27
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,790
Like what happened to Kevin Lau in 2014.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,760
“A journalist known for his aggressive reporting on China,

29
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,840
Kevin Lau,

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,080
was walking to his car earlier today,

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,090
and then stabbed multiple times by an unknown attacker

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,190
and left bleeding.”

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,619
I’m sure he just fell down the stairs...

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,699
into a knife...

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,760
multiple times.

36
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,360
So Joshua Wong is safe...ish in Hong Kong.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,530
At least safer than if he were in Mainland
China.

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,630
And while it is shocking to see the Chinese
regime’s influence

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,860
in Hong Kong,

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,530
which is supposed to operate under the One
Country,

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,830
Two Systems policy,

42
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,600
it’s only about as surprising

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,500
as when your grandmother

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,729
gets you the same subscription to Zoobooks
for your birthday

45
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,120
she’s given you for the past 25 years.

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,490
Thanks Nana,

47
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,560
you shouldn’t have.

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,720
But when Joshua Wong became an activist

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,020
he probably didn’t anticipate just how far
the Chinese regime

50
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,110
could extend its reach.

51
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,279
Like a Hungry, Hungry Hippo...

52
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,879
of evil!

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,879
Last week,

54
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,040
Joshua Wong was scheduled to speak at a university
in Thailand

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,049
for the 40th anniversary of a bloody government
crackdown there

56
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,379
on student demonstrators.

57
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,749
What is it about student demonstrators and
bloody government crackdowns

58
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:30,260
that go together like peas and carrots?

59
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,379
But instead of Joshua Wong giving his speech,

60
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,639
Thai police detained him at the airport.

61
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,489
They held him for 12 hours,

62
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,949
then stuck him on a plane and sent him back
to Hong Kong.

63
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:43,949
According to The Nation,

64
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,049
an English-language paper in Thailand,

65
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:51,620
an airport official said the request to arrest
Wong came from China.

66
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,870
But according to China:

67
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,870
Nuh-uh!

68
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,810
It was totally Thailand!

69
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,159
Regardless,

70
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,010
this image has been blowing up on Thai social media.

71
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,299
It shows Thailand as as part of China.

72
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,959
It’s really...

73
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,760
well it looks kind of nice, actually.

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,749
I mean, you know, maybe we could try it and
see how it works out…

75
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:14,109
Because as the Wall Street Journal puts it,

76
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:16,900
“This fits a global pattern.”

77
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,599
The Chinese regime gets in good with countries
that

78
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,370
don’t necessarily have the most sparkling
human rights records.

79
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,370
And that means,

80
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,909
if you’re on the wrong side of the Chinese
Communist Party,

81
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,390
you might not be safe even outside of China.

82
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,809
It’s like a game of whack-a-mole,

83
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,459
where the moles are dissidents,

84
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,730
and the Chinese regime has a giant mallet.

85
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,959
The democratically elected government of Thailand

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,699
was overthrown by a military junta in 2014.

87
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,549
That’s bad news for the many Chinese dissidents
living there.

88
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:49,549
In fact,

89
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,760
things could have gone much worse for Joshua
Wong.

90
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,579
They merely sent him back to Hong Kong.

91
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,519
This Hong Konger living in Thailand

92
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,980
got kidnapped and sent to mainland China...

93
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,980
probably.

94
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
Well,

95
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,719
we don’t really know what happened.

96
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,629
His Hong Kong bookstore sells books about
Chinese politics.

97
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:12,290
He disappeared late last year from his condo
in Thailand.

98
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,969
The next time anyone saw him was in early
January

99
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,940
making a confession on Chinese state-run TV.

100
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,140
And he hasn’t been seen since.

101
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,920
And while that sounds pretty bad,

102
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,300
it’s not as bad as what happened

103
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,120
to the last 100 guys.

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,009
And no one saw them again either.

105
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:35,479
So I guess Thailand and China are bros now.

106
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,900
But hold on, Thailand.

107
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,310
Malaysia deported a group of Chinese Uyghur
asylum seekers

108
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,409
way before you did.

109
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,409
Oh,

110
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,620
and they also deported Joshua Wong before
you did.

111
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,970
Thailand is such a Malaysia wannabe.

112
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,319
And in Nepal,

113
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,669
Tibetans who’ve fled China are frequently
harassed by police

114
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,379
or deported.

115
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,680
Sometimes you don’t even need to be Chinese.

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,789
Armenia,

117
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:00,900
Kenya,

118
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,009
Cambodia,

119
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,840
and Malaysia have all deported Taiwanese citizens

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,569
to Mainland China,

121
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:11,810
which adds yet another layer of wrongness
to this whole thing.

122
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,000
Unsurprisingly,

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,400
all these countries rely on the Chinese regime

124
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,610
for trade and investment.

125
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,389
So what does this mean?

126
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,610
If you criticize the Chinese regime,

127
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,080
you could be in trouble not just if you visit China,

128
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,430
but if you visit...well,

129
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,219
a number of other countries too.

130
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,439
So keep your head down and your mouth shut.

131
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,519
But don’t worry,

132
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,560
dissidents of all stripes are welcome here

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,319
on China Uncensored.

134
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,469
So Joshua Wong,

135
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:38,469
if you’re watching,

136
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,180
you’re welcome on this show any time.

137
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,210
If you're coming to New York,

138
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,610
just maybe take a direct flight.

139
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,240
So how do you feel about China extending its reach

140
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,080
beyond its borders?

141
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,740
Leave your comments below...

142
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,389
where they will be traced and stored

143
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,520
as future incriminating evidence.

144
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,979
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

145
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,439
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell,

146
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,239
see you in the reeducation centers!
