00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,629
China’s first space walk

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,110
hides a dark secret.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:14,630
China’s space ambitions
are a global threat.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:31,669
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:35,370
China made history this week with its first
ever space walk.

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,280
Hundreds of miles above earth, China made
history on Sunday with the first spacewalk

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,090
outside its Tiangong station...He and two
other astronauts are on the first of four

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,860
high-stakes missions to complete China's space
station by the end of 2022.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,780
And the space station, Tiangong, which means
Heavenly Palace, is just the beginning of

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,260
China’s ambitious space program.

11
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,300
In just the past 7 months, China has put a
rover on the moon, and one on Mars, becoming

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,060
the second country in history after the US
to land a rover on the Red Planet.

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,439
They also plan to send humans to the moon
in the 2030s.

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,680
So these Chinese astronauts must have some
really inspiring words for mankind.

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,009
We will obey orders and instructions and keep
calm while meticulously carrying out the mission.

16
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,700
One small step for man, one giant leap for
Big Brother.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,900
You see, China’s space program has a dark
secret.

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,040
It’s not run by a civilian agency the way
NASA is.

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,240
China’s space program is run by the People’s
Liberation Army, which is the armed wing of

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
the Chinese Communist Party.

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,130
Yes, in communist China, the army belongs
to the Communist Party, not the government.

22
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,860
Speaking of belonging to the Communist Party:
“All three astronauts are party members,

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,730
and they and other space officials repeatedly
credited [Xi Jinping] or the party for the

24
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,579
country’s feats in space.”

25
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,220
And if you’ve seen the recent celebrations
for the Chinese Communist Party’s 100 year

26
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,000
anniversary, that kind of cult-like worship
should have you pretty worried.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,070
Especially because China is rapidly looking
to replace the US in space.

28
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,510
Without new funding, the ISS could be decommissioned
in 2024.

29
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,110
Which means the Tiangong could be the only
space station left in Earth's orbit.

30
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,640
Foreign astronauts are certainly going to
enter the Chinese space station one day.

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,610
There are a number of countries that have
expressed a desire to do that.

32
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,900
If the Chinese Communist Party is able to
control access to space, that means China

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,900
could cut off access to any nation that’s
unwilling to do this.

34
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,630
According to US Intelligence, China is already
building space weapons to blind US satellites.

35
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,720
Say goodbye to your GPS.

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,950
That would be devastating for the US military.

37
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,620
And for me when I try to use Google Maps to
navigate to the nearest Cracker Barrel.

38
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,740
The Chinese Communist Party has an iron grip
on science in China.

39
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,820
If you have any questions about that, just
look into how the Communist Party has silenced

40
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,670
scientists who don’t toe the party line
on the coronavirus.

41
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,580
But here’s a more recent example.

42
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,670
A Communist Party official connected to the
state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology

43
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,530
Corporation “allegedly attacked two prominent
space scientists -- including an 85-year-old

44
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,530
woman.”

45
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,700
Funny, because Xi Jinping has been saying
how much the Party supports scientists.

46
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,560
Because science is the main battleground with
the West.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,630
But it’s the Party and politics that really
rule China.

48
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,750
“The Party Secretary attacked the two scientists
after they refused his request to be recommended

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,230
for membership of the International Academy
of Astronautics.”

50
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,650
And by attacked, I mean he broke the spine
of an 85 year old woman.

51
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,190
But it’s not just that a Party secretary
attacked Chinese scientists.

52
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,380
It’s that this happened in early June.

53
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,540
And the Party covered it up for weeks.

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,910
And many Chinese netizens were curious why
it took so long for the story to come to light.

55
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,630
And why the Party secretary hadn’t suffered
any consequences.

56
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,660
Well, I can tell you.

57
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,530
The Party was gearing up for its 100th anniversary
and the space walk, and didn’t want people

58
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,370
to know.

59
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,280
After a huge public backlash, the China Aerospace
Science and Technology Corporation finally

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,450
put out a brief statement saying the party
secretary was drinking at the time, and now

61
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,980
he’s been suspended.

62
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,870
But you can see why the Communist Party is
so interested in space.

63
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,160
In space, no one can hear the people scream.

64
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,190
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

65
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,550
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,

66
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,970
by contributing through crowd funding website
Patreon.

67
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,510
Ian Jackson asks, “Chris, there is room
here for your channel to do a 1 hour time-line

68
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:26,200
documentary on the origins of this starting
2009 up to 2020.

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Do it as a proper docco, not just a news item.

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,710
At the very least it will really annoy the
CCP

71
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,900
Ah, Ian is talking about the origins of the
coronavirus.

72
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,810
This is actually something we’ve been thinking
about.

73
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,190
Maybe not quite a full documentary, but an
explainer that breaks down everything we know

74
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,750
about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, their
coronavirus research, especially with human

75
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,800
animal chimeras, US funding for the lab, and
the timeline of the coverup—both what the

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,070
Chinese Communist Party did, and what US scientists
and media did to convince Americans the lab

77
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,120
leak hypothesis was a racist conspiracy theory.

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,630
It also reminds me of another idea we had.

79
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,270
To do more explainer episodes—like a quick
rundown of historical things like the Cultural

80
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,580
Revolution, or what a wumao is, things like
that.

81
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,590
So is that something you’d be interested
in watching?

82
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,060
Let me know in the comments below.

83
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,010
