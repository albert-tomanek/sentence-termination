1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,629
A Canadian faces execution in China!

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,800
It follows the arrest of a Chinese executive
in Canada

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,520
And threats that China will take revenge

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,280
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,440

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,449
Now, imagine being doing something so horrible,

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,509
so terribly bad that you somehow make Canada
angry!

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:34,480
I know, that’s just aboot impossible.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,050
But that’s what the Chinese Communist Party
has managed to do.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,250
So in case you’ve been living in a cave
for the past month,

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,250
big news:

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
In December,

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,060
Canada arrested Chinese telecom giant Huawei’s
CFO,

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,670
Meng Wanzhou.

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,579
That was at the request of the US.

20
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,629
Huawei is alleged to have used shell companies

21
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:56,429
to trick banks into violating US trade sanctions
on Iran

22
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,670
and possibly Syria.

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,429
But the arrest of Huawei’s CFO

24
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,630
did not make the Chinese regime happy.

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,410
And my...maybe no longer favorite

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,700
Chinese state-run media the Global Times

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,650
said China would take revenge

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,260
if Canada doesn't free the Huawei CFO.

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,200
And let’s just say,

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,330
that turned out to be more than just an empty
threat.

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,500
“Thirteen Canadians have been detained in
China

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,030
since Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,910
was arrested in Vancouver last month

34
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,520
on a U.S. extradition request.

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,820
That's according to a Canadian government
statement

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,270
released Thursday.”

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,360
And this week,

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Chinese authorities took it a step further.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,451
“A court in China has ordered a retrial
of a Canadian citizen

40
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,420
on drug smuggling charges.

41
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,560
Robert Lloyd Schellenberg had lodged an appeal

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,860
after being handed a 15 year sentence in November,

43
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,090
but prosecutors argued that sentence was too
light.

44
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,630
The court agreed.”

45
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,100
Well, that appeal backfired.

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,910
So if a 15 year sentence was too light,

47
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,980
what was the court’s new sentence?

48
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,140
“A Chinese court has sentenced a Canadian
man to death.”

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,690
Holy cow, that escalated quickly.

50
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,000
This is why I don’t plan on traveling to
China anytime soon.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,110
In fact, the US State department issued

52
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,140
a travel advisory to China at the start of
the year

53
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,910
warning of arbitrary enforcement of laws.

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,751
China’s foreign ministry said that was ridiculous.

55
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:23,620
"I would like to point out here

56
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,930
that the competent Chinese authorities

57
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,230
have always impartially handle cases

58
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,930
that involve the tiny minority of foreign
nationals

59
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,630
who were suspected of crime in China,

60
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,770
according to law.

61
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,000
The U.S. side's issuance of this travel advisory

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
frankly does not hold water."

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,430
Well, Canada has also decided that it does
hold water.

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,180
Their own travel warning now says Canadian
citizens

65
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,340
should exercise a high degree of caution if
traveling to China.

66
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,620
China's sentencing of a Canadian national
to death on Monday,

67
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,510
has drawn heavy criticism from Canada.

68
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,040
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau blasted Beijing

69
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,020
for the conviction of Robert Lloyd Schellenberg
on drug offenses.

70
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,190
It's dealt a further blow

71
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,730
to already icy relations between the two sides.

72
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,170
"I will say it is of extreme concern to us
as a government

73
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,430
as it should be to all our international friends

74
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,260
and allies that China has chosen to begin
to

75
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,910
arbitrarily apply death penalty in cases facing—

76
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,180
as in this case—

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,180
facing a Canadian."

78
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,410
And, you guessed it,

79
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,420
the Chinese regime was not happy of being

80
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,300
accused of arbitrary law enforcement.

81
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,150
“The remarks by the relevant Canadian person

82
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,130
lack the most basic awareness of the legal
system.”

83
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,920
Wow, she didn’t even use his name.

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,500
Though that is the first time any Canadian
official

85
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,120
has been called relevant.

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,160
China is known for handing out

87
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,130
harsh sentences to drug dealing,

88
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,340
even, yes, the death penalty.

89
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,440
In fact, over the past decade,

90
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,610
citizens of multiple countries

91
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,930
have been sentenced to death in China

92
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,360
for drug crimes.

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,459
Over 100 hundred just from Nigeria.

94
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,960
Then again, according to Amnesty International,

95
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,780
China is just the best at executions all around.

96
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,930
“China remains the world’s top executioner—

97
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,980
but the true extent of the use of the death
penalty

98
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,459
in China is unknown

99
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,779
as this data is classified as a state secret.”

100
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,549
So China executes a lot of people.

101
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,080
And some of the are executed for drug offenses.

102
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,719
But it’s the timing of death penalty

103
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,719
given to Canadian Robert Schellenberg

104
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:30,759
that suggests there’s more to this story.

105
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,830
“Schellenberg was actually arrested back
in December 2014

106
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,781
and it took almost 4 years for the Chinese
court

107
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,569
to hand down his first conviction

108
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,819
as an accessory to drug smuggling

109
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,730
and a sentence of 15 years in prison.

110
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,430
But after he appealed that decision last November,

111
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,710
all of a sudden his case becomes fast tracked.”

112
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,590
Schellenberg appealed his case last November.

113
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,330
Then in December, the Huawei CFO was arrested.

114
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,110
And suddenly, prosecutors in China claimed

115
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,439
they found new evidence that Schellenberg

116
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,949
was not in fact just an accessory,

117
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:07,620
but a principal offender,

118
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,879
responsible for trying to smuggle

119
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,710
500 pounds of methamphetamines to Australia

120
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,699
in pellets stuffed inside tires.

121
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,539
Like I said, that escalated quickly.

122
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,249
According to a China law specialist

123
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,370
at George Washington University,

124
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,539
Donald C. Clark,

125
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,479
“We should draw the conclusion that

126
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,090
the Chinese government very obviously wants
us to draw:

127
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,100
this is a political case.

128
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,289
Schellenberg’s fate will have nothing to
do with

129
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,759
his individual guilt or innocence.”

130
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,259
And that’s the biggest challenge Canada

131
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,919
will have in trying to prevent Schellenberg’s
execution—

132
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,931
the Chinese Communist Party fundamentally
doesn’t do

133
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:48,050
“rule of law.”

134
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,629
They will use their legal system

135
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:52,240
to do what they want, politically.

136
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,089
Here’s the Foreign Ministry spokesperson
responding to Trudeau

137
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,900
saying China is arbitrarily detaining people.

138
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,289
“We express our strong dissatisfaction towards
this.

139
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,349
We urge the Canadian side to respect the rule
of law,

140
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,289
respect China's legal sovereignty,

141
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,219
correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible
remarks.”

142
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,080
What the Party is trying to say is,

143
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,139
Canada respect China’s rule of law,

144
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,150
but should ignore its own rule of law by letting

145
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,249
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou off the hook.

146
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,389
And then maybe fewer Canadians will be executed
in China.

147
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,909
And under the Chinese Communist Party’s
thinking,

148
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,119
that makes perfect sense.

149
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:34,740
The courts are ultimately another weapon of
the Party.

150
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,520
I mean, how do you think Chinese courts

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,479
convict 99.9% of defendants?

152
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,259
So of course the Party thinks that Justin
Trudeau

153
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,350
can just order the Canadian courts to release
Meng Wanzhou.

154
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,319
But that’s not the way it works in countries

155
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,180
with actual rule of law and independent courts.

156
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,139
And that’s what is so confusing to the Chinese
Communist Party.

157
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,509
They probably don’t want to actually risk

158
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,539
the fallout of executing Schellenberg.

159
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,889
But they don’t understand that Canadian
courts

160
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,189
can’t just release someone

161
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,710
because it’s politically convenient.

162
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,939
So now the Party’s stuck—

163
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,939
it can’t back down.

164
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,349
And that’s why Schellenberg is in

165
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,800
such a dangerous predicament.

166
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,839
So what do you think about Schellenberg’s
death sentence?

167
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,810
Leave your comments below.

168
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,559
And now, it’s time for me to answer a question

169
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,839
from a member of my 50-cent army,

170
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,499
a brave alliance of fans who support China
Uncensored

171
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:35,210
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

172
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,099
William E William asks,

173
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,669
“What about South Korea?”

174
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,650
For context, that was in response to our recent
episode

175
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,530
“How 8 Countries Are Handling Huawei.”

176
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,309
South Korea was not on the list,

177
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,419
but that’s a good question,

178
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,490
o I looked into it.

179
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,490
Turns out,

180
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,889
South Korea’s largest wireless operator,

181
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:55,050
SK Telecom

182
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,319
announced in September the companies

183
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,599
it would like to build its 5G network.

184
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,539
Huawei was not one of them.

185
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,300
But they may be standing alone.

186
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,669
Another South Korean company,

187
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,969
LG Uplus,

188
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,960
is expected to go with Huawei.

189
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,120
Currently, the South Korean government

190
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,770
has not banned Huawei,

191
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,319
but may be considering it.

192
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,610
Which is why Huawei has said

193
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,539
they’ll happily address any security concerns.

194
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,249
So, South Korea’s stance?

195
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:25,419
There may be concern about Huawei.

196
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,539
But there are no plans to block Huawei from
government use,

197
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,960
or from their 5G network.

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Thanks for your question!

199
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
