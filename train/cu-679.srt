1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,910
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,810
if you criticize socialism,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,600
does that mean you’re not being very sociable?

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,020
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,500
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,400
US President Donald Trump spoke

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,749
at the UN General Assembly this week.

8
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:19,949
And it seemed to go well.

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,810
In less than two years,

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,109
my administration has accomplished more than

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,070
almost any administration in the history of
our country.

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:38,829
America...so true.

13
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,649
Didn't expect that reaction but that's okay.

14
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,710
A little laughter, and some applause.

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,890
But there are “some countries,” according
to Trump,

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,400
that just aren’t playing by the same rules
as everyone else.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,780
For example,

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,880
countries were admitted to the World Trade
Organization

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,910
that violate every single principle on which
the organization is based.

20
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:11,390
Some countries abused their openness to dump
their products,

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,970
subsidize their goods, target our industries,

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,430
and manipulate their currencies

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,650
to gain unfair advantage over our country.”

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,960
“These countries use government-run industrial
planning

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,300
and state-owned enterprises to rig the system
in their favor.”

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,450
Yeah, “some countries”!

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,110
Not to name names here.

28
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,500
And I respect your self-restraint, Mr. President.

29
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,170
But it’s ok to say your favorite word!

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,540
China, China, China

31
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,810
The United States has just announced another

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,660
200 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese
made goods,

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,390
for a total of 250 billion dollars.

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,600
Oh my gosh does the Chinese representative
have a black eye?!

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,680
Hang on, I’ve just received this letter
from the Chinese Consulate!

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,960
Apparently, China’s UN representative...

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,400
fell down the stairs.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,730
Huh.

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,400
But the Chinese Communist Party wants you
to know,

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,590
if any country is being abusive, it’s the
United States.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,510
“Now that the U.S. has taken

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,440
such sweeping measures of trade restrictions,

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,250
which is like putting a knife to others' neck,

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,890
how could we conduct negotiations?”

45
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,710
State-run Xinhua accuses the US of “trade
bullyism.”

46
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,710
Bullyism?

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,710
Bully-ism?

48
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,360
Wow, it’s like China’s even stealing our
insults...

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
and reverse engineering them,

50
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,950
and then trying to sell us badly-made knock-offs.

51
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,290
This is why we need tariffs, people!

52
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,200
It’s time to bring back those high-quality,

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,230
made-in-America insults.

54
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,230
Like “hornswoggler.”

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,260
That’s a real word.

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,260
Look it up.

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,880
I’m not hornswoggling you.

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,970
Wait, what was I talking about?

59
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,150
Oh, right.

60
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,390
How the US is the bully in this trade scenario.

61
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,840
Now I know you’re probably thinking,

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,459
“Wait, isn’t China the big dirty cheater
here?”

63
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,300
But how could that be?

64
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,240
China has just released a white paper on the
trade war

65
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,120
proving that it’s right.

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Using facts.

67
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,480
That’s right folks, Chinese state-run media

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,250
wants you to know that this white paper includes
real facts.

69
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,569
Presumably to distinguish it from all the
previous white papers,

70
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,200
like the one about how China has made

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,510
“remarkable progress” in human rights.

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,020
It’s like when Domino's Pizza started advertising,

73
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,230
“Now made with real cheese!”

74
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,860
And they were hoping you would think,

75
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,220
“oh goody!”

76
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,830
But you were actually thinking,

77
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,330
“Wait, what did they use before?

78
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,370
And should I even be eating this now?”

79
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,700
But just because a pizza contains real cheese,

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,400
doesn’t mean it also contains real meat.

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,480
So while China’s new white paper on trade

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,370
may contain some real facts,

83
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,080
it’s a bit lacking in others.

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
Like the facts about China

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,170
relentlessly dumping products on the US,

86
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,130
forcing technology transfer,

87
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,140
and stealing America’s intellectual property.

88
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,810
But it’s not about whether the white paper
is true,

89
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,920
or partly true, or the pepperoni is actually
rat meat.

90
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,499
The point is, you shouldn’t worry.

91
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,989
Because China is looking out

92
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,999
for the world in the face of US aggression.

93
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,779
It says “[The US] has become the greatest
source of uncertainty

94
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,759
and risk for the recovery of the global economy,”

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,590
but “[China has] the support of

96
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,810
all countries in the world that reject protectionism,

97
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,699
unilateralism and hegemony."

98
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,659
Yeah, that’s right.

99
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,659
The Chinese Communist Party

100
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,409
is standing up for the rest of the world,

101
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,729
using its totally fair debt traps.

102
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,840
And my favorite Chinese state run media, the
Global Times,

103
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,820
said this week that in the US-China trade
war,

104
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,990
“China is honest and principled

105
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,689
and a major trade power with intensive strengths.

106
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,999
No one can take us down.”

107
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,569
But President Trump may have other ideas.

108
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,129
Not about any country in particular, of course.

109
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,169
“Virtually everywhere socialism or communism

110
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,909
has been tried it has produced suffering corruption
and decay.

111
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:19,689
Socialism’s thirst for power leads to expansion,

112
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,949
incursion and oppression.

113
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,180
All nations of the worlds should resist socialism

114
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,939
and the misery that it brings to everyone.”

115
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,999
That’s misery to everyone in general,

116
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,870
not necessarily everyone in particular.

117
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,089
Oh, c’mon!

118
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,659
There’s lots of countries

119
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,610
where people are suffering from socialist
policies.

120
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,669
That’s better.

121
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:44,690
So what do you think?

122
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,060
Leave your comments below.

123
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,139
And before you go,

124
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,300
now is the time when I answer questions from
you!

125
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,080
The loyal members of the China Uncensored
50-cent army

126
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,020
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

127
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,059
David Blatt asks,

128
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,869
What is the impact of Hong Kong

129
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,900
handing over sovereignty of the train station
in Kowloon

130
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,849
that links it to PRC;

131
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,159
and what is their reasoning for this suspicious
occurrence.

132
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,779
That’s another step in the Chinese Communist
Party’s plan

133
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,110
to change one country, two systems—

134
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,460
the policy where Hong Kong gets to keep freedoms

135
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,860
unimaginable in the rest of China—

136
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,129
into one country, one system—

137
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:24,869
where things are much more harmonious.

138
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:28,020
Losing a piece of Hong Kong territory at the
train station

139
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,330
and having it be administered under Mainland
Chinese law

140
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,300
is a small but meaningful step toward that.

141
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,979
It would have been unthinkable ten years ago.

142
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,180
But bit by bit,

143
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,830
Hong Kong’s freedoms are vanishing.

144
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,580
In this case, in the name of convenience.

145
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,580
But so far,

146
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,349
the high-speed rail line doesn’t seem to
be

147
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:49,270
as popular as the government thought.

148
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,220
Thanks for you question David.

149
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,639
