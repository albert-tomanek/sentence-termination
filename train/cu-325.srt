00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,330
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,860
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,020
Wait, what’s that?!

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,830
Why, it’s a Chinese spy ship!

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,680
Off the coast of Alaska!

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,920
And I’m guessing it’s not there

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,450
just for the beautiful view of

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,140
Alaska’s rugged wilderness.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,540
But don’t worry!

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,740
US officials know it’s there.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,090
Making it...

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,940
maybe not the best spy ship.

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,040
Unless…

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,900
Wait, where did it go?!

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,560
Shoot, folks,

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,860
I guess it’s nowhere to be found.

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,660
So what was it doing there in the first place?

18
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,780
I mean really, there are so many things

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,480
happening in Alaska that China

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,370
would want to spy on.

21
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,370
For example,

22
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,370
what’s going to happen

23
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,010
on the next season of Deadliest Catch?

24
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,420
Or Ice Road Truckers?

25
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,310
Or Alaskan Bush People?

26
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,310
Or The Last Frontier?

27
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,370
Or Gold Rush?

28
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,600
Or Slednecks?

29
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Fun fact:

30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,739
Alaska has more reality shows per capita

31
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,740
than anywhere else in the world.

32
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,340
There are several more

33
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,660
that we didn’t even show you.

34
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,470
Maybe we should just get the Chinese military

35
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,620
a subscription to the Discovery channel.

36
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,470
Well, one thing’s for sure.

37
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,360
With a Chinese spy ship so close to US shores,

38
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,920
the US government—

39
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,280
Wait, the US government says they don’t
care?

40
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,329
Having a Chinese spy ship

41
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,850
hanging around Alaska is totally fine?

42
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,729
Wait a minute,

43
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,710
maybe this is for a new reality TV show!

44
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,880
But as fun as that would be,

45
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,170
there’s probably something else going on.

46
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,539
"The Chinese spy ship

47
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:29,630
was only 100 miles from Kodiak, Alaska.

48
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,920
That's where our military launched

49
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,540
an anti-ballistic missile earlier this week."

50
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,659
Ah, that makes more sense.

51
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:37,189
They were watching the US military

52
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,469
as it tested its THAAD missile system

53
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,060
on July 11th.

54
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,880
“So it starts here near Hawaii,

55
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,849
where the Pentagon says an airforce plane

56
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:48,020
launched a target missile.

57
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,469
And then it launched a so-called THAAD missile

58
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,240
from Kodiak, Alaska to intercept it.

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,249
Well, let’s see—

60
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,749
the two missiles met mid-air

61
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:00,889
and ‘big boom’ is the result.”

62
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,039
So the Chinese spy ship

63
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,829
was there to watch our missiles go boom.

64
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,329
Understandably, that’s exciting.

65
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,329
But the thing is,

66
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:11,450
this spy ship came fairly close to US shores—

67
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,330
just around 100 miles away.

68
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,880
That’s technically in international waters,

69
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,220
but still...

70
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,440
For some context,

71
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,120
this Alaska.

72
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,950
Kodiak is a small city on a small island

73
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,200
also named Kodiak.

74
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,310
It’s home to some not so small bears,

75
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,090
also named Kodiak.

76
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,090
Those bears are probably why

77
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,490
the Chinese spy ship left in a hurry.

78
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,900
Although that would also be a great reality
show.

79
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,020
So what’s the big deal about this US missile
test

80
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,940
that the Chinese military would risk

81
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,120
imminent bear-death to watch?

82
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,440
Well, as I said,

83
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,640
it was a test of a missile defense system
called THAAD.

84
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,790
It’s the same kind of missile defense array

85
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,960
the US has installed in several places

86
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,140
around the world.

87
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,230
In particular,

88
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,970
the US installed a THAAD system

89
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,650
in South Korea a few months ago.

90
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,960
That was designed to defend against

91
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,570
attacks launched by North Korea.

92
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,610
But the stakes were raised earlier in July.

93
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,180
That’s when North Korea tested

94
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,410
an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

95
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,920
that could hit Alaska.

96
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,400
So maybe China sent its spy ship

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,180
to observe whether THAAD would be successful

98
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,530
if it had to deal with any future missiles

99
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,650
from North Korea.

100
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,460
“‘Big boom’ is the result.”

101
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,530
That’s CNN-speak for “very successful.”

102
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,230
So clearly, the THAAD system in Alaska

103
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,450
is working well.

104
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,850
Or as CNN might say,

105
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,850
“it’s booming well.”

106
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,960
But that’s not necessarily good news

107
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,300
from the Chinese Communist Party’s perspective.

108
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,890
They’re upset about the similar THAAD system

109
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,940
the US installed in South Korea.

110
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,770
It’s not that the Chinese regime

111
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,640
wants South Korea to be destroyed

112
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,400
by North Korean missile strikes.

113
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
It’s that an American missile defense system

114
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
stationed in South Korea

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,750
could also be used against China,

116
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,450
should the Chinese regime ever decide

117
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,120
that it wants to take its growing military
technology

118
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,050
out for a spin.

119
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,300
So a Chinese spy ship

120
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,280
off the coast of Alaska is unusual.

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,620
But it follows a lot of other unusual activity

122
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,280
recently by the Chinese military.

123
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,960
An officials told CNN that,

124
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,200
“the US had observed similar Chinese vessels

125
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,930
in recent days sailing off the coast of Guam

126
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,110
and shadowing a joint US-Australian

127
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,540
military exercise.”

128
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,340
Also, China just sent half of their aircraft
carriers

129
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,360
through Taiwan’s defense zone.

130
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,120
What's that, Shelley?

131
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,140
China only has two aircraft carriers?

132
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,800
So they sent one aircraft carrier to Taiwan.

133
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,720
China also just told Japan to get used to the fact

134
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,430
they’ll be flying bombers by.

135
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,629
Though if the Chinese Communist Party

136
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,360
really wanted to see how the latest

137
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,949
US THAAD test turned out,

138
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,400
they could have just watched CNN

139
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,079
from the comfort of their own homes.

140
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,079


141
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,079
“Big boom’ is the result.”

142
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,660
Waaaiit a minute,

143
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,699
that’s a great idea for a new reality show!

144
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,750
And when we come back,

145
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,100
how China’s real estate boom is about to
go bust.

146
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,050
A spy ship can’t see everything.

147
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,889
But you can if you go to ChinaUncensored.tv!

148
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,439
That’s where we have the full half hour
episode,

149
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,820
which includes this and other segments!

150
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,310
