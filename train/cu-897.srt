1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,120
China has launched a trade war

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,840
hoping to crush Australia.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,200
But Australia refuses to back down.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,040
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,000
The Chinese Communist Party has been\h
ramping up a trade conflict with Australia.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
It came after the Australian government called for\h
an independent investigation into the origins of\h\h

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,960
the coronavirus. And also spoke out to defend\h
Hong Kong’s autonomy and human rights in China.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,400
So the Chinese regime has put tariffs on about $20\h\h

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,840
billion dollars worth of Australian\h
exports—like wine, seafood, and coal.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,160
But instead of backing down, members of the\h
Australian government are fighting back.\h\h

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,920
That includes Senator for Tasmania, Eric Abetz.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,320
But Abetz is also controversial.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,840
He’s been accused of “racism”\h
in the Australian media.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,000
It came after three Chinese Australians were\h
testifying before a government committee, and\h\h

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,600
Senator Abetz asked them if they were willing to\h
condemn the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,440
Is condemning the dictatorship the same\h
as being racist against Chinese people?\h\h

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,480
And what implications does this have for\h
other Australians who want to go up against\h\h

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,160
the Chinese dictatorship? Senator\h
Abetz joins me now to talk about it.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,200
Thanks for joining me today.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,520
My pleasure.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,640
I know the Chinese Communist Party has been\h
launching a pretty aggressive trade war on\h\h

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,920
Australia. And to show my support I've been\h
stocking up on Vegemite. I hope that helps.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
And Australian wine I hope.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,840
Yeah. All right. So recently, let's just\h
get to the big topic. You asked Chinese\h\h

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Australians testifying in the Senate to denounce\h
the Chinese Communist Party. Why did you do that?

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,880
First of all allow me to contextualize. There\h
were three separate groups of witnesses of\h\h

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,920
Chinese ethnicity. I only asked one group whether\h
they were prepared to condemn the dictatorship,\h\h

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,160
and that was on the basis that they presented to\h
the committee as thought leaders, as academia,\h\h

29
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,360
as think tank contributors. And there had\h
been an academic writing about these matters,\h\h

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,480
one, Professor Clive Hamilton, who basically\h
said that if you ask certain people whether\h\h

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,320
they're willing to condemn the dictatorship,\h
you'll be, one, labeled a racist and secondly,\h\h

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,520
they will offer sufficient criticism to retain\h
credibility, but they will never outright condemn.\h\h

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,240
And straight out of the textbook that is\h
exactly what occurred. Might I also say,\h\h

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,520
I have received information from the Chinese\h
diaspora in Australia that they were concerned\h\h

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,120
about the interference by the Chinese Communist\h
Party within the body politic of Australia and\h\h

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,480
within the Chinese diaspora, their community\h
organizations always wanting to be in control\h\h

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,480
and manipulating things to the benefit of\h
the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship.

38
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,400
And so these people were presented as thought\h
leaders, I thought it was appropriate. Can I\h\h

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:35,280
also indicate that one of them in their submission\h
started off by saying "Australian politics is too\h\h

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,360
wise." In other words, engaging\h
in the politics of identity and\h\h

41
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,440
incomplete contradistinction to what Martin Luther\h
King had pleaded with the American people, namely\h\h

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,960
that people be judged on character, on\h
values, and beliefs and not on the color\h\h

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,000
of their skin. And it was from there that we then\h
developed a discussion about values and beliefs.\h\h

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,920
And I then asked whether or not the dictatorship\h
would be condemned by these people. Keeping in\h\h

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,280
mind this is a dictatorship that has one million\h
of its own people in a concentration camp. That\h\h

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,040
imprisons people because they house Christians,\h
because they Falun Gong practitioners, because\h\h

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,800
they support the pro-democracy movement in Hong\h
Kong. This is a brutal regime that in fact engages\h\h

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,160
in organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.\h
And it is a regime worthy of condemnation.

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,080
Well, since you knew the accusations\h
of racism were pretty much guaranteed\h\h

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
to follow and they did follow. How\h
have you been responding to that?

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,440
I've been responding on the basis of calling\h
out the oppressor on behalf of the oppressed,\h\h

52
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:05,600
is not racism. What is racism is trying to knock\h
out the Uyghurs from Xinjiang province where the\h\h

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,880
concentration camps and the other repressions\h
that the regime is undertaking, that is racism.\h\h

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,920
And look, it's easy to label somebody a racist and\h
then what I try to do is put you on the defensive.\h\h

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:29,920
My view is, do you support or are you willing\h
to condemn this brutal dictatorship? And each\h\h

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,000
and every time I simply say "I stand with the\h
oppressed." With the Uyghurs. With the house\h\h

57
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
Christians. With the Falun Gong practitioners.\h
With the pro-democracy movement. And I'm sure\h\h

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,520
none of those people would label me a\h
racist for condemning that dictatorship.

59
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,560
So, should all Australians denounce\h
the Chinese Communist Party?

60
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,720
Look, it's more for, I think thought\h
leaders to work consider whether or not\h\h

61
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,560
they should engage in condemnation. My view is\h
that they should because on any humanitarian\h\h

62
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:18,080
or other criteria the dictatorship needs to be\h
condemned. And we cannot in a civilized world\h\h

63
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,200
seek to turn a blind eye to such an\h
ugly repressive regime. The values\h\h

64
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:33,200
of the dictatorship are in complete contrast\h
to those values that we hold in Australia\h\h

65
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,720
and in the United States for that matter, amongst\h
the freedom loving countries of the world,\h\h

66
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,920
we have to take a stand. And if we don't, we\h
do a great disservice to all those people that\h\h

67
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,440
are currently in concentration camps and prisons\h
in the Chinese, under the Chinese dictatorship.\h\h

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,800
So yes, we should be condemning the regime,\h
calling them out and bringing them to account.

69
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,520
All right, let's go to the big picture right now.\h
So the Chinese Communist Party has been secretly\h\h

70
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
infiltrating Australia for years. When\h
did you first become aware of the problem?

71
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:19,040
That'd be a good question for me to think\h
about. A number of years ago, I became concerned\h\h

72
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:28,400
about the Chinese Communist Party dictatorships\h
infiltration into Australia. And I was one of\h\h

73
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:36,960
those I confessed the thought that mainland of\h
China would go the same way as Taiwan, namely\h\h

74
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,320
Taiwan started off as a military dictatorship\h
under Chiang Kai-shek and then slowly but surely\h\h

75
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:51,600
evolved with Western support into now a fully\h
fledged functional democracy. There were very\h\h

76
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:58,800
good signs of that as China was beginning to open\h
up, but under the current presidency Xi Jinping,\h\h

77
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:07,200
he has taken the road of liberalization backwards,\h
become more repressive and more dictatorial,\h\h

78
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:15,680
he's made himself president for life. He's at the\h
latest national Congress when they have the motion\h\h

79
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:24,800
about the unification of China, the word peaceful\h
reunification of China that was removed from the\h\h

80
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,480
motion. So these are the subtle changes\h
where you've got Xi Jinping saying that\h\h

81
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Marx was the greatest thought leader ever, and\h
that he's wanted to style himself on the basis\h\h

82
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,960
of Joseph Stalin, the most\h
heinous of the Soviet dictators.

83
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,040
So when you've got all those things coming\h
out the recent years, they had to come a time\h\h

84
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,920
where I had to come to the conclusion, alright,\h
the liberalization that we were all hoping for\h\h

85
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,560
is not happening. In fact, it is regressing\h
and we have to take a stronger stand\h\h

86
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,120
against this dictatorship. So a few years ago,\h
I became quite concerned just as an aside under\h\h

87
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,520
former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull\h
and his foreign minister, Julie Bishop,\h\h

88
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,040
they were proposing an extradition treaty with\h
China and I got up in the party room and I did\h\h

89
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,920
not make myself popular at the time. I opposed\h
the extradition treaty on the basis that there was\h\h

90
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,200
no equivalents, even at that time between the\h
Chinese legal system and the Australian legal\h\h

91
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,320
system. And therefore I oppose the expedition\h
treaty. I was vilified for the time today,\h\h

92
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,920
not a single person would be promoting an\h
extradition treaty with China. And I think\h\h

93
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,480
that is how the consciousness within Australia has\h
changed. But those of us that were at the vanguard\h\h

94
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,240
of calling it out were vilified at the time. But I\h
think we have now been justified in our warnings.

95
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, as you say, things have really\h
turned around in Australia, as far as\h\h

96
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,920
viewing the Chinese Communist Party as a threat,\h
there were the foreign interference laws,\h\h

97
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,360
open discussion of the crimes of the\h
communist party, a call to investigate\h\h

98
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,920
the origin of the coronavirus. How has\h
the Chinese Communist Party responded?

99
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:30,240
Well the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship\h
has responded to us in a fairly aggressive\h\h

100
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,760
and a robust way. I would call it an ugly\h
way. Some of the commentary referring to\h\h

101
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,720
Australia as being a bit of a nuisance\h
like chewing gum on the sole of your shoe,\h\h

102
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,240
making all sorts of commentary along\h
those lines. And then in practical terms,\h\h

103
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,480
imposing a tariff on our barley, claiming\h
that our premium wines are being dumped\h\h

104
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,760
then our forestry products being stopped at the\h
border, rock lobster being left on the tarmac to\h\h

105
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,760
die and as a result not be saleable,\h
and so the consequences go on.

106
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Norway has suffered similar issues when\h
it sort of support a dissident artist\h\h

107
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,240
from China and I understand the Czech Republic has\h
suffered similarly, Canada has suffered similarly.\h\h

108
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,360
And what this belligerent dictatorship seeks\h
to do is intimidate. And that is why in recent\h\h

109
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
times, I've called for all the freedom loving\h
countries of the world to come together and say\h\h

110
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,640
enough is enough Chinese dictatorship we will\h
not allow you to try to pick us off one by one,\h\h

111
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,880
but the freedom loving countries will stand\h
united in solidarity with each other. And I think\h\h

112
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,600
if we can do that, we will be successful\h
in bringing the dictatorship back into\h\h

113
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,200
the realms of some sort of decency and\h
being a good, decent international player.

114
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,520
So do you think the general population in\h
Australia know the extent of the China problem?

115
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,200
I think most Australians are instinctively\h
concerned. I don't think they're fully aware of\h\h

116
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,960
the extent. And I must say I was surprised when\h
the organization of which I'm a member AIPAC,\h\h

117
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,320
the International Parliamentary Alliance on China\h
helped reveal the list of all the names of people\h\h

118
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:42,720
that have been infiltrating companies, consoles,\h
embassies et cetera, of a whole lot of countries\h\h

119
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,400
around the world. That the extent of the operation\h
is very, very concerning. But each and every time\h\h

120
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:57,360
the Chinese dictatorship becomes more belligerent.\h
They're just sending some Navy ships down within\h\h

121
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,280
200 nautical miles of the Australian coastline.\h
Those sorts of things tell the Australian people\h\h

122
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:12,000
that the Chinese dictatorship, no matter what\h
they are clearly not friends of Australia,\h\h

123
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,600
but even more importantly are not friends of\h
the freedom loving countries of the world.

124
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,960
Do you think the Corona virus changed things?

125
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,400
I think the Corona virus issue changed things on a\h
number of fronts. One, Australia's calling for an\h\h

126
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,040
international investigation. So the of\h
the dictatorship focused on Australia,\h\h

127
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,120
and then they've come out with all the quite\h
bizarre assertions. One it started in Italy,\h\h

128
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,120
then it started in the United States, then\h
it came into China via Australian beef,\h\h

129
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,000
yet every day, there's a new story.\h
And the idea that it doesn't match with\h\h

130
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,880
other stories is of no consequence,\h
because if you don't have a free press,\h\h

131
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,520
your president and other people aren't\h
going to be questioned about these things.

132
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,560
The other thing that I think concerns a lot\h
of Australians and in the people right around\h\h

133
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,360
the world is how the dictatorship was able\h
to initially manipulate the world health\h\h

134
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,680
organization and Dr. Tedros to put out the\h
Shanghai Beijing propaganda in relation to\h\h

135
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:32,560
the coronavirus. And first of all, we were\h
told it was not communicable between people,\h\h

136
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,440
that it was racists that closed down borders.\h
And now you ask where on earth did all this\h\h

137
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,800
misinformation come from, its all traceable back\h
to the Chinese dictatorship they were in denial\h\h

138
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,880
and because of the denial and the propaganda\h
being swallowed by the world health organization,\h\h

139
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,120
we now have a crisis around the world\h
a lot, lot worse than it need be. And I\h\h

140
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,040
think that has opened the eyes of many people\h
within Australia, but all around the world\h\h

141
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,840
to the sort of behaviors and manipulations\h
that the Chinese dictatorship engage in.

142
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,600
Now I know there's been a lot of pushback from\h
the Australian business community about the\h\h

143
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,680
economic damage of going toe to toe with\h
the Chinese regime. Why do you think that\h\h

144
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
is? And do you think it will\h
be enough to stop the momentum?

145
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,960
Look, money talks and some people\h
are more concerned about the dollars.\h\h

146
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm very pleased that the Australian\h
prime minister, Scott Morrison\h\h

147
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,960
continually talks about Australian values and\h
beliefs, and that our ethics are not for sale.\h\h

148
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,760
And so if, because we stand for human rights,\h
those we are willing to condemn, 1 million\h\h

149
00:15:51,760 --> 00:16:00,000
citizens being in a concentration camp because we\h
want a full international investigation of COVID.\h\h

150
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,040
If that has economic consequences for us as a\h
payback, then that is a matter of great regret.\h\h

151
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,000
But I think the Australian people are up to it.\h
And I detect that other countries in the world\h\h

152
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,920
will say, well, if they don't want your wine,\h
we'll buy it. I know India is very interested in\h\h

153
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,920
our coal and let's be very clear what the Chinese\h
dictatorship is doing with these trade barriers\h\h

154
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,920
against Australian products at the moment, they\h
are cutting off the nose to spite the face,\h\h

155
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,560
because the only basis on which countries\h
trade with each other is for mutual benefit.

156
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,280
So the Chinese buy our products because of\h
the quality of the product, reliability of\h\h

157
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,400
supply and the affordability. It's not to do us a\h
favor that's for those three reasons. So if they\h\h

158
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,920
all of a sudden stop seeking our products, they\h
are denying their own population, the benefit\h\h

159
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:10,000
of high quality, reliable supply and affordable\h
prices. And so this is what a dictatorship does,\h\h

160
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,160
becomes belligerent and is willing\h
to do things that punish others\h\h

161
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,200
whilst also punishing their own population.\h
So this is a game that they're playing, which\h\h

162
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,840
ultimately will test the resolve of the Australian\h
people and the Australian government. But I trust\h\h

163
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,840
we are up to it because there are certain values\h
and principles that simply are not for sale.

164
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
Now, if the United States were to no longer\h\h

165
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,600
take a hard line on China, do you\h
think Australia could go it alone?

166
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,440
If the freedom loving countries of the world\h
were to desert Australia and United States\h\h

167
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,040
clearly would be a major player in that,\h
that would be a matter of great concern,\h\h

168
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:04,800
but I cannot see that occurring under president\h
Biden or president Trump. say will be president\h\h

169
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:12,560
Biden, I don't want to get into that debate but\h
irrespective of the party or the person that might\h\h

170
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:19,840
be leading the United States, the friendship and\h
the unity between our two countries has always\h\h

171
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,520
been exceptionally strong. And might I add, from\h
the Australian perspective, that has been the case\h\h

172
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,520
irrespective of it being a labor government,\h
or as we currently have a liberal government.

173
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,160
And what do you think the other democratic\h
countries of the world can learn from the\h\h

174
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
situation Australia has found itself\h
in with the Chinese Communist Party.

175
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,600
What it shows is that if you take a principled\h
stand, the Chinese dictatorship will seek to\h\h

176
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,240
punish you. And that's a test of resolve. And\h
therefore, if you are a freedom loving country\h\h

177
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,960
of the world, that's not currently being punished\h
by China, then you should stand in solidarity\h\h

178
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,080
because at the end of the day, China cannot punish\h
each and every one of the freedom loving countries\h\h

179
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,400
of the world. But what it does show is that\h
there are consequences from this dictatorship\h\h

180
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,120
if you take a principled ethical stand.\h
What it also shows is how unprincipled\h\h

181
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:31,200
and how unethical the communist dictatorship\h
in China is. And basically if you let Australia\h\h

182
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,080
loose and cut us loose, guess what you'll\h
be next. And that is why it makes good sense\h\h

183
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,600
for every single country that believes in\h
freedoms, that believes in human rights,\h\h

184
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,760
that believes in the rule of law to stick\h
together, to stand in solidarity and say,\h\h

185
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,800
if you pick on Australia, you're picking on\h
Norway, you're picking on the United States,\h\h

186
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,600
you're picking on New Zealand, you're\h
picking on India, you're picking on Japan.\h\h

187
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,240
And if that's the case, then clearly China will\h
need to back off. And that is my hope and prayer.

188
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,760
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.\h
I can't wait till I can go back to Australia.

189
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,040
A pleasure, and it would be a\h
delight to welcome you to Australia.

190
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,560
Thank you, take care.

191
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,200
Great. Thank you.

192
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,160
And thank you for watching. And thanks heaps\h
to all the Aussies out there for sticking it\h\h

193
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,720
out as your government faces blowback from\h
standing up to the Chinese Communist Party.

194
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
