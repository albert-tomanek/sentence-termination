1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,340
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,560
Joining me in the studio today:
he reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,640
Hellooo.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,340
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,260
Salutem.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,900
And the bounciest man on the internet — Matt Gray!

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,760
It's not a studio, it's a kitchen diner.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,900
I'm choosing to quietly ignore that.

9
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,860
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia,
and these guys can't see it.

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,420
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,180
and there's a special prize for
particularly good answers, which is:

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,780
Today's article is: Lisa Clayton.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,840
She's from somewhere that makes bricks.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,740
Ooh. Why do you say that?

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,780
ALL: Clayton.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,060
TOM: Ohh, right.

17
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,360
Erm, Birmingham actually.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,780
GARY: Yep.
MATT: Yup.

19
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,660
[Laughter]

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,660
Okay, so someone from Birmingham.
What is this, f***ing Crime Watch?

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,320
CHRIS: 'Have you seen Lisa Clayton?'

22
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,980
'Have you seen her? Do you know her?'

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,200
Well, here's the thing: Lisa Clayton,
you wouldn't have seen her for quite a while...

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,160
For 285 days.

25
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,440
Because she was invisible?

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,060
[Laughter]
Briefly.

27
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,020
That's not briefly!

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,700
You'd cause bedlam with 285 days of invisibility.

29
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,900
It's brief on the universal scale!

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,480
Oh, yes, yes.

31
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,840
So 285 days of being invisible.

32
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,420
Er, of not being seen by the world.

33
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,460
Hibernation.

34
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,540
In a cupboard.

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,320
World Hide and Seek champion.

36
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,440
[Laughter]

37
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,840
I'd go with that one.

38
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,520
Er, not quite. She did certainly go away for a while.

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,260
Arctic wanderer.

40
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,020
Ooh, explorer certainly.
I will give you a point for that. [DING]

41
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,200
Explorer in the sense of going places
rather than the sense of discovering places.

42
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,400
Did she go to Wolverhampton?

43
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,300
That's still not been discovered!

44
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
The mystical city of...

45
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,200
ALL: Wolverhampton!

46
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,120
MATT: Eugh.

47
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,580
The one thing I do know about Wolverhampton,
they've got battered chips.

48
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,760
TOM and MATT: Oooh.
GARY: Eh?

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,040
Two very different reactions there. I went,
[Doubtful]  'Oooh...'

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,840
Matt went, 'Yep, yep, I'll have that.'

51
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,460
Yeah... I'm with Matt on this.

52
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,860
See, it would involve going to Wolverhampton to get it,

53
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,460
but what I can do is try it at home.

54
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,300
The other thing is, I think you'd only need three.

55
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,680
I think after three, I'd have had enough.

56
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,420
Have you ever had a battered chocolate bar?

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,240
ALL: No.

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,220
I once tried that, but I didn't work out you had to put batter in it. So I just dropped a Rocky into a pot of oil.

59
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,260
CHRIS: Fwoomf! 'Awww.'

60
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,920
There's a chippie round the back of the Nestlé factory,
and I had a battered Yorkie.

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,120
Oh... Yeah... No.

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,280
TOM: Ohh, that's a dense...

63
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,260
One bite was enough.

64
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,320
Because it is just hot dripping chocolate,
hot dripping oil, and... [Gags]

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,200
It's just a weapon, isn't it, basically.

66
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,460
We're back to our chocolate rods from God...

67
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,620
GARY: We are.
MATT and TOM: Yeah.

68
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,600
That's how you get the casing on
to get it through the atmosphere.

69
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,420
GARY: I was going to say that that's a hand grenade.

70
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,000
I was once in the US, and someone
ordered deep-fried cheesecake.

71
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,040
Ooo.

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
GARY: How does that work?

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,820
You get a slab of cheesecake,
you batter it, and you deep fry it.

74
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,640
And then you add like, raspberry sauce on it.

75
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,520
I had one bite, and was like:
That's lovely, and that is now enough.

76
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,740
[Laughter]

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,320
I did have some cake the other day,

78
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,860
where somebody, rather than creating icing,
had just rendered down entire Mars bars.

79
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,680
ALL: Ohhh...

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,340
So every element of the Mars bar then re-set into...

81
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,700
TOM: I can't get behind that.

82
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,640
When I was... Quite a while ago,
when I had a house in York.

83
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,660
The woman was a bit dicky but I wanted
to make a cake, right, to take to work..

84
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,160
So I made cake one...
Didn't really rise, door not shutting properly.

85
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Now what I should have done is said,
F*** it, I'm going to Tesco.

86
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,820
But damn it, I'd started, I was going to do this.

87
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,200
So I tried again — that one, also flat.
Tried again, that one also flat.

88
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,200
Oh God, I know where this is going.

89
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,940
Third one burnt down, fell over,
and then sank into the swamp.

90
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,860
[Laughter]
'But the last one stood up!'

91
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,040
So I put...

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,940
At this point something happened
in my brain that wasn't normal sense.

93
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,440
I thought: stack them all together,
put jam and cream in between,

94
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,260
And then I melted over the top an entire Yorkie.

95
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,280
TOM: [Groans]

96
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,760
In fact, three entire Yorkies,
I think it was, I put over the top of it.

97
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,460
You've just got a brick!
You've got...

98
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,080
You've got a prohibited weapon there!

99
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,240
I've got to say, it was almost starting
to collapse in on itself, mass-wise.

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,240
GARY: Superdense...

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,960
I nearly created a cake black hole, it turns out later on.

102
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,460
Someone said their teeth hurt after eating it.

103
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,680
TOM: Yes!

104
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,120
You've got four cakes crushed down!

105
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,320
'We're out of osmium, best use cake!'

106
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
It's diamond.

107
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,260
The middle of it was a solid diamond, and small other buns were starting to get trapped in its orbit.

108
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,220
[Laughter]

109
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,660
Just walking past a cake shop to take it to work,
and stuff's battering up against the glass.

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,080
[Whooshing noises]

111
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,900
Cake-based gravity...

112
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,360
Could...? I was gonna say "Could you do that?"
I'm pretty sure the answer is: no.

113
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,420
No!

114
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm achieving it as the years pass.

115
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,300
GARY: Yeah...!

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,620
A long time ago we were talking about Lisa Clayton.

117
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,060
GARY: Oh yeah, we were, yeah!
TOM: To give her full name...

118
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Did she go into space?

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,900
Er, no. Lisa Lyttelton, Dowager Viscountess Cobham.
As she is now known.

120
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,260
Now that's one for your exam paper, isn't it.

121
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,760
Yep. She set out September 1994,
came back June 1995.

122
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
Tried to discover America;
worked out it had already been done.

123
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,600
[Laughter]
Oh. You know what, you're very close.

124
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh f*** off.

125
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
CHRIS: And you said 285 days...
TOM: Yup.

126
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,780
Only person to walk across Canada?

127
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,520
But not seen. People'd see you in Canada.
There are people.

128
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,080
She tried to row across the Atlantic
on her own or something?

129
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,700
Close enough, I'll give you the point. [DING]

130
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,220
'Fastest Sail Around the World by a Woman,
Single-Handed Without Assistance'.

131
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,200
'First British Woman to Sail Single-Handed
and Non-Stop Around the World'.

132
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,040
Respect!

133
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,740
Well done to you! That's good work, that is. If you still...

134
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,980
And to be sat there with one of your hands
just in your pocket!

135
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
What?
Single-handed... Ohh.

136
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, just making it look good!

137
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,940
TOM: Wow...

138
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,600
That seems like an unnecessary thing to do to yourself.

139
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,420
...encumbrance, isn't it, yeah.

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
There'll be a point someone off the Cape of Good Hope,

141
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,720
You're like, 'I should really have done this
two-handed, but you know...'

142
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,320
'I did say at the start!'

143
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,940
MATT: 'An award's an award!'

144
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,180
A 38-foot yacht. Does anyone want
to take a guess what it was called,

145
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,920
given that she was sponsored by her university?

146
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,300
University of Birmingham.

147
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
The Brummie Bastard.

148
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
It's a good name for a boat.
Not quite.

149
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,120
I was hoping it was sponsored by Staffordshire University, and then she could have been Keelehauled.

150
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
ALL: AYYY!

151
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,260
Keele is a town in Staffordshire.

152
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,520
Was it
[Brummie accent] the 'Alroight'?

153
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,880
You know what, that's close enough.
It's the Spirit of Birmingham.

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,780
I was going to say, HRH Lenny Henry.

155
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,300
GARY: [Laughing] Spirit of Birmingham...

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,160
I like the way you went with *HRH* Lenny Henry...

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
something I'd like to see —
rather than HMS.

158
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,740
[Laughter]

159
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,320
Me too.

160
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,160
31,000-mile journey, single-handed,
round the world, in a yacht...

161
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,940
Some of the difficulties she'd have had on the way?

162
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,500
Crying. If Ellen MacArthur's anything to go by.

163
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,780
Yes, if Ellen MacArthur's anything to go by.

164
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,320
Tesco delivery not turning up.

165
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,680
To be honest, you have enough
trouble with that anywhere.

166
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,520
She's just sitting there, sailing around,
trimming the sail...

167
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,940
All of a sudden, she looks around:

168
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,220
'Sorry we missed you' —
'I'm sitting right here! How did you manage that?!'

169
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,040
'I have a hundred miles of visibility in every direction!'

170
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,940
That's because they've got a Tesco submarine.

171
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,980
I like the idea of Tesco submarine delivery...

172
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,060
because it implies there's a Walmart submarine
from a different superpower steadily hunting them.

173
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,620
And all Asda can afford is a destroyer on the surface,
hoping for the best with depth charges.

174
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,940
And there's a Carrefour flotilla coming up...

175
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,560
'We're loading in the granary torpedoes now!'

176
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,900
Eyyy!

177
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,600
Granary torpedoes: type of bread.

178
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,920
CHRIS: I enjoyed it.
TOM: He got it.

179
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,880
I got it.

180
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,160
Hardships on the way, as you're
circumnavigating round the world?

181
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,220
TOM: What might your boat do?

182
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,140
Fall over!

183
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,680
Yes. Have a point. [DING]

184
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,780
I was going to go for, more drastically: sink.

185
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,640
[Laughter]

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,620
Well, she wouldn't have made it round if it sank.

187
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,040
She might have... been able to reinflate it?

188
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,860
TOM: It's not an inflatable dinghy! It's not...

189
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,980
₤9.99 Tesco summer range inflatable dinghy.

190
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,560
Stood on one end, inflating the other end...

191
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,180
'F***in' hell!'

192
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,340
It's not the Scarborough boating lake
she's trying to circumnavigate here.

193
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,920
No, she went round that enough times
to make up 31,000 miles.

194
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,900
Yeah. Yeah.

195
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,280
Capsized seven times.

196
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,540
GARY: How?
MATT: That's all right.

197
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,580
I don't know how you right a boat
on your own when it's capsized, but...

198
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,560
MATT: Carefully.
CHRIS: Yeah.

199
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,540
Basically, you stand on the rail, and I think
there's a line that attaches to the end of the mast.

200
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,580
I mean, this is the principle for dinghies,
I don't know about a 38-foot yacht.

201
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,100
TOM: Oh, okay. Yeah.

202
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
But basically you haul on that end of it...

203
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,220
Wow. And then you go back in the water as it...

204
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
MATT: And hope it doesn't keep going.
TOM: Yeah.

205
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,860
Yeah. That's the principle with smaller vessels.

206
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't know if her weight's enough to do it,
or whether she can move ballast across in...

207
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,260
Ah, that's a point, yeah.

208
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,880
It's probably water-based ballast,
so you pump it up to the topside or something.

209
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,440
Or the side that's out of the water,
and then you lean on it...

210
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,860
I would have thought you wouldn't go all the way
around the world with a boat you couldn't right.

211
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,340
Because it's capsized, then you've got 'turtle' which
is when the mast's downwards, and then you just...

212
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
GARY: That's it, she's had it.
CHRIS: You go home.

213
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,280
CHRIS: On the other hand, did you see this thing,
it was earlier in the year...

214
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,960
You know there are now these carbon trimarans
with solid carbon sails.

215
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,220
It's just like a big vane on the back.

216
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,620
They flipped one.

217
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,860
MATT: [Gasps]
GARY: Oh, I can see that...

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,140
They nosed in.

219
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,900
Oh, is this the America's Cup?

220
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,800
The America's Cup one. Yeah.

221
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,380
TOM: That killed a man.
MATT: That killed them. Yeah.

222
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
Because the new ones are essentially hydrofoils,
floating above for most of the journey.

223
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,540
CHRIS: Yeah.

224
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,380
Fifty miles an hour, carbon fibre...

225
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,560
Nosed in, flipped it — mast down.

226
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,440
GARY: Yikes.

227
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,240
So the America's Cup works by the winner of the
previous America's Cup sets the rules for the next lot.

228
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,860
Oh, is that it? Ahhh.

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
TOM: And the person who won the last one was...

230
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,280
I think it was a billionaire who runs Oracle
and all sorts of IT groups.

231
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,820
Yeah, that's it. It was Oracle.

232
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,240
So he said, all the boats — carbon fibre, high speed...

233
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,360
CHRIS: Trimaran...
TOM: Yeah.

234
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,860
Cool things. Essentially, if Batman had a sailing boat...

235
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,560
Yeah.

236
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,160
[Gravelly Batman voice]
'To the Bat-Boat!'

237
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,380
TOM: But when they crash... it's terrifying.
MATT: Everyone dies.

238
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,260
Yeah. Well, only one. Everyone else was sort of injured.

239
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,300
Oh really? I thought it was everyone.

240
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,320
No, no. They were rattled but they managed to
limp it back to port or get it towed or something.

241
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,280
God, that'd be great in other competitions,
if the winner could set the rules for next time.

242
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,400
Boxing! You can have the springy boxing gloves
that come out like that and back in.

243
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,440
And until you beat me using that methodology,
I'm not interested.

244
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,860
We need to get Elon Musk to win tennis.

245
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,760
'Yep. You have to do it in space.'

246
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
You mentioned Dame Ellen MacArthur, by the way...

247
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,080
GARY: Yeah.
MATT: Oh yeah.

248
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,320
And it's quite interesting to note the difference between her and Lisa Clayton...

249
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,120
Obviously, Ellen MacArthur —
knighthood for breaking the record...

250
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,800
Lisa Clayton has essentially slipped into obscurity.

251
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,340
Well, not anymore!

252
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,300
TOM: [Laughs]

253
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,520
All eight of you watching, please spread the word!

254
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
At the end of the show, congratulations Matt,
you're this week's winner!

255
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,540
Yeeeeeeeeees!

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,820
That went on for much longer than I expected it to!

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,420
But slightly less long than I was expecting.

258
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,420
Yeah. Yeah.

259
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,880
You win a British Prime Minister's feeding trough
that tells kids to be wary of people they don't know.

260
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,540
It's John Major's Stranger Danger Manger.

261
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,640
Heyyy!

262
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,280
Enjoy that —

263
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,520
I've got a use for one of them, actually.

264
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,340
In the meantime —
I don't want to know why.

265
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,000
TOM: That's been Chris Joel.
CHRIS: Godspeed.

266
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
TOM: That's been Gary Brannan...
GARY: Godspeed.

267
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,640
TOM: That's been Matt Gray...
MATT: Bye bye.

268
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,280
I've been Tom Scott, and we'll see you next time.

269
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,940
Is this something like Fish Slapping Dance?

270
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,540
ALL: Ohh!

271
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,340
With a side o' bacon...

272
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,620
Bacon beating!

273
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000
Brannan, if you'd care to mime with me...

274
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,920
GARY: Go on.

275
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,700
Comme ça?

276
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,900
Bradford Crane, which —

277
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,120
Bradford! [Laughs]

278
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,760
Bradford Crane.

279
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,820
'Hello? Bradford Cranes?'

280
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,360
'Er, yeah, we got a 9-tonne, a 14-tonne,
and er, Maurice Micklewhite...'
