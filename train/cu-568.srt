1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,860
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,379
it’s not legal.

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,279
It’s extralegal!

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,000
Which in this case should be extra-illegal!

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,060
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,460
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,730
China’s Game of Thrones.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,409
Like the actual Game of Thrones,

9
00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:23,550
it seems like we’ve been waiting for the
final chapter forever.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,199
But at least there’s been another interesting
plot twist.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,889
And it has to do with the shadowy 610 Office:

12
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,700
China’s gestapo.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,320
It was named after the date it was created,

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,170
because calling it the “Central Leading
Group

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,030
to Kidnap and Torture People for Gathering
in Parks”

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,030
sounds good,

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,780
but wouldn't fit on the business cards.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,780
Former Chinese leader

19
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,230
and moldy toad in the hole, Jiang Zemin

20
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,230
created it as a way

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,929
to cement his power

22
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,899
and get rid of the biggest threat to China:

23
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,519
People... sitting with their eyes closed.

24
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,800
You see,

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,690
Jiang was facing a problem.

26
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,969
He hated Falun Gong,

27
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,949
but China has laws.

28
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,429
At least on paper.

29
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,000
Like that stupid constitution

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,960
that guarantees people the right to freedom
of assembly

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,799
and religion.

32
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,960
It's true that laws in China

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,869
are often selectively enforced.

34
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,560
But if you arrest huge numbers of innocent
people

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,000
and torture them in labor camps,

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,670
some of them might still try to take you to
court.

37
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,280
So Jiang created the 610 Office handle this
problem

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,329
outside the pesky law.

39
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,420
Instead of being within the Chinese government,

40
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,110
the 610 Office and its secret police force

41
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,530
all reported directly to him.

42
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,600
Problem solved.

43
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,100
Also,

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,740
controlling a multi-billion-dollar

45
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,260
nationwide paramilitary force

46
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,329
is good for hanging on to power in general.

47
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:44,420
In fact,

48
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,579
that's one of the top tips in Chairman Mao's

49
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,700
Little Red Book, Volume 2:

50
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,899
Leadership Tips for Dictators and Other Megalomaniacs.

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,140
It's a lesser known work.

52
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,280
The 610 Office was in charge of anti-Falun
Gong propaganda,

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,451
as well as monitoring, punishing, "reeducating"
and

54
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:02,860
"transforming" Falun Gong practitioners.

55
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Over the years,

56
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,899
the 610 Office expanded from "handling" Falun
Gong issues

57
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,660
to also dealing with people who believed in
other

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,330
"unapproved" spiritual practices,

59
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,160
like house church Christians and Buddhists.

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,390
And sometimes people who were on the Party's
blacklist

61
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,000
for other reasons.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,300
Remember blind Chinese human rights lawyer
Chen Guangcheng,

63
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,580
who dramatically escaped house arrest in 2012

64
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,890
and made it to the US Embassy?

65
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,020
The 610 Office was the one that put him under
house arrest

66
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,490
and continually harassed his family.

67
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,300
But now it's 2016,

68
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,280
and there’s a new sheriff in town!

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,660
And he don’t cotton to...

70
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,410
organizations that don’t answer directly
to him.

71
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,850
That’s why recently,

72
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,330
Xi Jinping’s investigators have put the
610 Office

73
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,330
in the crosshairs.

74
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,080
Couldn’t have happened to nicer people.

75
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,870
So what are the investigators saying about

76
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,950
the 610 Office now?

77
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,810
In no uncertain terms,

78
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,050
they’re accusing the 610 Office of

79
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,980
“a disparity in comprehensively studying
and implementing

80
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,150
the spirit of the rule of law.”

81
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,150
Boom!

82
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,220
…I have no idea what that means.

83
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,510
Let me check my trusty Communist Party Newspeak
Translator.

84
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,400
Accusing them of “illegal behavior”

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,420
is actually a way bigger deal than it sounds,

86
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,630
given how cloak-and-dagger the Communist Party’s

87
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,240
high level power struggles are.

88
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
There was once a time

89
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,000
when the name “610 Office”

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,790
could not even be uttered in public.

91
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,280
Those who did met with brutal retribution.

92
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,910
Chinese rights activist Gao Zhisheng

93
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,690
wrote this about the 610 Office:

94
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,510
“The immoral acts that shocked my soul the
most

95
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,280
were the lewd yet routine practice

96
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,870
of attacking women's genitals by 610 Office
staff

97
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,020
and the police.

98
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,120
Almost every woman’s genitals and breasts

99
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,860
or every man’s genitals

100
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,340
have been sexually assaulted during the persecution

101
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,230
in a most vulgar fashion.”

102
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,230
What do you get for naming

103
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,380
the most brutal and secretive organization
in China?

104
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,500
Long term imprisonment and torture.

105
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,940
They really do like that torture thing.

106
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,220
But over the past several years,

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,780
Xi Jinping has been scraping away at the 610
Office.

108
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,269
It’s tied to his so-called anti-corruption
campaign,

109
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,909
which really has more to do with systematically
purging the Communist Party

110
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:27,560
of people with ties to Jiang.

111
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,930
Getting rid of the 610 Office

112
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,580
is a long process that takes years of delicate
political maneuvering.

113
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,080
I mean,

114
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
this is the Grand Inquisitor in charge of
the purge.

115
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,090
Just look at the depths of sadness

116
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,160
in this man’s soul.

117
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,960
Here’s how it’s gone so far.

118
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,409
In 2013,

119
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,539
610 Office Director Li Dongsheng

120
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,449
was purged in a dramatic fashion.

121
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,449
Of course,

122
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,200
officially it was for something else:

123
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,560
taking bribes.

124
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,710
Think of it as the Chinese equivalent

125
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,159
of convicting Al Capone on income tax evasion—

126
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,080
if Al Capone was also the government’s vice
minister

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,590
of public security.

128
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,099
Which gives you an idea of just how corrupt

129
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:07,009
things are in China.

130
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,530
Then in July this year,

131
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,020
Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption investigators

132
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,430
formally put the entire 610 Office

133
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,810
“under investigation.”

134
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,760
And now with this month’s formal charges
of...

135
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
“illegal behavior,”

136
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,349
it’s clear that Xi is intent on completely
dismantling it.

137
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,630
So why is he dismantling the 610 Office?

138
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,550
It’s bad PR.

139
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,169
And I don’t mean Anthony-Weiner's-inability-to-stop-using-Twitter
level

140
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:34,349
bad PR.

141
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:37,680
I mean torturing-and-mass-murdering-dissidents
level

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
bad PR.

143
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,770
The 610 Office has done unspeakable things.

144
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,789
And by unspeakable,

145
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:46,389
I mean Western media with bureaus in China

146
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,090
dare not speak of them—

147
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,050
for fear of getting their visas revoked

148
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,150
and their offices in Beijing shut down.

149
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,759
Which is one of the reasons why you’ve heard

150
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,599
so little about it.

151
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,360
But now, as things start coming to light in
overseas media run by,

152
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
you know,

153
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,850
“hostile foreign forces,”

154
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,360
Xi Jinping doesn’t want to be left holding
the bag.

155
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
To be fair,

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I wouldn't want to be holding Jiang Zemin's
bag either.

157
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,980
Who knows what's in there…

158
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,900
So getting rid of the 610 Office

159
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,979
makes Xi Jinping look good.

160
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,509
And it’s also an opportunity to purge his
political enemies

161
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,669
within Jiang Zemin’s faction.

162
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,409
It’s like killing two birds with one charge
of a disparity

163
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,659
in comprehensively studying and implementing
the spirit

164
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,349
of the rule of law.

165
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,349
The question is,

166
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,759
if Xi breaks up the 610 Office,

167
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,979
what happens to the functions that the office

168
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,470
used to carry out?

169
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,479
Like imprisoning dissidents outside the law

170
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
and torturing them to death?

171
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,499
Does that stop,

172
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:44,389
or does it get taken over by other Party organs?

173
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:47,039
At this point, that's not clear.

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,689
Some China analysts think that this may be
a signal

175
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:52,729
that Xi is going to back off on the Falun
Gong issue.

176
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
But what do you think?

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,199
Is Xi Jinping truly out to reform China?

178
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,020
Or is he just a dictator trying to amass power?

179
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,840
That’s the cliffhanger we’re stuck with

180
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
until next season.

181
