1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,300
Hey Shelley,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,180
is there any particular movie character

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,439
I remind you of?

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,420
Yeah, Agent Smith.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,580
Hey Allen,

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,480
do I remind you of a famous actor?

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,740
Agent Smith.

8
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,260
Hey Matt, do I…

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,480
Agent Smith.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,660
This is ridiculous!

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,800
I look like lots of different actors.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I do!

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,630
Uhhh, Eddie Rodney Fleming in the Interview.

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,020
Johann Schmidt in Captain America.

15
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,920
Oh!

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,200
Elrond in Lord of the Rings!

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,380
Uhh, Chris.

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,579
You know what those parts

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,579
all have in common?

20
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,579
Yeah!

21
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,579
They all look like me.

22
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,850
No, that’s not…

23
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,880
You know what?

24
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,540
Forget it.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
I'm out of here.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,080
I should have taken an Uber.

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
This is the greatest day of my life.

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
Really?

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,040
Shelley?!

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,460
What are you doing here?

31
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,900
And why are you dressed like that?

32
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,360
I look like Rose Tico.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Who?

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
From Star Wars.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,890
But this is Lord of the Rings!

36
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,880
It has nothing to do with Star Wars!

37
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,090
Oh, you mean the story set in a faraway past

38
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,750
where a lovable bunch of misfits

39
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,900
leads a resistance against a dark lord?

40
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,640
Wow, I never thought of it like that.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
Allen?

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Why are you dressed like Wonder Woman?

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,720
Because I look like Wonder Woman.

44
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,260
No you don’t.

45
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,579
I can see it.

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,660
It’s the beard.

47
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,740
Thanks, Shelley.

48
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,560
Nice Agent Smith costume.

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,920
I’m not Agent Smith!

50
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,240
I’m Elrond!

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,780
No, I’m pretty sure you’re Agent Smith.

52
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
I agree.

53
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,920
It’s like looking into a mirror.

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,799
No!

55
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,189
I don’t look like you!

56
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,180
I don’t!

57
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,320
Agent Smith!

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
Agent Smith!

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,680
Agent Smith!

60
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,540
Noooooooo!

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,640
Oh, it was just a dream.

62
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,380
Hey Chris, have you seen my stilettos?

63
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,080
Noooooo!

64
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,220
Oh, it was just another dream.

65
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,960
Hey Chris, it's time to go.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,420
Hey, Chris,

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,760
you know who else you look like?

68
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,620
Who?

69
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,740
Tick, from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
