1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,429
Hong Kong is freaking out over the coronavirus

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:06,890
While the Chinese economy takes damage

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,860
As the international community shuts the door
on travelers from China.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,990
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,960
The Coronavirus outbreak is really not going
well

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,690
for the Chinese Communist Party.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,680
I mean, personally I’m more concerned about
all the people,

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,940
mainly in China,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,070
who have gotten sick because the Chinese Communist
Party

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,149
tried to cover up the whole epidemic for more
than a month,

12
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,679
instead of stopping it when they had the chance.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,489
But you’ve got to feel for the Chinese regime
just a little bit.

14
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,170
I mean, Chinese leader Xi Jinping even disappeared
for a little while.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,480
That led to rumors that he was sick.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,380
Especially after people began sharing a video
of him dry coughing.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,020
There was also talk that maybe he had been
purged.

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,680
But, no such luck.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,350
He’s back—doing the usual,

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,999
like hanging out with foreign dictators.

21
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:08,390
Hong Kong has reported its first death from
the coronavirus.

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,299
“The patient was a 39-year-old man

23
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,840
who had visited Wuhan and returned to Hong
Kong on Jan. 23.”

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,810
So far, at the time of this recording,

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,840
Hong Kong had 21 confirmed cases of coronavirus
infection.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,640
Although Hong Kong isn’t particularly close
to Wuhan,

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,170
where the outbreak began,

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,370
Hong Kong does share a border with Mainland
China.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,890
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was under
pressure

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,930
to block off all visitors from Mainland China

31
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,210
once the coronavirus began to spread.

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,060
She initially refused,

33
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,130
calling it “discriminatory.”

34
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,250
Which is dumb.

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,649
But not any dumber than the real reason she
refused:

36
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,789
She doesn’t have the power.

37
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:53,329
Actions like this would be under the control
of her masters:

38
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,540
the Chinese Communist Party.

39
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,929
And so Hong Kongers did what they’ve done
since June of last year.

40
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:00,929
They protested.

41
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:05,090
“Thousands of public sector healthcare workers
in Hong Kong on Tuesday

42
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,250
went on strike for the second day in a row
to demand immediate closure

43
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,370
of the city’s border with mainland China

44
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,220
to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.”

45
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,030
But unlike any of the other protests over
the past several months,

46
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,069
this time, Carrie Lam actually caved...kind
of.

47
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,280
“The Chief Executive in Council will invoke

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,680
the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance
section 599.

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,170
We will invoke the power to put requirements

50
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,180
towards people coming from the mainland,

51
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,599
including mainland residents,

52
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,599
Hong Kong residents,

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,930
and other visitors.

54
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,150
They will have to enter into compulsory quarantine

55
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,349
for a period of fourteen days."

56
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,540
So, Lam is still not fully closing the border,

57
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,150
but there will be a mandatory quarantine

58
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,830
for anyone coming from mainland China.

59
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,860
Hong Kong has seen, shall we say,

60
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,840
not a lot of enthusiasm for the Chinese Communist
Party

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,020
and its influence in Hong Kong.

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,440
The fact that the coronavirus

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
is now spreading within Hong Kong’s borders

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,269
because of a Communist Party coverup...

65
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,530
that’s not making the situation better.

66
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,379
Especially when people remember what happened

67
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,530
during the SARS outbreak back in 2003.

68
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,150
A Chinese doctor who had been treating SARS
patients

69
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,620
traveled to Hong Kong and infected more than
a dozen other people.

70
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,470
Eventually almost 300 people in Hong Kong
died from SARS.

71
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,069
That was the most anywhere outside mainland
China.

72
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,159
So people in Hong Kong are scared,

73
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,330
lining up for hours,

74
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,690
even sometimes overnight,

75
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,349
to buy items like face masks and hand sanitizer,

76
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,630
which are running low.

77
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,290
There’s even been a run on toilet paper,

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,120
sparked by internet rumors.

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,099
Especially when a higher up in the World Health
Organization

80
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,420
had this to say.

81
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,409
“So we're sitting on the edge here...

82
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:04,319
So with a lot of hard work and also a lot
of luck,

83
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,159
we may be able to get ourselves out of this.

84
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:14,349
But you know the likelihood is not in our
favour."

85
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,020
And on that optimistic note, the coronavirus

86
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,590
is spreading around the world on cruise ships
and airlines.

87
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,960
“A cruise ship in Japan carrying nearly
4,000 people

88
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,910
has found cases of the coronavirus.”

89
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,080
Is that better or worse than just finding
cases of Corona?

90
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,260
So far two cruise ships are being quarantined,

91
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,680
the one off the coast of Japan, and one off
the coast of Hong Kong.

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,900
Passengers are not allowed to leave their
cabins.

93
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,310
Have you seen what most cruise ship cabins
look like?

94
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,430
It’s basically solitary confinement on a
boat.

95
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,010
Obviously the international community

96
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,530
is concerned about the spread of the coronavirus.

97
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,720
Many airlines are “suspending or restricting
flights to China

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,250
and several countries, including the United
States,

99
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,280
[and] banning the entry of anyone who has
been in China

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,990
over the previous two weeks.”

101
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,449
Cathay Pacific has even asked employees to
take unpaid leave.

102
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,000
They could pass the time with a case of Corona.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,120
But the travel ban is affecting Chinese students
studying abroad.

104
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,350
In a show of support, 4,000 students in Australia

105
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,039
have signed a petition asking for a delay
to the start of university.

106
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
There are an estimated 100,000 Chinese students
studying in Australia

107
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,870
who are still abroad and currently locked
out of the country.

108
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,590
I can understand the concern of the Australian
government though.

109
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,710
University students shouldn’t have to deal
with cases of the coronavirus.

110
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,050
The worst thing university students should
have to deal with

111
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,040
are cases of Corona.

112
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,220
What’s that Shelley?

113
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,800
Okay, I’ll stop.

114
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,500
The coronavirus is also causing China’s
already sluggish economy

115
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,970
to stumble worse than a person drunk on…

116
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,100
I said I wouldn’t.

117
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,280
Some economists are warning GDP growth could
fall below 2%

118
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,570
According to CNBC,

119
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,660
“The 24 provinces, municipalities and regions

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,440
which have told businesses to cease operating
until at least February 10

121
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,699
accounted for over 80% of national GDP and
90% of exports last year.”

122
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,919
Chinese stocks are also plummeting to the
lowest level

123
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,480
since that stock market crisis in 2015.

124
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,889
But don’t worry, Chinese state-run media
are saying that

125
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,419
GDP will definitely not fall below 5%.

126
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,819
Which means that it won’t.

127
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,509
As long as you believe the official numbers.

128
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,900
The outbreak is also hitting Western companies
operating in China.

129
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,710
Tesla stocks took a hit after Tesla announced

130
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,229
it would not be delivering a scheduled shipment
of cars

131
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,030
because of the coronavirus.

132
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,280
So, to no one’s surprise,

133
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,690
Tesla over promised and under delivered.

134
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,050
Of course, American companies

135
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,819
that have already become less reliant on China

136
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,800
because of the US China Trade War

137
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,150
won’t be as affected.

138
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,870
So, as I’ve been saying for years,

139
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,560
you’re better off not doing business in
China.

140
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,470
And that’s it for this update on the coronavirus.

141
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,560
And as you may have heard me mention,

142
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,139
an inside source at YouTube has said that
YouTube

143
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,280
is targeting coronavirus coverage

144
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,580
as “too controversial for advertisers.”

145
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,280
All our episodes about the coronavirus have
been demonetized—

146
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,210
either temporarily or permanently.

147
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,010
It’s not that we’re trying to profit off
the misery of others,

148
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,379
but this is a form of censorship.

149
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,669
If a news show can’t generate income while
reporting the news,

150
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,590
it can’t survive.

151
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,270
YouTube would have shut down China Uncensored
years ago like this.

152
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,560
But fortunately, we have the support of viewers
like you,

153
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,039
who I call the China Uncensored 50 cent army.

154
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,349
Through your contributions on the crowd funding
website Patreon,

155
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,979
China Uncensored has survived to today,

156
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,600
so we can let you know about important China
issues that affect you,

157
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,830
like a deadly global pandemic.

158
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,580
So as a thank you to supporters,

159
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,010
I answer a question from them at the end of
some of my episodes.

160
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,410
Today’s question comes from Nightshade010101

161
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,169
“Have you guys considered posting your videos
to a different site?”

162
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,389
Good question.

163
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,750
Some folks have suggested that the way to
deal with YouTube censorship

164
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,780
is to just get off YouTube.

165
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,900
I’m definitely open to the idea

166
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,090
and if those of you watching have any suggestions,

167
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,890
please let me know.

168
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,630
However, despite all YouTube’s flaws,

169
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,790
it’s still an incredible platform

170
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,370
as far as video playback quality and viewer
reach go.

171
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,170
I want to reach as many people as possible
with China Uncensored,

172
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,280
and I’m not sure I could do that on another
site.

173
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,700
But I could be wrong, so let me know.
