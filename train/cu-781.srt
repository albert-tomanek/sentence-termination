1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,000
Brexit.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Some people love it.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,260
Others hate it.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,400
Others voted for it,

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,160
but now they regrexit.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,140
And China is happy to just let the chaos reign.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,460
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,760
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,010
In 2016, British citizens voted

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,160
whether to remain in the European Union,

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,720
or to exit.

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,970
British exit.

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,080
Brexit.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,610
By less than 4 percentage points,

15
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,660
Brits chose to Brexit.

16
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,270
It came as a surprise—

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,720
including to some people who voted for it.

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,950
It seems like big surprises

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,870
were a trend in politics that year.

20
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,390
But the unexpected outcome

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,290
forced the Prime Minister to resign.

22
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,250
And the new Prime Minister has had a hard
time

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,420
figuring out how to actually make Brexit happen,

24
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,040
because her proposals keep getting rejected.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,480
But you know who loves all the chaos?

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,509
“Upset the established order,

27
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,509
and everything becomes chaos.

28
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,509
I’m an agent of chaos.”

29
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,549
I was going to say the Chinese Communist Party

30
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,590
loves the chaos.

31
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,710
But close enough.

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,939
Anyway, my favorite Chinese state-run media

33
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,880
the global times wants you to know that

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,729
the real problem isn’t whether people voted

35
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,990
for or against Brexit.

36
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,149
No, the real problem is democracy.

37
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,250
Good news, though:

38
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,310
China’s Belt and Road Initiative

39
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,009
can help Britain heal its Brexit wounds.

40
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,999
And that surprisingly transparent

41
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:34,039
Chinese state-run media article

42
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,679
helps us see exactly what the Communist Party

43
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,889
is trying to do in the wake of Brexit:

44
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,170
be the rebound relationship.

45
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,189
Ok, and also divide and conquer.

46
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,189
The European Council on Foreign Relations

47
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:49,450
seems to understand this.

48
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,249
They say “China is ready to take advantage
of

49
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:56,389
a divided Europe and weakened UK after Brexit.”

50
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:57,539
In this special issue called

51
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,369
“China and Brexit: What’s In It For Us?”

52
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,939
the analysts at the Council on Foreign Relations

53
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,649
say that “most of the losses from Brexit

54
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:06,929
will hit the European Union

55
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:09,289
or the United Kingdom, or both,

56
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,540
while China will get most of the gains.”

57
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,689
One of the ways the Chinese regime expects
to benefit

58
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:18,640
is that with Britain outside the EU,

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,370
China might be able negotiate

60
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,459
new trade deals directly with the UK.

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,430
“China is very keen to deal with EU nations
separately,

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,650
rather than as a bloc” one researcher told
CNN.

63
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,819
She says that China has the upper hand

64
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,030
in dealing with individual countries,

65
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,830
because of China’s much larger economy.

66
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,239
Europe’s trade advantage comes from acting
together.

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,930
See, the European Union,

68
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,500
as a united bloc,

69
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,860
has recently been pushing back against

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,060
the Chinese regime’s unfair practices.

71
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,290
These issues are spelled out in a rolling
document

72
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,689
called the EU’s Anti-Dumping,

73
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,969
Anti-Subsidy and Safeguard activities.

74
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:57,519
The European Union has gradually come to realize

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,590
that the vast majority of the unfair competition
facing Europe

76
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,159
comes from China.

77
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,230
For example,

78
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,420
China subsidizes steel production,

79
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,980
and then exports that steel at such low prices

80
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,230
that it shuts other competitors out of the
market.

81
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,670
This is called dumping.

82
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,739
So Europe put in anti-dumping measures.

83
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,680
And “of all the 120 anti-dumping measures
in force

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,129
at the end of 2018,”

85
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,519
the report says,

86
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,770
China was targeted with 85.

87
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,890
The next closest was Russia with just 9.

88
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,140
Which is to say,

89
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,620
China was nearly 10 times more successful

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,060
at dumping than Russia.

91
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,060
Yeah!

92
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,599
Can Putin do this?

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,819
But with Britain leaving the EU,

94
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,549
China hopes to negotiate a bilateral trade
agreement

95
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,590
directly with the UK.

96
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,590
That way,

97
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,260
it can flood the UK with the cheap Chinese
goods—

98
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,140
even when the rest of Europe rejects them.

99
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,930
Weirdly, the British government

100
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,219
does not see what’s coming.

101
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,969
Just a year after the British people

102
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,580
voted to leave the EU,

103
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,849
the British government hailed

104
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,400
a “New phase in Golden Era for UK-China
relations.”

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,120
British officials promised to “to build
a truly global Britain”

106
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,700
and that the “strong and growing” relationship
with China

107
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,790
would “deliver benefits for both countries.”

108
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,200
Promises were made.

109
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,959
And awkward photos were taken.

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,959
But...

111
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,190
“The ‘Golden Era’ of UK-China relations

112
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,110
has never materialized as it was envisioned,

113
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,760
and it probably never will.”

114
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,040
Why?

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Because “Ultimately,

116
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,670
the U.K. does not really matter much to China.”

117
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,670
Even worse,

118
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,890
“As a trade partner,

119
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,500
Britain ranks below Australia.”

120
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Britain ranks lower than Australia?!

121
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,530
But Britain practically created Australia.

122
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,290
That’s like saying Marmite

123
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,170
ranks lower than Vegemite,

124
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,350
when the truth is...

125
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,000
they’re both terrible.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,440
Ok, my analogy fell apart at the end there.

127
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
The point is,

128
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,110
most of the Chinese regime’s vows

129
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,410
to increase imports of British goods

130
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,600
were just empty promises.

131
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,970
Like when NYU promised I’d have a successful
career,

132
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,290
if only I’d pay for a three-year Masters
Degree.

133
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,190
And now I’m deeply in debt—

134
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,190
because I chose to pursue

135
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,260
my dream of hosting a YouTube show

136
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,190
with an unprofitable perspective on China.

137
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,020
What’s that, Shelley?

138
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,160
Yes, as opposed to a lucrative career

139
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,410
in classical music composition!

140
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,880
Speaking of being in debt,

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,130
Chinese leaders have been further

142
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,100
trying to divide and conquer Europe

143
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,880
by going after the most delicious country
in the region:

144
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,000
Italy.

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,660
China promised to totally buy more Italian
goods.

146
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,030
And then they got Italy to be

147
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,280
the first Western European nation

148
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,950
to officially join the Belt and Road Initiative.

149
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,100
It’s going to be a win-win.

150
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,230
But only for China.

151
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,100
“So I don’t think it’s going to bring
more to Italy.

152
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,790
For China, it’s a huge win.

153
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,510
Because one it shows that a G7 country

154
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,820
is now a part of the Belt and Road Initiative,

155
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,220
which is a major political win.

156
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,850
Second it actually shows the weakening of
the US influence,

157
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,300
very clearly.

158
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,940
And third it shows a clear European fragmentation.”

159
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,190
So Italy’s move to join the Belt and Road
Initiative

160
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,440
is just another sign that the Chinese regime’s

161
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,860
divide and conquer strategy is working.

162
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,520
And later this month,

163
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,590
Chinese leaders will be visiting Croatia

164
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,780
for the annual 16+1 summit.

165
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,840
16+1 is a group of 16 Eastern European countries,

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,210
plus China.

167
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,370
And China wants to drive them away from the
European Union, too.

168
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,050
I mean, what leader of a small nation

169
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,860
that we can’t even place on a map

170
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,870
wouldn’t want to be friends with China?

171
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,340
So when it comes to the UK,

172
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,510
there may be disagreement whether

173
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,150
Brexit is good or bad for the country’s
future

174
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,870
with respect to Europe.

175
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,680
But it *is* clear that the Chinese regime

176
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,080
is taking full advantage of the opportunity.

177
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
The good news is,

178
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,660
even as the Chinese regime

179
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,010
tries to divide and conquer Europe,

180
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,610
one of its unlikeliest leaders is refusing
to surrender.

181
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,900
"We put ourselves in a situation

182
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,690
where Chinese investments have taken over

183
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,330
strategic infrastructure and network assets.

184
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,720
“The time for European naivete is over.”

185
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,530
Go get ’em, France!

186
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,470
What’s that Shelley?

187
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:30,020
France just signed a multibillion dollar deal
with China?

188
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,370
So what do you think about China leveraging
Brexit

189
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,400
to advance its strategy in Europe?

And now it’s time for me to answer

192
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,460
a question from one of you—

193
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,270
a fan who support China Uncensored

194
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,340
with a dollar or more per episode,

195
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,940
by contributing through Patreon.

196
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,680
TexDude asks,

197
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,400
“Someone told me China made debt collection
illegal—

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
is that true?

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680


200
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
What happens to a Chinese citizen

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,430
who doesn’t pay their debts?”

202
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,820
Good question, TexDude.

203
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,050
It’s not illegal to collect debt in China.

204
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,830
But sometimes it’s not that easy to collect,

205
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,060
since China’s rule of law is...not robust.

206
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,810
So Chinese people and companies use

207
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,670
*creative* methods to collect what’s owed.

208
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,220
From shaming people in front of their neighbors...

209
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,170
To using violence...

210
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,900
To even sending people infected with HIV

211
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,970
to sit in people’s homes to scare them until
they pay up.

212
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,310
And that’s not all.

213
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,690
“Over a dozen middle-aged women

214
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,730
in central China’s Henan province

215
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,530
have been sentenced up to 11 years in jail

216
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,320
for using violence and abuse to force people

217
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,090
to pay back their debts.”

218
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,760
And if you’re wondering why

219
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,750
the loan sharks hired middle-aged Chinese
women

220
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,630
instead of a few tough guys in tracksuits
named Joey,

221
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,490
clearly you haven’t met any Chinese aunties.

222
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,890
They’re the only thing I’m terrified of,

223
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,460
other than flesh-eating pandas.

224
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,560
So none of these thuggish debt collection
methods are good—

225
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,330
either for the debtor or debtee.

226
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,990
But there’s just not a very good civil court
system

227
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,250
to resolve these issues.

228
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,840
I guess that’s what happens in a country

229
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,090
ruled by the biggest thug of all:

230
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,230
The Chinese Communist Party.

231
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,490
Thanks for your question, TexDude.

232
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,000
And thank you for watching China Uncensored.

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,030
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

234
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,080
See you next time.
