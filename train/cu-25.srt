1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,250
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,709
Party on dude!

3
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:04,850
The Communist Party wants to be

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,120
the strongest party.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,420
And the Catholic Church and the Communist
Party -

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,719
They go together like peas and cyanide.

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,780
Plus, is it a Titanic sequel?

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,230
Or a Titanic mistake?

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,480
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,720
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,430
A 7.0-magnitude earthquake

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,910
hit China’s Sichuan province

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,050
Tuesday night.

15
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,110
Hundreds were injured,

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,860
and at least 20 people were killed.

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,890
Fortunately, the area hit the hardest

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,960
was a relatively unpopulated nature preserve

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,680
called Jiuzhaigou.

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,210
But it is a popular tourist destination,

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,900
so 50,000 people had to be

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,400
evacuated from the area.

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,420
But don’t worry, everyone.

24
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,620
Chinese state-run media was there

25
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,640
to cover the important news,

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,850
like reassuring the world

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,989
that the pandas are ok.

28
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,420
Oh, and the foreigners are fine, too.

29
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
You know a lot of times

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,720
we focus on the Chinese Communist Party.

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,570
But really, we should be focusing

32
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,150
on the Chinese Communist Party!

33
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,490
It’s been a wild year.

34
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,030
The 90-year anniversary of the Party’s military.

35
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,610
A big Party Congress later this year.

36
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,160
And like every really good Party,

37
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,740
there’s been lots of purging...

38
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,450
of corrupt leaders.

39
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,870
Yes this Party can’t stop,

40
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,960
won’t stop.

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,170
And now, they’ve announced a new mission:

42
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,770
“to be the strongest party in the world.”

43
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,770
Good thing this week was

44
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,200
World Baijiu Day—

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,170
where they drink the strongest alcohol in
the world.

46
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,020
Oh yes, the purging has only begun.

47
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,840
Now, when you think of the Trump administration,

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,930
you might think of tin foil.

49
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,170
And for good reason.

50
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,490
The US Department of Commerce

51
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,450
has put a levy on Chinese tin foil—

52
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,400
technically aluminum foil.

53
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,250
Apparently some Chinese foil companies

54
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,060
were getting unfair subsidies

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,880
from the Chinese government.

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,759
Which makes me realize something.

57
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,810
In China, the government really is

58
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,409
watching you all the time.

59
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,659
And if they’re supporting the tin foil industry...

60
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,749
Oh my gosh!

61
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,930
It was a government conspiracy all along!

62
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,030
Anyway, speaking of conspiracies,

63
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,030
the Grammys.

64
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,189
A secret plot to make you excited about

65
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,959
musicians you never cared about

66
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,700
in the first place.

67
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,469
Well now the Grammys want to go to China,

68
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:25,719
to do a tour showcasing

69
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,189
some of their nominated artists.

70
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,219
One small problem.

71
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,209
Some musicians think they should be allowed

72
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,819
to have opinions about China haha.

73
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,239
No.

74
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,599
Already last month,

75
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,180
China announced Justin Bieber

76
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,239
wouldn’t be allowed to perform in China

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,049
due to undisclosed “bad behavior.”

78
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,389
Which left me torn.

79
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:49,040
Which do I dislike more?

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,389
Justin Bieber or the Chinese Communist Party?

81
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,849
But it’s not just Justin Bieber that’s
banned.

82
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,299
Less-terrible musicians are affected too.

83
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,329
Like Lady Gaga,

84
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,329
Bon Jovi,

85
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:01,329
and Selena Gomez.

86
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,830
They’ve all had concerts canceled in China

87
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,459
because of things they’ve said about

88
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,309
the Dalai Lama or Tibet.

89
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,790
So the Grammys have

90
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,859
“pledged to bring only well-behaved artists

91
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,249
to meet Chinese censors’ demands.”

92
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:16,299
Remember artists:

93
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:17,450
You can say whatever you want

94
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,319
about the American government.

95
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,650
Just don’t criticize the Chinese Communist
Party.

96
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,230
On another note:

97
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,230
the Catholic Church.

98
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,040
It has no official diplomatic relationship

99
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,599
with the Chinese Communist Party.

100
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,599
But the chancellor

101
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,839
of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences

102
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,120
was in Kunming this week

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,469
attending an organ transplantation conference.

104
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:38,469
You know,

105
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,189
a conference held in a country

106
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,139
where the authorities are definitely not killing

107
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,480
political prisoners by harvesting their organs.

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,870
Now it seems that some officials in the Catholic
Church

109
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,340
are trying to build a relationship

110
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,110
with the Chinese Communist Party—

111
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,499
despite its ongoing crackdown on Christians,

112
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,510
and on religion in general.

113
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,560
Because they’re tired of the Party

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,809
picking all the bishops

115
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,489
and forcing believers to belong to

116
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,790
the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association,

117
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,700
where, you guessed it,

118
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,019
patriotism is more important than God.

119
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,559
Anyway, as part of building that relationship,

120
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,629
earlier this year,

121
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,729
the Vatican held a conference

122
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:15,719
about organ trafficking and invited China.

123
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,670
Specifically, the guy in charge of

124
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,600
China’s organ transplant system—

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,900
the system that’s murdered

126
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,090
thousands of innocent people

127
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,400
to sell their organs

128
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,810
like a Wal-Mart for body parts.

129
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,000
Which is kind of like inviting the Big Bad
Wolf

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,960
to a conference on the structural integrity

131
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,850
of pig houses.

132
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,940
The Vatican defended their decision.

133
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,780
I believe their spokesperson called it

134
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,960
an eye for an eye,

135
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,340
a liver for a liver.

136
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Speaking of bad decisions,

137
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,000
a Chinese company is building

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,150
a replica of the Titanic.

139
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,090
It’s meant to be a tourist attraction.

140
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,380
Now you might think,

141
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,410
this is a risky venture.

142
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,150
Every Titanic in history has sunk!

143
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,780
The original from 1912,

144
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,930
and the remake in 1997.

145
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,730
But to ensure that this boat will go on,

146
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,200
they’ve decided to built it in Sichuan Province,

147
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,400
600 miles from the nearest ocean.

148
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,340
At least you can stand on the bow and yell,

149
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,080
“I’m Chairman of the world!”

150
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,900
Thanks for watching.

151
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,970
Sadly, you’re still missing out.

152
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,510
This is only part of our weekly show.

153
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,250
The whole half-hour show is available now

154
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,350
if you visit China Uncensored.tv.

155
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,450
We publish our show there

156
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,660
every Friday afternoon.

157
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,949
See you there.
