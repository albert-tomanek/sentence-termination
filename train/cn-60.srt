1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,420
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,420
Joining me in the studio today: he reads books you know, it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,180
Spoken suggesters of salacious superlative are we.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,100
You got an S!

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,740
Yes!

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,700
Everybody's favorite Gary Brannan: Gary Brannan!

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,060
And now on Radio 3:
Flatulence from the Royal Albert Hall.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,520
And the bounciest man on the internet: Matt Gray!

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,100
Hello YouTube!

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,200
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,060
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING]

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,840
And there's a special prize for particularly good answers which is...

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,720
And today we are talking about Sidney Abram Weltmer.

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,620
Oooh!

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,240
If he didn't win a sporting event or invent some kind of metalworking process,

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,580
then quite frankly, I am out of here.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,780
Right, so that's two things narrowed there.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,480
Neither of those!

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,460
See, the thing is, you do the walk off and then you either have to commit to it,

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,780
or you have to do the
awkward walk back that you just did.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,060
Oh, it's always the awkward walk back.

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,840
It's the 'teacher walking to the dance floor at the school disco' walk, is how I like to call it.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,620
Yes. Yup.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
Sidney Abram Weltmer.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,800
He did invent something. I will actually give you a point. [DING]

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,380
Thank you.

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,540
He has invented something. It's not a steelworking process.

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,220
It's not even vaguely engineering. But it is a ridiculous invention.

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,900
Is it an American person?

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,260
Er... yes. Wooster, Ohio. Have a point. [DING]

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,940
Cat-powered glider.

32
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,180
I'm still going to count that as being under engineering.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,260
[Laughter]

34
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,960
I would like to *see* a cat powered glider, but...

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,540
Mraaaaow!

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,980
Cat-powered, that's — a glider, not exactly powered.

37
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,600
There's a logical fallacy in there. You can't have a powered glider.

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,380
Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.

39
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,820
Sorry. I love the fact we're all glossing over the cat part,

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,640
we're all just quibbling with 'powered glider'.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,660
For all the power that a cat is going to supply, it is a glider.

42
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,100
Despite having an ostensible power source.

43
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,840
They'll just be stood at the back, looking disinterested.

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,940
Also: always going to land the right way down.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
Sidney Abram Weltmer.

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
Was it something literary that they came up with?

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,740
No, no.

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,460
1858 – 1930.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,260
He came up with the 'Weltmer Method', otherwise known as 'Weltmerism'.

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,140
Oh. Is it... I was going to say farming, but that sounds more like religion.

51
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,680
Oh. You're closer with religion, but not that close. Certainly something...

52
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,920
Schooling.

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,460
A way of timing downhill skiing.

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,740
[Laughter]
The Weltmer Method!

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,400
— Exactly.
— Yeah.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,720
One one thousand!

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,600
[Sesame Street 'Count' voice]
Two one thousand!

58
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,100
Brick wall! Boomf!

59
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,520
Is it... the one that begins with an H, I don't remember what it's called?

60
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,440
Is it about measuring ghosts?

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,860
Oh, hololistic... holololistic...

62
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,980
Moloholololololomystic methods?

63
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,720
Harmystic legison, there?

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,560
Holololo... solo... syllogistic...

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
If anyone can actually get the words out, they'll get...

66
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,660
Holistic medicine!

67
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,520
...I'll give you a point for it.

68
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,760
No, give it to him, he thought of it.

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,420
[DING]

70
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,280
That's the one with the really diluted stuff.

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,060
Holistic medicine.

72
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,220
No, you're thinking homeop...

73
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,520
— Homeopathy.
— Oh, homeopaths.

74
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,340
It's not homeopathy.
It's something a little bit weirder than even that.

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,860
Something that you do as a programme, or in a belief sense.

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,140
You believe you're better, so you are better.

77
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,240
Ooh. I'm going to give Matt the point for that, clearly. [DING]

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,340
It's a placebo effect?

79
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,380
It's suggestions and hypnosis.

80
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,780
He called it 'magnetic healing'.

81
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,480
Ohhh! As opposed to Marvin Gaye's 'Sexual Healing'.
[Laughter]

82
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,760
So he provided classes in magnetic healing.

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,820
I don't think it actually had anything to do with magnets. I mean...

84
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,340
Well, you can have him on one point then, can't you.
[Laughter]

85
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,480
No, it was all to do with charisma.

86
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,620
Well, I think — yes, in the sense of 'magnetic personality'.

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,420
Klonk!
[Laughter]

88
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,740
Yeah. Rather than a sense of...

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,480
[Grunts]

90
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,760
My ferric shoulder, apparently.

91
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Matt Gray's ferric shoulder.

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,360
But this was 'magnetic' in the sense of charisma.

93
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,580
It was clairvoyance and hypnotic suggestion.

94
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,040
So someone schmoozes you better, effectively?

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,480
Essentially, yeah.

96
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
It's Derek ****ing Acorah, isn't it?

97
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,680
It is a little bit Derek Acorah, yeah.
Derek Acorah doesn't heal people.

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,920
Nor did this bloke.

99
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
For those of you in the 'abroads' parts of the world, Derek Acorah's professional title is

100
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,380
[Music]
' — BISCUITS! (Oh yeah!)'

101
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,240
[Laughter]

102
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,060
Erm...

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,040
Tom, just bleep the whole thing out. That's what you're going to do.

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,340
[Laughter]
Just have...

105
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,360
The technical term for Derek Acorah is this:

106
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,620
You'll get that in due course, gentlemen.

107
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,940
[Laughter]

108
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,940
Yes, that's about right.

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,360
He founded the Institute of Suggestive Therapeutics.

110
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,900
That's brilliant!

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,180
Eh? Eh? Know what I mean?

112
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,940
The Institute of Made-Up Things!

113
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,480
Yeah, essentially, yes.

114
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,780
Well, suggestion in the sense that he would suggest to you.

115
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,300
And what was he trying to cure?

116
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,280
Hysteria.

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,020
Gonna say, some kind of mental health condition.

118
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,020
Broken toes.

119
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,840
We're talking late 19th-century quackery, aren't we really?

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,500
A little bit, yeah. Tobacco addiction.

121
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,440
So he was kind of doing hypnotherapy for...

122
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,520
— That was a thing back then?
— That was...

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
Because I thought of that, but then I thought that was too far ago for people to even notice.

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,040
So effectively, people were paying to come to his office while he's sat there,

125
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,880
in his nicest suit and his most leatherbound of chairs,

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,260
and just kind of go, 'You don't really want fags, do you?'

127
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,780
— 'Stop smoking!'
— Yeah.

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,440
'You don't really fancy one now.'

129
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,180
'How are you feeling?'
'Won't like a fag.'

130
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,840
'Come back, give me a tenner next time.'

131
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,340
Yeah.

132
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,580
Suggestive, though, isn't it like:

133
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,400
'Have you tried, you know...? Not? Not being addicted?'

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
There were physical ailments in there as well.

135
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Nowadays we've got a little thing you go [puff] for, but in those days...

136
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,680
— Asthma?
— Asthma?

137
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,040
Yep. Point. [DING]

138
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,680
'Have you tried breathing properly?'

139
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,000
That's pretty much what it was.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,500
'You sound like you're breathing fine to me, I have to say.'

141
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,380
A ten-day course cost a hundred dollars,

142
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,460
which doesn't sound like much until you realize this was 1897.

143
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,420
What's that now?

144
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,580
A simple calculation is about three thousand dollars for a course there, in modern money...

145
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,840
that would tell you to cure your asthma by thinking about it.

146
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,060
Well, not bad. If someone were to pay me three grand for telling you you're fine, I can do that as well!

147
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,880
[Laughter]

148
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,540
I'd say postal order, or white fivers in non-sequential numbereds.

149
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,900
Erm... there is also a large section here on Controversy.

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
— Oh, really?
— Yes.

151
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,340
I can't believe that.

152
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,720
Some preachers and doctors were not convinced...

153
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,900
'Some preachers' — oh God.

154
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,840
...of the validity of his methods.

155
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,260
But some were cool with it, and were getting a cut as well, no doubt.

156
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,300
Was his retort, 'Have you tried thinking that you *are* fine with me doing this?'

157
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,020
Yeah!
[Laughter]

158
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,100
What did the U.S. Postmaster General do?

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,760
Punched him in the nuts.
[Laughter]

160
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,500
'Go on, pretend *this*!' Boosh!

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,520
'Hoooh!'

162
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,400
'Go on, think yourself better off that!'
'Urghhh!'

163
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,220
...as he's dry-heaving on the floor.

164
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,340
'Liar!' he cried, as he emptied letters all over him.

165
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,460
[Laughter]

166
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,900
He did cry 'Liar', I'll give you a point for that.

167
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,940
Spit take!

168
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,280
He did cry 'Liar', I'll give you a point for that [DING],

169
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,780
amidst the nut-hittery that was in there.

170
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,220
What can the Postmaster General do, though?

171
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,340
Fly.

172
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
[Laughter]

173
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,600
What *options* does the Postmaster General have?

174
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,840
— Nuclear.
— First or second class.

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,660
Ha!

176
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,160
Signed for!

177
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,300
Signed for: nut kick!

178
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,240
[Laughter]

179
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,400
'I'm not signing that!'

180
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,360
'Well, I can deliver it to next door.'
'Go ahead.'

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,160
'We tried to deliver: A NUT KICK today.'

182
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,440
'When would you like us to redeliver?'

183
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,280
'Return to sender.'

184
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,840
It's one of the few times where the mail service will be delivering *to* a package.

185
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,340
ALL: Wahey!

186
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,760
You're on form today!

187
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,680
Yaay!

188
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,580
This joke sponsored by Radio 4.

189
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,160
Postmaster General...

190
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,040
They called him a liar.

191
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,460
Yes. Called him a fraud and therefore...?

192
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,100
Er... well, took his inhaler.

193
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,280
Refused to deliver.

194
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,160
Which the Postmaster General could do.

195
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Really!

196
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,820
'I'm sorry, you're talking ****, I'm not going to deliver anything to you.'

197
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,780
— 'I'm not delivering your letters.'
— Yeah.

198
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,740
The U.S. Supreme Court eventually decided in Weltmer's favour,

199
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,220
and the Postmaster General was forced to continue delivering.

200
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,220
Himself.

201
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,240
But it went to the U.S. Supreme Court.

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,420
Royal Mail can't do that.

203
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,620
No, Royal Mail have to continue delivering.

204
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,300
What if the Queen — it is her mail service...

205
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,820
What if she decides a guy's a bit of a ****?

206
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,920
[Queen voice]  'I don't want him to get letters, he has to go to the depot.'

207
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Isn't that basically what Prince Charles does these days?

208
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,300
— What, go to the depot and fetch letters for his Mum?
— Yeah, I reckon.

209
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,820
No, sorry — meddles in things, and goes, 'No.'

210
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,880
Well, he tries to and they ignore him.

211
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,480
Yes.

212
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,800
Going down to the depot:
'She's got a bloody Amazon package again!'

213
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,480
'The entirety of Game of Thrones! She's been on her own one for sixty years!'

214
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,020
...he quips, and nobody laughs at him.

215
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,880
'The thing is, they left a card saying nobody was in!'

216
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,420
'We have over three hundred members of staff!'

217
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,920
'Who was not at the door when they knocked!'

218
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,740
'I don't believe they did!'

219
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,280
No, the delivery person got to the front gate, and there's just a guy in a hat, stood still.

220
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,760
'Could you sign...? Sorry, could you sign for this, please?'

221
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,940
'...could... could you sign...'

222
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,940
Just writes 'hand delivered' on it and sticks it in his hat.

223
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,660
Just poking out of Marge Simpson's hair.

224
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,160
— Oh ****!
— What?

225
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,260
I didn't hit Record.

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
Mail was restored. The U.S. Supreme Court decided in his favour.

227
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,580
But it did make it all the way to the Supreme Court.

228
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,340
There was also a case brought before the Supreme Court of Missouri,

229
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,160
against the Reverend M. Bishop, for libel.

230
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,540
And frankly, 'Reverend Bishop' is a pretty good name.

231
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,140
You want him to keep going up the clerical scale.

232
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,960
Because if you don't get Archbishop Bishop...

233
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
Diagonally up.

234
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
— Yeah, diagonally.
— Ha-hey!

235
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,380
Why was there a libel case against Reverend Bishop?

236
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,260
What did he call Weltmer?

237
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,540
A nobber.

238
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,740
That's — no, in U.S. law, that's opinion, and that's fine.

239
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
— Oh, okay.
— Really!

240
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,400
Yeah. U.S. libel law...

241
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,680
Hello, Acorah?

242
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,260
Yeah. No, U.S. libel law is much less strict than the U.K.'s.

243
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,180
Opinion is justified in the First Amendment.

244
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,620
In my opinion, Derek Acorah is a ****.

245
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,600
That's fine.

246
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,420
Actually, genuine exemption under U.K. libel law for vulgar abuse.

247
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,980
**** **** ****!
[Laughter]

248
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
Those are his middle names.

249
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
Ah! That's a statement of fact.

250
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,680
Oho!

251
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,380
Anyway — what did Bishop call Weltmer?

252
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,300
A ****bag.

253
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,820
Opinion.

254
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,560
A factual ****bag.

255
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,640
A liar.

256
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, I'll give you the point. [DING]
'Miserable charlatan'.

257
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,240
Oooh!

258
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,400
You see, 'a charlatan', he could take. But actually he was a fellow full of joie de vivre.

259
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,700
[Laughter]
He wasn't going to stand for that!

260
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,000
'What! I throw the very best of parties.
I just don't understand!'

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
'I'm not having "miserable"!'

262
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,520
'My magnetic personality!'

263
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,840
'I *tell* everyone I throw the very best of parties and they seem to believe me.'

264
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,540
[Laughter]

265
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,300
The Institute, though, treated a huge number of people.

266
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,420
At its height, how many people a day went through its doors,

267
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,960
paying about a hundred 1895 dollars each?

268
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,560
It's going to be a high number if you're asking us to guess it.

269
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,840
— Yeah.
— How many people a day?

270
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,380
How many people a day went through, paying...

271
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,920
Couple of hundred?

272
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,620
Twenty.

273
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,480
I was going to ballpark somewhere around Gary, so...

274
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,860
Yeah. Four hundred. [DING]
About four hundred a day,

275
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,740
paying what is now about three grand each.

276
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,740
So it wasn't just him, then?

277
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,900
It wasn't just him. Seventeen healers, a hundred stenographers and typists to process mail.

278
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,060
This was a big institute.

279
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,740
This is bull**** on an industrial scale.

280
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, it really is.

281
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,360
Just raking it in for going, 'Ah, you're fine.'

282
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,340
Yeah.

283
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,100
Right, chaps, we need to get in on this racket.

284
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,760
Whoa, whoa. Engage the time machine, we'll make a mint.

285
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,940
There is one practitioner here, J.O. Crone.

286
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,880
— 'Genuine Old Crone'.
— Yep.

287
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,880
Oh, no, it'd be G, wouldn't it. Ah, whatever.

288
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,020
You're not going to get a more late 19th-century name than 'J.O. Crone', are you really?

289
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,720
How much training did you get before...

290
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,380
None!

291
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,480
Yes, absolutely right. [DING]

292
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,100
He wrote of his first hypnosis, of a woman patient:

293
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,600
'...this was my first attempt to hypnotize a patient.'

294
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,900
Can you imagine busking, trying to get someone to be hypnotized?

295
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,240
And just viciously making it up at that point in time.

296
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,940
'So just, er, lie down... close your eyes...?
That working for you?'

297
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,160
'Yes! It is, isn't it? Oooh, you're feeling sleepy!'

298
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,620
Well, there will be placebo effect, people who want to play along...\h it may still have worked.

299
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,340
Particularly if she'd been there before a couple of times,

300
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,020
and knew the procedure. She might have walked out of there *feeling* better.

301
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,680
One of the people he hired, of course, had the Vicious Punching Method of getting people to be hypnotized.

302
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,280
'Go! To! Sleep!'

303
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,000
'Well, me asthma's gone, but me eye really aches.'
[Laughter]

304
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,540
There was also a book.
There was of course a book.

305
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,520
What do you reckon it was about?

306
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,200
'I Can Bull**** You Better.'

307
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,560
No, you see, it wasn't on the side of 'this is how to heal someone'...

308
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,600
Accounting?

309
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,960
Oh, did you do it as a correspondence course?

310
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,600
No, Matt, I'm going to give you a point again. [DING]
'How to make magnetic healing pay'.

311
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,500
He's not even making it out that it's actually useful, is he?

312
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,860
He's just about 'Me And My Money: How I Got Your Cash'.

313
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,080
'...a thorough knowledge of Magnetic Healing alone will not bring success...'

314
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,620
'...a knowledge of the business side [...] is necessary as well.'

315
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,580
It was a get-rich-quick scheme.

316
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,740
I should point out here: you can't libel the dead.

317
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,660
And he's definitely dead.

318
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,360
So I'm going to describe that as a get-rich-quick scheme.

319
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,640
As you can't libel the dead: ******.

320
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,580
Again: opinion.

321
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,160
Well, on that opinion, congratulations Matt.

322
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,300
You win this week's show, quite clearly.

323
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,640
Congratulations — you win tiny deep-fried mashed potato balls,

324
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,280
presented by an American folk hero every day for a week.

325
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
No!

326
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,020
Gno...cchi...?

327
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,420
No, go on...

328
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,000
They are Davy Crockett's dainty croquettes daily.

329
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,560
— Ughh!
— Heyy!

330
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,800
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel!

331
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,260
Matt Gray!

332
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,080
Gary Brannan!

333
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
I've been Tom Scott. We'll see you next time.

334
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,120
[Laughter]

335
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,000
All: Oooh!

336
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,840
That is my rank in the army.

337
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,380
[Laughter]
Have a point. [DING]

338
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,060
Sergeant Major — Sergeant Reckless!

339
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,460
— You get a point for...
— Yay!

340
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,080
...for successfully saying this is something or someone.

341
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,680
Right, that's the end, we can go home.

342
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
