00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,520
On this episode of China Uncensored, I've
been working on the railroad.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,660
All the livelong day.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,499
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:18,650
The United States is way behind the rest of
the world when it comes to trains.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,570
There isn't a single high-speed rail line
in the whole country.

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,340
The company XpressWest has been trying to
build a high-speed line between Los Angeles

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,690
and Las Vegas for years.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,220
It would reduce travel time from four hours
to 80 minutes.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,950
The project has been stalled because they
couldn't get a federal loan.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,620
But now they have a major investor from across
the Pacific.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,350
It's called The China Railway Group.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,649
It's the second-biggest industrial company
in the world.

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,280
Last month China Railway International USA
announced that they've signed a joint venture

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,040
with XpressWest, and that construction will
begin in September 2016.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,420
China Railway International USA is owned by
a consortium of five subsidiaries of Chinese

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,361
state-owned enterprises, which includes the
China Railway Group.

17
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,361
(can show on screen: China Railway Group , CRRC
Corp , China State Construction Engineering

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,361
Corporation and China Railway Signal & Communication
Corporation.)

19
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:14,430
The 21 Century Business Herald reported the
project will take three years and cost nearly

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,920
13 billion dollars.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,590
So where's all that money going to come from?

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,220
Uh... that's not really clear yet.

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,120
But China Railway International USA at least
promised to put up the first hundred million.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,210
And if this all works out, China and its consortium
of subsidiaries of state-owned enterprises

25
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,950
will have its foot in the door to be a part
of other high-speed rail projects.

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,770
Like that line between San Francisco and Los
Angeles that people have been talking about

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,479
for 20 years.

28
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,710
China Railway International USA recently sent
in their proposal for designing, building

29
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,940
and financing it.

30
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,920
And a related Chinese company broke ground
last month on a new factory in Massachusetts

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,960
where they will be building 284 subway cars
for the Boston transit system.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,200
But do we really want the Chinese building
American railroads?

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,080
What's that, Shelley?

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Oh.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,470
Um, yeah,sorry about that whole, Chinese Exclusion
Act thing.

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,750
Ahem.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,590
So why does America want China involved in
building its transportation this time around?

38
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,120
Like so many things, it comes down to money.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
According to this World Bank report, the cost
of building high-speed rails in China is up

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,030
to 46% lower than it is in Europe.

41
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,390
That's partly because the Chinese government
is more efficient at building straight rail

42
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,730
lines through people's neighborhoods.

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,110
And of course the cost of labor there is cheaper.

44
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,310
But that doesn't mean those factors will carry
over to the United States.

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,680
It's just that China is willing to put up
a lot of the cash and take big risks.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,490
China has the largest network of high-speed
rails in the world and plans to double its

47
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,560
size by 2020.

48
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,250
China is also in talks to build or sell high-speed
trains in more than 20 countries.

49
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,150
So how did China manage to conduct all this
high speed rail development?

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,150
Simple.

51
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,800
They stole the technology from Japan.

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,040
In fact, at least one Chinese economist has
praised China's "bandit innovators."

53
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,790
It's like when I steal my neighbor's lawnmower.

54
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,110
I'm really giving him value...

55
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,069
When I offer to mow his lawn with it at a
reasonable price…and the lawns of all the

56
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:29,909
neighbors down the street.

57
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,820
China sees railways as a way to increase its
international prestige.

58
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,800
And they do it by being cheaper than the competition--even
if their profit margins are thin at first.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,370
But Chinese railways still have image problems...
after that deadly high-speed rail crash in

60
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,200
2011 that the Chinese regime tried to cover
up.

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,310
The whole system was so corrupt that the Chinese
government eventually dissolved the entire

62
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,959
Ministry of Railways, and gave former Railways
Minister Liu Zhijun a suspended death sentence

63
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,710
for bribery and abuse of power.

64
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,799
Part of the reason the US has failed to develop
its own high-speed rails is that private investors

65
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,270
see it as a big risk, despite the boon to
the economy it would bring from having better

66
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,609
transportation, not to mention the joy of
commuters.

67
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:21,379
The costs are high and the return on investment,
questionable, if the government doesn't put

68
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,090
up enough funding.

69
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,180
The government doesn't put up funding because
of opposition on the right.

70
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,569
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California
representative, has said he would block federal

71
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,889
funding for any high-speed rail in California.

72
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,990
No word on how US lawmakers feel about having
another country funding these… boondoggles.

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,069
So what do you think about the US's lack of
high-speed rail and the idea of China filling

74
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,069
the gap?

75
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:52,379

time for more episodes of China Uncensored.

time.
