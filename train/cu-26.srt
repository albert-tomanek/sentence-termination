00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,060
I think Shelley’s been wiretapping me!

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,920
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,590
Chinese state-run media report a lot of fake news,

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,610
complete and utter fabrications

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,160
that Western media report as true.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,550
Like that China’s GDP is really strong,

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,500
when, in fact, even the guy in charge of China’s economy

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,710
said he doesn’t even believe the GDP data.

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,250
Or that China is going to stop harvesting organs

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,500
from executed prisoners.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,480
No matter how many times they say,

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,239
this time it’s for real.

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,760
While also ignoring the organs are coming

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,269
mainly from executed prisoners of conscience—

17
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,670
not even regular prisoners.

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,679
And who could forget the classic,

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,360
the Chinese government is a meritocracy.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,019
Ha ha ha.

21
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:57,730
It just happens that the most capable leaders

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,010
are the sons and daughters of the

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,359
Communist revolutionary elite.

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,309
Who just also happen to control

25
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,680
most of the businesses.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,100
But while Chinese people in the know

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,270
may secretly laugh at us in the West

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,250
for eating up their fake news as truth,

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,200
we in the West can at least laugh at Chinese media

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,940
for eating up our fake news.

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,410
I mean stories like this one from last week,

32
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,570
about how US President Donald Trump

33
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,890
has been wrapping every phone in the White House

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,590
with tin foil to stop Barack Obama

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,210
from wiretapping him.

36
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,100
Many Chinese netizens were shocked...

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,840
that state-run media did not pick up on the fact

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,620
that story was a satire piece in the New Yorker.

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,550
And this wasn’t a one-off slip.

40
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,830
In 2013,

41
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,180
state-run Xinhua and People’s Daily republished verbatim

42
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,110
a satire piece written by the same author

43
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,140
saying Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos accidentally
bought

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,710
the Washington Post.

45
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,670
Then there was the time they picked up the
Onion story

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,400
about Kim Jong-un being named Sexiest Man Alive,

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,030
and ran a 55-page photo spread about him

48
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,000
as a tribute.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,319
Or the time my favorite state-run media the
Global Times

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,349
ran this story,

51
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,209
about former would-be-president Hillary Clinton’s

52
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,530
memoirs revealing her secret bisexuality.

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,600
That story’s source?

54
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,030
The National Enquirer.

55
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,040
I hope they never discover the Weekly World
News.

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,760
No, no on second thought,

57
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,830
I hope they do.

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,840
So why does this keep happening?

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,200
Well, think about this.

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,519
In the Kafkaesque world that is China,

61
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,489
they call air pollution “fog.”

62
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:46,689
And they say ethnic minorities

63
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:50,159
enjoy unprecedented religious freedom.

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,400
And even that the capital of Tibet

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
is the happiest place in China!

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,870
It makes perfect sense!

67
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,069
The Chinese Communist Party is the

68
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,760
ultimate performance artist,

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,470
and we’ve been getting trolled all along!

70
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,079
Maybe during the National People’s Congress

71
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:08,400
at the end of this year,

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,239
Xi Jinping gets up in front of everyone and
is like,

73
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,799
“The Aristocrats!”

74
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,660
And then he and Jiang Zemin hug,

75
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,540
Andy Kaufman walks on stage,

76
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,129
and they all go to Mao’s mausoleum

77
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,840
to give him a mummy makeover.

78
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,420
But there’s probably another,

79
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,909
slightly more likely explanation.

80
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,370
In a country where the atheist Communist Party

81
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,549
actually claims it has the authority

82
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,560
to control reincarnation...

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,629
In a country where there are

84
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,090
actual internet police...

85
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,980
And in a country where former high-ranking
Party member

86
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,680
Bo Xilai actually did wiretap leader Hu Jintao...

87
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,819
It wouldn’t be that hard to believe

88
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,549
that a president would wrap his phones in
tin foil.

89
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,901
Or that Americans think Kim Jong-Un

90
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:53,011
is the Sexiest Man Alive.

91
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:57,079
I mean, have you seen the guy on a horse?

92
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,260
So what’s your favorite piece

93
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,169
of Chinese Communist Party performance art?

94
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,870
Leave your comments below.

95
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,129
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

96
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,939
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

97
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:07,730
see you next time.
