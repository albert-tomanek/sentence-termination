00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,940
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,060
Super babies are the future.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,620
No, not that kind of super baby.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,880
The kind that's genetically engineered -

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,100
in China!

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,940
It's an old story:

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,260
A crazed scientist with delusions of grandeur

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,920
embarks on ethically questionable research

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,240
and creates a monstrosity.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,360
Of course, that's pure science fiction. I mean,

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,900
no scientist could get research grants for that much money!

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,780
No, you need the kind of money only a government has -

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,420
to bring together teams of scientists

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,900
to work together...

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,160
to create ethically questionable monstrosities.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,020
And for that, China has the rest of the world beat.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,960
Did you know, and I kid you not,

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,720
basketball star, Yao Ming

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,860
is the result of a selective breeding program

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,080
set up by Mao Zedong over 50 years ago?

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,420
But why leave it to clumsy methods like natural breeding

24
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,300
when we stand on the cusp of a paradigm shift for humanity?

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,120
Genetic engineering!

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,460
This has huge implications.

27
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,660
But while the rest of the world has barely begun to think about it,

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,520
China has been spending big on research and development.

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,480
At a major economics meeting earlier this year,

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,240
the Chinese Communist Party announced a five-year plan

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,800
that would allocate 41 billion dollars to science,

32
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,980
including genetic engineering research.

33
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,900
In the near future, genetic engineering will have a huge impact on human kind.

34
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,720
And I know, it's tempting to say, "hey, that's great!"

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,920
But what's the future of this technology

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,800
in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party:

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,560
an authoritarian regime that kills its own citizens

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,980
for their organs,

39
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,400
controls the media

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,780
and silences dissent?

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,440
I sat down with biotechnology policy expert

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,120
Jamie Metzl, to find out.

43
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,080
Jamie, thank you for joining us on the show.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,500
Now you speak a lot about genetic engineering.

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,080
For a lot of people, that's not a topic they think about.

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,900
Where is this technology now, and where is it going?

47
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,740
They way I like to describe it is,

48
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,320
we are on the verge, have already begun

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,440
a genetics revolution that's going to

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,600
transform not just how we do medicine

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,300
not just how we make babies,

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,020
and the nature of the babies we make,

53
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,660
but our evolutionary path as a species.

54
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,260
So in 2003 was the end of the Human Genome Project

55
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,000
which was the first sequencing of the human genome.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,060
And what that essentially did was turn biology

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,300
into an information technology.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,980
So we, as humans, we are made up code.

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,260
We are beginning to understand and read that code.

60
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,640
And what that is means is that our own biology

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,300
will come to be seen as being as hackable

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,440
as information technology systems.

63
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
So with these new technologies,

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,040
we're gonna be able to eliminate a lot of genetic diseases,

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,980
We're going to live longer, healthier

66
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,480
more robust lives.

67
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,820
But there are some very big, very significant

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,200
moral, ethical challenges.

69
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,960
And we're going to need, as a species,

70
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,820
and nationally and individually,

71
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,820
to find the right balance between decisions that we're making

72
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,560
for our good,

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,980
and potential dangers that we may unleash

74
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,260
that could harm us.

75
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,080
Very good point! And so now

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,500
let's talk about China,

77
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,580
because this ties in very much with what you just said.

78
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,880
What currently is the Chinese regime doing

79
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,040
that we might consider

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,060
unethical in regards to

81
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,340
genetic research?

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,600
I know they've been investing a lot of money into that.

83
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,560
First, let's talk about what they're doing.

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,680
Because the Chinese government,

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,180
to its credit,

86
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,520
recognizes, like the United States government recognizes

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,400
that genetics and biotechnology

88
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,500
is going to be incredibly important for the future of

89
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,120
medicine and even the future of national competitiveness.

90
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,260
And that's why, in China and the United States,

91
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,000
there are massive precision medicine initiatives.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So precision medicine

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,580
is the recognition that, in the future,

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,940
unlike the general medicine we have today,

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,340
that if someone has cancer they get chemotherapy,

96
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,260
and you don't know, until you have that treatment,

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,700
whether you're the kind of person that would respond to that kind of treatment.

98
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,240
With precision medicine,

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,300
your genetic code,

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,440
your sequences genome will be the foundation of your medical record.

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,040
So before you try anything,

102
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
We'll know a bit more about

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,840
are you the kind of person that would respond to this kind of treatment-

104
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,800
So it's like custom tailored...

105
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,220
Exactly. Personalized medicine. That's exactly the point.

106
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,240
And it will be a different model for how we treat,

107
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,040
but also for how we develop new treatments

108
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,180
including drugs and how we test.

109
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,680
So there's a lot of good in what China

110
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,660
and the United States,

111
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,860
and others are doing to invest

112
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,100
in the realization of this future

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,380
of precision medicine and biotechnology,

114
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,680
and genetic technologies that have the potential

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,260
to help everybody.

116
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,420
The danger, though, is

117
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,220
that these tools are extremely powerful.

118
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,820
So these same tools.

119
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,780
that can help us live longer, healthier, more robust lives

120
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,060
can also be used to create dangerous bioweapons.

121
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,680
They can be used to interfere

122
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,060
with the human germline,

123
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,280
our heritable genetics.

124
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,140
And that doesn't mean it's always wrong,

125
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,500
but there needs to be

126
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,940
some kind of

127
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,400
some kind of ethical standard

128
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,660
so we can make big decisions if we're changing

129
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,760
the nature of our children and our children's children.

130
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,280
We need to have a context for thinking about it.

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,000
And the fear many people, myself included, have about China

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,180
is that there's a massive pressure to move forward

133
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,500
very aggressively, which is not necessarily bad.

134
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,900
And there are even some decent laws.

135
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,460
But there is a Wild West environment

136
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,180
and a Wild West culture

137
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,740
where people are taking some very big risks.

138
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,360
And the controls,

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,560
on one hand the controls

140
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,020
to establish parameters around those risks aren't

141
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,220
fully established.

142
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,880
And at the same time, there's a tremendous pressure

143
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,860
To continually have advances, to continually break new ground

144
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,000
and in some way bring glory to the state.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,480
So what are the implications of China's genetic rise?

146
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,440
Well, on one hand, it's good

147
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,840
because I always say that, with China,

148
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,480
engaging in so much intellectual property theft,

149
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,960
it's almost a double taxing against the rest of the world.

150
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,760
On one hand,

151
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,500
China has been stealing intellectual property

152
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,140
from the rest of the world.

153
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,100
On the other hand, all these brilliant, creative people in China

154
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,940
rather than creating something new,

155
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,840
are putting a lot of energy into stealing and adapting someone else's thing.

156
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,980
And so I think that

157
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,400
the more that China's brainpower

158
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,860
is deployed on doing new things,

159
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,960
solving new problems, in my mind,

160
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,300
that's a much better allocation of that very important resource.

161
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,460
So if there are more people in China that are working

162
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,260
at the frontiers of genetic science,

163
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,300
I think that's a plus.

164
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,380
But it will be very important

165
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,200
that we are all talking to one another

166
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,160
so we don't get in difficult situations where

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,580
we are moving in different directions.

168
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,480
Particularly when there are big ethical issues at play

169
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,220
that could influence our future evolution as a species.

170
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,500
Then that gets into the issue of national security.

171
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,680
Is there a national security risk for the US in any of this?

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,220
Different societies will have different views

173
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,040
on how to apply these genetic technologies. And so

174
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
it could be that there will be

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,520
countries, and let's just say, for example,

176
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,060
the United States is one.

177
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,360
Maybe Vatican City will be another,

178
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,580
where we, collectively, aren't comfortable

179
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,860
with germline, genetic, heritable

180
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,120
mutation - particularly of unborn babies.

181
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,640
And so we draw that line.

182
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,780
But it could be that other societies,

183
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,260
- and let's just take China as one potential example -

184
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,400
are comfortable with it.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,860
And they're saying, "Well, we can

186
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,240
use these technologies, we can eliminate

187
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,860
genetic diseases.

188
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,080
We can, maybe at some point in the future,

189
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,460
engineer people to be smarter or more

190
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,780
resistant to disease or something else.

191
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,860
So if that were to happen,

192
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,000
What would we do?

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,520
What would the country that says "we don't wanna do it" do?

194
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,260
We ban people from those other countries,

195
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,180
from coming here, from procreating with our citizens?

196
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,760
Would we do genetic tests of everyone entering the country?

197
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,980
And you could see how with genetically modified crops,

198
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,960
which aren't even that bad for you,

199
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,920
people have gotten so up-in-arms,

200
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,180
people are destroying property, destroying people's fields.

201
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,640
What would people do

202
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
in that kind of situation?

203
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,920
So it's not just a China-US issue.

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,280
It's a global issue.

205
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,040
But there's a real potential tinderbox.

206
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,500
Now, I read your book, The Genesis Code,

207
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,620
where you talk a lot about these issues.

208
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,220
You know, I'm a huge science fiction fan, and this really holds up.

209
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,700
But you set it in the very near future,

210
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,780
only 2020, right?

211
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,640
2023.

212
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,720
So that's only a few years away.

213
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,340
Why did you set it so close to today?

214
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,240
Well, the reason is

215
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
I write science fiction

216
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,860
not so that people can not-think.

217
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,780
But so that people will really think of the implications for today.

218
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,560
I felt like, somebody goes and sees wonderful science fiction like Star Wars,

219
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,300
But they're not thinking,

220
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,180
"Oh jeez, if I have a Wookie at home,

221
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
where is he gonna sleep?"

222
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,580
What are "droid rights?"

223
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,140
What I wanted was for people to read this book and say,

224
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,980
"hey, this world feels very familiar!"

225
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,760
And these issues, in some way, feel far off,

226
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,360
But in other ways they just feel like they're right here.

227
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,760
So is China genetically engineering babies?

228
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,360
No.

229
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,720
Not to my knowledge.

230
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,000
Are they in a position where this is something they could start doing in the near future?

231
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,280
Well certainly China and Chinese companies

232
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,080
are doing a lot of research,

233
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,720
like people in the United States and elsewhere are,

234
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
on understanding the genetic

235
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,680
fingerprint, if that's the right word,

236
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,700
off all kinds of traits, including intelligence.

237
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,140
At BGI-Shenzhen, they have a thing called the

238
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,920
Cognitive Genomics Initiative,

239
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,940
where they're really trying to understand

240
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,340
what genetic combinations make up extremely high intelligence.

241
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,740
Whether, once they and we all,

242
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
understand that,

243
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,340
China would be in a position

244
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,380
to use embryo selection to select

245
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,260
people who are likely to have higher IQs.

246
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,720
Nobody knows the answer to that question.

247
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,220
But when we look at China's recent history,

248
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,120
you could at least suggest, believe that there could be

249
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,680
an openness or willingness to do that.

250
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
China is very comfortable with population engineering

251
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,740
through the One Child Policy,

252
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,940
with significant environmental engineering.

253
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,580
With South-to-North water diversion program,

254
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,380
Three Gorges Dam...

255
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Willing to take children away from their families

256
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,300
to place them in their Olympic sports schools for the glory of the state...

257
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,900
So if there was this technology,

258
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,980
if and when this technology matures to a point

259
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,180
where it could be used for

260
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,020
population enhancement,

261
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,280
Would China or other countries be open to that?

262
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,100
I think the answer to that is potentially, "yes."

263
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,500
So it's the question of, "what would

264
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,140
genetically engineered super babies have on the world?"

265
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
Certainly, super babies

266
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
is the future of our species. And some

267
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,180
individuals, groups, countries will opt out,

268
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,960
and some individuals, groups, countries

269
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,380
will opt in.

270
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,780
But in my view, it is inevitable

271
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,920
that we will be using these technologies

272
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,140
first to eliminate disease,

273
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,200
but over time,

274
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,400
to select for perceived positive traits.

275
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,480
And so if the United States

276
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,660
continues to have

277
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,160
say, moratoriums on this, but China continues to advance along these lines,

278
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,220
what could the potential consequences be for this country?

279
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,340
As genetic technologies mature,

280
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,460
different countries will come to different conclusions

281
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,200
about how they'd like to use them.

282
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
If a country opts out,

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,820
there may be consequences for competitiveness.

284
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,700
And if a country opts in,

285
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,280
it may face challenges that we don't even

286
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,900
understand because they would be

287
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,420
messing with a very complex system.

288
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,960
And so there will be huge implications whether it's the United States and China

289
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,040
or any other combination of entities.

290
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,460
This is going to be a huge issue moving forward.

291
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,220
Alright, well Jamie - thank you very much for joining us.

292
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,620
Once again, the book is Genesis Code

293
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,600
and there's a sequel out now called Eternal Sonata.

294
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,160
If you are interested in reading the book,

295
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
we provided a link below

296
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
where you can buy The Genesis Code.

297
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,100
I do recommend it. It's a fantastic book.

298
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,520
Jamie, thank you for joining us.

299
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,860
My pleasure, thank you.
