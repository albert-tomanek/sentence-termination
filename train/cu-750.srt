1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,770
China is the largest police state in the world.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,080
It uses surveillance to go after dissidents
and minorities.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,080
And who helped them build that surveillance?

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,680
Microsoft and other American tech companies!

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,780
This is how they did it.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,339
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,800
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,009
The Chinese Communist Party has built

9
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:28,970
the world’s most advanced systems of mass
surveillance.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,679
And this is the laboratory where the Chinese
regime

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,969
tests this new technology:

12
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:35,190
The region of Xinjiang,

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,260
home to a mostly Muslim ethnic Uighur population.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,379
The surveillance includes a network of

15
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,090
40,000 facial recognition cameras,

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,500
as well as collecting DNA samples,

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,420
fingerprints, iris scans,

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,570
and blood samples from most Xinjiang residents.

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,710
It’s the dystopian nightmare everyone warned
us about!

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,600
But we here in America didn’t simply sit
idle

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,309
while the Chinese regime was building

22
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,469
this Orwellian system.

23
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:06,880
In fact, our companies actively helped!

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,010
US tech companies knowingly worked with the
Chinese military,

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,320
as well as with private Chinese companies

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,580
contracted to do work for the Chinese government.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,740
The problem is what’s called dual-use technology—

28
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,080
tech, like facial recognition,

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,860
that has both civilian and military applications.

30
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,820
There’s very little regulation of this.

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,640
According to Foreign Policy,

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,300
“U.S. Congress and government officials

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,870
have yet to call for a review of the extent
of

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,070
U.S. investment and research partnership entanglements.”

35
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,960
The Commerce Department has proposed

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,190
some rules for emerging tech,

37
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,920
but the scope is unclear.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,360
Fortunately, at the end of last year,

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,430
Microsoft truly stepped up to the plate.

40
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,830
They said there’s a need for “public regulation

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,690
and corporate responsibility.”

42
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,190
Wow, good for Microsoft.

43
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,190
Except...

44
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,800
Microsoft ignored both public regulation

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,890
and corporate responsibility

46
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,530
by working with the Chinese military.

47
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,259
According to a report last week in the Financial
Times,

48
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,360
“Microsoft has worked with a Chinese military-run

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,700
university on artificial intelligence research

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,840
that could be used for surveillance and censorship.”

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,370
Well, that’s awkward.

52
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,560
Over the course of a few months last year,

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,610
three published papers were co-written

54
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,010
by the Microsoft team in Beijing,

55
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,760
and researchers tied to China’s

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,660
National University of Defense Technology.

57
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,910
That university is controlled by China’s
top military body,

58
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,900
the Central Military Commission.

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Which is headed...

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,350
by Chinese presitator Xi Jinping.

61
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,160
But how could Microsoft know all that?

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,820
I mean, the University only has

63
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,560
“defense technology” in its name

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,920
and also the military symbol in its logo?

65
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,970
That’s like going to Burger King

66
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,640
and being surprised when they have burgers.

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,330
And kings.

68
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,430
One paper that Microsoft worked on describes

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,130
“a new AI method to recreate detailed environmental
maps

70
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,550
by analysing human faces,

71
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,240
which experts say could have clear applications

72
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,100
for surveillance and censorship.”

73
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,410
What a coincidence!

74
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,770
Because that’s the very same kind of technology

75
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,069
they’re using in Xinjiang to track the Uighurs!

76
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,900
But it’s dual-use technology.

77
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,650
It could have civilian applications

78
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,320
or military applications!

79
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,700
How was Microsoft to know that the military
university

80
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,210
would want to use it for military applications?

81
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,400
Now US lawmakers are calling out Microsoft
for what they’ve done.

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,950
Senator Ted Cruz,

83
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,930
hey...nice beard,

84
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,120
says “American companies need to understand
that

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,770
doing business in China carries significant
and deepening risks.

86
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,000
In addition to being targeted

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,950
by the Chinese Communist party for espionage,

88
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,090
American companies are increasingly at risk

89
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,500
of boosting the Chinese Communist Party’s

90
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,440
human rights atrocities.”

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,330
That’s crazy.

92
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,319
An American company knowingly helping

93
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,709
a murderous regime persecute people?

94
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,250
What are they, IBM?

95
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,220
Senator Marco Rubio said Microsoft is complicit

96
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,060
in the Chinese regime’s human rights abuses.

97
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,841
“It is deeply disturbing that an American
company

98
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,180
would be actively working with the Chinese
military

99
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,999
to further build up the government's surveillance
network

100
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,499
against its own people—

101
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,469
an act that makes them complicit

102
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:29,300
in aiding the Communist Chinese government’s

103
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,620
totalitarian censorship apparatus

104
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,490
and egregious human rights abuses.”

105
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,999
In fact, he and Congressman Chris Smith spearheaded

106
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:41,520
this bipartisan letter urging sanctions on
China

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,289
for the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang.

108
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,810
It was signed by 9 Republicans,

109
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,559
7 Democrats and one independent.

110
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,840
To which I say,

111
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,191
good for the Chinese Communist Party

112
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,830
for finally bringing Democrats and Republicans
together.

113
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,860
Now Microsoft has defended their work

114
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,499
with the Chinese military university.

115
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,379
Their official response to the Financial Times
was,

116
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,800
“The research is guided by our principles,

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,460
fully complies with US and local laws,

118
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,839
and...is published to ensure transparency

119
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,729
so that everyone can benefit from our work.”

120
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,520
I mean, if their principles are to make lots
of money

121
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,870
while technically not breaking any laws,

122
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,430
then yeah, I guess they are guided by their
principles.

123
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,030
My favorite Chinese state-run media, the Global
Times,

124
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,639
defended Microsoft.

125
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,760
It wrote that the Chinese director of the
research

126
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,810
“slammed the accusations as subjective interpretation,

127
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,680
saying that ‘he who has a mind

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,470
to beat his dog will easily find his stick.’”

129
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,689
Oh yeah?

130
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,530
Well just because you pointed out the stick

131
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,559
doesn’t mean you were beating a dog.

132
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,059
Or something.

133
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:48,020
It sounded more folksy in my head.

134
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,180
The point is,

135
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,800
this isn’t Microsoft’s only shady connection

136
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,659
to mass surveillance in Xinjiang.

137
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,430
In February, a European research team discovered
that

138
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,119
a Chinese company called SenseNets

139
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,009
had a totally open, unsecure database

140
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,449
of 2.5 million Uighurs in Xinjiang.

141
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,150
The records tracked everything from each person’s
ID number,

142
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,589
birthday, address, ethnicity, employer...

143
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,230
as well as updated GPS coordinates that could
tell if,

144
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,259
for instance,

145
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,369
this particular person was visiting a mosque.

146
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,719
Any I know that sounds creepy,

147
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,919
but have you considered this?

148
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,729
Maybe the police are just tracking everyone’s
ID,

149
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,779
birthday, and location so they know where
to deliver

150
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,160
their state-sponsored birthday cake!

151
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,200
Surprise!

152
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,400
And that image is my birthday present to all
of you.

153
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,639
But back to creepy surveillance.

154
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,740
The company handling all this tracking, SenseNets,

155
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,089
listed Microsoft as a partner on their website.

156
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:48,680
Now, Microsoft has since said SenseNets

157
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,340
was lying about that partnership...

158
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,469
and offered, well, very little proof to back
that up.

159
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,589
But SenseNets has removed Microsoft’s logo
now,

160
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,020
so that’s good enough.

161
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,990
But Microsoft’s relationship with Chinese
mass surveillance

162
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,789
goes even deeper.

163
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,210
The three papers the Financial Times discovered

164
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,379
“underscore Microsoft’s...long-running
links

165
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,339
to Chinese military-funded academia,

166
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:15,979
including its operation of several ‘tech
clubs’

167
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:18,110
for students at Chinese universities

168
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,520
known to have military links.”

169
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,169
In fact, Bill Gates got Microsoft into China

170
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,379
by building a personal relationship

171
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,039
with former Chinese leader

172
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,759
and murder toad Jiang Zemin.

173
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,890
And Jiang Zemin’s son owned a 50% share

174
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,789
of the MSN China website.

175
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,020
But before you say,

176
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,639
“Wow, Microsoft is the worst”...

177
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,629
I should tell you that there are actually

178
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,759
lots of American companies and organizations

179
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
doing shady things in China.

180
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,249
Like Cisco.

181
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,029
Cisco helped build China’s Great Firewall.

182
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,580
That’s the Communist Party’s internet
censorship system

183
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,899
that prevents Chinese netizens

184
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,860
from accessing dangerous websites, like YouTube.

185
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,860
And a leaked internal powerpoint presentation

186
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,020
showed that Cisco was very aware that

187
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,069
one of the Chinese regime’s goals for the
Great Firewall

188
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,069
was to target Falun Gong and other Chinese
dissidents,

189
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,949
helpfully called “hostiles” here.

190
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,740
Falun Gong is the main group

191
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,529
the Chinese regime was persecuting at the
time.

192
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,619
Falun Gong practitioners’ main thing is

193
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:24,669
hour-long meditation and exercises—

194
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:27,849
which, I have to say, is an incredibly boring
thing

195
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,469
to put under surveillance.

196
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,809
But hey, I’m not the one paying for it.

197
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:34,241
So Cisco took a look at how the Chinese Communist
Party

198
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:37,570
was monitoring and arresting all these people
and thought,

199
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,779
what a great opportunity to sell more routers!

200
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,130
Anyway, it’s not just Cisco.

201
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,750
Top American University MIT

202
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,560
has a wide reaching partnership with SenseTime.

203
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,350
SenseTime is a world leader in AI facial recognition
technology.

204
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,029
It also owns a 49% stake in SenseNets,

205
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,660
that company keeping on eye on 2.5 million
Uighurs.

206
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,980
The one that Microsoft claims is totally not
a partner.

207
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,870
And SenseNets is mainly owned by its Chinese
parent company Netposa.

208
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,870
In 2010,

209
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,040
Netposa got some big investment from

210
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,100
an American venture capital firm:

211
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Intel Capital.

212
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,410
It’s “where great companies are built.”

213
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,410
Which is good,

214
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,040
because Netposa has been doing its own investing

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,380
in US robotics startups.

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Like Bito robotics.

217
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,220
It’s led by researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University.

218
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,870
Netposa also invested in Exyn,

219
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,649
a drone software company,

220
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,690
which is competing in an AI challenge run
by DARPA.

221
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,460
DARPA is the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.

222
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,350
That’s the part of the US Defense Department

223
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,529
responsible for the development of emerging
technologies

224
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,800
for use by the military.

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
If you’re like me,

226
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,570
you know about DARPA thanks to Metal Gear
Solid.

227
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,899
You’re the DARPA chief Donald Anderson,
right?

228
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,060
No, Snake!

229
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,880
That’s Decoy Octopus

230
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,690
disguised as DARPA Chief Donald Anderson,

231
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,120
and the FOXDIE virus the Pentagon injected
you with

232
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,360
is going to give him 
a heart attack!

233
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,380
But...what about the Pentagon?

234
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,380
Pentagon?

235
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,380
Nnnggghhhh!!!

236
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,380
What is it?!

237
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Whyyyy?!

238
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Told ya.

239
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,350
Most of what I know about DARPA comes from
a video game.

240
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,370
Anyway, as I mentioned earlier,

241
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,300
the Xinjiang government is also monitoring
Uighurs

242
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,980
using their DNA.

243
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,629
And guess who’s helping?

244
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:33,410
More American companies!

245
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,000
Up until this February,

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,139
the American company Thermo Fisher

247
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,509
was selling DNA sequencers

248
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,220
directly to Xinjiang authorities.

249
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,040
This Yale professor shared DNA samples

250
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,610
with China’s Ministry of Public Security.

251
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,660
I mean come on!

252
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,459
How can you be a Yale professor

253
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,490
and not understand what the “ministry of
public security”

254
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,779
gets up to in an authoritarian state like
China?

255
00:10:58,779 --> 00:10:59,779


256
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,709
California-based Amax works on computer deep
learning.

257
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:07,120
They have a partnership with China’s state-owned
Hikvision, and...

258
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,819
...ok you know what?

259
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:09,970
I’m just going to stop here

260
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,670
otherwise this episode will be like 10 hours
long.

261
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,670
And I don’t think our video editor Seamus
would like that.

262
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,810
But these American tech companies should know
better!

263
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,420
It’s well known that Chinese companies

264
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,920
built the internment camps in Xinjiang.

265
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,720
Chinese companies built the technology

266
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,480
that monitors their every move.

267
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,310
Chinese companies built the software

268
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,980
that monitors Uighurs online.

269
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,560
So maybe if you give these Chinese companies,

270
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,579
or Chinese military researchers,

271
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,220
your latest cutting edge technology,

272
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,200
it might get used for some not so great things.

273
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,000
But hey, it’s not like we learned any lessons
from history.

274
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,620
So what do you think of how US companies

275
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,860
have helped build China’s surveillance state?

276
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,720
Let me know in the comments below.

277
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,630
And now it’s time for me to answer

278
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,110
a question from one of you—

279
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,930
a fan who supports China Uncensored

280
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,610
with a dollar or more per episode,

281
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,029
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

282
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,850
Spartaner 251 asks,

283
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,100
“what's going to happen in the end?

284
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,350
china will just send some little doctor or
someone

285
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,189
to put all the blame on.”

286
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:17,740
For clarity, that was in reference to a recent
episode

287
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,701
I did about the Chinese Communist Party

288
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:21,300
being put on trial for killing

289
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,800
innocent prisoners of conscience

290
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,380
for their organs.

291
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,120
So I actually think it’s very likely

292
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,930
they’re going to try to blame it on someone,

293
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,339
or on a small group,

294
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,540
instead of the Communist Party as a whole

295
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,279
This is Huang Jiefu.

296
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,620
He’s the face of China’s organ transplantation
system.

297
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,800
Even though he hasn’t admitted to

298
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,009
killing innocent people for their organs,

299
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,449
he has gone on the air to make sure that

300
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,720
any shady things that may or may not have
happened

301
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,380
were some other guy’s fault.

302
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,550
That guy is Zhou Yongkang,

303
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,529
a high ranking Communist official

304
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,550
who has now been purged.

305
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,389
Now specifically he was talking about

306
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:59,269
organs from executed prisoners.

307
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,490
But Zhou Yongkang was a powerful figure

308
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,379
in a political faction tied to

309
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,180
former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

310
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,790
He and his faction have been trying to oust

311
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,550
current Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

312
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,879
Which is why Xi has been trying to purge them
all.

313
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,899
Like a Communist version of Pokemon.

314
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,440
Now Jiang Zemin, Zhou Yongkang,

315
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,649
and others in that faction are the ones

316
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,980
who started this system of forced organ trafficking.

317
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,230
So I have a feeling, as more evidence

318
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,240
of these crimes against humanity come out,

319
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,270
Xi is going to try real hard to blame it on
Jiang and his folks,

320
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,430
so he himself doesn’t get the blame.

321
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,940
Because in communist China,

322
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,459
the captain is the only one who

323
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,140
doesn’t have to go down with the ship.

324
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,199
Thanks for your question, Spartaner.

325
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,540
And thank you to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

326
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,980
who support China Uncensored.

327
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,899
It’s only because of your support that we’ve
been able to cover

328
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:55,670
topics that most other TV shows don’t want
to,

329
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,110
because they prefer to get advertising dollars,

330
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,720
rather than criticize the Chinese Communist
Party.

331
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,200
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

332
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
See you next time.
