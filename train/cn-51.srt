00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Today's show is sponsored by
Roger Daltrey's Discount Poultry:

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,780
It's not fit for human consumption.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,280
[Laughter]  [Chicken sounds]

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,480
This is The Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,360
I have an almost randomly selected article

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,020
from everybody's favourite, reliable
source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,020
and these folks can't see it.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,820
Every fact they get right gets a point and a ding, [DING]

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,140
and there's a prize for particularly good answers, which is:

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
— Oh yeah!
— Oh yeah!

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,700
I've got a button.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,660
Yeah, thing is, when you whacked that,
behind you, three chickens just shot in the air,

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,660
[Chicken noise] 
firing feathers off.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,600
[Chicken noises]

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,960
Well, if it's discount poultry,
there's only so many things you can do with it.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,420
Irate pissed off prog rock member.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,740
[Laughter]

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
"Stay away from my chicken farm!"

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,980
"Who are you? Who ARE you?"

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
YES!! We've started!

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,720
(Oh dear.)

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,220
He does actually have a salmon farm though,
doesn't he?

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,660
— Yeah, he does.
— That's what he retired to do.

24
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,460
Wait, really?

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,220
Yeah, he retired to farm salmon.

26
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,220
Was it salmon or trout, er... Was it a fish?

27
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,600
Oh yeah, fish. Might be trout.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,500
Sorry, are we arguing about the kind of fish

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
that the member of The Who
is currently engaged in farming?

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,600
Yeah. Somewhere down the line,
Roger Daltrey is just a fish farmer, now.

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you, what do you think? Like, when you have fish,

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,260
you give them play things, like a castle or something.

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,400
Do you think they've got a Rolls-Royce in there?

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,460
That's a Keith Moon gag, everyone!

35
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,560
Yeah, it's okay, I was gonna help there...

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Oh, it'd be brilliant if he was a proper sort of
rock star style fish farmer,

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,940
Instead of, you know, some square lake in a field,

38
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,640
proper glass-sided house or some mansion house.

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,360
Gary: Oh yeah!

40
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,000
Just sealed at the windows.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
People walking past
with trout banging up against the glass.

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,060
And the fish have got a gigantic people tank.

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,900
That sounds amazing!

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,900
I change the air all the time...
feed them bacon bits...

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,620
I've given them a castle to live in and walk out of,

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,780
and a giant skull that spits water at 'em.

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,200
I wanna be in a people tank...

48
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,960
— You are, Matt.
— Join the army.

49
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,720
You are, Matt. You already are.

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,300
Oh, yeah, it's a house.

51
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,360
I've never thought of that.

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,580
Yeah, houses are people tanks, you're right.

53
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,980
All we need is some fish outside looking in.

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
We can sort that out.

55
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,280
I was gonna say, I can do some compositing work
on this camera shot if it helps.

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,920
Excellent, excellent.

57
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,660
That has to happen.

58
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,220
No, I just want fish to walk past:
Bow tie, bowler hat, kid in a pram...

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,340
You want a fish to walk past...?

60
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,420
There's no water out there, is there, dickhead?!

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,720
Someone will have to lob it, and it'll just slide...

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,360
Doonk!

63
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,980
Somebody offshot just hoying fish past the glass...

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,160
What did we do to piss off Grimsby?

65
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,860
Well...

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
Where do you start, yeah?

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
Do you want to get to the game at some point?

68
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,900
— Yeah.
— Yeah, f***. Yeah.

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,900
Instead of talking about Roger Daltrey's fish farm.

70
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,540
Just get Roger Daltrey up on the 'Pedia.'

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,820
Our topic today is The Big Lobster.

72
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,080
... which I swear I picked before we went off
on the Roger Daltrey fish farm thing.

73
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,660
The Big Lobster.

74
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,120
Actually sounds like a New Orleans
gangland boss's name, doesn't it?

75
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,740
Whereas I was going for a restaurant.

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
Maybe the two are the same?

77
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,660
New Orleans gangland-themed restaurant.

78
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,160
No, not themed, it's a front.

79
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,960
It's a front obviously, for the gigantic man-sized lobster
that lives within!

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,140
Aha, now...

81
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,280
You're looking a bit bigger than man-size here.

82
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,480
Bigger than...? A lobster bigger than a man?

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,200
Yep.

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,740
A lobster the size of a bear!

85
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,440
We'd have known about this.
It would have walked over Tokyo by now.

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,820
It did, they just cleaned up after it.

87
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,840
I just got the thought of the actual film version of the bloke dressed as the Giant Lobster.

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
[Roaring]

89
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Everybody is giving it that!

90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
All these lobsters comin' in here, givin' it that.

91
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
[Laughter]
Hey!

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,620
Ladies and gentlemen: may I congratulate us

93
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,620
on the first visual gag of the Technical Difficulties?

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,320
First ever visual gag! Chin chin!

95
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,720
Okay, so it may not be an actual, "alive" lobster.

96
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,540
Oh, f***ing really? You reckon?

97
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Is this one of these American things

98
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,340
where some state's got an enormous glass fibre one

99
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,060
to celebrate that fact there was once one there?

100
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,640
Oooh, you're right.
It's not Aus... it's not America, I mean.

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,600
— Is it in fact Australia?
— Australia?

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780
I might just have given away that with the... 
Competent hosting, here.

103
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,780
Is it in the Tyrol of Austria?

104
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,780
[Laughter]
Austria!

105
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,780
Just on the side of a mountain.

106
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,500
"Why have you got this lobster?"

107
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,920
"We stole it from Australia."

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
That's the worst accent ever; that's not from anywhere!

109
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,420
"He teaches them the folly of their ways, Hansel."

110
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,160
"From it, from its claws..."

111
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,740
"I say this lobster is a lesson!
A lesson to the whole world!"

112
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,060
"From its claws will come fondue!"

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,760
Do you want any more Austrian stereotypes?

114
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,620
Do you want like a cuckoo clock?

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,120
— Yes.
— Yes!

116
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,260
— ...out of its mouth...or?
— Yes!

117
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,440
— That'd be great!
— Okay.

118
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,660
I just like the idea of a lobster doing a sort of "Alien" deal,
just like a cuckoo clock.

119
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,440
Can you imagine Alien with a cuckoo clock?

120
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,540
Dramatic music, slime dripping down...

121
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,260
ALL: Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,520
...just the tension before that scene,

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,980
as it's coming closer and closer and closer.

124
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,320
[Growling]

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,020
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

126
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,040
"Three o'clock, everybody."

127
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,040
...and then he just hands over this note saying:

128
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,140
"Mr. Jones, you are late for your 2:30 appointment."

129
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,460
"Thank you, Miss Smith!"

130
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Sorry, have we got an alien, cuckoo-clock-bearing Siri?

131
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
Is that what we're talking about?

132
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,100
Steampunk Siri.

133
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,800
No, sorry. Steampunk Siri is a butler.

134
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,520
"I'm sorry, I couldn't send that telegram just now.

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,220
"I'll try again later."

136
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Completely forgets about it.

137
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
"Siri, would you fetch me some tea?"

138
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,900
"I don't understand what you mean.

139
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
"Would you like me to call Tim?"

140
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
"No, no. Fetch me some tea!"

141
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,060
To activate him you just press his crotch.

142
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,580
[Laughter]

143
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,600
"Ooh! Yes, sir. Very good, sir."

144
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
"Can I help you, sir?"

145
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Keeps going off in your pocket a lot.

146
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,260
[Laughter and groans]

147
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,980
Actually, now I've got the thought of a butler walking up:

148
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,960
[Siri noise]  Dee-deet!

149
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,480
"Doo-doot!"
And walk off.

150
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,160
You can get different voices for it.
You just swap out the butler.

151
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,700
No, it's got a generic man and a generic woman
that you can just put...

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
If you go outside the city, he just stops working.

153
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
Tell me about it, yeah.
[Laughter]

154
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
— Er, the Big Lobster.
— The Giant — the Big Lobster, everybody.

155
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,080
Does anyone want to take a guess
at what it's nicknamed?

156
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,100
Big Red.

157
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,660
It's got a name.

158
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Rudy!

159
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,980
— Lobby.
— Lobby McLob-lob.

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,600
Lobby is a lot closer than Rudy.

161
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,900
We're looking for a name that starts with L.

162
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,440
— Are we talking about...
— Larry.

163
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,220
Larry the Lobster! Spot on. Point!  [DING]

164
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
Ahh, well done, sir. I was going to say,

165
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,220
if it's Australian, I'm going to go for LOBBO!
Or something like that.

166
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
[Australian accent]
"Castlemaine XXXX brings you..."

167
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,140
ALL: LOBBO!
[Laughter]

168
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
"The fast bowling giant lobster!"

169
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,560
[Laughter]

170
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
"Queensland, you're for it!"

171
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,280
It's actually in South Australia,
so that's pretty accurate, really.

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,060
It's just the thought of him getting hotter and hotter,

173
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,940
going from blue to red.

174
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I thought you said *you'd* been
getting hotter and hotter then.

175
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,780
I thought we were going to get a police box striptease.

176
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,580
[Hums blues riff]
I'm bigger inside than outside!

177
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,540
ALL: Heyyy!

178
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,740
Okay, so we're looking at an eighteen-metre-high...

179
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,680
— High?!
— ...four-tonne lobster here.

180
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,340
Is it standing on its tail?

181
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,360
So Brannan was surprisingly close with his first guess.

182
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,100
Yeah! Yeah, I mean, that's one hell of a lobster roll.

183
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
And I'm actually giving you a point
for standing on its head... [DING]

184
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,900
It was meant to rear up over the structure.

185
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,800
Horse style? It's a horsey lobster?

186
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,100
What stopped it doing that? Yeah.

187
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,680
What stopped it from being built...?

188
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,560
The... Terrifying the townsfolk.

189
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,000
Or is it near an airport or something stupid like that,

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
so with the airport it's going to get
clipped on its big claws or something like that?

191
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,540
— Planning permission.

192
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,820
Yes. The local council stopped it.
[Laughter]

193
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,800
Point!  [DING]
Matt, you are getting all the points.

194
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,780
Is some local authority bloke sat there:

195
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,740
"Garage... garage... extension...
giant lobster."

196
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
[Australian accent]
"Now, we like what you've done with the giant lobster...

197
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,860
"We're not saying that's a bad idea.

198
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,020
"What we don't like is having it
rearing up over the whole township.

199
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,120
"I think you're going to see a lot of terrified folk there,

200
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,580
"We've all seen Godzilla."

201
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,540
"We're all worried about, what if it goes wrong?"

202
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
"We're known as a sunshiny country.

203
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,780
"What if somebody visits,
they're stood in the shadow of the lobster...

204
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,880
"That's it, the tourism industry, it's over.

205
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,940
"We're going to have to lie your lobster down, mate."

206
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,460
"That said, I'd just like to raise with the council

207
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,680
the possibility of the shadow keeping tinnies cool."

208
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,000
[Laughter]
It's this lobster outline of XXXX.

209
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,600
Oh dear...

210
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,560
There is a local legend about why it's quite so big.

211
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,000
Does anyone want to take a shot at what that might be?

212
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,620
Because some of...
Is it a Spinal Tap thing?

213
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
— It absolutely is.  [DING]
— Hahey!

214
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,660
Not *quite* that much.

215
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,040
They apparently had the measurements in feet,
and then read them in metres.

216
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,660
— Ohhh!
— Okay, not a factor of ten then.

217
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
— No.
— Brilliant. Someone just brings it in on a big lorry:

218
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,220
"Oh, s***, mate, how big did you want it?"

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,260
Did no one — ah, bollocks...
Did no one ring up and go,

220
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,100
"Someone wants a hundred-metre lobster?
Seems legit."

221
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,920
"There'll be no baths for the rest of northwest Australia

222
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
"...till we've got the fibreglass on this s***!"

223
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,040
[Laughter]

224
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,100
Point! It's fibreglass and steel.  [DING]

225
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,860
"What are we going to use it for?"
"Strewth, I dunno."

226
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,240
"Keeping tinnies cool underneath its rearing body?"

227
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,740
[Laughter]

228
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,720
Okay, quick fire round:

229
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,880
Australia has an enormous amount of big things.

230
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,140
Dickheads —

231
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,460
Oho! And ba-doomf, onto the cutting room floor it goes!

232
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,720
No, that's staying in. That is definitely staying.

233
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,360
Sorry, Australia. Sorry, sorry.

234
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh, like we hadn't alienated that audience enough
with the bad accent.

235
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,640
The many accents, I mean you've...

236
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,040
And the stereotypes...

237
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,660
Careful, I'm about to start slighting cricket as well, everyone.

238
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,000
I was just about to say...
The hell with it. You can't play cricket.

239
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
On behalf of the Technical Difficulties team,

240
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,080
I would like to apologize to all Australians.

241
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,460
It is not our fault that you are convicts.

242
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
All right.
Does anyone want to take...

243
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,660
Hey, on that — we've made a point, though.

244
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,240
Obviously, where I work — I work in the heritage industry...

245
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
We have records relating to transportees.

246
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,460
My favourite reason for someone

247
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
being transported to Australia goes as thus:

248
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,560
It's in Ecclesfield, so just outside old Sheffield Region...

249
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,540
Oh, good Lord.

250
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,240
South Yorkshire, as represented by my good colleague.

251
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,140
Hello.

252
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,480
The guy was done for the theft of a duck. All right?

253
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,180
[Laughter]
That's a good start.

254
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,240
It's a "three strikes and you're out" system.

255
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,780
A duck: inherently funny animal.

256
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,240
Yeah. But if you think about
the lack of criminal detection at the time,

257
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,800
the duck would have to have been in a bag, quacking.

258
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,420
And the guy caught doing it.

259
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
[Quacking]
[Laughter]

260
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,260
"Put it back!"

261
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,980
Next charge is also for theft of a duck.

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
And the third one is theft of a duck.

263
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,820
In the end it turns out,
it's the same man's duck three times.

264
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,000
In the end I think he was transported
just for being a hopeless case, quite frankly.

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,220
Which, the thought of him being on a ship...

266
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,900
"What did you do?"
"I killed a man."

267
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
"What did you do?"
"I stole a sheep."

268
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,040
"What did you do?"
[Mumbles]

269
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
[Laughter]
"I stole the same duck three times..."

270
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,660
[Mumbles]  "...stole the same duck three times..."

271
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,680
For a point each,

272
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,020
do you want to take a guess at
some of the big things around Australia?

273
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,880
Platypus. Wombat. Kangaroo.

274
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,840
Hang on, I can only...! Yeah!

275
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,160
Tin of beer!

276
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,920
Platypus: yes.  [DING]
Tinnie: yes.  [DING]

277
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,480
— No, haven't got a wombat.
— Alice Springs?

278
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,280
Alice Springs: Er, no, but I'm going to give you a point,

279
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,140
because there is a big Uluru...

280
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,540
I was going to say, Uluru?

281
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,660
There is actually a *small* Uluru.

282
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,300
I was going to say, is there a tiny...

283
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,700
Wasn't Uluru in Star Trek?

284
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,400
Yes. The Enterprise's communications officer,

285
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,340
that falls in love with Spock in the new movie,

286
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,560
is a massive rock.

287
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,480
That would be a great —
in a red dress.

288
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,460
Yes!

289
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I've just got the thought of them walking along, and a...

290
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,820
[Rock crunching sound]

291
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,040
...sound of a rock just scraping along the floor behind.

292
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,580
Yeah. Other big things in Australia... Barrier Reef?

293
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,880
Okay, we're looking for models of things
that have been blown up.

294
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,980
Like, I've personally been to the Big Pineapple.

295
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,420
Which is a big pineapple.

296
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
— Sense of entitlement.
— Er...

297
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Er, marlin.

298
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,360
— Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
— Yes, point.  [DING]

299
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,300
Lego version of something.

300
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,240
Nope.

301
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,500
Sydney Opera House? Is there an even bigger version somewhere?

302
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,780
No!
[Laughter]

303
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,880
You've got the Sydney Opera House!

304
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,060
Actually... no, er...

305
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,960
Sydney Harbour Bridge is a bigger version
of the Monkwearmouth Bridge in Sunderland.

306
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,700
Yes.

307
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,200
I dunno. Big what?
Are we talking big fibreglass things in Australia?

308
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,560
Big fibreglass things in Australia.

309
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,460
Crab!

310
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,420
Yes!  [DING]
Big mud crab. In Cardwell.

311
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
Have they got a gigantic pie or something?

312
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,580
I know pie and pea liquor is quite popular in Sydney.

313
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,860
It's the kind of thing I imagine a pie company would build.

314
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Yup. The Big Pie is mounted...
[Laughter]

315
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,680
[DING]  ...above a ten-metre pole

316
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,820
next to the car park of a drive-through pie shop.

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,680
Get it!

318
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
— Drive-through...
— ALL: Pie shop?!

319
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,940
We've got it wrong over here!

320
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,820
Yorkshire — Australia!

321
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,040
Australia, we take it all back!
You've got a lot to teach us.

322
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,200
You've got a lot... yeah!

323
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,780
We want your knowledge
of gigantic drive-through pie shops!

324
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,900
— I've had a...
— In fact:

325
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,320
I've had a drive-through hot beef sandwich.
That's the worst one I've...

326
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,140
You drove through a hot beef sandwich.

327
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,140
That's a euphemism.
I don't know what it's for, but it's a euphemism.

328
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,120
No, there's a cafe! It used to be like a, I don't know...

329
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,840
A popular chain of takeaway restaurants,
but it was taken over by a local cafe company,

330
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,800
and they just started flogging
hot beef sandwiches out of the window.

331
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,400
You try eating a hot beef sandwich in a car!

332
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,080
No! It'll drip everywhere.

333
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,920
Exactly! Hot gravy down both your arms before a meeting!

334
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,720
Louisiana has drive-through daiquiri stalls.

335
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,860
— Like, alcoholic...
— What?!

336
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,640
Because it's legal to have the alcohol in your car,

337
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,720
it's not legal to drink it because it's an open container.

338
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,680
So they give you the, like, two pints of daiquiri,

339
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,180
and a straw...

340
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,660
Which they haven't pushed through the...

341
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,620
And then they sellotape over the little straw hole.
So you can't put it in.

342
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,160
Arseholes!

343
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,500
— Impossible. Cannot defeat this.
— Absolutely impossible. Yup.

344
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,620
I was driving in America a couple of weeks ago,

345
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,660
and filled up at the petrol station, and the entire,
you know — there are two queues.

346
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,580
— Yeah.
— And the rope, the dividing line between the queues,

347
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,920
Not a rope barrier.
Crates and crates and crates of beer.

348
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Australia has drive-through liquor stores as well.

349
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,880
Like, it's basically just a big shed,

350
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,680
filled on the interior with beer on all the walls...

351
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,760
Whoa, whoa...

352
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
And then you drive in, you ask for what you want,

353
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,060
they load it in the back of your car,
you pay, then you drive off.

354
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,120
This is why we're not allowed nice things, isn't it.

355
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,400
We'd just abuse that in the way that
they obviously somehow manage not to.

356
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,360
Well, we already abuse the non-drive-through.

357
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,100
[Laughter]
Yeah.

358
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,800
I know that in Australia there was some race,
like car racing thing,

359
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,080
and they had to restrict it to just one slab,
as they call it, of beer.

360
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Yes, it's, er... it's the...

361
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,940
It's the 24 hours, what's the track called?

362
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,160
Yeah, it's the Supercar 24-hour —
Bathurst.

363
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,040
— Bathurst. Right, yeah.
— Bathurst 24 Hours.

364
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,460
So you're allowed 24 hours, 24 beers.

365
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
— ...is the rule.
— Yeah, but there was an outcry...

366
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,280
But there was an outcry, because they restricted it to...

367
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,620
That's 24 beers *per person*.

368
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,220
Yeah. One an hour, per person.

369
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,680
But they said, there was an outcry at "just 24".

370
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,920
[Laughter]

371
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,820
[Australian accent]
"No..."

372
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,180
But actually, in all fairness,
I go about one tin per half hour, so...

373
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,640
Well, I don't know if I could do that
for 24 hours, though, seriously...

374
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,220
I was going to say, by the end of the twenty-fourth one,

375
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,940
— ...you ain't gonna be asking for more.
— While driving.

376
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,600
Oh yeah, while driving.
[Laughter]

377
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,300
Yeah, that was the driver.

378
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
"Come on, mate! Safety first!"

379
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,320
Pit crew, possibly.

380
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,020
[Air gun whirring]
"Oh, s***, you want some more tyres? Oh, God."

381
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,940
"Eh, he'll be fine.'

382
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,180
"Inches of tread left, mate. F*** off."

383
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,160
[Laughter]

384
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,140
"Rack off!" ...he cried.

385
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
We're going to be never allowed to go there, are we.

386
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
That's my visa application f***ed.

387
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Erm... so, talking about the gigantic lob...

388
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Are we still talking about gigantic things in Australia?

389
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
— Yes.
— Cricket ball.

390
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,860
— Ohh.
— Cricket ball...

391
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,720
— Or bat.
— Or stumps.
— Yeah.

392
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,580
I'm going to give you the Big Wickets
[DING]  in Westbury.

393
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,500
— Natch.
— Mmm.

394
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,280
"Located at the front of the local cricket pitch."

395
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,540
I don't want you to give me the Big Wickets.

396
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,860
Somewhere out there, thanks to a nuclear accident,

397
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,220
is going to be a gigantic Fred Trueman
bowling at those in Godzilla stylee.

398
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes! Good Lord, that'd be brilliant.

399
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,920
But we'd have to invade and bring him back.

400
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
— Yeah!  [Laughter]
— Repatriate Giant Trueman!

401
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,720
King Kong with Giant Fred Trueman:

402
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,140
[Roars]

403
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,620
— Pipe.
— Thwack!

404
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Climbing the Media Centre at Lord's,

405
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,280
holding onto Jonathan Agnew like Fay Wray.

406
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,860
[Whoosh!]

407
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,260
That is a man who does not follow cricket.

408
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,160
— Big things in Australia that aren't...
— Kangaroo.

409
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,500
I said that.

410
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,100
— Did you?
— Yeah.  [DING]  Right near the start.

411
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,560
— Point.
— You ignored it.

412
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Ohh.
[Laughter]

413
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,140
The, erm... big huggy thing that smells of piss
and has an STD.

414
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,460
— Koala.
— Thank you.

415
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Er, point...  [DING]

416
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,060
In fact, two points, because there is the Big Koala,
and the Giant Koala.

417
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,520
All: Ohhh.

418
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,520
The difference in size being...?

419
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,440
— Er, not much.
— Ah.

420
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,620
Kookaburra.

421
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,900
Ooh, yeah, good one.

422
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,960
[DING]  Yep.

423
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,940
Because they're pretty big anyway.

424
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,620
Yeah. Four and a half metres, the big one, but yeah.

425
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
They're actually hummingbirds.

426
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
— Really?
— Really?

427
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,740
— No, they're kingfishers.
— Sorry, I meant kingfishers.

428
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,720
Hummingbird-sized kookaburra!

429
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,660
— I like the idea of a...
— ...kookaburra-sized hummingbird!

430
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,660
Just sounds like a Huey coming through.

431
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,160
Whoomp-whoomp-whoomp-whoomp!
"F***!"

432
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,700
— There's a Viet Nam vet, just going back to the...
— "Aaa! Aaah!"

433
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,040
— "I like the smell of kingfishers..."
— Kookaburras...

434
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
— "...kookaburras in the morning."

435
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,980
The thought of the giant kookaburra model again:

436
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,620
giant fibreglass, light-up eyes...
over a township, *squawking* on the hour.

437
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,380
— Ohh, yeah!
— [Screech]

438
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,640
Oh yeah, because they've got
a real horrible grating call as well, haven't they?

439
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,200
Yeah, they have, yeah.
Well, it sounds like "kookaburra", doesn't it.

440
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,180
Oh, of course, yeah.

441
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,860
Well, it's the sound they use for the monkey
in every jungle movie filmed before 1980.

442
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,240
— That kind of laughing monkey sound.
— [Monkey call]

443
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,420
— Yeah.
— That's a kookaburra.

444
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,940
In a monkey costume.

445
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,820
Not even in shot.
They just try and get it to feel the role, you know...

446
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Flip the head back, light a fag between takes...

447
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,280
"I went to bloody RADA, luv, I don't know why I do this."

448
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
— [Kookaburra squawk]
— The monkey obviously had better unions.

449
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,420
[Laughter]

450
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,300
The Monkey Film Union!

451
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,600
That's why they don't work these days.
The kookaburras do all the monkey work.

452
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,660
[Laughter]
[Groans]

453
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
On that note, congratulations to Chris,

454
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,220
stealing it at the last moment
with an enormous number of big things.

455
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,340
Love it!

456
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,460
You know it.

457
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,920
So congratulations, you win a DVD of the film

458
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,340
where the singer of "Purple Rain" trades places
with a peasant who looks just like him.

459
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
It's The Artist Formerly Known As Prince
and the Pauper.

460
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,540
Until next time, that's been Matt Gray...

461
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,980
That's been Gary Brannan,

462
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,500
That's been Chris Joel...

463
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,220
I've been Tom Scott. We'll see you next time.

464
