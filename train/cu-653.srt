00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,440
A new weapons sale to Taiwan

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,040
Could destroy half of any Chinese invasion force

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,400
And China is not happy

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,040
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,720
This episode has been sponsored\h
by Surfshark—because you should\h\h

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,400
be protecting your identity whenever you\h
go online by using a VPN like Surfshark.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,200
The Trump Administration has\h
announced plans for a huge\h\h

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
new weapons sale to Taiwan,\h
worth 2.4 billion dollars.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,520
And if you’re saying, hey Chris, didn’t you just\h
report that last week? No, you’re confusing this\h\h

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,080
week’s 2.4 billion dollar weapons sale with\h
last week’s 1.8 billion dollar weapons sale.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,040
In fact, the Trump Administration has been\h
selling so many weapons to Taiwan lately,\h\h

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,360
it’s getting a bit hard to keep up.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,040
This is the second arms deal in\h
a week and the ninth approved by\h\h

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
the State Department since Donald\h
Trump became president in 2017.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,760
But this isn’t just up to the State Department.\h
Arms deals also need to be approved by Congress.\h\h

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,000
So these two latest weapons sales have\h
been sent to Congress for a 30-day review.\h

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,080
It shouldn’t be a problem, since there\h
is bipartisan support for arming Taiwan.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
And this latest weapons sale is a doozy.\h

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:38,560
It, “includes 400 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, 100\h
launcher transporters, radar and support systems.”

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,320
The Harpoon anti-ship missile is a subsonic\h
weapon with a range of about 78 miles.\h\h

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,480
It’s not just an anti-ship missile though. It\h
can also strike missile launch sites or ports.\h\h

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,240
Taiwan already has Harpoon missiles,\h
but those are launched from submarines,\h\h

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,920
ships and aircraft. This new one is a land-based\h
system that basically fills in the gaps.\h

24
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,520
So, should a Chinese invasion force\h
come across the Strait of Taiwan,\h\h

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,120
the Harpoon missiles would be able to strike\h
Chinese invasion forces, as well as the ports\h\h

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,520
they’re launched from, and any of the hundreds of\h
missiles China has permanently aimed at Taiwan.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,280
The Chinese Communist Party is\h
obviously very upset that the US is\h\h

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
mucking up their invasion plans for\h
Taiwan. China has said it will impose\h\h

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,920
sanctions on US defense manufacturers\h
Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon.

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,240
These companies probably aren’t too\h
worried, though. Lockheed says that\h\h

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,280
China provides “considerably less\h
than 1%” of the company’s revenue.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,160
And while Boeing does a lot of business in China,\h\h

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,440
the Chinese sanctions would only be on Boeing’s\h
defense unit, which does not do business there.\h

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,480
I mean, China wouldn’t want to\h
sanction the entire company, because\h\h

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
China kind of needs all of the planes\h
that Boeing is building for them.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
Meanwhile “China’s defence\h
ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang\h\h

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,960
said the US arms sale to Taiwan could not\h
work and would only lead to a dead-end.”

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,920
And he’s right. It will lead to a dead\h
end. For any Chinese invasion force.

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,040
Taiwan is saying the new weapons\h
would give it the capability\h\h

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,720
to destroy half of any invading Chinese force.

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,160
What about the other half? I guess\h
that’ll be America’s job. Maybe.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,000

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,920

VPN like Surfshark to protect your identity.\h\h

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
Everything you do online is\h
being tracked and logged—by\h\h

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,680
the websites you visit and your internet service\h
provider. And in many cases, by the government.

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
And if you’re in an\h
authoritarian country like China\h\h

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,320
this kind of tracking can put you at\h
risk of surveillance and even arrest.

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,560
