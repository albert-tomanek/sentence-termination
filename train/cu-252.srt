1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,720
The Chinese Communist Party

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,800
Doesn’t want you to watch this video

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,440
But are they controlling YouTube?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,480
The Chinese Communist Party has been very\h
successful at censoring Americans, even\h\h

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,720
inside America. Usually by leveraging corporate\h
interests that want to do business in China.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,920
From the NBA banning Americans\h
protesting in support of Hong Kong...

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,880
To Zoom sending American user\h
data to the Chinese Government...

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,840
To CBS censoring its own shows for\h
criticizing censorship in China.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Yeah, that was ironic. Sorry, I meant tragic.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
But what about Google?

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,480
Google has been trying to get back in\h
the China market for years. It tried\h\h

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,040
to secretly create a censored search\h
app for the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
One US general has said that Google’s work\h
in China is benefitting China’s military.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,360
So what does that mean for YouTube,\h
which is owned by Google—and\h\h

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
for channels on YouTube that talk about China in\h
ways the Chinese Communist Party might not like?

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,520
Joining me today to talk about that\h
is Matt Tye, better known as LaoWhy86,\h\h

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
who runs his own YouTube channel on China.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,480
Matt, thanks for joining me today.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Hey, thank you so much, Chris.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,120
So in a recent video, you suggest YouTube may be\h
compromised by the CCP. Why do you think that?

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,320
Sure. Well, I've had a really big problem\h
between all three of our channels. I mean,\h\h

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,320
I run Laowhy86, which is my own, I run ADVChina\h
together with Winston over on SerpentZA\h\h

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
and then we collab on each other's channels all\h
the time. Also we run the ADV Podcasts and all of\h\h

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,680
them are surrounding China content, China-based\h
content particularly they're recently about\h\h

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,160
the Chinese government. And although we've had\h
videos demonetized or suggested for limited ads\h\h

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,240
basically, it's their nice way of saying it.\h
We've had a recent problem where videos are\h\h

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,480
getting manually reviewed. So what that means\h
is in the past YouTube kind of decides, okay,\h\h

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
this video is limited ads. So you're not going to\h
get monetization on this, and there's nothing you\h\h

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,040
can do about it. But so many people complained and\h
they kind of changed the way they do things to be\h\h

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,480
more transparent about why you're not getting\h
ads or how they came up with that decision.

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,640
And what they suggest now is that you upload\h
your videos ahead of time so that they can\h\h

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,400
actually have a physical reviewer. Now, I don't\h
know if this works on smaller channels, but on\h\h

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
bigger channels, they'll have a physical person,\h
a real human being to watch your video and say,\h\h

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,320
this is okay, so that it won't get affected in the\h
future. It can't get flagged, it won't get taken\h\h

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,000
down. It's already manually reviewed by YouTube.\h
So what's recently been happening and I have three\h\h

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,880
concrete examples on my video on Laowhy86,\h
I made a video called Taiwan is a Country,\h\h

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,640
even if you wish it really wasn't. And basically\h
what happened was it was manually reviewed by a\h\h

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,600
human being as being totally fine so I was getting\h
ads on it. And then all of a sudden it was again\h\h

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,800
demonetized. It was demonetized after it had been\h
manually reviewed. So I was very confused because\h\h

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,440
when I went into this new transparent YouTube\h
system about how they kind of come up with this\h\h

42
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,720
conclusion, it said that that video had been\h
demonetized because of video game violence.

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Now, my channel has nothing to do with video\h
games, obviously, no, I wasn't playing like\h\h

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,920
a Taiwan video game simulator and GTA V\h
or anything. This had nothing to do with\h\h

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,520
actually what the content was about. So I was very\h
confused, I went on to the live chat on YouTube,\h\h

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,880
and of course they bumped me up to their internal\h
team, the good old YouTube internal team,\h\h

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,640
which they looked at the video and quite\h
quickly said, "Oh yeah, it's totally fine.\h\h

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,520
Congratulations, good news your video is\h
monetized again." And that got me thinking\h\h

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,840
why not pursue this and see what\h
their decision-making process was?

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,480
So I said, you know what's going on? It was\h
flag what was the decision making process\h\h

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,560
that made this originally fine but then\h
another manual reviewer came in and said,\h\h

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,760
it's not fine? And they just completely\h
avoided that conversation and said, "Yeah,\h\h

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,160
thanks for your cooperation. Thanks for\h
your feedback. That's great." There was no\h\h

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,760
transparency involved. So they've effectively\h
made this transparent system to say that your\h\h

55
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,480
videos are monetized or demonetized for a reason,\h
but then they won't actually tell you that reason,\h\h

56
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,560
even after it's already been falsely\h
accused is something that it's not.

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
What are the consequences of\h
a demonetized video for you?

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,200
So this is something I think YouTube likes to\h
deny. They like to say that the monetization of\h\h

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,160
a video has nothing to do with its performance,\h
right? The thing is when a video gets demonetized\h\h

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,760
across all three of our channels or all four\h
of our channels, actually what we'll see is\h\h

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,080
that the performance of a video will spike\h
when it's monetized and it will be very,\h\h

62
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,880
kind of very stable. It won't really grow if it's\h
demonetized, if it has that yellow check mark.\h\h

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,560
And that's just our evidence like on our end,\h
but I've also heard other channels for example,\h\h

64
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,280
I heard something from Ethan Klein on H3 Podcasts\h
talk about how they've proven that basically you\h\h

65
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,560
could watch the spike of the graph. If a video\h
gets demonetized like halfway through its life,\h\h

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
it will stop getting views basically.

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,760
There's no incentive for YouTube to want to\h
recommend content that isn't making them money.\h\h

68
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
Especially if it's content that's getting\h
falsely flagged for reasons that they\h\h

69
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
might perceive as being offensive, or they\h
don't want to offend their audience, right?\h\h

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,720
If YouTube is caught recommending a content that\h
someone might deem offensive according to all the\h\h

71
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,760
flags that they're getting, then at the end of the\h
day, YouTube might be complicit in that content.

72
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,480
And so you think how you got flagged for\h\h

73
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,960
a video game violence, that was like\h
something somebody purposely did?

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,040
So this is my theory is that if you go\h
onto the Chinese side of the internet,\h\h

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,880
on the other side of the Great Firewall of\h
China, if you are searching things in Chinese,\h\h

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,760
you can find forums about both me and SerpentZA\h
and there's entire basically walkthroughs\h\h

77
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,360
and there's thousands of pages of this stuff, but\h
walkthroughs on how to use a VPN, get on a VPN,\h\h

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
go to YouTube, find our content, I saw\h
your content on there, Chris, as well.

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,360
Oh good.

80
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,720
Of course, to go on our content and\h
then to flag it for different reasons,\h\h

81
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,480
how to actually flag it, how to change your\h
browser into Chinese when you go to YouTube,\h\h

82
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,360
you know how to do all these things. And\h
the reason being is that they're voluntary\h\h

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,640
wumaos, voluntary fifty-cent armies that would\h
like to take our content down. And this is one\h\h

84
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,680
of the only ways that they can conceive of doing\h
this. Now, we've also found Western YouTubers,\h\h

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,440
American YouTubers doing the exact same thing,\h
following that same playbook, showing how to go\h\h

86
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,240
onto all of our content and flag us as this\h
and this and this, whether it's for racism,\h\h

87
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,040
whether it's for bullying, whether it's for\h
harassment, video game violence, or whatever.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,480
What I think happened and this is what happened\h
on our ADVChina video for the Tiananmen Square\h\h

89
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,160
monument that we visited and paid tribute\h
to, is that they found that maybe the YouTube\h\h

90
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,360
reviewers are very lax on the whole video game\h
violence thing. Maybe they'll just say, yeah,\h\h

91
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
it's video game violence because there's a\h
ton of that out on YouTube and just kind of,\h\h

92
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,200
oh, whatever. Yeah, let's demonetized after\h
it's been flagged for that reasoning. Or the\h\h

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,680
other theory is that there's someone in there\h
that's constantly getting flags on our content\h\h

94
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,400
because we know that that's happening. We know\h
that, for example, on one of SerpentZA's video,\h\h

95
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
he did a video on the century of humiliation\h
and that's kind of what spurned the whole\h\h

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,880
tutorial thing. So we know that basically\h
they'll find any reason to report a video.

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,760
In that case, it was an old man who walked into\h
the camera, like into the shot and then they\h\h

98
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,920
flagged that for bullying an old man, the video is\h
completely removed. Now, in that case, it wasn't\h\h

99
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,160
even demonetized it's just removed. So we think\h
that there's probably either someone sympathetic\h\h

100
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,560
to that within the YouTube moderation sphere,\h
which you know that the idea is really difficult\h\h

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,520
to prove but the same time, how can somebody whose\h
job is to manually sit down and watch a video,\h\h

102
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
say, "Yes, this has been flagged for video game\h
violence. And yes, I'm going to approve this."\h\h

103
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,760
Certainly that's all traceable within Google,\h
the people who moderate there's a trail,\h\h

104
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,240
there's a paper trail of the moderators that\h
are actually flagging content. So it wouldn't\h\h

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
be impossible to prove, but it would be\h
impossible to prove without someone to\h\h

106
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,320
be able to go in there and look at the content and\h
see who was moderating and why they clicked that.

107
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,520
And has YouTube responded\h
in any way to your concerns?

108
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,440
No. So I put that video out and concern I wanted\h
to bring attention for people like yourself\h\h

109
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,880
people like SerpentZA, people like me. I wanted\h
people to understand that this is different than\h\h

110
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,640
a normal video that someone might find offensive.\h
This is potentially thousands and thousands\h\h

111
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
of flags coming at these channels, which is\h
going to do whether they ignore them or not,\h\h

112
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,320
it's going to do something in the whole\h
zeitgeist of how the content system works,\h\h

113
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,640
moderation system works in YouTube. If you're\h
seeing constant barrages of flags on a certain\h\h

114
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
type of content, eventually something's going to\h
happen and that we're starting to see that now.\h\h

115
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,760
I'll admit that the whole mass demonetization\h
has gotten a little bit better since they made\h\h

116
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,600
the whole human moderation process a thing. But at\h
the same time now we're seeing people physically,\h\h

117
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,400
actively okaying flags on these videos that\h
are not... They're completely irrelevant to\h\h

118
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,080
the content. And what we've noticed is that\h
it's always on very, very sensitive topics.

119
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,400
So if we look at the three concrete examples\h
that I have Taiwan is a Country, I mean,\h\h

120
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,040
chairman, she literally says, "Taiwan is our most\h
controversial issue." If we look at the Tiananmen\h\h

121
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
Square, the monument video, the video is\h
literally called the Chinese Government's\h\h

122
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,120
not Going to like What we Found in the Desert,\h
very sensitive issue for China, The Century of\h\h

123
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Humiliation on SerpentZA's video, incredibly\h
sensitive issue. It's never stuff about,\h\h

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,920
you know maybe it's stuff that pokes fun\h
or maybe satire. It's never that kind of\h\h

125
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,880
stuff. It's always very, very cutting and\h
very, very sensitive topics that get hit.

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,400
Well in your video, you say\h
the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

127
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,880
is winning the propaganda\h
war. Why do you say that?

128
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,600
I say the Chinese Communist Party is winning the\h
propaganda war I mean, partially I'm referring\h\h

129
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
to the soft power that they put out there\h
on YouTube. And what I mean by winning is\h\h

130
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,720
that there's not a mass army of people in other\h
countries that are reporting their content. To\h\h

131
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,280
me for someone that has actually been affected by\h
the Communist Party of China and sees the absolute\h\h

132
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,840
atrocities that they commit, for me to see the\h
Chinese Government able to post freely on the\h\h

133
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,120
Western internet to try and sway opinion in the\h
Western World or in other countries to me that's\h\h

134
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,280
offensive to me. But I'm not going out there\h
reporting their content and you're not finding\h\h

135
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,840
thousands or millions of potential people getting\h
paid or voluntarily going to report their content\h\h

136
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,480
either. So when I say they're winning, they're\h
actively using Western platforms and freedom\h\h

137
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,200
of speech that they themselves ban in their own\h
country to spread their own oppressive message.

138
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,160
And I just find that kind of ironic because you\h
have numbers on your side. So when someone like\h\h

139
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,560
me or you, or Winston tries to put out content\h
and information and stuff that we truly believe\h\h

140
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,760
about the Communist Party of China,\h
and we get mass attacks, mass flags,\h\h

141
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,800
not to mention the death threats and all that\h
other kind of stuff that I'm sure you're very\h\h

142
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,880
familiar with, they don't have to deal with\h
that. So from that aspect, they're winning,\h\h

143
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,040
they have the platform and the tools to do that,\h
the money to do that and the audience to do that.

144
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,240
Why is the Chinese Communist Party so concerned\h
about what YouTube shows have to say about China?

145
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,920
Well, I think there's a couple of reasons. One\h
thing that really bothers the Chinese Communist\h\h

146
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Party is that they're worried that when a Chinese\h
person does in fact use a VPN, maybe it's an\h\h

147
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
English savvy person. When they go over to the\h
other side of the internet, they want to make\h\h

148
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,760
sure that they have enough content for them\h
to consume, to confirm their internal bias. So\h\h

149
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,160
we know how the Chinese brainwashing system works\h
and the education system of Government of China.\h\h

150
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,520
People are, if they're a little bit curious,\h
I'm not talking about dissidence or anything,\h\h

151
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,720
if they're a little bit curious and they want\h
to hop over to the English speaking internet\h\h

152
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,640
or a place where they can freely express\h
their opinions or consume other opinions,\h\h

153
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,440
they want to make sure that there is enough\h
domestic type media there. So you got CGTN,\h\h

154
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,720
you have pro-CCP Western YouTubers that are\h
definitely a huge force right now in terms of\h\h

155
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,800
attracting Chinese nationalist audiences\h
on the other side of the internet.

156
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
And they want to make sure that it's kind of\h
a safe place. So it's just people like us,\h\h

157
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,120
our dissenting voices are actually kind of drown\h
out in that whole mess, but there's also the other\h\h

158
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,000
thing is that China has a huge prerogative\h
to want to sway Western opinion to make\h\h

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,800
its own system look good. So when you hear all of\h
this news, let's say, or opinions from us about\h\h

160
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
how oppressive freedom of speech is, the freedom\h
of religion and all these issues that China\h\h

161
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,880
has really horrible track record with.\h
When you hear about all these things,\h\h

162
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,040
but then you hear a ton of other opinions that\h
kind of drown that out, or kind of make that less\h\h

163
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,960
reliable and you see other people able to post\h
on YouTube on these supposedly websites that\h\h

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,560
are blocked in China, Facebook and YouTube,\h
but how do these people get away with it? How\h\h

165
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
does this person walk around with a camera\h
in China and just say whatever they like?

166
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,880
It starts to create questioning in people's minds\h
and when you have mainstream media here in the\h\h

167
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,640
U.S. that really just preys on the insecurities\h
of people and really likes to big up chaos and\h\h

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,680
all kinds of busy clickbait media, when you have\h
this kind of zeitgeist, but then you see this\h\h

169
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,840
bastion of stability that China likes to portray.\h
It all of a sudden becomes a little bit more\h\h

170
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,720
palatable in authoritarian system like China.\h
Number two, you have China's prerogative of\h\h

171
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,120
just wanting to have soft power throughout the\h
world, whether it's financially benefiting them or\h\h

172
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,360
diplomatically as well. So it's not just Americans\h
that are watching the Chinese media stuff.\h\h

173
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,240
It's not just their prerogative to... I'm trying\h
to formulate here, but our channels for them are\h\h

174
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,960
dangerous because it offers a differing opinion\h
to something they dumped millions and millions\h\h

175
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,000
of dollars and man hours into trying to portray.\h
It flies in the face of all that. So if we have a\h\h

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,200
big enough audience, that's a big threat to their\h
hegemony. It's a big threat to their influence.

177
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
So moving forward, what are you guys going to do?

178
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,320
I mean, honestly, like an interview like\h
this, where we're talking about it openly,\h\h

179
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,360
we're all in the same boat here. We'd like\h
to see YouTube actually be a little bit more\h\h

180
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,360
transparent I'd like them to reach out to me\h
[inaudible 00:13:47] and tell us why content is\h\h

181
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,440
being flagged. I want to know is the concept being\h
flagged, what is being flagged for and why someone\h\h

182
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,760
would manually review that content as something\h
that it's not? I don't want a reply in this email\h\h

183
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,600
chain to be like, "Oh, we thank you for\h
your cooperation." I want to know why?\h\h

184
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,880
When I ask why I expect a reason why. As a content\h
creator, we're putting our intellectual property,\h\h

185
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,200
we're putting our ideas and hard work out\h
there. I expect to know why something happened.

186
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,800
I understand that I, you and Winston are using a\h
platform that has community guidelines and rules,\h\h

187
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,240
but those community guidelines and rules\h
haven't been broken in these videos that I'm\h\h

188
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,040
referring to. So I'd like to them to\h\h

189
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
not just say that they're being transparent\h
with these new tools of human moderation,\h\h

190
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,280
but telling... Giving concrete reasons as to why\h
content is still being demonetized or removed.

191
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,800
Well, thanks for joining me today\h
and sharing this story with us.

192
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
You're welcome, Chris. Thank you for having me.

193
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,280
So at this point I think it’s pretty important\h
to like and share this episode so more people\h\h

194
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,960
can know about how the Chinese Communist Party\h
is influencing what you can watch on YouTube.

195
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,360
Also, coming out today is the 100th\h
episode of the China Unscripted podcast,\h\h

196
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,280
and I had both Matt from Laowhy86 and Winston\h
from SerpentZa (Corner Box both) on for an\h\h

197
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,560
incredible interview. Check\h
out the link below for that.\h

198
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
I’ve also put a link to Matt’s episode below,\h\h

199
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
be sure to check it out and\h
subscribe to his channel as well.

200
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:35,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
