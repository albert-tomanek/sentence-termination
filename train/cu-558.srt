1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,410
North Korea’s new missile has China going
ballistic.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,690
The world’s oceans belong to all mankind.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,120
Except for the ones that belong to China.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,670
And multi-party democracy?

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,190
That’s evil.

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,430
Unless people’s votes don’t actually count;

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,670
then it’s fine.

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,240
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,860
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,970
In our top story,

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,300
North Korea has successfully completed

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,160
another missile test.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,180
According to the totally unbiased reporting

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,390
from state-run media,

17
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,710
it’s capable of striking

18
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,000
“anywhere in whole US mainland.”

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,680
Don’t worry,

20
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,370
because US President Donald Trump

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,579
still has a good bromance going on

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,240
with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
After a phone call,

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,989
new sanctions are on the way!

25
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,760
But there’s one thing the Chinese regime

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,890
is still exporting to North Korea: refugees.

27
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,260
Like one mother and son who were recently
caught

28
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,760
attempting to flee North Korea.

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,580
They crossed the border into China,

30
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,840
ultimately on their way to South Korea.

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,750
That’s where the husband/father is waiting

32
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,480
after himself fleeing in 2015.

33
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,990
His name is Lee,

34
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,210
and he’s sent a message to Xi Jinping

35
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,200
begging him to save his family.

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,700
“When defectors are caught

37
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,930
trying to go to South Korea,

38
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,420
Lee tells me they’re sent to political camps,

39
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,830
and never leave.

40
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,180
From what I know, in 2–3 years,

41
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,130
maybe less, you’ll wither to death.”

42
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,909
The Chinese regime should know how wrong that
is!

43
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,869
They’ve been able to keep prisoners alive

44
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,229
in Chinese forced labor camps for over a decade...

45
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,500
before they wither to death.

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,050
But not wanting to be outdone by North Korea,

47
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,790
either in cruelty or missile technology,

48
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,850
the Chinese regime is close to rolling out

49
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,750
its own ballistic missile capable of striking

50
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,990
anywhere in the world.

51
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,920
They even broadcast a series of videos

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,150
on state-run TV about it.

53
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,310
But don’t worry.

54
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,470
The Chinese Communist Party

55
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,759
is committed to world peace.

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,580
They only kill innocent people inside China.

57
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,880
Speaking of people inside China,

58
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,670
a Chinese court this week sentenced

59
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,689
a Taiwanese activist to five years in prison.

60
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,349
We talked about Lee Ming-che back in September.

61
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,379
Well this week he was found guilty

62
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,439
of “subverting state power”

63
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,079
by promoting dangerous ideas

64
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,719
in group messaging chats.

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,049
Ideas like like multi-party democracy.

66
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,409
His sentence has the bonus effect

67
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:32,189
of striking fear into the hearts of Chinese
activists

68
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,379
and the people of Taiwan in general.

69
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,239
Instead of promoting multi-party democracy,

70
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,939
what Lee should have done,

71
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:39,939
is promote the system

72
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:42,239
they already have in mainland China,

73
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,380
which is...multi-party cooperation.

74
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,579
You see, while China has eight political parties

75
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,060
other than the Chinese Communist Party,

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,099
the CCP is “the sole party exercising political
leadership

77
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,760
in this system of multi-party cooperation.”

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Cooperation means that all the parties are
equal.

79
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,559
The CCP is just more equal than everyone else.

80
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:08,129
And besides, everyone knows that Chinese people

81
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,680
aren’t ready for democracy!

82
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,010
Unless they live in Taiwan…

83
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,019
And apparently Chinese people aren’t ready

84
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,249
for violent video games, either.

85
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:20,540
That’s why hit South Korean multiplayer
shooter

86
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,739
PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, or PUBG,

87
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,180
is coming to China...

88
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,279
with Chinese characteristics.

89
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,790
Chinese tech giant Tencent has bought the
rights

90
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,709
to bring PUBG to China.

91
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,620
And they’ve agreed to make some changes

92
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,730
to the original South Korean version.

93
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,809
Chinese censors had said the game was

94
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:42,370
“too violent and said it would likely be
blocked

95
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,989
because it ‘severely deviates from socialist
core values.’”

96
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,199
But what could be more in line with socialist
core values

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,980
than violence and senseless killing?

98
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,320
Maybe they can just slap some

99
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,290
Communist Party flags in the background,

100
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,520
and then it will be ok.

101
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,260
That's at least what another video game company in China did.

102
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,400
The blood just blends in.

103
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,639
And speaking of sticking to core values,

104
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,069
a Chinese scholar is criticizing India

105
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,879
for doing military drills in the Indian Ocean.

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,299
He says, “It should be stressed that

107
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,560
the Indian Ocean belongs to all mankind,

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,150
and India’s actions are an attempt to

109
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,830
turn the ocean into India’s territorial
waters,

110
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,530
which is a violation of International Law.”

111
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,880
All the world’s oceans froze over in irony.

112
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,410
And the Trump Administration is making another
move

113
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,100
against the Chinese regime for unfair trade
practices.

114
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,260
The Commerce Department has officially launched

115
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,230
a probe into China’s aluminum exports to
the US.

116
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,720
If China is found to be dumping at prices

117
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,570
that are artificially low,

118
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,380
the US could impose tariffs.

119
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,590
And it’s not just the US

120
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,730
that’s having trade trouble with China.

121
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,440
A group of German businesses is warning

122
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,220
that some German companies may pull out of
China.

123
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,780
Why?

124
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,020
Because of “a request from the ruling Communist
Party

125
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,040
to set up cells in their companies.”

126
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Apparently, there are already more than 100,000

127
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,590
foreign-invested companies in China

128
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,660
that have a Party secretary embedded with
their staff.

129
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,620
It’s something the Communist Party requires.

130
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,680
But hey, who doesn’t want a Party in their
company?

131
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,440
Oh, wait.

132
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,780
The Germans don’t.

133
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,340
That actually makes sense.

134
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,010
So what do you think of this week’s news?

135
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,780
Leave your comments below.

136
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,010
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,700
