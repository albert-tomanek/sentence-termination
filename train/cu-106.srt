1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,620
Trump announces new tariffs...

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,280
10% on $300 billion in goods...

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,179
Because of China’s broken promises

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,419
and Beijing’s Seven Deadly Sins

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,400
Is there any hope for a trade deal?

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,700
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,990
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,740
President Trump is disappointed

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,060
that the Chinese Communist Party

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,080
has been dragging its claws on trade talks.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,600
So last week,

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,460
Tariff Man said he plans to slap new tariffs
on China.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,500
“The U.S. will start, on September 1st,

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,180
putting a small additional Tariff of 10%

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,960
on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods
and products

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,540
coming from China into our Country.”

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,390
That would be in addition to the existing

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,370
25% tariff on $250 billion in Chinese goods.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,770
And it would mean that basically ALL GOODS

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,780
coming into the US from China would now have
a tariff.

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,920
For American consumers,

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,150
there's good news and bad news.

23
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,440
Products that were spared in previous rounds
of tariffs

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,930
will now be hit.

25
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,110
That includes smartphones,

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,760
clothing, toys, and video games.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,260
But fear not, Fortnite fans!

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,030
According to Trump’s trade advisor Peter
Navarro,

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,750
American consumers won't feel the pain

30
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,940
because China will absorb the tariffs

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,690
"by slashing their prices and by devaluing
their currency."

32
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,220
But would they really do that?

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,550
Well, on Monday,

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,159
China’s central bank set its exchange rate

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,760
at a weaker level than 6.9 yuan to the dollar,

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,060
for the first time since December.

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,990
And the offshore yuan sank to a record low.

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,150
That means the yuan devalued against the dollar,

39
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,950
which makes Chinese exports cheaper.

40
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,870
So even though there will be tariffs,

41
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,670
the cheaper cost of Chinese exports would
mean

42
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,320
the price American consumers pay will be essentially
the same.

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,790
Which means China is absorbing the cost of
the tariffs.

44
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,030
But the Chinese central bank can’t keep
that up forever,

45
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,220
or they will wreck their own economy.

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,850
But that’s a topic for another video.

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,479
Back to the tariffs, which Trump announced
on—

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,479
where else—

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,479
Twitter.

50
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,180
"Our representatives have just returned from
China

51
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,920
where they had constructive talks

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,319
having to do with a future Trade Deal.

53
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,279
We thought we had a deal with China three
months ago,

54
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,489
but sadly,

55
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,719
China decided to re-negotiate the deal prior
to signing."

56
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,989
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

57
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,120
and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,629
had gone to Shanghai to breathe life into
the half-dead trade talks.

59
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,989
But apparently it was more like trying to
give CPR to a zombie.

60
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,769
Trump was maybe just being polite

61
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,560
when he called the talks “constructive”,

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,409
because insiders told the Wall Street Journal

63
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:49,040
that the Shanghai trade talks were "brief
and unproductive."

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,139
Which is at least better than “long and
unproductive,”

65
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,980
like getting a Master’s degree at NYU.

66
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,989
On the plus side,

67
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,379
while visiting Shanghai,

68
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,519
Lighthizer and Mnuchin probably got to eat

69
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,919
those those fancy little soup dumplings.

70
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,299
So America’s trade guys returned from China,

71
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,069
after being told essentially that the Chinese
Communist Party

72
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,959
would not agree to the US’s demands.

73
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,790
And then Tariff Man did what Tariff Man does:

74
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,290
He announced the new 10% tariffs.

75
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,390
On Twitter.

76
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,389
Trump is upset about what he feels are two
broken promises.

77
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:21,599
Back in December,

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,519
Trump had met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping
at the G20.

79
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,629
Afterwards, the White House said

80
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,799
China agreed to purchase a very substantial
amount of

81
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,709
agricultural and other products from the United
States.

82
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,279
This...did not happen.

83
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,840
The White House also said China

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,760
would stop the illegal exports of fentanyl.

85
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,010
That’s the synthetic opioid that’s played

86
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,209
a big part in America’s deadly drug epidemic.

87
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,919
Xi Jinping, “in a wonderful humanitarian
gesture,

88
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,359
has agreed to designate Fentanyl as a Controlled
Substance,

89
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:55,180
meaning that people selling Fentanyl to the
United States

90
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,959
will be subject to China’s maximum penalty
under the law.”

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,249
Well, there wasn’t much of a humanitarian
gesture, after all.

92
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:06,019
Fentanyl has continued to flow from China
into the US.

93
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,689
Although, to be fair to the communist regime,

94
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:12,489
if you read China’s official statements
from the G20,

95
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,959
China technically only agreed to “work to
open its market”

96
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,609
to US agricultural products

97
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,970
and “start working to adjust [fentanyl]
related regulations.”

98
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,580
It’s like when you tell your wife,

99
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,360
“I’ll start working on considering mowing
the lawn.”

100
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,780
She can’t prove you never started working
on considering it!

101
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,370
But technicalities don’t mean much to Trump,

102
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,711
since at the end of the day,

103
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:36,419
the Chinese Communist Party is still not buying

104
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,509
enough American goods,

105
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,759
and Chinese fentanyl is still killing Americans.

106
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,940
Hence, the new tariffs.

107
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,970
And that’s also why the enforcement mechanism

108
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,349
for any future US-China trade deal

109
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,840
has been a critical sticking point.

110
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
According to experts cited by the South China
Morning Post,

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,340
given the lack of transparency of the Chinese
economy,

112
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,669
and Beijing’s history of breaking previous
pledges,

113
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,970
the US side wants enforcement to be quote
unquote "painful."

114
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,430
At a February hearing of the House Committee
on Ways and Means,

115
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,789
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer hinted
at

116
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,000
just what kind of pain the US has in mind.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,930
“[We] are very aware of the history of

118
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,050
our trading relationship with China,

119
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,740
and the disappointments that have resulted

120
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,099
from promises that were not kept,” Lighthizer
said.

121
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,129
“The enforcement process will be very specific.

122
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,250
It will have layers,

123
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,330
it will have time frames,

124
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,849
it will have reaction.”

125
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,069
Experts say that the US wants to do

126
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,300
something called a “snapback.”

127
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,090
Which sounds like\h when you say “oh snap!”

128
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,090
while delivering a clapback.

129
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,090
But actually,

130
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,600
it’s a unilateral verification system.

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,490
The “snapback” option would let the US
review

132
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,020
whether China is keeping its side of the bargain.

133
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,099
Tariffs on Chinese goods would be removed,

134
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,539
but if China breaks the agreement,

135
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,509
the US would just snap them back into place.

136
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:58,509
For example:

137
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,479
A key goal for the US is to reduce its trade
deficit with China.

138
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,350
But if, let’s say, the reduction targets
are not met by a certain date,

139
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,460
the tariffs would automatically snap back
into place.

140
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,050
Now it should come as no surprise that the
Chinese regime

141
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,500
does not like this snapback option.

142
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,130
They’d prefer a trade dispute system like
the one

143
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,560
used at the World Trade Organisation—

144
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,409
where representatives from each side

145
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,870
have to agree on the enforcement.

146
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,039
You know, the same mechanism that’s been
in place for decades,

147
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,039
where the Chinese regime can keep cheating
with no consequences.

148
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,000
In fact, WTO dispute resolutions often drag
on for years.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,920
And that's perfect!

150
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,290
Because in its trade talks with the US,

151
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,599
the Chinese Communist Party can just run out
the clock.

152
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,699
See,Trump only has at most 6 more years in
office,

153
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,060
but Xi Jinping gets to be presitator for life!

154
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,710
Which is why Trump is not likely to agree
to anything without strong enforcement.

155
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,409
And what needs enforcing?

156
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,539
Well, it’s what White House trade adviser
Peter Navarro

157
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,300
calls Beijing's “seven deadly sins.”

158
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,060
“Stop stealing our intellectual property,

159
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,379
stop forcing technology transfers,

160
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,419
stop hacking our computers

161
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,719
and steal[ing] our trade secrets,

162
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,060
stop dumping into our markets

163
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,819
and putting our companies out of business,

164
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:21,909
stop state-owned enterprises from heavy subsidies,

165
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,010
stop the fentanyl,

166
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,889
and stop the currency manipulation."

167
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,370
Of course, the Chinese Communist Party

168
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,620
doesn’t know about the Seven Deadly Sins.

169
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,350
They never went to Catholic school!

170
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,860
Or watched that weird Brad Pitt movie from
the 90s.

171
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,249
I suggest using a more awkward

172
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,479
Chinese communist propaganda name,

173
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,729
like the “7 Stops.”

174
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,039
Not that that would actually stop them.

175
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,690
In fact, in response to Trump announcing the
new tariffs,

176
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,939
Chinese authorities devalued their currency,

177
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:50,810
which makes it harder for US companies to
sell stuff in China.

178
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,219
And they ordered Chinese state-owned companies

179
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,439
to stop importing US agricultural goods.

180
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,419
And then China's UN delegate Zhang Jun

181
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,689
blasted Trump's tariff threat as “an irrational,

182
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,699
irresponsible act.”

183
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:12,289
“We do oppose that sanction decision has
been made,

184
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:19,029
and we definitely will take whatever necessary
countermeasures

185
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,249
to protect our fundamental right.”

186
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:26,300
Yes, the Communist Party has a fundamental
right...

187
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,069
to not be punished for cheating on trade!

188
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:30,900
Still, Trump is part carrot,

189
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,669
part stick when it comes to negotiating with
China.

190
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,169
Trump tweet-fed a bit of carrot,

191
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,730
saying he’ll continue positive dialogue...

192
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,770
and referring to Xi Jinping as his friend.

193
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,900
And the stick?

194
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,660
Well after the Chinese central bank let the
yuan fall,

195
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,410
which the central bank says totally had nothing
to do with the tariffs...

196
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,600
the US Treasury Department immediately did

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,920
what Trump had promised to do as his first
thing in office:

198
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,310
label China a currency manipulator.

199
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,870
Now practically speaking,

200
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,601
officially calling China a currency manipulator

201
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,950
doesn’t do much for now.

202
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,790
But it’s a heck of a snapback.

203
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,100
So what do you think about Trump's

204
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,430
new threat to impose tariffs on China?

205
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,030
Leave your comments below.

206
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,730
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

207
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,580
a patron who supports China Uncensored

208
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,410
with a dollar or more per episode

209
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,140
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

210
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,820
Philip Conway asks:

211
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,180
“Did the Chinese Communist Party get a grip
of Italy

212
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,720
just so they can get hold of their ice cream

213
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,700
even though it's not quite as good as the
Russian type?”

214
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,210
The Communist Party wanted Italy to join the
Belt and Road—

215
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,600
not for the ice cream,

216
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,340
but for the political influence.

217
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,060
Also, the ports.

218
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,860
Italy is one of the world’s top 10 economies.

219
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,890
Plus, the Belt and Road is a great way for
Chinese regime

220
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,910
to make more European countries

221
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,350
more dependent on Chinese money,

222
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,950
and that gives them more sway over European
politics.

223
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,370
Also, I know that Xi Jinping enjoys his Russian
ice cream,

224
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,261
but I’m not convinced it’s better than
gelato.

225
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:02,190
I’ll have to try it next time I go to Moscow...

226
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,190
Or Brighton Beach.

227
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,790
What’s that, Shelley?

228
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,890
Oh yes.

229
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,070
Shelley is going to Italy in a month,

230
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,220
so if you have any tips on who she should
talk to

231
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,470
for information on China’s growing influence
in Italy,

232
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,330
email us at chinauncensored@gmail.com.

233
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,100
Thanks for your question, Philip!

234
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,530
And thank you to everyone who’s watching.

235
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,590

236
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,660
