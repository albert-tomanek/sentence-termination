1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,120
Chinese groups are banding together

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,560
To stand up to the CCP

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,120
Can they force it to change?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,040
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,800
The People’s Republic of China is a nation of many\h
nations. Dozens of happy ethnic minority groups\h\h

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,640
from places like Tibet, East Turkestan,\h
and Southern Mongolia came together...

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,560
...to be forcibly conquered by\h
the People’s Liberation Army.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,400
Yes, after decades of struggle, the communists\h
have finally—finally!—turned China...

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,840
... into the shape of a giant chicken.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,640
But some of these chicken\h
parts—I mean, captive nations—are\h\h

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
now banding together to stand up\h
to the Chinese Communist Party.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,080
For more, I sat down with Se Hoon Kim. He’s\h
the director of the Captive Nations Coalition,\h\h

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,280
which is part of the Committee\h
on Present Danger: China.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
Thanks for joining me today.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,240
Thank you, Chris.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
So tell me, what is the Captive Nations Coalition?

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,120
So the Captain Nations Coalition\h
is a coalition that's made up of\h\h

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,120
individuals from communities that are\h
and have been taken over by the CCP.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,160
So mainly those communities of Southern\h
Mongolia, East Turkestan, Tibet,\h\h

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,360
and really all of China as well. And we have also\h
expanded to communities that are under the threat\h\h

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,520
of takeover by the CCP. So specifically nations\h
that are under the Belt and Road Initiative,\h\h

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,120
as well as other political dealings with the\h
Chinese Communist Party at the present time.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,640
So how the FBI has been warning about China's\h
Operation Fox Hunt, where they intimidate\h\h

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,160
Chinese diaspora overseas, and trying to\h
get them to go back to mainland China,\h\h

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,000
that's also part of this captive nation?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Absolutely. Those individuals are\h
targeted for a specific reason.

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Mainly these are dissidents from China that\h
happened speaking out against the government\h\h

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,120
policies set by the party itself. And\h
the Chinese Communist Party simply does\h\h

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,920
not want that to be alive, as it is in this\h
country or elsewhere around the world. So,\h\h

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,040
absolutely, they are part of this entire\h
coalition and really a more of a bigger campaign\h\h

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,560
to battle the CCP as much as we can.

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
And so this is why the captive nations is not just\h\h

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
ethnicities like Tibetans or Mongolians\h
or Uyghurs, but do also include Hong Kong.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely Hong Kong\h
and anybody who loves freedom, but is under the\h\h

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,520
threat of either losing their freedom or have\h
lost that freedom under the grass of the CCP.

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,680
That is what the coalition is actually made up of.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,840
Okay. And you've spearheaded\h
this coalition, correct?

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,600
Well, right now I am spearheading it as\h\h

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,640
a director, but it also came into being because\h
of the Committee on Present Danger: China.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,560
And this idea came after we have discovered\h
that there are number of communities\h\h

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,520
that could actually serve as evidence as\h
to why the CCP is a criminal organization,\h\h

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,000
which is another project that we're working on.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
Well, labeling the CCP as an actual\h
transnational criminal organization.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
Absolutely. That is actually one of our\h
main projects right now to designate them,\h\h

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,000
because we have so many members. At least just\h
within the coalition that can actually speak\h\h

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,120
about the horrors of the CCP. I forgot to mention\h
that the Falun Gong community is also a huge part\h\h

48
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,360
of our coalition as well. And I mentioned that\h
very proudly because of the fact that the Falun\h\h

49
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,320
Gong community, like many other communities\h
before, have been that voice in the world\h\h

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,320
where from the get-go have been telling us\h
all how much of a threat the CCP really is.

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,440
But unfortunately many of us just\h
didn't listen, including myself.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, yeah?

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,840
Right. Absolutely. Who I thought at one point it\h
was this crazy cult group, right? That wanted to\h\h

54
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,160
negatively impact China. Right.

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,720
It used to be fairly pro CCP.

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,200
I was. I absolutely was. And\h\h

57
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,680
what's really interesting about that is that\h
I was very pro CCP until I started college.

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,000
So you went to college and became anti-communist?

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Very anti-communist.

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay.

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,960
So just to you a short summary of it, up until\h
my first semester of my freshman year in college,\h\h

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:48,080
I thought, well, China's going to be that next big\h
target for success, for any global achievements.\h\h

63
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,800
It seems like they're doing an amazing job.\h
Remember I grew up in an age to where Beijing\h\h

64
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Olympics was apparently one of the biggest\h
achievements by the Chinese government, right?

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
So at one point I thought, well,\h
look, they've achieved all of this,\h\h

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
and they brought themselves out of\h
poverty and there's something that\h\h

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,920
must be being done right, in that sense, right? 
So as I came to college though, I think\h\h

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,560
one thing that really changed at all was actually\h
looking at the other side, which I did not do.\h\h

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,280
So one of the things I did was reading up\h
on the Tiananmen Square Massacre, right? \h

70
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
Why is it called a massacre? At one\h
point I just thought, well, it's just,\h\h

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,680
every country has a protest, right? Maybe this was\h
just one of them.   Why make such a big deal about\h\h

72
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,800
it?  But as I read the memoirs of individuals\h
that were actually underground, I thought, well,\h\h

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,200
is this really the China that I read about that\h
I've come to respect so much?  And the other thing\h\h

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,840
that I would recommend everyone to do is actually\h
talk to the people that have been oppressed by the\h\h

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,320
CCP. Which even going back to captain nation's\h
coalition, this such experiences actually became\h\h

76
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,440
a cornerstone, at least in my heart, for me\h
to just engage with all these communities.

77
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:12,000
I think one experience that I've had was talking\h
to a Falun Gong practitioner. And again, that was\h\h

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,320
in the middle of winter and flushing,\h
right in front of the Queens Library.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,160
These ladies who are in these\h
yellow shirts I would say,\h\h

80
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,600
with the words that says Falun Dafa is Good. 
I would even say negative 20 degree winter,\h\h

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,520
they stand there and make sure that things are\h
actually distributed.   So make sure that people\h\h

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,280
have the information that they want them to have.\h
And really, they're extremely genuine about it.\h\h

83
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,040
I know because I actually went over there\h
and began a conversation with a lady.

84
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
Oh!

85
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,320
Which made a huge difference. Because\h
right around that time, I still wasn't\h\h

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:03,280
fully convinced that CCP is this evil. But\h
then when I talked to this lady, something just\h\h

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,840
opened within my heart. And I say open because\h
I felt like I was blind up until that point.

88
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,480
I still didn't really understand what it meant,\h
but it just, something was telling me you've been\h\h

89
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,760
blind, but something has been opened. I was like,\h
okay. And it's something that this lady has said.\h\h

90
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,640
This lady actually told me\h
about the story of her sister,\h\h

91
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,520
how she misses her sister. And not only\h
that, she says her sister has been tortured,\h\h

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,120
arbitrarily arrested, even after being released\h
in China and harassed every single day.\h\h

93
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:50,800
And I think the other biggest factor was that she\h
was extremely sincere and genuine about it. Now,\h\h

94
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,600
anybody in that situation would be, but she also\h
didn't say anything out of hatred against anybody.

95
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
That's surprising.

96
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,240
It is very surprising. And that, I feel like\h
was one of the biggest things that just really\h\h

97
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,160
opened up my heart. Because I would have thought,\h
well, if anybody did that to my family members,\h\h

98
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,960
I would be this angry, irrational person\h
all the time out of fear or what have you.\h\h

99
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,200
But none of that was present in this lady.\h
So... And she was really genuine about\h\h

100
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,840
just having this conversation with me. And at\h
the end of that conversation, she gave me a hug.\h\h

101
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,960
And I think that just... Something just\h
clicked on my mind and and I heard something\h\h

102
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,960
in the lines of, this could have been your mom,\h
your aunt, anybody in your neighborhood that you\h\h

103
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,920
knew that you held dear. How would you feel if\h
something like that happened to one of them?\h\h

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,640
So a lot of things happen in that small\h
span of time, but that was a very, very,\h\h

105
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,920
very heavenly experienced. And I've\h
had that led me up to what I am today.

106
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
Well, I think you touched on... That\h
was a beautiful story by the way.

107
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,040
But you touched on something that\h
a lot of people just don't know.

108
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,600
Sure.

109
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Like they buy into the Chinese Communist\h
Party propaganda about the Beijing Olympics.\h\h

110
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
How is the Captive Nations Coalition trying to\h\h

111
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
raise awareness about the crimes\h
of the Chinese Communist Party?

112
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,680
Well, firstly, we believe that personal\h
testimonies, first and foremost,\h\h

113
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,880
is probably the most important and the most\h
effective tool to create awareness, and also\h\h

114
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,840
create this environment where people can\h
at least think about what they can do.

115
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,800
So that's what we've been doing. The other\h
thing that I would even say that makes a huge\h\h

116
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,080
difference, is that the Captive Nations Coalition\h
have been also United in a way that I haven't seen\h\h

117
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,480
before in my entire time of getting involved in\h
this issue, which has been eight years already.

118
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,080
What I mean by that is, yes, over the years, I've\h
seen protests where you see different groups like\h\h

119
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,120
Southern Mongolians, Tibetans, Taiwanese, Hong\h
Kong, et cetera,   all in the same protest,\h\h

120
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,640
yelling out human rights atrocities and their\h
own issues, right?  And then me being United in\h\h

121
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,840
whatever they were celebrating at\h
that time or protesting at that time.

122
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,920
But this coalition, I would say for the first\h
time, have not only touched upon the human rights\h\h

123
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,400
aspects of what it's been going on there, but\h
also at the same time, they're all United under\h\h

124
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,000
this banner of, we want genuine freedom\h
and we will achieve it through the will\h\h

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,480
of the global society, pretty much\h
specifically by the freedom loving people\h\h

126
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
of the United States and really the\h
rest of the world that truly understands\h\h

127
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,280
what threat really means when it comes\h
from an authoritarian government.

128
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,760
So that's a very beautiful part about the\h
coalition, because they're also serving as an\h\h

129
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,120
example to the rest of the world of what could\h
happen if you're compliant on tyranny or...\h\h

130
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,360
And I'm not saying that these communities\h
were compliant, but at the end of the day,\h\h

131
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,400
these communities were extremely weak, militarily,\h
compared to compared to the CCP at that time. So\h\h

132
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,480
look at Tibet, for example, they had no\h
chance militarily against the Chinese, right?

133
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
But the takeover did happen. So\h
stuff like that. We are touching upon\h\h

134
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,440
a lot of the things that happened in the\h
past, and they're really showing it to the\h\h

135
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
rest of the world, telling them that,\h
look, whatever happened to these people\h\h

136
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,360
in principle and in nature, can also happen\h
to all of us, if we do not understand and\h\h

137
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,320
come to this realization that the CCP\h
is a threat and must be dealt with.

138
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Now, I know you were talking about using\h
this coalition to present evidence. Where\h\h

139
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,760
are you presenting that evidence? Because\h
I imagine it's very difficult to actually\h\h

140
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,080
apply pressure to the Chinese Communist Party.

141
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,280
Sure. So one of the things that the Chinese\h
Communist Party feels is I would say, yes, global\h\h

142
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,720
government's policies could be a factor. But I\h
would say the biggest weapon that we have against\h\h

143
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:36,320
them is societal awareness and societal unity\h
that comes to the point of saying CCP is a threat,\h

144
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,520
 because of look what has happened\h
to the Falun Gong practitioners,\h

145
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,320
 Southern Mongolians,  Tibetans,\h
  concentration camps in East Turkestan.\h

146
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,400
 They're afraid of that, because once CCP loses\h
this global standing, they absolutely have no\h\h

147
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,000
more legitimacy in the world. And they don't\h
have legitimacy in China in the first place.

148
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,920
And somewhere along the lines, at one point in\h
the future, we believe that the Chinese people\h\h

149
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,080
will do something about it. Will get to a point\h
where they will say, we need to do something\h\h

150
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,480
about this, even though it looks bleak right now\h
because of the oppression that's present. But we\h\h

151
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,800
believe that with such unity, right, from the\h
outside world and with the Chinese people, that\h\h

152
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,560
could really make a difference. And unfortunately,\h
right now we don't see much of that, but we hoped\h\h

153
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:37,600
to change it. So that's what we're trying to do.\h
Just create this unity and that we have to come to\h\h

154
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,520
a conclusion that the CCP is a threat to\h
all of us, including the Chinese people.

155
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,520
No more a friendly competition between\h
nations, a place to invest bonds.

156
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Sure.

157
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
How are you going to convince Wall Street to that?

158
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,760
Well, Wall Street is a big problem and has\h
been a big problem from the get-go, right?

159
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,480
Remember, past administrations have opened up\h
our markets to the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

160
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:13,840
thinking that somehow with the liberal open\h
economy, China will change, right?  And look\h\h

161
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,880
what has happened, right? Did they change?  No,\h
it progressively have gotten worse, right?

162
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,920
And it's also right around that time\h
when China entered the WTO.  The\h\h

163
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,080
persecution against the Falun Gong started, right?

164
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,840
That should have been a big wake up call\h
for the rest of the world. But, Hey, we\h\h

165
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,000
went on to do more business with them. So how\h
are we going to convince Wall Street? Well,\h\h

166
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
to be honest, I don't think there's\h
any need to convince anybody really,\h\h

167
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,560
because... And that's where the role of the\h
TCO or the Transnational Criminal Organization\h\h

168
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,640
effort or initiative by our part comes in, is\h
that once you designate them for what they are,\h\h

169
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,000
anything that you do with them becomes at\h
least being compliant with a criminal activity.

170
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
I think that's why Apple has been\h
fighting against the legislation\h\h

171
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,720
to [stop] the forced labor in China. 
Oh, yeah. Apple and a number of other\h\h

172
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,680
companies, they do not want to lose their\h
marketing grounds foresee in China. But also,\h\h

173
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:23,040
as it has been revealed in many of these\h
classified documents or a lot of the articles\h\h

174
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,480
that are out there, a lot of our business\h
executives and even our congressmen, right?

175
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:36,320
Has had some very, very, very shady\h
deals with the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

176
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:43,680
indirectly. And through that, you see\h
the nature of how they work. Because,\h\h

177
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,600
the way that they do things isn't respectable\h
by all means, and that should scare us.\h\h

178
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,400
Because, they're not playing in terms\h
of the rules that we have created.

179
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,640
Normal countries don't try and honey trap.

180
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,880
No, we don't. No country would try to do that\h
in the scale that the CCP is doing right now.

181
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,440
Well, so you said a big part of this\h
is raising awareness, people watching.

182
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:07,760
Yeah.

183
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,840
Obviously people watching are\h
interested in wanting to know\h\h

184
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,800
what's happening. But how can they\h
play a role in spreading awareness?\h\h

185
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,200
How can they feel like they're\h
doing something to make a change?

186
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,640
Well, firstly, don't stop talking about it.\h
Talk to every single one of your family members,\h\h

187
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,400
if you have to. And I believe that if every\h
single American does that, at least here,\h\h

188
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,920
it will make a difference. Why? Because I\h
believe that individuals may push for policies,\h\h

189
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,520
right? Call up their congressmen. It's your\h
right. We have to exercise it. And by doing that,\h\h

190
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,400
I believe that we're achieving a lot of things\h
together. You're not only having a moral ground\h\h

191
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,680
in protecting it and exercising it, but you're\h
also preserving the democracy that exists here\h\h

192
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,680
by engaging with your elected representatives.\h
Remember, you're the one that voted those people\h\h

193
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:04,080
in to office. Utilize it. On the same token,\h
think twice about what you buy. Think twice.\h\h

194
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,400
And also it also creates an environment where\h
people put human rights, actual human rights\h\h

195
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,840
into our economy, which has been de linked\h
actually during the Clinton administration, I\h\h

196
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:26,960
believe, and with this false hope that China will\h
will change, which was a huge mistake at times.

197
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah.

198
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,760
And what has been the U S government's\h
response to the Captive Nations Coalition?

199
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,440
Well, we actually had a\h
meeting with secretary Pompeo\h\h

200
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
last week.   And it was extremely\h
inspirational, at least for me, because\h\h

201
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,920
one member from each of the captive nations,\h
specifically three nations that are under the\h\h

202
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,840
captivity of the PRC, and as well as one\h
representative from a country, Kazakhstan,\h\h

203
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,600
that is a huge and a very, very important\h
nation for the Belt and Road Initiative.\h\h

204
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,560
They're all there. And our Mongolian friends,\h
especially one of them actually threw interest\h\h

205
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,800
up in the traditional Mongolian dress. And he\h
actually took a picture with secretary Pompeo.\h\h

206
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,680
That was a huge part. But more importantly,\h
secretary Pompeo was very sympathetic. He\h\h

207
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,640
also took extra time, from what I've heard, to\h
hear from each members of the captive nations.\h\h

208
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,520
And he smiled. I remember him saying, this is\h
a green initiative. And he was in solidarity.

209
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,360
And he actually also talked to a Uyghur friend\h
of mine that I brought, whose sister has been\h\h

210
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,080
sentenced 17 years officially now, after\h
spending years in a concentration camp,\h\h

211
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,080
10 years for having a Quran in her desk and seven\h
years for praying after her father passed away.\h\h

212
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,800
So when secretary Pompeo heard her story,\h
I remember him specifically saying to her,\h\h

213
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,640
me and my wife will be praying for you. So,\h
that told me that at least from the government's\h\h

214
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,120
position, there's a lot of sincerity, at least\h
from individuals that have heard these stories,\h\h

215
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:12,800
right? And it moved a lot of people. And I believe\h
that such policies drawn by such attitudes, will\h\h

216
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,200
do a lot of great things. And I got to\h
say, a lot of the economic actions that\h\h

217
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,400
the administration has taken has been viewed\h
as extremely helpful for the captive nations,\h\h

218
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,000
because they're saying, for the first time,\h
people now know where their money is going.\h\h

219
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
For the first time, people are realizing\h
that they're utilizing slave labor,\h\h

220
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,240
right? In China, whenever you buy\h
something made in China, right?

221
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,240
To a certain degree, right? And this was a win-win\h
situation for everybody in the captive nations,\h\h

222
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,920
right? One, for the Chinese dissident here who\h
has been advocating hard to make this issue come\h\h

223
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:02,800
to light about slave labor practices under\h
the CCP. And for other folks like Tibetan,\h\h

224
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,720
Southern Mongolians and people of East Turkestan,\h
to them, it was another opportunity for them to\h\h

225
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:16,240
tell their stories, the most updated stories as to\h
why people have to act. And I think I should also\h\h

226
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:24,480
add in the fact that they serve as evidence\h
in terms of not only why the CCPs is evil,\h\h

227
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,960
but also at the same time how this evil will\h
spread eventually to our shores one day.

228
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,766
So that's what we've been doing so far. Yeah.

229
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:35,840
So how do you think the CCP would\h
be spreading to the United States?

230
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,880
Well, firstly, I would say that we're\h
a bit late in that, because they have\h\h

231
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,560
already been spreading to a point in\h
our country through business dealings.\h\h

232
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,360
You mentioned Wall Street earlier. It's been\h
proven that a lot of Wall Street... People of\h\h

233
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,800
Wall Street,   that is how I would say, have\h
been engaged with the CCP in multiple fronts,\h\h

234
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,720
even effecting policy to a certain degree. 
I don't know specifically what types of\h\h

235
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,720
actions were taken that shifted what exact\h
policies that were, but I know for a fact that\h\h

236
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,640
something like that has been going on and it\h
is evil. Also intellectual property theft,\h\h

237
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,480
a lot of that also happened because\h
the CCP had a free rein in our country,\h\h

238
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,400
in our markets. And also at the same time, you\h
also see this Fox Hunt that's happening, the FBI\h\h

239
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,360
director Christopher Ray, talked extensively\h
about that, I believe a couple of months ago.

240
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,040
And you have the CCP operatives\h
coming in as business people,\h\h

241
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,080
students even, or even just different forms\h
of scholars and academics or even scientists,\h\h

242
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,160
right? Just pretty much infiltrating into\h
the society, right? Protected under this\h\h

243
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,840
banner of, well, don't say anything against the\h
CCP because it's apparently racist towards us,\h\h

244
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:06,640
when in fact the CCP in no way represents the\h
Chinese people. So, it's in a way already has\h\h

245
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,400
happened, but what I mean by ending up in our\h
shores is that, if you look at the history of\h\h

246
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,480
these captive nations, right, this is where it all\h
started. It all started from this outside force,\h\h

247
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,840
solely seeping into their society in a lot of\h
cases, with all these promises of benefits and\h\h

248
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,440
friendship and brotherhood, whatever they may call\h
it, right? And to an eventual takeover, right?

249
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,320
Now, I'm not saying that the US will be completely\h
taken over by China in some way. That's not what\h\h

250
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,720
I'm saying. But what I'm saying is, we might even\h
see a time if we let things run the way that it is\h\h

251
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:54,560
being run. It has been run in the past. The CCP\h
may be the ones having the final say in things\h\h

252
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,000
when it comes to even our internal affairs.\h
And that is very scary. And we believe that\h\h

253
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:09,120
the Captive Nations Coalition could at least serve\h
as that one community to remind everyone that,\h\h

254
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,720
look, if you do not wake up, what has happened\h
to us will probably most likely happen to all\h\h

255
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:24,000
of you. And I'd like to just end it by saying that\h
at the end of the day, it's the right thing to do.

256
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,680
Giving a voice to those who are craving for\h
our attention. Not because of just the sake\h\h

257
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:38,480
of wanting attention, but really because they\h
have experienced what oppression really is.

258
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
Thank you so much for taking the time to speak\h\h

259
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,440
with me today. I'm glad that you were\h
able to squeeze me in after Mike Pompeo.

260
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,160
Thank you so much.

261
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,640
And thank you for watching. You can learn\h
more by going to presentdangerchina.org.

262
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:03,840
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
