00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,810
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,120
learn how to be politically correct from the
OG—

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,180
China!

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,700
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:12,950
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,480
You’ve probably heard of the term “politically
correct.”

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,410
It became popular starting in the 1970s.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,730
Like bell bottoms.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
And mullets.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,949
Political correctness originally meant saying
things

11
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,830
that conformed to a specific political ideology.

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,769
But fashion trends evolve.

13
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,000
And nowadays in the West,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,220
most people think of political correctness

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,570
as changing the way you say things,

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,430
to avoid offending people.

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,580
Like instead of saying “handicapped,”

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,610
saying “differently abled.”

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,850
Or instead of calling someone a “numbskull”,

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,860
calling them a

21
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,890
“person who lacks nerve endings on his head.”

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,360
But you may not know that political correctness,

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,770
in its original form,

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,510
has actually been part of Chinese territory

25
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,210
since ancient times.

26
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,950
By which I mean the 1950s.

27
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,800
And when the political ideology

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,510
you have to be correct about is communism,

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,390
it can be deadly.

30
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,570
Since the early days of Chairman Mao,

31
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,260
using the wrong words could get you punished,

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,760
or even killed.

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
For example,

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,000
in the 1960s during China’s Cultural Revolution,

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,120
scientists couldn’t do research on sunspots,

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,600
or even say “sunspots”.

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,150
Mao Zedong was China’s Red Sun,

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,540
so if your research suggested that the sun

39
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,400
has spots of darkness,

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
you were also implying that Mao did, too.

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,970
Extreme political correctness in China

42
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,270
is still important today.

43
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,311
Even something like calling the Diaoyu Islands

44
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,240
by their Japanese name—the Senkaku Islands—

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,310
is enough to get you branded as being anti-China.

46
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,260
Because how dare you use a Japanese word

47
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,360
to describe some uninhabited islands

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,040
that are definitely, 100%

49
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,549
part of China?!

50
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,150
And these politically correct protests

51
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,369
prove there’s there’s no controversy whatsoever.

52
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,600
So when it comes to territorial disputes,

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,750
I’m going to back off here and say political
correctness

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,470
historically belongs to the Chinese...

55
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,030
Communist Party.

56
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,749
And lately, Chinese leader Xi Jinping

57
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,110
has been talking a lot about it.

58
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,049
In recent months, political correctness

59
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,819
has been, “appearing repeatedly

60
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,900
in President Xi Jinping’s speeches

61
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,959
and party documents.”

62
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,319
And what happens to those foolish foreigners

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,420
who are politically incorrect?

64
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,660
Well, this past week has seen a string of

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,329
Western companies accidentally stepping over

66
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,139
the Party line.

67
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,849
The first victim was the Marriott International
hotel chain.

68
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,560
They sent out this survey to members

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,370
of their customer-loyalty program.

70
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,409
It asks “Which country are you currently
living in?”

71
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,079
and proceeds to list not-countries,

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
Like Hong Kong;

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,740
And Taiwan;

74
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,520
And Tibet.

75
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,140
Marriott may have thought it was just collecting
data.

76
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,310
But it was actually angering the beast.

77
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,800
This was China’s official reaction.

78
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,059
Shanghai police “opened an investigation

79
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:08,489
into the company for violating

80
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,040
cybersecurity and advertising laws

81
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,620
and questioned Marriott executives.

82
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,939
Angry Chinese called for a boycott of the
hotel chain.”

83
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,680
And even worse, Marriott’s official Twitter
account

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,790
“liked” a tweet from a group

85
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,719
called Friends of Tibet.

86
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,290
Don’t worry, that guy got fired.

87
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,379
After a huge amount of backlash,

88
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,599
Marriott’s Chinese website and mobile phone
app

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,230
were temporarily shut down by the authorities.

90
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,949
Now, Marriott has been desperately trying
to apologize.

91
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,359
They’ve issued “a series of apologies

92
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,529
and a bizarre clarification that it

93
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,669
does not support ‘separatism.’”

94
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,049
No, I totally get it.

95
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,500
Like if I had a survey and asked you

96
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,139
which country you’re from,

97
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,449
and I listed Texas as an answer—

98
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,799
you might wonder if I was making

99
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,480
some kind of statement.

100
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,629
Anyway, Marriott got nervous,

101
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,599
because it sees China as its biggest market.

102
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,629
Not just for hotels in China,

103
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,109
but also as a destination

104
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,340
for the growing number of Chinese tourists
abroad.

105
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,790
Marriott is far from alone

106
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,920
in making politically incorrect statements

107
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,269
about Taiwan.

108
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,019
In fact in the same week,

109
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,190
“Chinese regulators rebuked fashion brand
Zara,

110
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,299
Delta Air Lines,

111
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,489
and medical device maker Medtronic

112
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,860
for calling Taiwan a country on their websites.”

113
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,879
They have also profusely apologized.

114
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,099
The problem is,

115
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,130
this is a very easy mistake to make.

116
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,120
All it takes is a drop down menu that says
“countries”

117
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,680
to put a Western company in politically hot
water.

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,190
Like when you go to the British Airways website,

119
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,100
it has a pop-up asking you to select your
country.

120
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,310
And you can choose Taiwan.

121
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,510
Or Macau.

122
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,840
Or Hong Kong.

123
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Confusing?

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,990
Don’t worry,

125
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,490
British Airways fixed it last week.

126
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,410
Now it just says “From.”

127
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,740
So far, 24 airlines have gotten in trouble

128
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,520
for their drop-down menus.

129
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,139
Clearly, a serious crime.

130
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,910
But it’s more than just hotels and airlines

131
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,590
that have to worry.

132
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,659
Some celebrities have been

133
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,240
banned from entering China

134
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,439
for not being politically correct.

135
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,000
Like that time Katy Perry

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,150
held a concert in Taiwan,

137
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,039
where she wore the Taiwan flag

138
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,980
on top of a sunflower dress.

139
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,190
Little did she know:

140
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,180
Chinese provinces don’t have flags!

141
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,759
Her little mistake got her banned from China.

142
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,639
Which shows you just how ridiculous this whole
thing is.

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,110
If any country is going to ban Katy Perry,

144
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,680
it should be Egypt.

145
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,039
Also Japan.

146
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,470
And frankly any country that has a beach.

147
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,449
Katy Perry did try to dance her way

148
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,949
out of the China ban

149
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,000
by apologizing profusely.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
She sent this letter to authorities

151
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,750
promising not to “do or say anything religious
or political,”

152
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,280
or “participate in any activities

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,990
that jeopardize China’s unity and integrity.”

154
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,550
The CCP still denied her entry.

155
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,509
Even American universities have been attacked

156
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,980
for not being politically correct.

157
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,270
Like how UC San Diego

158
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,689
wanted to host the Dalai Lama.

159
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,550
And the CCP responded by withdrawing state
funding

160
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,470
for Chinese students wanting to go there to
study.

161
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,909
And Maroon 5 may have had

162
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,810
their China concert canceled

163
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,050
because of a tweet wishing the Dalai Lama

164
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,139
a happy birthday.

165
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,050
And this video from Hong Kong’s Apple Daily

166
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,780
says that recently,

167
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,479
Customs officials in mainland China

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,280
have been destroying food imports

169
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,810
labeled as coming from Taiwan, China.

170
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,330
That term used to be politically correct.

171
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,689
But now it’s not politically correct enough.

172
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,110
Customs officials want them to say

173
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,830
“Taiwan District, China.”

174
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,370
But some companies are politically smart.

175
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,590
They try to project to the Chinese regime

176
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,720
just how politically correct they can be.

177
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,860
Like Apple.

178
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
In December,

179
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,199
as Chinese Internet censorship was

180
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,159
reaching terrifying new heights,

181
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,069
Apple CEO Tim Cook made a trip to China

182
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,639
and praised their open internet.

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,970
Yeah, he really said that.

184
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,430
Don’t believe me?

185
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,560
Google it...

186
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,760
just don’t try to Google it

187
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,490
from inside China.

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,230
Like communism.

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,240
Or North Korea.

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,469
