1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,000
what do you call a huge music festival

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,330
that tackles the issue of

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,040
oppression in China?

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,700
“Blacklisted.”

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,960
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,540
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,860
You know, I don't like to brag,

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,160
but I'm known in certain circles

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,140
as a tastemaker.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,410
An arbiter of style.

12
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,410
Someone with his finger

13
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,840
on the pulse of popular culture.

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,620
And take it from me,

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,779
the 90s are back.

16
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,210
Slap bracelets.

17
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,210
Crystal Pepsi.

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,699
Twin Peaks.

19
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,080
A music festival that raises awareness

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,320
about Chinese human rights abuses.

21
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,840
Uh, no,

22
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,850
not the Free Tibet concerts.

23
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,020
I’m talking about the Blacklisted

24
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,300
music and arts festival,

25
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,390
coming up in Los Angeles

26
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,860
on July 29.

27
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,000
It’s got a bunch of cool bands...

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,740
and two incredibly charismatic hosts.

29
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,810
I'm proud to be hosting Blacklisted

30
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,700
along with Miss World Canada,

31
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,130
Anastasia Lin.

32
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,130
After all,

33
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,192
for years I've been looking for a way

34
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,560
to combine my two favorite hobbies.

35
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,259
No, not deep sea fishing

36
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:10,780
and javelin throwing.

37
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,979
the Chinese Communist Party.

38
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,590
And of course because a festival

39
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,829
that tackles authoritarian censorship

40
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,979
and human rights abuses in China

41
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,810
is being held not in China,

42
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,390
but in Los Angeles,

43
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,830
everything is going great,

44
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,119
and there are no problems at all.

45
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,810
Haha, no not really.

46
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,009
Actually, the Blacklisted concert

47
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,659
just got blacklisted.

48
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,820
Funny story.

49
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,929
Back in December,

50
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,959
California State Parks had granted

51
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,459
the organizers of the festival

52
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,039
a permit to hold the event

53
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,929
for up to ten thousand people

54
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,219
at the Los Angeles State Historic Park,

55
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,929
which is on the edge of LA’s Chinatown.

56
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:48,009
They got permission,

57
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,899
coordinated with the Parks department,

58
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:50,899
lined up the bands,

59
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,469
and launched their promotional campaign.

60
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:54,859
But months later,

61
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:55,959
in mid-May,

62
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,539
the Parks department suddenly told

63
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,819
Blacklisted producer Nick Janicki

64
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,569
that he had to meet with the head

65
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,929
of the LA Chinatown Business Improvement District,

66
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,310
George Yu.

67
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,280
That meeting did not go well.

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,599
Janicki says Yu told him

69
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,260
that the event was anti-China—

70
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,760
and that the event can’t mention

71
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,780
things like Tibetan freedom,

72
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
slave labor,

73
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,290
environmental destruction,

74
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,900
and the most taboo subject of all,

75
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,220
Falun Gong.

76
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Janicki told him basically:

77
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
Sorry,

78
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,220
we’re still gonna talk about this stuff,

79
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
especially Falun Gong.

80
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
The CCP is killing them for their organs.

81
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,230
It’s kind of a big deal

82
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,879
and we’re not going to keep silent.

83
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,099
Keep in mind that Blacklisted

84
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,069
is not a protest or march.

85
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,739
It’s a music and arts festival.

86
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:40,930
A few days later,

87
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,989
Mr. Yu sent Janicki this email

88
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,579
saying the LA Chinatown Business Improvement
District

89
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,310
wouldn’t support the event,

90
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,310
because of its “anti-China sentiments”.

91
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
And he managed to get

92
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,939
the California State Parks department,

93
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,020
which operates the land,

94
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,710
to withhold their permit.

95
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,840
Basically, Blacklisted got repressed

96
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,219
for trying to raise awareness

97
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,439
about repression.

98
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,909
It's like Woodstock getting shut down

99
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,750
for being too peaceful.

100
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,870
Or Cochella getting shut down

101
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,160
for having too many celebrities.

102
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,840
So what could the organizers do?

103
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,900
Forget it, Jake.

104
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,960
It’s Chinatown.

105
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,860
So was the Chinese Communist Party,

106
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,459
working behind the scenes,

107
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,640
making menacing phone calls

108
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,680
to shut Blacklisted down?

109
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,219
Well, George Yu told my producer over the
phone,

110
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,349
that’s not the case.

111
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,349
He said, quote,

112
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,349
“We have zero relationship

113
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,999
with the Chinese government.

114
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:34,030
Our responsibility is to our community.”

115
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,250
Well if that’s true,

116
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,819
it's actually scarier—

117
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,969
when you think about what it means.

118
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,480
Without any direct pressure

119
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,400
from the Chinese Communist Party,

120
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,499
a Taiwan-born American community leader

121
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,900
feels compelled to block an event

122
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,269
that calls for improving human rights in China,

123
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,519
because he’s concerned that

124
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,400
the Chinese community in Los Angeles

125
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,230
wouldn’t want the Communist Party's human
rights abuses

126
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,619
to be exposed.

127
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:03,389
George Yu told LA Weekly in colorful language

128
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,389
that

129
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,689
“[Nick Janicki] wants to do an anti-China event.

130
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:10,200
Can you imagine having an anti-Mexican event

131
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
in Boyle Heights?

132
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,470
They’d kick his ass.”

133
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,069
Actually, no.

134
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,360
It would be like having an event

135
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,320
exposing the damage corrupt police and drug cartels

136
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,040
are doing to Mexico,

137
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,700
and calling that racist.

138
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,120
Janicki told us, quote,

139
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,860
“We have a moral and ethical obligation

140
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,920
to tell people about what’s happening in
China.

141
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,540
We want a future where people

142
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,790
come before money,

143
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,730
and justice wins over greed.”

144
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah, that's terrible.

145
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,950
You know, for decades,

146
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,290
the Chinese Communist Party has been influencing

147
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,100
overseas Chinese communities

148
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,210
through the media.

149
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,660
They’ve been largely successful.

150
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,510
They’ve instilled the idea that the Communist
Party

151
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,880
is China,

152
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,470
and that opposing the Party means

153
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,890
being anti-China.

154
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,720
Think about it.

155
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,110
That’s like saying being against Kim Jong-un’s
regime

156
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,860
is the same as being anti-Korean.

157
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,820
Well, if the LA Chinatown Business Improvement

158
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,820
District

159
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,250
is afraid that exposing human rights abuses
in China

160
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,350
would hurt the Chinese community,

161
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,510
so be it.

162
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,500
Janicki says that the Blacklisted festival

163
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,920
doesn’t want to hurt the Chinese community,

164
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,070
and so he’s not trying to get

165
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,020
the park permit back.

166
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,640
So Blacklisted may have gotten blacklisted

167
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
in Chinatown,

168
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,810
but it’s not getting shut down.

169
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,710
It’s just moving to a different location
in Los Angeles.

170
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,710
A couple days ago

171
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,680
they signed a contract with The Reef—

172
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,050
a nearby venue that’s thrilled to host Blacklisted.

173
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,550
But all this does go to show you

174
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,340
that decades of propaganda has worked.

175
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,700
It’s convinced Chinese people overseas

176
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,900
that they should still support

177
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,710
the Chinese Communist Party—

178
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,830
and silence any voices that might want to

179
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,470
expose the Party’s problems.

180
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,550
And in this case,

181
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,770
it kind of backfired.

182
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,140
By trying to blacklist Blacklisted,

183
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,680
the LA Chinatown Business Improvement District

184
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,450
has given it even more publicity

185
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,910
than it had before.

186
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,590
Oh, delicious,

187
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,450
delicious irony.

188
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,580
So if you love China and hate repression,

189
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,580
you should come join me

190
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
in trolling the Communist Party

191
