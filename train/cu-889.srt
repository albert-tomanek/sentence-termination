1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,689
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:05,600
a shining example how democracy works in China.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,240
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,459
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:16,110
Who says China can’t have democracy?

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,300
Certainly not my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,900
the Global Times.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,520
As they point out,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,849
democracy is prospering under

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,699
the glorious one-party rule of the CCP.

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,380
I mean, Chinese Democracy is banned,

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,759
but I assume that was just a matter

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,150
of musical preference.

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,360
Other than that,

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,270
democracy is doing great in China.

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,270
And of course,

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,760
there’s no better example than Wukan,

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,530
located in Guangdong Province.

19
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,899
It’s sometimes referred to as China’s
democracy village.

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,489
Which is way better than being known

21
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,289
as China’s Underwear Town,

22
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,990
and yes that is actually a thing.

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,620
For decades in Wukan,

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,490
local officials had been getting rich off

25
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,250
stealing villagers’ land,

26
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,079
and selling it to developers.

27
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,310
But in 2011,

28
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,070
residents took to the streets,

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,770
protesting to get rid of the crooked village
leaders.

30
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,440
And in a surprise move,

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,000
then Party Secretary of Guangdong, Wang Yang,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,620
resolved the protests not with tear gas and
tanks,

33
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,000
but by letting the villagers hold open elections.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,470
And they ended up voting seven of the protest
leaders

35
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,910
into office.

36
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,110
Technically village elections have been allowed
in China

37
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,170
since the late 1980s,

38
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,380
but elections are often “managed”

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,390
by the local Party secretaries

40
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,140
so truly meaningful elections are rare.

41
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,880
Funny how that happens.

42
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,640
So actually in Wukan,

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,270
it seems the Communist Party did a great thing;

44
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,640
instead of turning to violence and repression,

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
they experimented with greater democratic
reforms.

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
Now you might be thinking:

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,060
“Chris, in five years of hosting China Uncensored,

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,470
this is the first positive thing you’ve
ever said

49
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,220
about about the Communist Party.”

50
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,860
Yes, I’ve certainly changed my tune.

51
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,450
Which is why the rest of this episode

52
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,080
is just pandas frolicking in the snow.

53
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,120
Ok, that’s enough.

54
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,110
Wukan was such a success story back in 2011.

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,720
Let’s see what’s happening in Wukan now,
in 2017.

56
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,120
Oh, this seems like a good sign!

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,180
A giant billboard!

58
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,019
With doves flying over Tiananmen Square

59
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,489
while armed soldiers look on.

60
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,510
It says, “Advance solidly to execute the
strategy

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,670
of loving the people and enforcing the border.

62
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,469
Police and citizens collectively build a harmonious
and civilized Wukan.”

63
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,180
Well that sounds lovey, and dovey.

64
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,280
But enforcing that border is important.

65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,180
Otherwise, dangerous elements could sneak
in,

66
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,240
like reporters.

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,390
“Today Wukan is sealed off by checkpoints

68
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,140
and armed police.”

69
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,620
Well, one Reuters reporter did sneak in.

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,909
And this is what he observed.

71
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:01,750
“Every street corner from accounts that
I’ve heard

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,769
have video cameras,

73
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,689
high definition surveillance cameras.

74
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,510
There are plainclothes police everywhere,

75
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,999
and there’s still a massive battalion of
riot police.”

76
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,629
Now while that sounds bad,

77
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,030
there’s a very good reason

78
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,489
for the heavy police surveillance.

79
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,269
You see, there’ve been some problems in
Wukan.

80
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,269
Last year,

81
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,959
the leader that the villagers elected, Lin
Zuluan,

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,340
was frustrated.

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,079
Even though he got elected,

84
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,329
communist officials at every level

85
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,060
were blocking him from carrying out the changes

86
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,620
they had promised him five years earlier.

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,650
So he threatened to bring the villagers out

88
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,749
to protest again.

89
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,610
But instead of giving in to his threat,

90
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,041
authorities simply arrested him and forced
him

91
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,590
to confess to a bunch of corruption charges.

92
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,870
Then the villagers protested that.

93
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,950
And the CCP responded

94
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,219
in pretty much the way you’d expect.

95
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,560
And now, a year later,

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,950
all’s quiet on the Wukan front.

97
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,819
According to one of the former protest leaders,

98
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,590
“All of the other former Wukan protest leaders

99
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,290
have since quit their posts,

100
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,849
been jailed, or harassed.”

101
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,489
The only possible explanation is that...

102
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,349
they were all bad leaders.

103
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,349
See?

104
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:12,379
Chinese people just aren’t ready

105
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,590
to elect their own representatives,

106
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,850
and need the strong, benevolent hand of the
CCP

107
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,250
to pick their leaders for them.

108
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,000
Jackie Chan was right all along.

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,420
And really, how could the man who made

110
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,280
both Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,060
ever be wrong?

112
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,510
But back to Wukan.

113
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,530
It’s not just the protest leaders

114
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,260
who have gotten in trouble.

115
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,480
Ordinary villagers were sentenced to prison

116
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,910
for illegal assembly,

117
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,130
disrupting traffic,

118
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,380
and spreading false information.

119
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,660
So it seems we’re back to the status quo.

120
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,260
It really was the perfect strategy from the
CCP.

121
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,620
Pretend to give in to people’s demands,

122
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,660
allow elections,

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,370
then undermine those elected leaders at every
opportunity,

124
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,480
then eventually arrest those leaders

125
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,690
and establish a police state.

126
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,420
And who’s making that police state possible?

127
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,960
Um...the West is, I guess?

128
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,760
Now it’s interesting to note that Wang Yang,

129
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,311
the Guangdong Party Secretary

130
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,780
that allowed for elections in the first place,

131
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,030
has recently been promoted

132
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,540
to the Politburo Standing Committee.

133
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,760
That makes him one of the seven

134
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,860
most powerful men in all of China.

135
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,920
Maybe that means he’ll push for democracy

136
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,570
in the rest of China.

137
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,570
After all,

138
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,940
I hear democracy is flourishing in Wukan.

139
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
What do you think?

140
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,260
Leave your comments below.

141
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,600
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

So maybe you can’t vote in China.

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,220
Or protest.

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,100
Or watch this YouTube video.

146
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,020
