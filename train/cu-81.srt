00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,160
chop up your enemies for Chinese New Year!

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,380
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,980
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,120
Wow, finally!

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,340
Chinese New Year is right around the corner,
February 8th.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,640
Another year nearly over and all I can say
is I'm glad to have survived.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
I have so many enemies.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,720
Probably.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,560
All of them out to get me.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,000
Probably.

12
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,189
But now that it's New Year,

13
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,129
I can get back at all those petty people for
every imagined slight.

14
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,499
You know, petty people!

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,600
Those people that love to pry into other's
affairs and stir up trouble.

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,080
But not to worry,

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,350
because according to a tradition in some regions
of China,

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,909
the Lunar New Year is apparently a time to
get back at all of them!

19
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:52,350
Now as you know,

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,510
Chinese New Year is also a time for homemade
dumplings, or jiaozi.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,989
But you don't want petty people interfering.

22
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,429
So make sure you do what this guy does:

23
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:07,969
Mold your jiaozi filling into the shape of
some petty person you know, and then chop!

24
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,960
That's why on the fifth day of the Lunar New
Year

25
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,219
some people do a tradition called 剁小人
duò xiaorén,

26
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,020
or chopping petty people.

27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,590
You see, China has a long tradition

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,219
--in stories, art, and music--

29
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,619
of ordinary people being wronged,

30
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,999
but not having the power to do anything about
it.

31
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:32,820
Especially when it comes to being wronged
by people in power.

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,259
And so they turn to the supernatural realm
for justice denied on Earth.

33
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,140
Hence, traditions like chopping up petty people.

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,120
Wow, this guy must know a lot of petty people!

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,360
And this guy, well...

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,740
he might actually have some anger issues.

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
Anyway, as you make your dumplings from the

38
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,649
symbolic minced flesh of your enemies,

39
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,030
you need to of course pinch those dumplings
closed.

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,569
As this man demonstrates, that's part of the
tradition, too.

41
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,329
It's called pinching petty people's mouths.

42
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,430
Another fun tradition is writing the names
of people you don't like on the bottom of

43
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,230
socks, and then stomping around in them.

44
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,780
It's called 踩小人 Cǎi xiǎorén

45
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,049
--stepping on petty people.

46
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,470
This is actually a thing...

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,790
to the extent that you can even buy socks
with the words "petty person" printed on the

48
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,060
bottom.

49
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,530
What's that Shelley?

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,750
You think that's petty?

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,440
All right...

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,260
Shelley.

53
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,140
Anyway, speaking of Chinese traditions,

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,200
2016 will be the Year of the Monkey.

55
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,460
That's according to the traditional Chinese
placemat zodiac.

56
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,659
And to celebrate,

57
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,870
it's time for the 3rd annual China Uncensored
Viewer Contest Gala Extravaganza Spectacular

58
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,870
Event Thing.

59
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,689
For the uninitiated, here's how it works:

60
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,530
Draw your best Year of the Monkey monkey

61
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,750
and send it to me on my Facebook page.

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll pick the winner based on my completely
arbitrary standard of how much I like it.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
The grand prize is...

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,239
a collectors' edition China Uncensored poster
personally signed by a poorly paid worker

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,360
in squalid factory conditions.

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,799
And I will send you the poster in the actual
mail.

67
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,069
So keep your eye out for a future episode
where I announce the winner.

68
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,900
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell.

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,440
Happy New Year!
