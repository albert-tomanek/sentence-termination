1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,160
Is a global pandemic starting in China?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,879
Hong Kong Protests Communism

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,550
And don’t get caught in your pajamas in
this Chinese city.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,000
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,400
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,869
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,850
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,599
First an update on the deadly Chinese coronavirus

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,939
that spread from the city of Wuhan.

10
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,159
As of Friday morning, Chinese state-run media

11
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:34,680
had confirmed there were 887 cases nationwide,
with 26 deaths.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,050
Don’t worry.

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,540
Chinese authorities are taking resolute action
against the new virus.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,770
They’ve raised the public health response

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,520
to the highest emergency level.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Which is good.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,640
They’ve also completely locked down travel
in 13 cities, i

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,030
ncluding Wuhan where it all started.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,480
The travel ban now covers more than 30 million
people.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,240
Authorities have also banned large gatherings
around the country.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,780
They even shut down Disneyland.

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,370
So if you hate long lines, nows the time to
go.

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,500
A classic Chinese Communist Party solution:

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,409
Cracking down, like the virus is a political
dissident.

25
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,560
Except of course it’s too late.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,830
One virologist who helped identify SARS in
2003

27
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,700
told Chinese media that “a bigger outbreak
is certain.”

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,090
And that “We have passed through the ‘golden
period’ for prevention and control.”

29
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,370
If only they used the golden period for that
instead of a massive coverup.

30
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,020
Not to mention that millions of people have
already started traveling t

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,770
hroughout the country for the Lunar New Year,
which starts today.

32
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,570
And in Wuhan, the scapegoating of local officials
has already begun.

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,760
Meanwhile, the first patient to have the virus
in the US

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,700
is being treated in Seattle by a robot.

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,110
That is not a joke.

36
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,560
The good news is, he seems to be recovering.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Meanwhile a second US case has been confirmed
in Chicago.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,820
I hope Chicago has robots, too.

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,020
Now over to Hong Kong,

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,960
where protests are continuing.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,510
Only now, they also have to worry about this
weird Chinese virus, too.

42
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,060
It’s a good thing so many people wear masks
in Hong Kong.

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,880
Last Sunday, Hong Kongers held an anti-Communism
rally.

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,420
It was called Universal Siege Against Communism.

45
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,790
And it was to call on other countries to sanction
Hong Kong officials.

46
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,340
These people held up signs that say

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,840
Heaven Destroys the Chinese Commuinst Party

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,040
before police started shoving their way through
and firing tear gas.

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,770
The rally was originally allowed by police,

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,030
but they suddenly shut it down after too many
people showed up.

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,970
Several fights then broke out between police
and protesters.

52
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,620
Plus the tear gas.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,440
Police made several arrests.

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,660
One of the people arrested was Ventus Lau,

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,420
the person who organized the rally.

56
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,580
He’s being charged with, among other things,

57
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,850
“inciting others to take part in an unlawful
assembly.”

58
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,830
Yes, Lau was charged for inciting people to
take part in an unlawful rally...

59
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,700
that police had previously said was totally
lawful

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,370
until they changed their minds in the middle
of the rally

61
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,720
and started tear gassing people.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,040
In other words, it was a typical Sunday in
Hong Kong.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,770
But don’t worry, that’s going to change,

64
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,620
thanks to the brilliant minds of Chinese Communist
officials.

65
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,800
The new head of the Liaison Office is pushing

66
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,920
for the Draconian national security law they
tried to pass in 2003.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,630
In 2003, it resulted in massive protests.

68
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,630
So it failed before,

69
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,629
but clearly doing the exact same thing is
going to work this time.

70
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,520
I believe we have a photo of the new head
of the Liaison Office right here.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,030
Human Rights Watch has released their Human
Rights report for 2020.

72
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,400
It includes this special feature called China’s
Global Threat to Human Rights.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,690
The director of Human Rights Watch

74
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,200
flew to Hong Kongfor the official release.

75
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,260
But he was denied entry.

76
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,760
“The focus of the report this year was going
to be on how

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,849
the Chinese government is really trying to
deliberately undermine

78
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:58,989
the international human rights system.

79
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,099
Sadly, as I arrived here, the Chinese government
decided

80
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,510
that it did not want to let me in.

81
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,599
So even though I've been able to enter Hong
Kong freely before,

82
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,379
this time, for the first time, they've blocked
me.”

83
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,680
Surprisingly, denying him entry to Hong Kong
didn’t actually silence the report.

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
He just released it in New York instead.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,690
And as a result, it got more media attention.

86
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,540
Imagine that.

87
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,410
There’s finally an update on Huawei CFO
Meng Wanzhou.

88
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,500
She was accused of violating US sanctions
on Iran.

89
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
For more than a year,

90
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,340
she’s been detained in a harsh prison known
as—Canada.

91
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,520
Will she get extradited to the US?

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,389
Well, extradition hearings have begun, but
that’s just the beginning.

93
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,449
“This week's hearing focuses on whether
Meng's alleged crimes in the U.S.

94
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,389
are also illegal in Canada.

95
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,400
Meng's defense say the central issue is so
called "double criminality",

96
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,950
as in, charges she is accused in the U.S.

97
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,590
must also be considered crimes in Canada.

98
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,120
Meng's lawyers argue the case is founded on
allegations of breaching

99
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,699
U.S. sanctions against Iran.

100
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,699
But, Canada has rejected those same sanctions.

101
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,200
So, they argue Meng can't be extradited.”

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,610
And legal experts say it could be years before
a decision is reached.

103
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,120
So Meng will remain in legal limbo in Canada.

104
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,590
Don’t feel too bad for her, though.

105
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,250
Her “prison cell” is house arrest.

106
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,880
At her 12-million-dollar luxury home.

107
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,490
Plus, she’s getting by with a little help
from her friends.

108
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,949
And by friends, I mean people who were paid
to protest on her behalf.

109
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,600
Who says money can’t buy friends?

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,889
There’s another Meng in the hot seat this
week.

111
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,150
The former head of Interpol Meng Hongwei.

112
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,360
No relation.

113
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,790
He’s been sentenced to more than a decade
in prison for corruption.

114
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,590
And I don’t think *his* prison cell will
look like this.

115
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,520
How did a corrupt guy like Meng Hongwei

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,330
get elected to the head of the International
Police?

117
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,690
“Partly on the strength of his record of
combating graft in China.”

118
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,690
Ironic.

119
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,510
Meng is also a part of former Chinese leader
Jiang Zemin’s faction,

120
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,190
which current leader Xi Jinping has been locked
in a factional power struggle with.

121
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,910
It’s nice to know that despite everything
else

122
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,160
that’s putting stress on the Communist Party,

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,530
the power struggle goes on.

124
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,680
But if you’re thinking both Meng’s haven’t
got a prayer,

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,780
well...most people in China might not have
a prayer, either.

126
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,530
Because the Chinese Government is planning

127
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,710
to re-interpret classic religious books

128
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,110
like the Bible, the Quran, and Buddhist Texts.

129
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,260
“Socialist core values should guide the
re-interpretation process.”

130
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,390
Oh good.

131
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,240
And even more good news for religion in China.

132
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,760
The Vatican has chosen a new Bishop for Hong
Kong.

133
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,920
But they haven’t officially announced who
it is.

134
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,370
Why?

135
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,830
According to the Catholic News Agency,

136
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,830
it’s because of concerns that the guy they
chose

137
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,300
is too sympathetic to the Chinese Communist
Party.

138
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,201
To clarify, the Vatican’s concern is not
that the new bishop

139
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:06,850
is too sympathetic to the Communist Party.

140
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,539
No, their concern is just that *announcing*
it

141
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,639
would upset the people of Hong Kong,

142
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,000
who are protesting the Communist Party.

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,419
Sure, heaven will destroy the CCP.

144
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,300
Just not the under the Vatican’s watch.

145
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,020
And now, witness the power of China’s fully
operational Radio Telescope.

146
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,130
Not only is it the largest radio telescope
in the world,

147
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,810
but like the feelings of the Chinese people,

148
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,850
it’s also the most sensitive.

149
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,210
Which is probably why it was built in a depression.

150
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,880
And finally, another technological breakthrough.

151
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,460
China is using AI Facial recognition technology...

152
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,520
to shame people for wearing their pajamas.

153
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,630
Because wearing pajamas in public is a thing
in some parts of China.

154
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,980
This crackdown is another one of those things
you only see in a country like China,

155
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,169
where top down government directives lead
to idiotic local policies.

156
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,009
Officials in Suzhou, a city of six million
people in Anhui Province,

157
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,780
got word that they needed to root out uncivilized
behavior.

158
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
Nice and vague.

159
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,389
So obviously they took action.

160
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,020
Which for them, meant publishing surveillance
photos

161
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,970
taken by street cameras of residents wearing
pajamas in public

162
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,840
along with parts of their names, government
identification numbers and their locations.

163
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,880
That sparked a nationwide outcry, so local
officials quickly apologized.

164
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,380
And that does it for this week’s China News
headlines.

165
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,380
What do you think?

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,479
Leave your comments below.

167
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,849
And as I’ve mentioned before,

168
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,229
YouTube demonetizes episodes like this,

169
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,079
because they’re too controversial for advertisers.

170
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:43,649
We would have been run out of business years
ago,

171
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,019
if it weren’t for fan support through the
crowd funding website Patreon.

172
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:49,970
So as a thank you to these fans,

173
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,399
I answer their questions at the end of some
of my episodes.

174
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,559
This question comes from...Thomas Kollmeier.

175
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,600
“Which of the 2020 presidential candidates
is the most anti china out of all them,

176
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,259
because I'm getting the impression lately
that no one wants to stand up to china.”

177
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,050
Good question, Thomas.

178
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,879
If by anti-China, you mean anti-Chinese regime,

179
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,639
none of the candidates are.

180
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,170
Even president Trump has not explicitly said
anything

181
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,420
against the Chinese Communist Party or Chinese
leader Xi Jinping.

182
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,529
Although to be fair, through Trump’s actions
on trade,

183
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,829
he’s done a lot to weaken their grip on
power.

184
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:29,019
And some key people in Trump’s administration,

185
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,209
like Vice President Pence and Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo,

186
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,790
have openly criticized the regime’s human
rights abuses.

187
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,459
Among the 12 Democrats still in the presidential
race,

188
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,829
it’s not clear so far whether any of them

189
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:45,209
will meaningfully stand up the Chinese regime.

190
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,600
While some of them have criticized China’s
human rights abuses,

191
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,079
they also say that, “we need to work with
them”, or they say nothing at all.

192
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,670
Michael Bloomberg has even openly said China
is not a dictatorship.

193
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,379
Which I guess makes him the most anti-China
of all

194
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,600
if you take “anti-China” to mean “anti-Chinese
people.”

195
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,550
The poor guy makes billions of dollars a year
from China,

196
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,329
so I understand where he’s coming from.

197
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:11,689
Maybe after the primaries are finally over,

198
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,230
the remaining democratic candidate will try
to match

199
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,319
Trump’s toughness when it comes to China
trade,

200
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,189
but I won’t hold my breath.

201
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:23,360
And since politicians aren’t doing enough,
I hope you will.

202
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,720
Share China Uncensored episodes with your

And as a thank you, I answer questions from
Patrons at the end of some of my episodes.

207
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,800
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

208
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,300
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

209
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,160
See you next time.
