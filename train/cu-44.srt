1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,480
The Internet in China.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,190
It’s a high-tech dystopia.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,990
And officials from around the world

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,120
are going to China to learn how to build

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,340
their own internet dystopias.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,780
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,439
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,800
Internet censorship in China today has reached
absurd levels.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,849
People have been jailed for the things they
say on WeChat.

10
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,339
Here’s a quick list of some of things

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,340
censored on the Chinese Internet.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,410
Tiananmen Square Massacre

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,120
An empty chair

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,690
Winnie the Pooh.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,680
And even the letter N.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,550
That must make the Chinese version of Sesame
Street so difficult.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,430
But to find out exactly how bizarre

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,420
the Internet censorship in China is,

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,510
I sat down with Sarah Cook.

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,000
She’s a senior research analyst and director

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,050
of the China Media Bulletin for Freedom House—

22
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,350
an NGO focused on research and advocacy for
democracy,

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,520
political freedom, and human rights.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,140
Thank you for joining us today, Sarah.

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,600
So how bad is internet censorship in China?

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,940
Well, to be honest, the Chinese Communist
Party

27
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:13,740
has created the most multi-faceted and sophisticated
system

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,710
of internet censorship in the world.

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,170
Actually, in Freedom House’s Freedom on
the Net report

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,970
for the last three years China has been designated

31
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,280
as the worst abuser of internet.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Worse than Syria?

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,560
Yeah, I think its different factors,

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,530
so it's worse than Syria and Iran.

35
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,770
I think it's a different dynamic in terms

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,890
of what the political situation in these countries
are.

37
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,960
In Syria, it might be that you don't have
internet access

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,340
because something's been bombed out.

39
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,530
In China there's quite a good amount of actual
access to the internet,

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,620
and it's increased, but the extent to which
people are able

41
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,390
to actually do certain things on the internet,

42
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,180
and the scale of controls that are exercised
that are in place

43
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,170
even if they're not always activated and exercised
is tremendous.

44
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,940
It goes through the entire internet system
in China

45
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,920
and it's by far the most sophisticated and
pervasive

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,660
of anywhere else in the world.

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,740
So I know a lot of people make the mistake
of

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,340
thinking of internet censorship as the government

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,950
preventing certain information from getting
out there,

50
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,730
but a big part of it is actually pushing

51
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,569
a message the government wants.

52
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,810
What is the message the communist party is
pushing?

53
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,090
Well, it depends, really.

54
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,431
It depends on the topic,

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,460
and it depends on the audience in some ways.

56
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,400
You have the set taboo topics so,

57
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,849
not letting people know about June 4th or
about Falun Gong

58
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,010
or about Taiwanese and the Square Massacre.

59
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,599
Yeah, the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

60
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,650
or about what's really happening to Uighurs
and Tibetans

61
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,730
in different parts of China.

62
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,560
But part of that is also manipulating the
message,

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,140
so again, it's this combination of censorship
and propaganda

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,499
that are really two sides of the same coin,

65
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:59,279
and so some of it is suppressing the bad news

66
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,459
and then part of is promoting the good news.

67
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,409
And actually, Xi Jinping talks about promoting
positive-

68
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:06,560
The China story.

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,900
Well the China story, that's more outside
of China.

70
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,650
Telling a good China story, that's more outside
of China.

71
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,049
Within China, they want to promote positivity

72
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:21,659
and just to give an example, the extremes
to which they go to do that,

73
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:27,300
you see from lead censorship directives that
they will tell websites that,

74
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,129
let's say the landing page of a Google News
type of website has ...

75
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,239
The top story has to be this.

76
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,780
In some cases I think there's a sense

77
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,890
that the rankings on social media platforms

78
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,079
of what's the hottest news now is manipulated.

79
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,079
So they're telling you…

80
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,699
Last year when the constitutional was changed

81
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,889
to enable Xi jinping to become President for
life,

82
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,870
if you looked at the top ranking topics on
social media,

83
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,199
it was how to eat noodles on a high speed
train.

84
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,199
This is inside China?

85
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,199
This is inside China.

86
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,150
These are platforms that are run by Chinese
companies and so-

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,849
Not necessarily Google, this is Chinese-

88
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,189
Yeah, these are Chinese, this is Chinese social
media.

89
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:05,629
This is Weibo.

90
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,069
Sina Weibo, WeChat.

91
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,830
Yeah, these are Chinese, because the Chinese
government

92
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,480
uses the Great Firewall to block the kinds
of social media applications

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,329
that we all use, Facebook, Twitter,

94
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,349
those aren't really accessible to people in
China

95
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,109
unless they have a way of jumping the Firewall.

96
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,419
But, within China than you have these Chinese
alternatives

97
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,870
that have become extremely popular and they
have

98
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,940
whole departments of staff whose job is basically

99
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,770
to identify and censor content,

100
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,450
and then in some cases based on structure

101
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,780
specifically to promote other content.

102
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,660
Wow, so when Xi Jinping became President for
life,

103
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,030
the main story was how to eat noodles?

104
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,000
That was one of the top ranking stories on
Weibo

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,740
because they had censored so ...

106
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,259
Because it's a combination,

107
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,500
because they had censored so much of the keywords
in the conversations

108
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,659
that Chinese people were trying to have about
this important news topic

109
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:58,520
and so you didn't have that trending and then
I think,

110
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,560
we suppose that there was some kind of manipulation

111
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,500
in the trending as well.

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,840
So this ties into the whole Patriotic Education as well?

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,920
Well "Patriotic Education" is a term that's typically used specifically in Tibet.

114
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,900
But in general there's a type of, yeah, just general

115
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,500
kind of nationalistic education.

116
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,040
Very pro-Communist Party.

117
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,500
And it's not just that, especially under Xi Jinping,

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,600
it's like promoting Xi Jinping Thought per se.

119
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,740
And certain, like, tenets of Xi Jinping Thought, and referring to him as the Core Leader.

120
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,260
That's where under Xi you get the sense of a personality cult that you didn't necessarily see before.

121
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,220
So in the West, the sort of original model,

122
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,479
the internet was that it was free and it was
open.

123
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,060
China is offering an alternative model to
internet.

124
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,920
What is the China internet model?

125
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,010
Well, the Chinese government would say it's
a form of cyber sovereignty.

126
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,349
It's the idea that the internet does not cross
borders.

127
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,820
It's that the internet really stops at the
border,

128
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,979
and you create a virtual border and in China

129
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,830
it's the case of the Great Firewall.

130
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,080
But it's also elements of various laws, like
the cyber security law

131
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,719
and requiring data centers to be applications,

132
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:11,000
or things like iCloud to have its servers
inside China,

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,110
and not be able to be outside of China.

134
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,069
So that whatever happens within China

135
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,289
is really under the Communist Party's control.

136
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:19,939
There's multiple ways in which that's done,

137
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,840
either technologically or also legally and
administratively,

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,979
but that's, in a lot of ways, the model.

139
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,469
It's a combination of this high-tech techno
dystopia

140
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,349
that is maybe less achievable for other countries
depending

141
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:41,190
on their technological caliber and resources,
monetary resources,

142
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,750
but it is also ... A different model that
is maybe easier

143
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,090
to mimic and some specific kinds of legislation,

144
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,449
arresting bloggers, sending them to prison,
arresting,

145
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:58,270
forcing local social media companies to do
their own censorship,

146
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,780
and then injecting this type of proactive
manipulation

147
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,199
of paid government commentators or other forms
of ...

148
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,789
That China's probably called gaining the upper
hand

149
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,060
in terms of quote, guiding public opinion.

150
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,750
So it's all of those factors combined,

151
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,770
but ultimately it's this idea that within
China's borders particularly,

152
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,699
within a particular country's borders you
should

153
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,139
have full control over what people can see
and do on the internet

154
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,300
and not allow these companies outside,

155
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,639
like Facebook or Twitter or others to be able
...

156
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,330
Or the New York Times, to produce information

157
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,139
that your people can read and see.

158
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,500
So if you look at China's model of internet
controls

159
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,560
it's not just censorship, which we think of
a lot.

160
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,740
It's a combination of censorship but also
extensive

161
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,360
and pervasive surveillance and monitoring

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,319
of what people are doing online.

163
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,660
Real name registration so they can ...

164
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,849
That's how they can arrest people.

165
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,000
They can trace that this person has a seemingly
anonymous account,

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,610
and it actually belongs to this particular
individual.

167
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,740
You can't be anonymous on the Chinese internet.

168
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,729
And increasingly with people who are on Twitter,

169
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:57,949
they're not anonymous on Twitter.

170
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:00,560
Somehow they Chinese government is figuring
out ways to trace it back,

171
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,340
the Twitter account, back to their phone number,

172
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,340
and they're getting a knock at the door

173
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,509
for what they're writing on Twitter.

174
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,009
Even though Twitter is banned in China?

175
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,319
Even though Twitter is banned in China people
are jumping the Firewall.

176
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,000
It's open, and in some cases people have like,
three thousand followers.

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,620
It's not people with millions of followers
necessarily,

178
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,220
but they're getting knocks on the door in
some cases

179
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,580
for just opening an account or things like
that,

180
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,160
and they're being harassed.

181
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,509
So that's ... and even arrested.

182
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,509
I just need to make sure.

183
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:26,830
That's not happening to the good people

184
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,460
of the People's Daily Twitter account.

185
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,550
No, of course not.

186
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,550
Right.

187
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,550
So that's a thing.

188
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,150
That's the ... So there's actually been a
relatively recent case

189
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,780
of some employee of Chinese Day media getting
in trouble

190
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,790
for creating a personal Twitter account,

191
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,730
when you have Chinese Day media like Xinhua
and People's Daily,

192
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,640
and China Daily, and CG Daily,

193
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,900
they all have millions of followers and they're
able to access,

194
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,960
talk to millions of people around the world,

195
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,850
but if you're a Chinese Human Rights lawyer,
a professor-

196
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,620
Or even an individual employee of those state
run companies-

197
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,520
Yeah, and then people are starting to get
in trouble.

198
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
And that's something very new.

199
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,780
A year ago that wasn't happening.

200
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,070
That's something relatively recent.

201
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,150
So you've got a combination of censorship,
of surveillance,

202
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,390
and of intimidation and harassment,

203
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,840
and this proactive manipulation that all of
it together creates

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,750
a very interesting environment in China.

205
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,620
On the one hand you have a lot of information

206
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,380
that's censored and that's inaccessible,

207
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,200
but there's still a vibrancy about it and
all kinds of things that,

208
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,150
if you think about what you do with your phone,
yes,

209
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,330
you check the New York Times,

210
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,560
you check news that would probably be censored
in China.

211
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,790
You also look up what movie is playing nearby.

212
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,980
You use Google to ... Google Maps to try to
navigate

213
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,580
how to get to your friends house.

214
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,440
You look up what the ranking is on this particular
restaurant.

215
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,630
All of those types of things are accessible
in China,

216
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,480
although they're with Chinese apps

217
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,730
and not the ones that we would usually use.

218
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,570
So it's this illusion of choice that's created.

219
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,290
The Chinese government can control everything.

220
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,280
It doesn't necessarily, and the space is shrinking,

221
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,590
but it's created a system where it could control
everything

222
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,500
if it wants and it's able to knit pick

223
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,070
and pull out and censor the things

224
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,410
it doesn't want people talking about

225
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,410
while monitoring who's writing the things

226
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,410
they don't want people talking about.

227
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,410
So what happens to people inside of China

228
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,900
who get on the wrong side of the internet
censors?

229
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,980
Well, it depends.

230
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,710
It can range from having a particular post

231
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,470
be deleted to having your entire account be
canceled.

232
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,270
So there's lots of examples of,

233
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,450
on these parallel social media applications
in China

234
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,270
run by Chinese companies, people with millions
of followers,

235
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,370
just like that it's gone.

236
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,030
You press a button, it's gone.

237
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,030
All gone.

238
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,130
And in some cases it has real impact on their
livelihood too,

239
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,810
'cause people will earn money because they're
a famous author

240
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,580
or whatever and celebrities.

241
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,590
So, can range from those types of examples,

242
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,020
of losing a post deleted,

243
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,440
having your account canceled all the way through

244
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
to being sentenced to prison.

245
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
In some cases a very long prison term,

246
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,880
10 years, 15 years, very long prison terms.

247
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,560
So if I were making China Uncensored inside
of China

248
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
what would happen to me?

249
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
A few things would happen.

250
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,790
First of all you would really have no way
of distributing it,

251
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,610
so if you tried to open an account

252
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,710
on one of the Chinese social media

253
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,030
either they wouldn't let you or very quickly
after

254
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,510
they saw what you were sharing they would
just delete it

255
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,750
and that would be the end of that.

256
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,710
You would try to open a website, and you wouldn't
be able to,

257
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,540
and then you would be under liability,

258
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,410
potentially, personally, especially if you
create an episode

259
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,790
where you were, say, mocking Xi Jinping.

260
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,960
Which I would never do.

261
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
Which you would never do because China Uncensored

262
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,660
doesn't do any mockery of Chinese officials
or the communist party or ...

263
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,190
So then you would potentially be liable to
being arrested

264
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,600
and getting a knock on your door in the middle
of the night

265
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,430
and be taken away and then be jailed,

266
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,960
and have a trial that lasts for half an hour,

267
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,750
and not being able to access a lawyer, and
then,

268
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,790
you know however long ...

269
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,420
And they'll have this so called evidence,

270
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,420
but we've actually seen that.

271
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,640
We've seen people who have just posted things,
making, just, humorous.

272
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,130
There's a lot of people in China who have
gotten in trouble

273
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,200
for posting humorous things.

274
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,770
The memes about Xi Jinping and Winnie the
Pooh?

275
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,770
Yes.

276
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,770
So for example, I don't know anybody

277
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,010
who's actually been jailed for sharing or
posting a meme

278
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,291
related Xi Jinping and Winnie the Pooh,

279
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,230
but it's certainly heavily censored.

280
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,680
There have been other people

281
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,390
who have posted something that was a different
kind of a mockery of Xi

282
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,640
who had been sent to an administrative detention,

283
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,780
I think in one case even sentenced to two
years in prison.

284
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,890
Now, this internet model that China is creating,

285
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,580
they are trying to export that around the
world, right.

286
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,380
That's got to be appealing to other authoritarian
regimes.

287
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Yes.

288
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,980
And I would say not always even authoritarians
per se

289
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,110
but I think what we've seen over time is that
there were already elements,

290
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:48,420
even without deliberate projection and export
from China that were being

291
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,870
adopted by other regimes,

292
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,240
like Iran or Vietnam.

293
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,310
And then I think what we've seen the last
two years

294
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,130
is that the Communist Party's been much more
explicit

295
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,440
about wanting to promote their model,

296
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,490
and make their model not only for other countries,

297
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,180
but even trying to set international standards.

298
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,880
And that gets into more technological stuff
but that relates,

299
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,130
say for example, to 5G standards and others
so that their standards

300
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,690
become adopted elsewhere, they even become,

301
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,290
they even use words like the consensus internationally.

302
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,070
That's creepy.

303
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,070
Yes.

304
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,970
But yes, you definitely,

305
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:28,230
but now I think more actively you have efforts
to promote the China model.

306
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,230
In some cases it's in terms of the export
of technologies.

307
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,080
In a lot of cases it's different,

308
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,570
it's more about other kinds of know how.

309
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,280
One of the things we found with the latest
issue of Freedom on the Net

310
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,580
was that we looked at how many countries had
sent officials to China

311
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,500
to have some kind of training related to new
media

312
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,040
or so-called information management.

313
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
And after we found that out of 65 countries,

314
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,640
36 had sent officials.

315
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,610
And that included places like Thailand or
Vietnam, say,

316
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,280
who are very heavy internet restrictions

317
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,440
but also places like the Philippine's for
example that doesn't,

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,690
or parts of Latin American countries that
have a fairly open internet,

319
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,570
and they were sending officials there for
some kind of a training.

320
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,410
Any European countries?

321
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,940
I don't remember the specific list of countries.

322
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,550
I would be surprised, because one of the reasons
people also go on this

323
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,940
is also 'cause it's kind of a nice, all expenses
paid, junket to China.

324
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,030
And that can be attractive for some random
Filipino official

325
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,270
in the Ministry of Communication.

326
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,610
So this technology didn't come out of thin
air.

327
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,110
How did Western tech companies help build
this system.

328
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,920
So, in some cases it was pretty direct.

329
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,630
We have reason to believe that Cisco for example
played a role

330
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,450
in helping the Chinese government build the
Great Firewall

331
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,200
and other aspects called Golden Shield

332
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,780
which is an internet censorship and surveillance.

333
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,720
But at the same time you also have, I would
say, indirect examples,

334
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,750
where from even seemingly innocuous academic
exchanges

335
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,810
and things like that or other types of joint
venture partnerships

336
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,130
there was a certain degree of know

337
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:11,500
how that was transferred to Chinese companies
or Chinese tech geniuses,

338
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,940
and those people then applied it to systems

339
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,160
that are actually used to suppress internet
freedom in China,

340
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,080
so that you see a little bit with certain
things

341
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,060
coming out about artificial intelligence and
the like,

342
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,470
and so I think you see that in terms of actually
developing the system.

343
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,650
So besides the structural elements, on a more
micro level

344
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,990
you have Western companies who do engage in
censorship for Chinese users.

345
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,070
So, for example, Apple has deleted apps from
Chinese mobile app stores.

346
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,910
And that includes specific news websites like
NTDTV or the New York Times,

347
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,670
but it also has deleted and removed hundreds
of the kinds of applications

348
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,770
that let people jump the Firewall and access
uncensored news.

349
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,980
And then you have, for example,

350
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,580
LinkedIn that does some level of censorship
for people in China

351
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,730
in terms of what profile they are able to
see.

352
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,430
So you definitely have also ways in which
Western companies,

353
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,320
when they're dealing with content,

354
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,920
have to censor on behalf of the Chinese government.

355
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
So it's very disturbing to hear that companies

356
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,180
like Microsoft or Google are doing research

357
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,980
with Chinese military universities,

358
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,520
then that technology might be used in Shenzhen
for mass surveillance.

359
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,260
Do you think there's any possible that this
kind of censorship

360
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,310
will be exported to a country like the United
States?

361
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:35,270
For instance, I know Mark Zuckerberg has talked
about

362
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,540
wanting more control over the internet.

363
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,860
Well, I think in some ways we see certain
forms of Chinese censorship

364
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,830
already coming to the west.

365
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,920
That takes the form, in some cases, of self-censorship
by companies,

366
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,940
like airlines who aren't going to put Taiwan
in the dropdown menu

367
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,920
because they came under Chinese pressure or
a case,

368
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,280
I think it was Mercedes-Benz,

369
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,300
where they had a post on a social media website,

370
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,510
I think it was Instagram, that was outside
China,

371
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,130
not Chinese people, and they quoted the Dalai
Lama

372
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,290
and the Chinese government got upset

373
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,190
and then they actually deleted it and issued
this very, kind of-

374
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,190
Official apology.

375
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,190
Yes, official apology.

376
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,140
So I think you see that kind of censorship
slowly sneaking into the West,

377
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,730
but the other thing is that you have a Chinese
company called "Tencet"

378
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,170
that once runs an instant messaging application
called "WeChat"

379
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,230
and it's used a lot by people in the Chinese
diaspora,

380
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,720
and including Americans, Canadians, Chinese
Americans, Chinese Canadians.

381
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,230
Because it's a way to communicate with people
back in China.

382
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,230
Because it's a way to communicate with people
back in China

383
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,230
and they're just used to it.

384
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,230
If they come out,

385
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,470
they're used to it and that's how they'll
keep in touch with people here.

386
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,910
And so you're actually starting to see examples

387
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,570
of censorship of people here by WeChat, including,
in some cases,

388
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,950
communication between politicians and their
constituents

389
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,780
or between local news media in Chinese and
Australia

390
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,380
and how much they're actually ...

391
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,400
There's almost no reporting that's critical
of China

392
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,440
in a way that's very different than what's
on their main website.

393
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,110
So you actually start to see that type,

394
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,390
especially for the Chinese diaspora,

395
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,920
start to see that sneaking into the west.

396
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,730
And it can have a real political impact,

397
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,980
in terms of political candidacies.

398
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,840
For example, I don't know the China and I
don't know if you've tried.

399
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,410
I'm kind of doubtful that you would be able
to create a WeChat account

400
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,410
for ... You know?

401
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,660
That's a good idea.

402
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,560
And so you might not.

403
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,610
You could test that out.

404
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,290
You might not be able to then reach certain
constituencies

405
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,770
in the United States, even though they're
in America,

406
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,770
you're in America.

407
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:30,370
And so you see that element starting to infiltrate
into the west

408
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,070
with some level of political ramifications
too.

409
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,550
And then in terms of surveillance, absolutely.

410
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,720
There was recently a report,

411
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,380
I think that it came out that Hikvision,

412
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,930
one of these Chinese companies that runs surveillance
in China,

413
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,200
including these facial recognition cameras
in Xinjiang,

414
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,710
had gotten the contract for the UK parliament.

415
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,200
And it wasn't just for the UK parliament I
think,

416
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,759
it was for some of the building with some
of their offices.

417
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,901
So there was suddenly concern ...

418
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,750
I think it might have been put on hold now,

419
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,690
because they were suddenly concerned about
the ...

420
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,390
really the national security implications
of this.

421
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,080
So I think it's really more that element of
the surveillance

422
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,230
and this kind of backdoor concerns, rather
than censorship, per se,

423
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,510
that you see from some of these Chinese technologies,

424
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,510
but when you get to questions of Chinese technology

425
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,620
being involved in the delivery of content,

426
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,950
you see that more in Africa now,

427
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,450
that's where you do start to see censorship

428
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,130
because they'll favor Chinese state media
channels over, say,

429
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,220
the BBC World, in terms of the most affordable
package.

430
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,110
So then you have fewer Africans who are watching
BBC World,

431
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,410
and more who are watching Chinese state media.

432
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,910
And you could see that happening in the West,

433
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,300
but I don't know that that's going to happen.

434
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Okay.

435
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,420
So basically, right now it seems like there's
a battle going on

436
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,950
between the west's free and open internet
model

437
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,900
and China's sovereignty-based model.

438
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,760
What will it take for the free and open model
to win?

439
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,320
Well, it's tricky because one of the problems,

440
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,810
and I think challenges that we're having is
that

441
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,550
there are a lot of people even in democracies

442
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,470
that are questioning the desirability of having

443
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,600
as free and open an internet as we have.

444
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,700
And that's where you get to questions of regulating
Facebook

445
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,320
and other social media companies.

446
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,280
So I think the first thing is really for democracies

447
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,170
to give more attention to and thought to

448
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,720
how do you maintain the open internet?

449
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,970
How do you protect freedom of expression and
privacy

450
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,120
within their own borders so that there is
a more robust model?

451
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,570
And how do you protect against encroachments
from the Chinese model,

452
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,410
including into our own societies?

453
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,520
So for example,

454
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,720
starting out with really looking at WeChat
in the United States

455
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,690
or in other democracies and making sure,

456
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,650
in situations where they're violating

457
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,210
the First Amendment rights of people here,

458
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,710
that there's some kind of repercussion, that
they have to ...

459
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,480
Chinese government, when they ask foreign
companies to censor in China,

460
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,740
they like to say, well, the companies like
to justify,

461
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,710
"Well, we're working according to local laws."

462
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,630
Well, that should really work both ways.

463
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:08,090
The Tencet should be following local laws
here

464
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,170
and they should be allowing Chinese Americans
a

465
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,510
nd Chinese Canadians and Chinese Australians
to have a free,

466
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,130
open channels of communication on WeChat.

467
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,270
And if not, then they should be fined

468
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,110
or should be sued or something like that,

469
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,520
like any other company would be.

470
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,230
So I think that those are a few of the things,

471
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,730
in terms of really making sure that we're
protecting our systems

472
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,430
against Chinese government encroachment

473
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,790
and private company encroachment

474
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:40,220
and creating a more robust system of protecting
internet freedom at home.

475
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,820
And then I think finding ways to support Chinese
people's

476
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,250
desire for a free internet,

477
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,390
because there are a lot of Chinese people
who would like a free internet.

478
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,210
We see that when we publish a China media
bulletin.

479
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,920
We hear from our readings and when we work
with people who are ...

480
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,070
circumvention tools to reach people in China
and there are millions ...

481
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,440
We estimated there were 20 to 30 million Chinese
people

482
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,430
who use various tools to jump the firewall
in 2018

483
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,810
to access uncensored information.

484
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,290
Now, in the country of 1 point whatever billion,
that's not a lot,

485
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,740
but it could probably be a lot more

486
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,500
and there's certainly a constituency that
is interested.

487
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,520
And the more people learn about how censorship
worked

488
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,840
and how partial their information environment
is,

489
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,170
we found in our surveys and from academic
studies,

490
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,200
the more likely they are to want to seek out
uncensored information.

491
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,500
So there's still a lot more to be done,

492
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,210
in terms of having Chinese people be granted

493
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,200
greater access to a free and open internet.

494
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,260
So the Chinese people might be the biggest
market

495
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,880
for a free and open internet.

496
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Yes.

497
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,060
And actually, I think it's really unfortunate

498
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,500
that companies like Facebook or Google are
investing

499
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,640
in developing ways of trying to get into the
Chinese market

500
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,880
and have a censored search engine like Dragonfly,
rather than ...

501
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Imagine if all that money was invested in
either supporting

502
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,260
either existing circumvention tools

503
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,240
or designing some other type of tools that
would allow Chinese people

504
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
to access the internet freely,

505
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,430
because ultimately these companies would benefit.

506
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,450
They make their money off of users.

507
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,520
It doesn't have to be the Chinese government

508
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,650
that grants American tech companies access

509
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,230
to the Holy Grail of the Chinese internet
market.

510
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,990
They could be taking a piece of the pie themselves
