1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,200
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,420
Winter is Coming...

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,980
in a few months.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,900
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,269
Summer is coming to a close,

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,590
which means China’s Communist Party leaders
are just getting back

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,980
from their annual vacation getaway at the
beach resort town of Beidaihe

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,000
It's a tradition that dates back to the 1950s.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,250
Lookin' good, Zhou Enlai.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,910
But Beidaihe is more than just a beach

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,520
where Party leaders can kick back and check
out

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,700
how high Xi Jinping's swim trunks are.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,870
It's the classic smoke-filled beach,

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,320
the beach where it happens,

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,370
full of closed-door wheeling and dealing about
the future of the Party.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,200
You might even call it a…

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,510
Game of Thrones.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,680
Like the Lannisters and the Starks,

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,920
Communist Party Chairman and self-appointed
president Xi Jinping

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,340
is locked in battle with another faction inside
the Party

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,540
to see who can get and keep his own people
in the highest positions of power.

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,400
The leadership of the Party theoretically
changes every 5 years.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,860
And decisions are already being made now

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,420
about who will be left standing after the
shake-up coming in the fall of 2017.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
According to precedent,

26
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,770
five of the seven youthful, raven-haired bureaucrats

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,820
that make up China’s ruling Politburo Standing
Committee

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,000
will step down from office.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,670
And one of the new guys will be Xi Jinping’s
successor.

30
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,790
That’s right, according to precedent again,

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,430
Xi should only serve two terms.

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,500
In other words, he’s supposed to step down
in 2022.

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,040
Except that some analysts are now saying

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,500
that Xi may try to hang onto his job for just
a tiny bit longer than that,

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,080
and avoid naming a successor.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,060
Not that he wants to be ruler for life or
anything crazy like that.

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,549
According to Chinese politics expert Willy
Wo-Lap Lam

38
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,170
awesome name, by the way

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,700
Xi might just “retain control of the army
and police”

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,160
once he’s stepped down as president in 2022.

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,700
You know, it’s important to have hobbies
after retirement.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,160
Actually, Xi Jinping is probably worried

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,049
because he’s already made a lot of enemies

44
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:20,409
with his intense so-called anti-corruption
campaign.

45
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:24,540
He’s used it to take away power from once-mighty
factions

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,120
like the Communist Youth League

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,719
and the “Shanghai Gang” of former Party
leader Jiang Zemin.

48
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,840
Not to mention the complete annihilation

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,120
of the Qingdao Crew,

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,719
the Jade Garden Boys,

51
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,999
and the Golden Dragon Buffet Clan.

52
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,720
Anyway, the point is,

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,340
Jiang Zemin has now become Xi Jinping’s
arch rival.

54
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,389
Most of the big names that Xi has taken down

55
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:50,510
with his anti-corruption campaign were tied
closely to Jiang

56
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,829
who continued to have a huge amount of control
over the Party

57
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,820
even after he supposedly stepped down in 2002.

58
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,799
So, even though Xi has been in charge of the
Party for four years,

59
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,359
he still hasn't managed to sit on the Iron
Throne.

60
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,749
First, he's got to get rid of the threat from
the House of Jiang.

61
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:14,019
That came to a head this past week with Jiang’s
90th birthday,

62
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,459
which was notable mainly because state-run
media completely ignored it.

63
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,280
Which shows that Xi is indeed gaining the
upper hand.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,299
But it was celebrated by hordes of zombie-like
followers

65
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,629
in the wastes of the Chinese internet,

66
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,980
who mashed keys to declare their support for
and allegiance to “the toad.”

67
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,080
No, that’s not me slandering him.

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,960
That’s Jiang’s actual… uhh…

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,829
“affectionate” nickname.

70
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,340
Because…

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,960
yeah.

72
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,559
And according to the BBC,

73
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,099
“his ‘worshippers’ have flocked to send
him birthday wishes

74
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,239
and ‘one more second’,

75
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,829
a moment of their lives to extend his.”

76
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:02,169
Let me take a moment to just acknowledge how
weird and creepy that is.

77
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,370
This show of support is a bit baffling

78
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,269
when you consider that Jiang Zemin’s reign
from 1989 through the early 2000s

79
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,999
began with the Tiananmen massacre and only
got more bloody from there

80
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,620
Crackdowns on religious groups, organ harvesting,
and of course,

81
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,120
massive corruption and cronyism.

82
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,990
But hey, he’s just so darn quirky, so all
is forgiven.

83
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,159
But whether it’s genuine toad fandom

84
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,759
or just something cooked up by Jiang’s faction

85
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
to try and build him an underground following,

86
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,580
either way there’s a growing display

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,629
of subtle opposition to Xi Jinping’s administration.

88
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,430
Even though many of the activities of “toad”-worshipers are censored,

89
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,020
it’s not clear the Great Firewall of China

90
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,009
can keep them out of the Seven Kingdoms forever.

91
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,819
So what can Xi Jinping do?

92
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,160
Well, he’s counting on allies like Wang
Qishan,

93
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,840
who’s been running his anti-corruption campaign
as its Grand Inquisitor.

94
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,870
Wang Qishan is generally known

95
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,590
as the one of the most intimidating and Machiavellian
figures in the Party.

96
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,400
One official even said he’d rather “see
the devil”

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,789
than be investigated by Wang.

98
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,610
And he’s been as loyal to Xi as a Hand of
the King,

99
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,789
even though he was previously seen as part
of Jiang’s faction.

100
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:19,050
But perhaps at some point Jiang did something

101
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,150
to get on Wang Qishan’s bad side.

102
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,860
Which was a stupid move, because…

103
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,440
A Qishannister always pays his debts.

104
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,000
I’m sorry.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,900
But while Xi vs Jiang might be the Starks
vs the Lannisters,

106
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,030
is there another House out there,

107
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,740
coming from across the sea,

108
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,699
who also has a claim to the Throne?

109
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,460
Maybe with some cute baby dragons?

110
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,110
I guess we'll have to wait for season seven.

111
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,240
So what do you think of China’s Game of
Thrones?

112
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,490
Leave your comments below.

113
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,700
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
