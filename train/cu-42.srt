00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,930
China wants to build the world’s longest
underwater tunnel—

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,720
to a country that it doesn’t even recognize
as a country.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,660
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,420
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,220
Authoritarian regimes sure come up with the
craziest schemes.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,340
Like China’s canal designed to transport
billions of gallons of water

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,750
all the way from the south of the country
to the north,

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,820
losing most of it to evaporation,

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,940
and wrecking ecosystems in the process.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,399
That one was Chairman Mao’s idea.

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,410
Or China’s plans to build a giant city so
big,

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,129
it’s bigger than the entire population of
England and France combined.

14
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,489
Just kidding they’re not building “a”
megacity.

15
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,620
They’re building 19 of them.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,650
And now Chinese engineers want to build

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,309
the world’s longest underwater train tunnel.

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,719
Kind of like the Channel Tunnel,

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,800
that connects England and France.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,170
Only much longer.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,369
And less of a mutually agreed-upon decision.

22
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,439
Because, according to the South China Morning
Post,

23
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,920
Chinese scientists are planning the world’s
longest train tunnel...

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,509
to connect mainland China to Taiwan.

25
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:22,789
Rumor has it, the Chinese Communist Party
absolutely adores the plan!

26
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,170
So much so, in fact,

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,649
they’re ready to start planning without
Taiwan’s cooperation.

28
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,829
Researchers told the South China Morning Post
that

29
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,980
“it’s possible Beijing would start work
on the project

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,039
in a unilateral and largely symbolic move.”

31
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,770
The 84-mile Taiwan Strait Tunnel

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,190
would link Pingtan in Mainland China...

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,869
...to Hsinchu in Taiwan.

34
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,260
And yes, Hsinchu happens to be where Taiwan
has an army base—

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,929
where forces train hard to prepare for an
aggressive,

36
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,760
unannounced visit by the People’s Liberation
Army.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,020
Otherwise known as an invasion.

38
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,289
So there’s a good chance that Taiwan might
react negatively

39
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,640
if members of a Chinese tunnel drilling team
start to

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,270
pop up out of the ground unannounced.

41
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,800
But due to engineering constraints, a tunnel
this long

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,849
could probably never be completed without
digging from both ends.

43
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,819
And when Taiwan’s Minister Chen Min-tong,

44
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,080
who’s responsible for relations between
Taiwan and the mainland,

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,770
got wind that the plans for the tunnel were
ready and the CCP

46
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,540
was anxious to break ground,

47
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,000
he immediately denounced the project,

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,650
saying “The proposal is part of China's
consistent

49
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,569
united front propaganda and was made unilaterally.”

50
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,819
Chen also said there had not been any bilateral

51
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,030
communication between China and Taiwan on
the subject,

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,530
much less any kind of agreement.

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,040
But from the Communist Party’s perspective,

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,790
an agreement isn’t really necessary—

55
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,049
although it would make things go much smoother.

56
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,340
That’s because the Party considers Taiwan

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,670
a province of the People’s Republic of China,

58
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,640
and has vowed to seize control of it sooner
or later,

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,790
by force if necessary.

60
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,260
Actually Chinese president Xi Jinping has
ordered

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,520
the People’s Liberation Army to be ready

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,950
for an invasion of Taiwan by 2020.

63
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,569
No wonder Taiwan is a bit suspicious of this
underwater tunnel.

64
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:17,430
The Taiwanese minister also said that by proposing
the tunnel,

65
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,280
China was “attacking Taiwan’s potential
for international space

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,310
using militaristic intimidation and trying
to mislead the public

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,069
into thinking that this was a bilateral decision.”

68
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,680
But even if Taiwan okayed the tunnel,

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,060
the project could still be fraught with some
of the same problems

70
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,410
that have plagued China’s own rail system.

71
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,739
Like the massive corruption that caused the
Communist Party

72
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,689
to have to dissolve and restructure THE ENTIRE
RAILWAYS MINISTRY.

73
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,680
And also, give the railways minister a suspended
death sentence

74
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,099
for taking 10 million dollars in bribes.

75
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,670
But even if the tunnel is built without corruption,

76
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,750
it could still end up like some of

77
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,150
China’s other grand-scale planning ideas

78
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,890
that disregarded the realities of the natural
environment.

79
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,870
Like the Three-Gorges Dam—

80
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,689
the world’s largest hydro-powered project,

81
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,950
that displaced 1.3 million people,

82
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,469
and is causing landslides,

83
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,469
droughts,

84
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:17,440
oh, and earthquakes.

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Did I mention earthquakes?

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,480
A Chinese scientist—

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,810
who asked not to be named because who in their
right mind

88
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,040
would put their name on this plan—

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,490
said the underwater tunnel would need to cross
not one,

90
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,080
but two earthquake fault lines.

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,940
The scientist called the tunnel one of the
“most challenging

92
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,770
civil engineering projects in the 21st century.”

93
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,500
And that’s because in addition to cutting
across

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,360
two earthquake fault lines,

95
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,900
the tunnel has to slice through complex layers
of rock,

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,560
including extremely hard granite sandwiched
between layers

97
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,780
of far less stable sandstone and shale.

98
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,060
But even if they got it to work

99
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,000
without an earthquake getting in the way,

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,180
there’s another engineering problem.

101
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,710
The tunnel is too long to pump air through.

102
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,639
So China would have to build not one but two
artificial islands

103
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,600
in the Taiwan Strait, to pump fresh air down
into the tunnel.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,270
Fortunately, the Chinese regime

105
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,690
is good at building artificial islands.

106
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,970
Unfortunately, I think the Taiwan government
might

107
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,610
object to building islands off the coast of
Taiwan.

108
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,180
But even if Taiwan okays the artificial islands,

109
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,229
and the tunnel is built without massive corruption,

110
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,040
and it doesn’t cause earthquakes,

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,960
there’s another reason it might not be a
great idea.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,009
Remember how China has threatened to invade
Taiwan,

113
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,520
if Taiwan ever declares independence?

114
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,940
Well, you know what’s a really easy way
to move tanks?

115
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,410
Trains!

116
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,160
Looks like there might be some wide loads
coming through.

117
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
And before you go, it’s time for me to answer
another question

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,740
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

119
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,419
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

120
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,580
James McKay asks: “Hi, Shelly.”

121
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,780
Ugh, this one’s for Shelley?!

122
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,650
“When you travel together,

123
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,690
who is considered your "carry on":

124
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,710
Chris or Matt?

125
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,729
Will you elaborate on how you stretch the
team's

126
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,500
(likely very modest) travel and accommodation
budget?”

127
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,169
Shelley, do you want to answer this one?

128
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,180
Sure Chris.

129
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,370
James, if any of us was the carry on, it would
be me.

130
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,780
But I don’t really want to be stuck in

131
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,759
an overhead compartment at 35,000 feet,

132
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,810
so I usually buy my own plane ticket.

133
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,669
How do we stretch our travel budget?

134
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,639
We try to get sponsorship for everything.

135
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,139
Airlines, as you might guess,

136
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,520
don’t really want to sponsor anyone who
undermines the CCP.

137
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,130
But we had a hotel sponsor us in Taiwan.

138
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,210
Otherwise, we usually stay in an airBNB or
in someone’s home.

139
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,220
We also borrow our camera gear from our friends
whenever we can.

140
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,509
And if people take us out to dinner while
we’re on the road,

141
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,009
we don’t complain.

142
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,860
Especially if it’s hotpot.

143
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
Just saying.

144
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,280
Thanks Shelley.
