00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,779
a beautiful woman wants to go to China,

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:07,190
and the Chinese regime is freaking out.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,860
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,429
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,470
There is a terrifying force sweeping the world,

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,100
and we are helpless against it.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,880
I'm not talking about ISIS.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,949
I'm talking about beautiful women.

10
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,750
Oh, beauty queens!

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,430
It's so unfair!

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,550
You look so beautiful,

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,250
and I look like the bad guy from The Matrix.

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,480
Now sure, when some people think of beauty
queens, they think of this:

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,719
"I believe that our education,

16
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,460
like such, as

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,440
in South Africa and the Iraq,

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,670
everywhere like such as, and."

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,780
But that isn't always the case.

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
That was Miss Teen USA.

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,329
But Miss World is different.

22
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,489
Their motto is "Beauty With a Purpose."

23
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:00,559
That that's why they were so thrilled to have
Chinese-born Canadian Anastasia Lin win Miss

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,390
World Canada this year.

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,560
"Anastasia Lin was crowned Miss World Canada
in May.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,520
She has spoken out about religious persecution
in China,

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,200
and acted in films that highlight human rights
issues."

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,110
"The 25-year-old actress testified at a U.S.
Congressional hearing on religious persecution

29
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,920
in China in July."

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,610
Wow. That's actually pretty awesome.

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,750
That is "beauty with a purpose."

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,500
One reason she was inspired to speak out about
freedom of belief in China is the Chinese

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,939
regime's persecution of Falun Gong

34
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,619
a meditation practice.

35
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,909
She practices Falun Gong herself.

36
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,280
And if you've watched China Uncensored before,

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,810
you know that Chinese authorities throw a
fit at the mere mention of Falun Gong.

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,700
That's why

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,130
even though initially Chinese state-media
were proud to report that a Chinese-born contestant

40
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,890
had won Miss World Canada

41
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,869
they used a fake name for her.

42
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,579
And obviously didn't tell her whole story.

43
00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:01,110
Later, when Anastasia's win and activism gained
more international media attention,

44
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,079
Chinese security officials threatened her
father,

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,899
who's still living in China.

46
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:09,599
So he called her and asked her to stop talking
about human rights.

47
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,110
"My initial reaction was of course I'm not
going to speak about this anymore.

48
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,520
My family's in danger.

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,950
But, after about a few days of thinking,

50
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,520
I realized, if they're able to silence me
now,

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,260
I won't ever get a chance to speak again.

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,190
Cause they know that [if] this tactic will
work on me,

53
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,290
I will submit to their manipulation this way."

54
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,709
Not only did Anastasia refuse to submit to
China's manipulation,

55
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,000
so did Miss World Canada's national organizers.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,700
During the run-up to this year's pageant,

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,980
they received a mysterious threat:

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,370
"Don't be surprised if your sponsors start
pulling out due to an insulted Chinese government."

59
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,530
Not only did Miss World Canada ignore the
threat,

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,150
they forwarded the email to Anastasia.

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,930
And when the two Chinese judges intentionally
gave her a score of zero out of ten,

62
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,379
organizers ignored them, too.

63
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,709
Score one for Anastasia and for the folks
who run Miss World Canada.

64
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,780
And this courage in the face of threats is
why so many fans have been hoping she'll win

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,099
the international Miss World finals next month.

66
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,620
It'll make both Chinese people and Canadians
look good.

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,569
There's just one problem. Next month's finals
will be held in China.

68
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,450
"Anastasia Lin, the reigning Miss World Canada,

69
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,049
needs an invitation from the Chinese host
venue to apply for a visa that she says other

70
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,580
contestants have already received."

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,290
And she never got that invitation letter.

72
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,989
"So without the invitation letter from China
I cannot apply for the visa."

73
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:50,330
And rehearsals started on Monday.

74
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,760
It's just like that episode of Gossip Girl."So...
When's the party?"

75
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,950
"Saturday. And you're kinda not invited."

76
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,420
Wait, does that mean the CCP is Blair?

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,470
Anyway, not to worry.

78
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,239
Because this is the perfect opportunity for
Miss World to show that the "Beauty With a

79
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,500
Purpose" pageant won't let China get away
with using scare tactics to intimidate…

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,509
Wait. What's that Shelley?

81
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,210
They are letting them get away with it?!

82
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,470
According to the Daily Beast,

83
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,530
Miss World pageant organizers basically told
Anastasia, sorry,

84
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,979
there's nothing we can do.

85
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,419
You need China's invitation letter to get
the visa.

86
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,509
And since you didn't get the letter by last
Friday,

87
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,150
I guess you can't participate.

88
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,320
Now this may seem like a weird change of heart
for the Miss World organization, but it's

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,060
really not.

90
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,580
The folks who were so supportive of Anastasia's
activism before represented Miss World Canada.

91
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,280
But the finals in China are run by the larger
organization,

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,830
Miss World Limited.

93
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,710
It's a British company headquartered in London.

94
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,940
So naturally, Anastasia flew to London to
talk to them.

95
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,300
They told her they were too busy to meet with
her.

96
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,600
Then, as a media firestorm began to descend
on Miss World for,

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,620
you know, helping the Chinese regime intimidate
a Canadian citizen,

98
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,479
they told reporters,

99
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,270
"We do not know what is in a contestant's
background that would cause their visa applications

100
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,490
to be rejected."

101
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,620
Um... Falun Gong is what's in the contestant's
background, ok?

102
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,039
Did you even read about your own contest winner?

103
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,889
It's really not that big a mystery.

104
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,530
Or maybe Miss World Limited just doesn't have
time to deal with this.

105
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,660
But you know what they do have time for?

106
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,180
Millions of dollars.

107
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,780
You see, this year's Miss World will be held
in Sanya city on China's Hainan Island.

108
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,600
Since 2003, the Miss World Competition has
been held there seven times.

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,530
Six of those times were in a theater they
built specifically for the pageant.

110
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,259
This is great publicity for Sanya, and great
for China's overall soft-power propaganda.

111
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,139
That's why, instead of charging Miss World
to use facilities,

112
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:08,340
the Chinese city paid Miss World 4.8 million
dollars to be allowed to host them.

113
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,039
Not only that,

114
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,550
but Miss World was also allowed to keep all
the broadcasting fees paid by TV networks

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,400
outside of China.

116
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,639
So rather than demanding Anastasia's entry
into China,

117
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,240
or changing venues as a matter of principle,

118
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,419
the pageant will be held in the nice custom-built
Chinese theater, as the British organization

119
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,380
pockets loads of money.

120
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,680
See? "Beauty With a Purpose."

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,949
Money. Money's the purpose.

122
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,400
But perhaps there is something you can do.

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,569
Because if we allow China to stop Canada's
most beautiful woman from participating in

124
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,680
Miss World,

125
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,669
what will happen when China holds the winter
Olympics in 2022?

126
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,599
Should we also let them block any athlete
who says something critical about the Chinese

127
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,889
regime?

128
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,180
That's why one Canadian, presumably this guy...

129
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,270
“After you, ma’am”

130
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,410
...has started an online petition

131
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,050
where you can ask Chinese leader Xi Jinping
to let Anastasia into China for the Miss World

132
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,750
pageant.

133
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,650
"Because it's the right thing to do."

134
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,940
The link is in description below if you want
to join.

135
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,180
Show the Chinese Communist Party that they
can't bully the world into submission.

136
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,849
Once again I'm Chris Chappell.

137
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:19,860
See you next time.
