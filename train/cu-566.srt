1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,900
A Chinese jet crashed into a US spy plane

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,650
Causing a major diplomatic incident

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,650
And 20 years later,\h

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,660
The CCP is celebrating its propaganda victory

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,600
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,050
I’m Chris Chappell.\h

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,710
Last week was the 20th anniversary of the
Hainan Island incident.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,970
On April 1, 2001, a Chinese fighter jet collided
with a US reconnaissance plane above the South

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,619
China Sea.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:39,359
The Chinese jet crashed, but the US plane
managed to land...on Hainan Island, in China.\h

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,219
The collision caused a major diplomatic incident
between the US and China.

12
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,609
It was also the first big foreign policy test
for the George W. Bush administration.

13
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:53,949
That is, after someone finally convinced President
Bush that the collision actually happened

14
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:58,449
and was not in fact an elaborate April Fool’s
Day joke set up by Dick Cheney.

15
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,289
He’s such a kidder.

16
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,769
We’ve never talked about the Hainan Island
incident on this show.

17
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:08,000
It happened way before China Uncensored—even
before Youtube.\h

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,549
But US-China relations are still feeling the
repercussions of that incident even 20 years

19
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,850
later.

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,080
So let’s take a look back at what happened.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
April 2001.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,479
It was a different time.

23
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,359
China Uncensored didn’t exist yet.

24
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,359
But if we did, we probably would have had
a Geocities website.

25
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,820
Which you could have found by Asking Jeeves
on your Netscape Navigator.

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,159
And YouTube wasn’t around, so China Uncensored
would probably just be Flash animations where

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,859
I talked about the dangers of the Chinese
Communist Party while answering emails.

28
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,960
It would have been very popular.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,789
On April 1, 2001, a US Navy EP-3 maritime
patrol aircraft was on a routine surveillance

30
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:52,330
flight over the South China Sea...

31
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,439
when it was intercepted by two Chinese J-8
fighter jets.

32
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,799
That was not unusual, either.

33
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,189
But the Chinese jets had a habit of getting
dangerously close to US planes.

34
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,240
And they had been getting more aggressive.

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,319
To the point that the US had already made
official protests to China about the issue.

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,640
One of the Chinese pilots, Wang Wei, was especially
known for pulling dangerous stunts.\h

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,110
After the Chinese jets appeared, the US plane
turned and started heading back to base.

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,390
At this point they were about 70 miles off
of the coast of Hainan Island, over international

39
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,099
waters in the South China Sea.

40
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,170
But then, things turned deadly.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,840
I’ll tell you how after the break.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
Welcome back.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,450
Chinese pilot Wang Wei was flying dangerously
close to the US reconnaissance plane over

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,830
the South China Sea.

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,310
Here’s what happened according to a PBS
Frontline interview with the American pilot,

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,299
Lieutenant Shane Osborn.

47
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:54,159
The footage is from an earlier incident.

48
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,519
Osborn said the Chinese pilot came up next
to the plane once, and then a second time.

49
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,810
The second time, he was only about 10 feet
away.

50
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,120
He could see his face.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,069
It made the American crew nervous.

52
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:12,500
The third time, the Chinese jet came up from
underneath, and its nose collided with the

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,910
nose of the American plane.

54
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,290
Both planes began to fall.

55
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:24,260
The US plane dove 8,000 ft while upside down,
but Osborn, the pilot, managed to get it under

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,640
control.

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,709
He was forced to make an emergency landing
on the airstrip of a military base in Hainan,

58
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,180
an island that’s part of China.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,870
After hitting the US plane, Wang Wei’s jet
broke up in the air and he parachuted into

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,120
the sea.

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,829
Despite a search and rescue mission by the
PLA, his body was never found.

62
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,940
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party had
this US reconnaissance plane grounded on its

63
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
airstrip.

64
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,129
They also had its 24 crewmembers, which they
spent days interrogating.\h

65
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:58,920
Plus, the Party’s propaganda apparatus was
getting into gear.

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,569
The main goal was to blame the Americans for
the crash.

67
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,560
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the US plane
purposely turned toward the Chinese plane,

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,329
bumping it and causing it to crash.\h

69
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:13,799
That might have been based on the account
of Wang Wei’s wingman, Zhao Yu, who said

70
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,500
that he saw the head and left wing of the
US plane bump into Wang’s plane.

71
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,230
Although Zhao didn’t say that the US plane
turned toward the Chinese jet.\h

72
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,490
The Foreign Ministry also said that the US
should bear full responsibility for the incident,

73
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,740
and also pay compensation for the Chinese
damage.

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,530
The idea that the US needed to take full responsibility
was repeated, including by then Chinese leader

75
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,830
and chief toad Jiang Zemin.

76
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,520
Jiang also said the Chinese government had
“sufficient evidence” that it was America’s

77
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
fault.\h

78
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,860
And Jiang also accused the US of violating
Chinese airspace.

79
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,240
It’s not clear what evidence that the Chinese
Communist Party had, because they never released

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
any.\h

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,800
Meanwhile, the US government initially didn’t
assign any blame.\h

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,580
But as the Chinese Communist Party continued
with its propaganda offensive, including suggesting

83
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,090
that the US would need to apologize before
China would release the American crew members,

84
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,210
the US government began to change tactics.

85
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,720
The Department of Defense released a video
showing the pilot Wang Wei getting dangerously

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,220
close to another US plane in January 2001.\h

87
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,870
That’s the footage you saw earlier.

88
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,810
The US also released a photo showing Wang
Wei flying close to a US plane and holding

89
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,270
up his email address.

90
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,980
You can’t quite make it out in the photo,
but I’m guessing it was an AOL.com address.

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,850
But basically, the US was showing Wang Wei
was a reckless pilot who had a history of

92
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,860
showboating and harassing US planes.

93
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,520
That’s something the Chinese Communist Party
didn’t want to get out, since they were

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,550
making Wang into a martyr, including awarding
him the title of Guardian of the Territorial

95
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,540
Airspace and Waters.

96
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,260
After days of tense negotiations, the US ambassador
to China issued what became known as the Letter

97
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,790
of Two Sorries.

98
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,260
 The letter expressed sincere regret over
China’s missing pilot and said that the

99
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,760
US was sorry for their loss.

100
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,840
It also said the US was “very sorry the
entering of China’s airspace and landing

101
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,710
did not have verbal clearance.”

102
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,380
Keep in mind, this US reconnaissance plane—or
what Chinese propaganda would like you to

103
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,590
remember as the “spy plane”—was flying
over international waters when it was hit.

104
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,080
It only entered Chinese airspace to make the
emergency landing.

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,840
But Chinese regime took this as the US apologizing
for the incident.\h

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,110
The US maintained that the letter expressed
the Bush administration’s regret and sorrow,

107
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,370
but it was absolutely not an apology.\h

108
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,440
Diplomacy: The art of purposeful ambiguity
so that both sides can say they won.

109
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,050
But what happened to the American crew?

110
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,260
And what happened to the plane with sensitive
technology on board?

111
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,300
I’ll tell you after the break.

112
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,650
Welcome back.

113
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,100
The US sent China a letter of regret about
the collision.

114
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,800
And afterwards, China released the 24 American
crewmembers.

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,370
They flew back to the US 10 days after their
emergency landing.

116
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,830
And the US reconnaissance plane was eventually
dismantled and returned to the US three months

117
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,130
later.\h

118
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:26,190
The US also paid China more than 30,000 dollars
to cover the costs of housing the American

119
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,610
plane crew.

120
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,550
Which the Chinese regime claimed was compensation
for the crash.\h

121
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,470
After the Americans were safely home, the
Bush administration was more direct about

122
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,660
blaming the Chinese pilot for the collision.

123
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,610
But the damage was already done.

124
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,680
The Chinese Communist Party’s narrative,
that it was America’s fault, was here to

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,000
stay.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,940
In the aftermath of the incident, it was clear
that the Chinese Communist Party was able

127
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,360
to learn quite a bit of classified intel from
the US plane.\h

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,050
Although the EP-3’s crew tried to destroy
as much classified information as they could,

129
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,750
including by smashing computers, they weren’t
able to do so completely.

130
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,440
It’s even possible that the Communist Party
was able to reverse engineer the plane’s

131
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
operating system.

132
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,140
“Mastering it would give China a road map
for decrypting the Navy’s classified intelligence

133
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,460
and operational data.”

134
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,620
In 2008, an unrelated incident showed this
data breach might have happened.

135
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,460
So the Obama administration spent hundreds
of millions of dollars replacing all of the

136
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,600
similar operating systems in the Navy.\h

137
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,959
The Chinese regime also learned secret information
involving what the US knew about the PLA.

138
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,490
For example, that the US had been able to
locate and collect signal transmissions associated

139
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,160
with Chinese submarines.

140
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,250
And now, 20 years later, the Chinese Communist
Party is still using the Hainan Island incident

141
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,250
as propaganda.

142
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,579
In fact, they’re practically celebrating
it.\h

143
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,610
As they launch drills in the South China Sea.

144
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,500
Here’s a photo of the pilot Wang Wei’s
memorial.

145
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,959
Someone placed a basket of flowers with a
photo of Chinese Communist Party official

146
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,290
Yang Jiechi lecturing US officials during
the Alaska meeting a few weeks ago.\h

147
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,330
The message is clearly that China is a lot
stronger than it was 20 years ago, and now

148
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,650
it’s a match for the US.\h

149
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,560
And the Chinese Communist Party is of course
sticking with their propaganda narrative that

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,370
it was the US plane’s fault.\h

151
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,930
“The US reconnaissance plane made a sudden
wide turn, crashing into the Chinese plane.”\h

152
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,780
That’s from a state-run media video that
uses the Hainan Island incident to brag about

153
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,230
how advanced China’s military is now.

154
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,019
But as advanced as the PLA is, it doesn’t
mean they’ve stopped flying dangerously

155
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,300
aroundUS planes.

156
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,730
Which means that there could still be another
Hainan Island incident today.

157
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,990
As if there aren’t already enough flash
points in the South China Sea.

158
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,019
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you, a fan who supports China

159
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,230
Uncensored on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

160
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,029
Banana Pancakes asks:
So how far will this nationalistic fervour

161
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:09,350
continue in China?

162
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,389
Will people go start burning down factories?

163
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:17,500
At this point they might as well so that factory
owners can claim their insurance coverage.

164
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,160
That’s in reference to our episode about
China boycotting foreign brands like H&M and

165
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,200
Nike because they refuse to use Xinjiang cotton,
a.k.a. cotton that is likely made from slave

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,519
labor.

167
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,889
Well Banana Pancakes, the truth is that the
nationalistic fervor will continue as long

168
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,360
as it’s useful for the Chinese Communist
Party.\h

169
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,310
They’ve gotten really good at being able
to gin up the outrage when they need it, but

170
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:48,740
also keep it from going too far and out of
control, thanks to the magic of Internet censorship.

171
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,370
And a mass surveillance state.

172
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,980
And a huge propaganda apparatus.

173
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,370
You get the picture.\h

174
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,040
Burning down factories would be going too
far.

175
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,990
Because then it would make China look bad.\h

176
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,670
Just like the anti-Japanese protests back
in 2012, that turned into people burning Japanese

177
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,829
cars and causing over a hundred million dollars
in damage.

178
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,509
Plus, there’s always the possibility that
if you let people protest too much about one

179
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:17,860
thing, they could start protesting about other
things, or even worse, protesting against

180
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,899
the Chinese Communist Party.

181
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,050
So they’re not going to let that happen.

182
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,199
Thanks for your question, Banana Pancakes.\h

183
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,749
Be like Banana Pancakes.

184
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:31,180
Go to patreon.com/ChinaUncensored and support
the show for as little as a dollar an episode.

185
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,670
And I could answer your question, too.

186
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,089
And thank you for watching this episode of
China Uncensored.

187
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,550
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

188
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:53,899
I’ll see you on our Geocities page.
