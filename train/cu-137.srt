1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:02,199
Chris, where’s your bags?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,199
What do you mean?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,800
I booked you on a cultural tour to Tainan.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,560
The one from the Jia Jia Hotel Group.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,509
Oh no, I’m not falling for this again!

6
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:12,009
Last time you booked me on a trip,

7
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,059
I spent 56 hours on a Filipino fishing boat!

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,059
No go!

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,680
This is totally different!

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,940
You promise?

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,760
This is an actual cultural tour

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,410
and not code for putting me into

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,800
physical danger?

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,600
Absolutely.

15
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,360
Shelley!

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,220
Hi, I’m Chris Chappell.

17
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,390
You may know me from China Uncensored,

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,890
or The Matrix: Refunded.

19
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,870
That one was direct to TV.

20
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,590
Anyway, you may also know that China Uncensored

21
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,960
is supported primarily through Patreon

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,630
with contributions from viewers like you.

23
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,950
It’s also supported by sponsors,

24
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,770
who contribute things like clothing.

25
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,160
And in the case of our 2016 Pivot to Asia
Tour,

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,300
hotels.

27
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,160
Our week-long tour in Taiwan

28
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,079
was supported by the Jia Jia Hotel Group.

29
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,750
They put us up in great hotels

30
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,939
in Taipei and Tainan.

31
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:07,939
And in return,

32
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,170
we made this video showing some of the things

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,359
you might do—and maybe shouldn’t do—

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,120
if you take their cultural tour package in
Taiwan.

35
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,430
I had my suspicions about this “cultural
trip.”

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,240
As a wise man once said,

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,149
fool me once shame on you.

38
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:28,429
Fool me twice,

39
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:31,279
um, can’t get fooled again?

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,900
But the rich beauty of Taiwan called to me.

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:47,920
You’re right,

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,060
this is a much more relaxing trip.

43
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,899
Ms. Kino Tsai,

44
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,599
designer of the Jia Jia Hotels,

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,180
was waiting for us in the lobby,

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,360
ready to show us our rooms.

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,180
The Jia Jia Hotel was unlike anything I’d
seen before.

48
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,810
Rooms were given special themes,

49
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,879
and designed and enriched by the people

50
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,680
who stayed in them.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,860
I was staying in the Chinese medicine room.

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,459
There were jars filled with Chinese herbs.

53
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,709
And tea.

54
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,069
The perfect place to relax

55
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,819
after a long day of uncensoring stuff.

56
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,129
Now please leave the room so I can rest.

57
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,519
Shelley says she has something “special”

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,720
planned for me in the morning.

59
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,660
Shelley, my room is fantastic!

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,780
So glad you like it!

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,680
You were right.

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,730
This cultural tour

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,019
was an amazing idea.

64
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,310
Well I’m glad to hear you say that

65
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,890
because I’ve signed you up for a very special

66
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,209
traditional Taiwanese shoemaking class.

67
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,430
Oh, that’s fantastic!

68
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,459
You know, a man really should be able

69
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:12,580
to make his own shoes.

70
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,980
You’re so right.

71
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,880
Let’s go.

72
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,960
Well, here we are.

73
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,849
Traditional women’s cloth shoes.

74
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,080
Oh, you didn’t say it was women’s shoes.

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,260
Oh didn’t I?

76
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,500
That’s great, I’ll give it a shot!

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Really?

78
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,440
Yeah, thanks Shelley!

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Hotel staff were kind enough to show me the
ropes

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,960
of shoemaking.

81
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,160
Oh yeah, this was going to be fun.

82
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,400
Focus.

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Dedication.

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,600
Scissors.

85
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,670
I’m not a man making shoes,

86
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,440
I’m a shoe-making man.

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
One piece down.

88
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,760
Hard.

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,040
Apparently really hard.

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,480
Hi, Shelley!

91
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
Hi, Chris.

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,490
How did the women’s shoemaking class go?

93
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,090
It went great.

94
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,120
I made these for you!

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Really?

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,380
Wow, they’re actually really nice.

97
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,770
Thanks Chris, that’s really sweet.

98
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,720
No problem, um,

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,350
your feet are a little bigger than I thought.

100
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,660
I hope they fit.

101
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,780
Anyway, I signed us up for

102
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,180
a traditional Taiwanese cooking class!

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,100
Let’s go!

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,100
Well, Shelley,

105
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,480
tonight we’ll be cooking some spring rolls,

106
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
coffin bread,

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,040
and Aiyu jelly!

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,280
I wonder what Aiyu jelly is.

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,860
And coffin bread…

110
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,640
So you can cook?

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
How hard can it be?

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
Chris!

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,140
Chris, we need to go on that

114
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,480
Tainan tour!

115
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,320
A tour of Tainan in southern Taiwan!

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,640
Our first stop was the famous Confucian Temple.

117
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,170
No con-fusion about it.

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,040
That was the best Confucian Temple I’d ever
been to.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh, and one valuable lesson I learned

120
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,280
about being a tourist—

121
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
always be aware of your surroundings.

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,440
Shelley!

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
It smells bad!

124
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
The Narrow Door Cafe.

125
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,200
I wonder why they call it that…

126
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,840
Oh.

127
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,760
Wow, I had a really great time today.

128
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,100
What’s next?

129
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,760
Back to Taipei.

130
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,460
To the high-speed rail!

131
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,200
Shelley and I made our way back north

132
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,530
to the Taipei Jia Jia Papersun Apartment.

133
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,880
As part of their tour,

134
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,720
they told us we should check out the nearby

135
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,360
Shilin night market.

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,080
Wow, Shelley, I am so excited to be here

137
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,030
in a traditional Taiwanese night market!

138
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,150
Well, Shilin night market is one of the biggest

139
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,150
in Taipei.

140
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,460
Let’s go.

141
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,260
Actually Chris, that’s the Taoist temple.

142
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,920
This is the night market.

143
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,780
Woah…

144
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh boy, Shelley, you got us those famous

145
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,010
chicken sticks I’ve head so much about?

146
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,300
Sorry, it was the last one, so I got you this.

147
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,180
Chris, you gotta try these -

148
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
candied Hawthorne fruits,

149
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,630
my favorite as a kid.

150
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,900
Oh, why thank you Shelley.

151
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,820
They look great.

152
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,220
What do you think?

153
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,560
They’re great!

154
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,400
Wow!

155
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,680
Want the rest?

156
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,920
No, I couldn’t possibly…

157
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Please…

158
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,240
Oh Shelley, that looks really good.

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,180
Can I try some?

160
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,180
Sure.

161
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,100
Oh, that’s amazing!

162
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,620
What’s in it?

163
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,760
Frog eggs.

164
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,300
Okay, they’re not really frog eggs.

165
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,960
They just call them frog eggs.

166
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,700
My trust in you is shattered.

167
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,500
Let me know if you need any help, Shelley.

168
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,640
Well, Shelley, I had a amazing time.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,620
Thanks for signing us up for this tour.

170
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Absolutely.

171
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,280
Now tell them about the thing.

172
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,040
Tell who?

173
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
Tell them!

174
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,680
Oh.

175
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Right.

176
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,460
Our hotel stay in Taiwan

177
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,220
was sponsored by the Jia Jia Hotel Group.

178
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,920
And they have a five-day tour

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,720
of Taipei and Tainan,

180
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,120
where you can do pretty much

181
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,180
all the same stuff

182
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,850
you saw Shelley and me do in this episode,

183
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,740
and stay in the same cool hotel rooms!

184
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,040
So click below,

185
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
and book it for yourself

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,230
when you visit Taiwan.

187
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,370
Was that the thing?

188
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,240
That was the thing.
