1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,410
Donald Trump...

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,840
versus Xi Jinping.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,800
Saturday’s meeting between Donald Trump
and China’s Xi Jinping

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,170
ended in a trade truce...

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,620
...or did it?!

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,340
Hi.

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,409
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:16,930
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,130
The G20.

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,820
It’s like going on vacation with your entire
extended family

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,289
that you barely get along with.

12
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,510
Unlike the G7,

13
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,029
which is like going on vacation with your
immediate family

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:29,029
that you...

15
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,960
barely get along with.

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,770
And just like my family vacations,

17
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,380
there were plenty of protests,

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,910
tons of security,

19
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,230
and loads of photo ops.

20
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,460
Now doesn’t that just scream

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,530
“we’re happy to be here!”

22
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,530
Anyway,

23
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,690
the annual G20 meeting

24
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,000
was held in Argentina over the weekend.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,870
It’s a forum where world leaders get together

26
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,510
basically to discuss ways to avoid international
crises.

27
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,530
And in some cases,

28
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,280
to slap exuberant high-fives to cement their
budding bromances.

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,690
I wonder if there’s a backstory here.

30
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,210
“We meet later.

31
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,080
I show you how to kill many journalist.”

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,550
Poison.

33
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,950
The trick is poison.

34
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,380
Anyway, as far as I’m concerned,

35
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,260
the G20’s single most important event was

36
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,570
a working dinner between

37
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,740
US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader
Xi Jinping.

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,040
One of the big issues for Trump

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,380
was stemming the flow of fentanyl from China.

40
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,980
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid drug.

41
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,960
And fentanyl coming illegally from China

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,020
is a big part of the deadly drug epidemic
in the US.

43
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,090
The closed door dinner meeting

44
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,650
lasted an hour longer than expected,

45
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,280
so there was obviously no shortage of other
stuff to talk about.

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,570
For example:

47
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,690
trade tariffs, intellectual property theft,

48
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,820
government subsidies, and of course,

49
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,409
whether you should eat steak with a fork or
with chopsticks.

50
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,409
Of course,

51
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,490
the press had to leave before the steak arrived,

52
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,160
so we don’t know exactly what Trump and
Xi Jinping talked about.

53
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,670
But we do know how it ended.

54
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,670
Sort of.

55
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,670
OK, it’s complicated.

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,700
The White House issued a press statement....

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,570
...and so did the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

58
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,380
And they don’t exactly match up.

59
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,749
The US said China would

60
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,749
“designate Fentanyl as a Controlled Substance,

61
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,480
meaning that people selling Fentanyl to the
United States

62
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,340
will be subject to China’s maximum penalty
under the law.”

63
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,920
But China merely said it would

64
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,150
“start working to adjust related regulations.”

65
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,540
Those two statements are not the same.

66
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,000
It’s like your wife expects you to fix the
garage door,

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,599
but technically you only agreed to start

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,409
exploring garage-door-related issues.

69
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:38,840
Now when it comes to trade,

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,069
there was also a bit of a mismatch.

71
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,639
Originally the US was going to raise tariffs

72
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:49,530
on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods
from 10% to 25%,

73
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,510
starting on January 1st.

74
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,510
After the meeting,

75
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,609
according to the White House,

76
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,330
Trump agreed to delay those tariffs for 90
days.

77
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,120
That aims to allow both sides to reach an
agreement on

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,349
“structural changes with respect to forced
technology transfer,

79
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,389
intellectual property protection,

80
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,609
non-tariff barriers,

81
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,040
cyber intrusions and cyber theft.”

82
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,669
But did the Chinese Foreign Ministry admit
to

83
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,389
any of those things?

84
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:15,640
Of course not!

85
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,389
They just said both sides reached consensus

86
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,680
and agreed not to impose new additional tariffs.

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Wait,

88
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,510
did they not hear the “for 90 days” part?

89
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,579
Or did they just forget to write it down?

90
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,749
Also, according to the White House,

91
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:33,249
“China will agree to purchase a not yet
agreed upon,

92
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:34,680
but very substantial,

93
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,849
amount of agricultural, energy, industrial,

94
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,939
and other product from the United States

95
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,389
to reduce the trade imbalance.”

96
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,590
But the Chinese statement merely said

97
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,150
“it will work to open its market,

98
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,949
expand imports and resolve economy- and trade-related
issues.”

99
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,079
And they “called on the two sides to

100
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,159
realize cooperation for win-win results.”

101
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,159
And of course that

102
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,180
“The foundation and premise of any positive
moves

103
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,230
is a concrete agreement featuring mutually
beneficial

104
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,659
and win-win results.”

105
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,319
Yes, it’s a win-win.

106
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,329
China has even said they’re going to allow

107
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,180
Trump’s speeches on state-run CCTV.

108
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,180
With some minor edits.

109
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,180
“We’re gonna win-win with trade.

110
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,940
We’re gonna win-win with health.

111
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,850
We’re gonna win-win at so many levels.

112
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,100
We’re gonna win-win.

113
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,020
You’re gonna get so tired of win-winning.

114
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,270
You’re gonna say,

115
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,520
‘Mr. President, please!

116
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,020
We don’t want to win-win anymore!

117
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,270
It’s too much!’

118
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,940
And I’m gonna say,

119
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
‘I’m sorry,

120
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,440
we’re gonna keep win-winning.’”

121
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,699
I guess that’s what happens when you make
deals

122
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,520
with Win-Winnie the Pooh.

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
That being said,

124
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,460
it’s possible the Chinese Communist Party

125
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,699
has a somewhat different definition of win-win.

126
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,420
China expert Bill Bishop says

127
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,879
it’s likely that China has

128
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,560
no intention of making the kind of structural
changes

129
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,460
to its unfair trade policies that the US is
calling for.

130
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,740
“The Chinese are always playing for time,”

131
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,960
he says, “and any pause that involves more
talking

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,950
is a victory for Beijing,

133
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,610
as it only adds to the chances they have

134
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,740
for a shift to a more favorable US domestic
political environment.”

135
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,240
This is echoed by the South China Morning
Post,

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,060
which argues that now comes the hard part:

137
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,960
making good on China’s trade war truce promises.

138
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
And that,

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,300
according to Nicholas Consonery,

140
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,180
director of the research firm Rhodium Group,

141
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,699
just doesn’t seem likely.

142
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,610
“We’ve got a window now to see how serious

143
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,099
the Chinese government is about moving forward

144
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,639
with structural economic reform,” he said.

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,229
“And recent history doesn’t lead us to
a very optimistic place.”

146
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,669
So it would seem that it’s a pretty tall
order

147
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,939
for Chinese and American negotiators to agree

148
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,460
within just 90 days on the massive structural
changes

149
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,419
China needs to make.

150
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,470
Especially when they can’t even agree

151
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,310
on what they agreed on at the meeting.

152
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,310
Besides,

153
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,240
Xi Jinping may try to drag things out as long
as he can.

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,430
Because he knows that while President Trump

155
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,479
only has another 2 to 6 years in office,

156
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,719
he gets to be president for life.

157
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,139
Provided that Xi can continue

158
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,520
to fend off the other Communist Party faction

159
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,480
that’s out for his blood.

160
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,020
But that’s another episode.

161
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,479
So what do you think about the G20 meeting

162
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,349
between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping?

163
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,449
Leave your comments below.

164
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,630
And before you go,

165
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,199
it’s time for me to answer a question

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,729
from one of you who supports China Uncensored

167
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,120
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

168
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,389
David Blatt asks:

169
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,550
“Why don't states in the middle east,

170
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,840
where Islam is so important it's often the
official religion

171
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,870
and justice systems are based on it in the
form of Sharia Law,

172
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,099
help the Uyghurs of China

173
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,000
from the oppression of the infidel CCP?”

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,439
Good question, David.

175
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,199
My simple answer is,

176
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,069
geopolitics are strategic,

177
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:58,069
and decisions are not always based on good
moral choices,

178
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,849
or even based on religious alliances.

179
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:01,970
Consider this:

180
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,909
For most of the big Islamic countries

181
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:07,210
including Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Turkey,

182
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,759
and the United Arab Emirates

183
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,650
their biggest trade partner is China.

184
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,460
So a lot of governments might think it’s
not a good idea to rock the boat.

185
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,690
And also countries like

186
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,580
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt,

187
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,850
don’t have the best human rights records.

188
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,319
Many of them are authoritarian regimes that,

189
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,240
like the Chinese Communist Party,

190
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,110
emphasize so-called “social stability”,

191
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,669
as well as also non-interference

192
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,449
with the internal affairs of other countries.

193
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,030
Which really means that they don’t want
other countries

194
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,189
to interfere in their internal affairs.

195
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,610
Just like the Chinese Communist Party.

196
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,240
So this looks like a case where geopolitical

197
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,449
and strategic economic interests

198
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,770
are more important than religious interests.

199
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,909
But I would argue that even for people

200
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,730
who don’t care about Islam,

201
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,389
it’s important to condemn what the Chinese
Communist Party

202
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,569
is doing to the Uighurs.

203
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:05,700
The techniques they’re developing to spy
on and oppress Uighurs

204
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,830
they’re honing those skills,

205
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,229
and the next time they go after another group,

206
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:13,229
they’ll oppress that group even more.

207
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,520
And if you’re in China,

208
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,999
one day, that group could include you.

209
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,180
So thanks for your...

210
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,510
depressing question, David.

211
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,800
