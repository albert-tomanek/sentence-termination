1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,440
And finally,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,680
Shelley convinced me to go for

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,960
a little trip outside the studio.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
I learned about a massive legal action so
big

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,640
it could affect the course of China’s future.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,400
Also, we got to stop at Cracker Barrel.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,279
A summer road trip with the China Uncensored
gang!

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,140
We’re headed down to beautiful, sunny...

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,850
Wait, where are we going again?

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,760
Washington, D.C.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Great.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,770
Everyone’s along for the ride!

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,690
Our producer Matt, myself, Shelley,

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,410
our summer intern Noah,

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,100
and our cameraman Allen.

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,340
Wait, who’s driving the car?!

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,989
Are we there yet?

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,449
After a grueling trip,

19
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,410
we finally made it to the nation’s capital.

20
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,410
Shelley’s promised me

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,579
that we're here to cover a big story.

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,700
I can't wait.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,690
So where’s the big story?

24
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,690
This is the big story.

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,690
This is the big story?

26
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,170
This is the big story.

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,620
It’s...another Falun Gong parade?!

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
No.

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,680
This is a rally.

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,420
Also, what’s wrong with that?

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,840
Okay, I know we cover Falun Gong a lot,

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,500
because it’s the biggest human rights crisis

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,010
in China.

34
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,500
But look, Shelley...

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,970
they’re SO BORING!

36
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,690
Whaaat?

37
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,390
Look at them!

38
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,840
Peacefully meditating,

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,320
peacefully holding banners,

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,150
peacefully handing out flyers.

41
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,100
I bet I couldn’t even get a single one of
them

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
to throw a single brick

43
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,630
through the window of the Chinese Embassy!

44
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,910
Is that...a bad thing?

45
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,320
It’s a boring thing.

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
So I guess you’re not interested

47
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
in one of the biggest stories today

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
that no one else is talking about.

49
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Tell me more.

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,560
Suing a former world leader.

51
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,780
Bush or Clinton?

52
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Neither.

53
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
China’s former leader:

54
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Jiang Zemin.

55
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Shelley.

56
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,780
We’ve talked about this.

57
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,780
Toadatron 2000.

58
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,780
You want to call the guy

59
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
who ordered the torture and killing

60
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
of all of those people

61
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,780
Toadatron 2000.

62
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,780
Yes.

63
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,910
Toadatron 2000.

64
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,910
Fine.

65
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,320
Toadatron 2000.

66
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,440
So Falun Gong practitioners

67
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,360
are suing Toadatron 2000.

68
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,650
Technically, they’re filing criminal complaints.

69
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,650
The difference is…

70
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,660
These aren’t civil lawsuits.

71
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,710
They’re legal complaints filed under Article
108

72
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,440
of China’s Criminal Procedure Law.

73
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,280
This explanation is going to be boring, isn’t
it?

74
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Very.

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,410
The Criminal Procedure Law states that

76
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,720
Chinese citizens can bring a case

77
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,120
against a criminal \hsuspect

78
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,940
by filing a complaint that shows

79
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,390
how they were victimized by the suspect.

80
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,880
On May 1, 2015,

81
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,420
the Supreme People’s Court issued new guidelines

82
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,700
that require authorities to accept

83
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,000
all criminal complaints.

84
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
What were they doing before?

85
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,540
Throwing out the ones they didn’t like?

86
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Yes.

87
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
I was joking.

88
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,540
I know.

89
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,540
But it’s true.

90
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
Falun Gong practitioners began submitting

91
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,750
these criminal complaints against Jiang---

92
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,750
Toadatron 2000

93
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,030
to the Supreme People’s Court

94
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,610
and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate.

95
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,210
More than 200,000 so far.

96
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,210
The procuratorate.

97
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,210
The procuratorate.

98
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,210
They’re responsible for investigating

99
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,310
and prosecuting cases.

100
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,310
To be honest,

101
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,660
I’m not sure I got all of that.

102
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,800
Maybe this will help.

103
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,910
I’m a complaint

104
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,459
Yes, I’m just a complaint

105
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,241
And I’m sitting here at the Supreme People’s
Procuratorate

106
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,530
It took a lot of courage

107
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,880
for someone to go and send me

108
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,510
But I might be used by Xi

109
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,040
to purge his longtime enemy

110
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,310
Yes, my case could bring Jiang down someday

111
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,540
At least if rule of law has its say,

112
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,040
but today I remain a complaint

113
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,020
Gee, criminal complaint,

114
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,069
you sure have a lot of patience and courage.

115
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:37,849
Well, I got this far.

116
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,770
Before, they would have just thrown me out.

117
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,040
You see, everything written in me

118
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,750
shows how former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin

119
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,099
broke specific parts of China’s criminal
law

120
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,280
when he ordered the persecution of Falun Gong.

121
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,642
And if I actually become a part

122
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:50,770
of a criminal case someday,

123
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,400
then that will show that China

124
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,250
really does have rule of law.

125
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,069
Yeah, that was much clearer.

126
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,810
But what happened at the end?We ran out of
the animation budget.

127
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,810
But you get the point.

128
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,810
Yes, I do.

129
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,459
The point is: power.

130
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,540
Former former leader Jiang Zemin

131
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,320
used the persecution of Falun Gong

132
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,430
to set the table to his liking.

133
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,180
And former leader Hu Jintao

134
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,540
had no choice but to eat off those plates.

135
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,910
But when Xi Jinping came to power,

136
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,940
he started to...remove those plates.

137
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,190
And these criminal complaints,

138
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,340
this pile of evidence of Jiang’s wrongdoings,

139
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,699
that could help Xi turn the table over,

140
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:28,849
once and for all.

141
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,190
The question is, will it?

142
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,300
Chris, do you want to meet someone

143
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,360
who’s filed a criminal complaint?It would
be an honor and a privilege.

144
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,460
Why are you talking like that?

145
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,909
Talking like what?

146
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,740
I met William Huang.

147
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,759
While he was getting his Ph.D in Engineering

148
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,580
from Tsinghua University,

149
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,000
he was arrested for practicing Falun Gong.

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In 2015,

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,500
he filed a complaint against Jiang.

152
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,279
So what was in the criminal complaint?

153
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,279
So in this criminal complaint I described

154
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,300
what I experienced—

155
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,129
the torture I experienced in the jail

156
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,569
during that five years.

157
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,599
We were forced to do

158
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,020
the slave labor every day,

159
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,020
at least sixteen-hour days in a small cell

160
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,710
and all the products we made,

161
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,430
like plastic flowers for decoration,

162
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,460
also the Christmas tree line chain.

163
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
When I came to the USA,

164
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,180
I saw exactly the products

165
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,479
we made in the labor camp.

166
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,749
Also, you know,

167
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,439
once the police used over ten

168
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,919
high-voltage electric batons

169
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,099
to shock me at the same time.

170
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,229
My whole body just shattering—

171
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:38,639
almost died—

172
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,500
and I feel very bad.

173
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,419
And they deprived of sleep totally from me

174
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:45,780
for a whole month.

175
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,460
They wanted to brainwash me

176
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,560
and force me to give up my belief.

177
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,819
So you were very much a victim

178
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,870
of the Chinese legal system.

179
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,159
Why are you trying to use the legal system

180
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,210
by filing a complaint?

181
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,960
Even based on the constitution,

182
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,729
you know, they said Chinese citizens

183
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,729
should have freedom of religion,

184
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:07,729
freedom of belief.

185
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:08,809
But in fact, not.

186
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:11,099
In fact, it’s the Communist Party

187
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,169
and then-leader Jiang Zemin—

188
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,919
he violates their own laws.

189
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,150
So I can use their law to file

190
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,110
the criminal [complaint] against them.

191
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,550
I mean, don’t you ever just want to just

192
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,759
go to the Chinese Embassy and throw

193
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,199
a brick through the window?

194
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,969
No, no, absolutely not.

195
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:31,999
Because Falun Gong, you know,

196
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,680
we are very peaceful people.

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Yes, peaceful.

198
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Right.

199
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
I know, very peaceful.

200
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,499
They’ve been very peaceful all day.

201
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,939
No violence at all.

202
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,051
Ok, so I feel like I understand why

203
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,969
someone would file a complaint.

204
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:45,969
But still,

205
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,550
does it really have a greater significance?

206
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,479
Why don’t you ask Freedom House?

207
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:50,479
I don’t know...

208
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,479
It’s air-conditioned.

209
00:06:51,479 --> 00:07:01,360
Lead the way.

210
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,439
So how does one file a criminal complaint

211
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,060
against Jiang Zemin inside of China?

212
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,339
So the way most people are doing it right
now

213
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,699
is they’re doing it by mail, basically.

214
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,000
And people write up the complaint

215
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,599
and put it in a package and will send it off.

216
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,309
So Falun Gong practitioners in China,

217
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:21,589
they’re dealing with horrible crimes against
humanity

218
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:25,000
by essentially filing paperwork?

219
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,399
Um, yes.

220
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,399
So what is the impact

221
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,490
these criminal complaints are having?

222
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,490
“I think there’s the immediate

223
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,490
and what might be the long-term.

224
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,290
I think a lot of people filing the complaints

225
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,290
are thinking about the long-term.

226
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,290
They’re thinking, ‘There’s going to
be a day

227
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,979
when there is either rule of law in China

228
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,729
or some of the political vendettas

229
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,189
and factions in the Communist Party

230
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,229
create the political environment where

231
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,379
Jiang Zemin could actually be prosecuted

232
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:51,800
for his role in launching the persecution

233
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,150
against Falun Gong.

234
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,520
When that time comes,

235
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,119
we want the prosecutors to be ready

236
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,719
and the have the information they need

237
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,389
about all of these crimes that were committed

238
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,839
and to have that historical record.’

239
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,850
So I think potentially you could see in the
future

240
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,009
that having a real impact from that perspective.

241
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,419
I think in the immediate-term

242
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,819
there’s other kinds of impacts.

243
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,800
It potentially has an impact on people

244
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,129
working inside the system.

245
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,189
And some of the plaintiffs that we interviewed
said,

246
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:18,189
‘Look, one of reasons I sent this complaint

247
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:19,449
is that I really hope that the person

248
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,699
who reads it at the central procuratorate

249
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,309
is going to see this and realize,

250
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:25,899
“Wow, this is really what’s going on

251
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,580
in the persecution and campaign

252
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,789
against Falun Gong.”

253
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,719
And maybe if they have a request to participate,

254
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,010
they won’t participate in the future.’

255
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,010
So I think that’s certainly—

256
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,010
that kind of changing of hearts and minds

257
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,010
of people in the system

258
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,010
is also one of the things motivating

259
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,010
the people filing the complaints.”

260
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,010
You know, Shelley, I really respect

261
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,010
Falun Gong practitioners more now.

262
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,010
You don’t think they’re boring anymore?

263
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,010
Oh no, they’re still really boring.

264
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,010
They are literally fighting the Chinese Communist
Party

265
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,149
by filing paperwork.

266
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,709
That is ridiculously boring.

267
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,709
But you know what?

268
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,590
I underestimated boring.

269
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,590
Boring might look boring,

270
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,280
but it’s not even though it is.

271
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Boring is eating your way

272
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,291
through a box of cereal to get

273
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,850
to the prize at the bottom.

274
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,850
Boring is sitting through

275
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,600
the entire credits of a movie

276
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,370
just for the hope there's

277
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,760
a bonus scene at the end.

278
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,970
Boring is driving four hours

279
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,760
down to Washington DC with a broken radio

280
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,520
to make this episode.

281
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,720
Boring is writing out a 23-page criminal complaint

282
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,640
that will help take down one of history’s

283
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,510
most brutal leaders.

284
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,180
Boring can change the world.

285
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,529
So Falun Gong is boring,

286
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,529
but in a good way.

287
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,440
Yeah,

288
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,580
also they have a pretty sweet marching band.

289
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,900
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

290
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,610
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

291
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,480
See you next time.

292
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,320
Gee, I sure learned a lot on today’s episode!

293
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:54,829
Yeah, and you could have watched it

294
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,430
five days earlier.

295
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,370
China Uncensored puts full-length episodes

296
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,600
on its website every Friday afternoon.

297
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,940
ChinaUncensored.tv!

298
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,480
Uh...this is kind of a weird conversation.
