00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,500
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,000
it’s a credibility fire sale!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,890
We’re selling off all our reputation!

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,140
Everything must go!

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,620
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,360
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,800
The most prestigious publications in the world,

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,749
the Cambridge University Press,

9
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:22,259
totally caved to Chinese censorship.

10
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:23,980
“Late last week, the publisher

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,510
said it had removed around 300 papers

12
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,310
from its website in China,

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,650
covering topics like the Tiananmen Square
protests,

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,060
the Cultural Revolution,

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,060
and Tibet,

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,109
after the Chinese government threatened to
ban it

17
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,859
from publishing other material in the country.”

18
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,490
More than 300 articles written by

19
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,160
some of the most prominent China analysts
today.

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,519
Mind you, Chinese censors

21
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,070
weren’t actually reading their dry scholarly
articles.

22
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,850
It was based on a rough keyword search

23
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,030
that singled out the 300 peer-reviewed articles.

24
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,449
Mention of the Cultural Revolution was a big
one.

25
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,980
Taiwan, Tiananmen, and of course Falun Gong
keywords

26
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,019
were also targeted.

27
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,049
In an official statement,

28
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,520
Cambridge University Press wanted to let everyone
know

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,020
they are totally all about freedom of thought.

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,810
But they still were giving into the Chinese
regime’s

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,810
censorship demands,

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,341
because it’s better that some articles

33
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,119
get into China than none,

34
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:15,119
blah blah blah,

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,119
you’ve heard it all before.

36
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,250
It’s like when Apple CEO Tim Cook

37
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,860
blocked VPNs in the Chinese App Store,

38
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,220
saying, “We’re all for freedom of speech...

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,400
but we’re also all for compromising those
values

40
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,479
if we can get access to that sweet,

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,219
sweet China market.”

42
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,219
Not an exact quote,

43
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,549
but I’m pretty sure that’s what he meant.

44
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,950
Anyway, the Cambridge University Press’s
statement

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,610
ended with their mission of

46
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,610
“disseminating knowledge

47
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,150
in the pursuit of education,

48
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,250
learning and research at the highest

49
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,020
international levels of excellence.”

50
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,360
Right.

51
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,899
My favorite state-run media the Global Times

52
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,969
totally agreed with their decision...

53
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,369
while at the same time belittling them

54
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,320
for how few people read their crummy rag,

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,520
saying, “As the readership of the China
Quarterly is limited,

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,650
there will be little impact over the Cambridge
University Press

57
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,950
withdrawing some articles.”

58
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,950
But you know what is

59
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,950
going to be a hot seller?

60
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,600
A book about Xi Jinping!

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
The good news, though,

62
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,810
is that even though the Cambridge University
Press

63
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,480
is one of the world’s oldest

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,300
and most respected publishing houses,

65
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,090
this absolutely won’t set some kind of precedent

66
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,190
that will go into effect merely days later…

67
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,300
Oh.

68
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,370
The US Association for Asian Studies

69
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,841
also was asked to remove 100 articles

70
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:29,670
from its Journal of Asian Studies.

71
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,670
There goes the neighborhood.

72
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,620
But unlike the Cambridge University Press,

73
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,629
they said no right away.

74
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,069
But, wait!

75
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,840
This story has a happy ending after all.

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,090
Cambridge University Press did finally repost

77
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,920
everything they had taken down.

78
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,030
After a huge media backlash

79
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,630
and lots of public criticism.

80
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,090
“That sparked an international outcry,

81
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,340
with hundreds signing an online petition

82
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,600
and threatening to boycott CUP publications.”

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,620
You see?

84
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,840
All it takes to stand up to tyranny

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
is a little global condemnation.

86
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,280
I think this random Chinese gif

87
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,640
best sums up their response to the whole incident.

88
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
So what do you think?

89
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,200
Leave your comments below.

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,520
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

91
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,820
See you next time.

92
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,460
Well gang,

93
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,700
it looks like things worked out this time.

94
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,800
But what about next time?!

95
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,140
Better stay informed by going to ChinaUncensored.tv

96
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,879
to watch full half hour episodes of China
Uncensored

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,209
that we give you for free every week.

98
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,230
And unlike Cambridge University Press,

99
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,340
we’ll never pull our content off our Chinese
website...

100
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,689
mainly because we don’t have a Chinese website,

101
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,419
since, well you know...
