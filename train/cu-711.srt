1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,720
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,950
can you hug your children with nuclear arms?

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,740
Kim Jong-un is certainly going to try!

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,260
China is exploding...

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,440
over US weapons sales to Taiwan.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,940
And what do a mistress,

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,100
a spymaster,

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,920
and a Chinese billionaire have in common?

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,500
I’m not sure,

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,280
but it sounds like a party.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,320
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,720
Hi welcome to China Uncensored,

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,600
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,300
For all my fellow Americans out there,

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,180
I hope you all had a wonderful Independence
Day.

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,600
And a special shout out as well

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,020
to all my friends in the UK;

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,160
we couldn’t have done it without you.

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
This Fourth of July was special,

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,910
not just because of this sick American flag
cake

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,400
Shelley made…

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,320
but because this year’s celebrations

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,520
were made in China.

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,500
As is apparently every Fourth of July these
days.

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,640
“93 percent of fireworks used in the United
States

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,520
are made in China,”

27
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,079
according to a 2013 report

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,750
by the American Pyrotechnics Association,
right before it caught on fire.

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,120
That’s almost 300 million dollars

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,940
in fireworks last year.

31
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,940
Which makes sense,

32
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,940
because after all,

33
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,120
China invented fireworks in the 7th century.

34
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,270
But Chinese manufacturing has taken things

35
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,409
to a whole new level.

36
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:19,409
In China,

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,500
there’s a town that makes the world’s
jeans.

38
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,390
A town that makes Christmas.

39
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,380
Even a village that makes Van Goghs.

40
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,710
And most of the world’s fireworks

41
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,549
are made here in Liling,

42
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,600
Hunan Province.It’s one of the most dangerous
industries in China.

43
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,520
Poor safety standards often lead to disasters,

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,619
like this explosion in 2014

45
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,090
that killed 13 people and injured dozens more.

46
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,259
The good news though is that industries in
China

47
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,610
are beefing up their safety standards,

48
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,610
like for example,

49
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,500
when electronics maker Foxconn

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,040
installed these suicide nets.

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,189
But I don’t mean to grill China.

52
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,170
Because you’re probably already doing that
yourself.

53
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,420
According to Consumer Reports,

54
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,810
“Most gas grills are made in China.”

55
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,320
And this Fourth of July,

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,490
Americans spent 5.3 million dollars

57
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,840
on American flags made in China.

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
But America didn’t pay for everything

59
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,579
this fourth of July.

60
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,400
Some things were gifts!

61
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Like this,

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,249
launched by our friends in North Korea.

64
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:24,409
Rotund North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un

65
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,329
said it was a “gift” to “American bastards.”

66
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,310
Well that was very thoughtful of him,

67
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,310
but unfortunately

68
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,019
America already has an ICMB.

69
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,740
Actually 450 of them.

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,099
“Oh wow.

71
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,269
I totally don’t have any of these.

72
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,780
Thank you so much.”

73
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,939
Meanwhile, South Korea responded to the missile
launch

74
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,330
with this video simulating

75
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,420
how they could strike back at North Korea.

76
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,450
For example,

77
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,719
say North Korea were a star on a giant rock.

78
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,909
They could totally blow it up.

79
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:01,379
China, on the other hand,

80
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,719
is not having much luck

81
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,139
with explosive projectiles.

82
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,689
This is the Long March 5,

83
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,999
China’s most powerful rocket.

84
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:11,480
They launched it on July 2.

85
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,069
And completely not living up to its name,

86
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,519
it failed soon after takeoff.

87
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,709
State-run media said the failure

88
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,700
was caused by an “anomaly,”

89
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,219
but was vague on details.

90
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,299
I’m going to guess the anomaly was...

91
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,790
it turned into a giant fireball.

92
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,470
Don’t worry, it was unmanned.

93
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,209
But the failure throws into questions

94
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,870
many of the space plans China

95
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,139
has proposed for the coming months,

96
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,780
including an unmanned trip to the moon

97
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,900
scheduled for November.

98
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,489
Maybe they can just go halfway and come back.

99
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:41,999
Speaking of Independence Day,

100
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,229
on July 1, Hong Kong celebrated

101
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:47,339
the 20th anniversary of its own liberation

102
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,760
from Great Britain,

103
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,849
with a fun-filled military parade

104
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,969
led by their Chinese overlords.

105
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,790
This woman says she feels a lot safer

106
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,709
knowing that the People’s Liberation Army

107
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,930
is here to enforce Hong Kong’s liberation.

108
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,849
I’d feel safer, too,

109
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,659
with eight to ten thousand PLA troops

110
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,389
on the ground, ready for action.

111
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,389
By the way,

112
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,329
you know that Sino-British Joint Declaration

113
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,760
that established the One Country,

114
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,400
Two systems policy,

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
the one that allows Hong Kong

116
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,709
to keep freedoms impossible in mainland China?

117
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,769
Well on June 30th,

118
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,829
my favorite Chinese spokesman Lu Kang

119
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,870
had this to say.

120
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,560
"The Sino-British joint declaration,

121
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,800
as a historical document,

122
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,189
no longer has any practical significance.”

123
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,110
Just like how the Chinese Constitution,

124
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,639
which guarantees freedom of speech and religion,

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,650
also has no practical significance.

126
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,650
In other news,

127
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,379
the US sailed a Navy destroyer

128
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:46,699
through the South China Sea.

129
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,520
China is calling it a provocative act.

130
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,539
To which President Trump responded,

131
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,539
“Destroyer?

132
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,569
I hardly know her.”

133
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:55,759
This is the second freedom-of-navigation exercise

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,380
completed under Trump’s administration.

135
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,340
This time by the USS Stethem.

136
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,919
To which President Trump responded,

137
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,919
“Stethem!

138
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,699
Damn near killed ’em.”

139
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,659
The Defense Department said the exercise

140
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,700
was to challenge the territorial claims of
China,

141
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,580
Vietnam and Taiwan.

142
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,000
To which President Trump responded,

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
“TAI-won?

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I…”

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,129
Ok, we’re done with this joke.

146
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,129
And finally,

147
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,009
a Chinese company has dropped its plans

148
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,180
to create genetically engineered miniature
pigs.

149
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
I didn’t know they had plans

150
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,570
to make them in the first place,

151
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,050
but I guess it’s a brave new world.

152
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,469
A company called BGI had announced plans

153
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,939
to alter the DNA of Bama pigs

154
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,150
to make them in custom sizes and colors.

155
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,229
That was followed by strenuous objections

156
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,719
from animal rights groups,

157
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:40,840
which pointed out that pigs

158
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,219
should only come in custom sizes and colors

159
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,400
after they’re dead.

160
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,580
So it looks like next year,

161
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,460
we’ll all have to load up some non-GMO pork

162
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,430
on our Chinese-made gas grills

163
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,050
and watch Chinese-made fireworks

164
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,570
as we celebrate America’s birthday.

165
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,570
Which reminds me,

166
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,080
Shelley, I’m going to need some more of
that flag cake.

167
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,840
We’ll be right back.

168
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,160
So what size and color pig would you want?

169
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,569
Now maybe that’s the kind of merchandise

170
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,419
we should be selling on the website!

171
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,469
Speaking of the website,

172
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,480
if you go to China Uncensored dot TV,

173
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,760
you can watch our new full-length episodes.

174
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,090
Each episode has segments

175
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,120
we won’t be putting on YouTube until next
week.

176
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,660
You can also watch full-length episodes

177
