1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,500
China has just forgiven a chunk of Cameroon’s
debt.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,460
Normally, that’d be something to brag about.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,080
Except China kept it a secret.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,590
Why is China keeping quiet

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,060
about writing off Cameroon’s debt?

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,400
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,780
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,760
Debt relief.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,220
When a country lets another country

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,640
off the hook for paying back loans.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,289
As in no more debt, what a relief.

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,460
If only they did that for student loans.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,710
Specifically, *my* student loans.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,230
Usually when rich creditor countries

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,530
forgive the debts of poorer countries,

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,989
there’s a ton of publicity to highlight
all that generosity.

17
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:43,680
Like that time twenty years ago when Bono

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,550
worked with world leaders to get them to forgive

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,340
more than $100 million in loans

20
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,940
to the poorest countries.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,059
“Take your time and get your head around
this fact.

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,670
The national debt of the 18 poorest countries
in Africa

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,899
has been canceled thanks to Bono.”

24
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,230
The point is, everyone loves publicity.

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,680
Which is why it’s weird that when China

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,720
recently wrote off a chunk of debt

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,280
of the West African nation of Cameroon…

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,130
it was all super hush hush.

29
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,710
And then reporters asked,

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,299
“Why the secrecy?”

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,980
In fact, the world might not have even known

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,280
China forgave a chunk of Cameroon’s debt

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,240
if not for a gaffe by the Chinese language
edition

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,119
of the Wall Street Journal.

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,119
It reported—

36
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,670
based on a statement from the president of
Cameroon—

37
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,360
that China had agreed to write off

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,240
5 billion dollars of Cameroon’s debt.

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,630
Since that’s almost all of the debt that
Cameroon

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,119
has ever borrowed from China,

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,070
that news report caused a bit of controversy
online.

42
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,070
Last September,

43
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,530
Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged some $60
billion dollars in aid,

44
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,860
investment and loans to Africa at the Forum
on China-Africa Cooperation.

45
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,549
That created some backlash,

46
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,930
including netizens asking online why China

47
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,020
was giving money away to nearly failed states
in Africa,

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,729
when in China there are at least 30 million
people

49
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,890
who live on less than a dollar a day.

50
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,009
As you can imagine,

51
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,030
those questions were then censored.

52
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,739
Actually, it was at that meeting in September

53
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,340
where Cameroon’s president Paul Biya

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,000
pleaded with Chinese authorities to ease his
country’s debt burden—

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,700
according to Chinese media.

56
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,900
But it turns out, when the Wall Street Journal

57
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,660
said China forgave 5 billion dollars in debt,

58
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,930
well...it was kind of not quite accurate.

59
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,349
The actual amount was 78 million dollars.

60
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,409
That’s a big difference.

61
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,790
It’s like reporting that

62
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,060
“The new tower is a tall as the Empire State
Building!”

63
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,819
When actually it’s only one story tall,

64
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,160
with a low ceiling.

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,519
Now, Chinese media had a field day with this,

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,740
with the Global Times calling it a huge blunder
for US media:

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,159
And other Chinese media accusing foreign media

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
of planting fake news for Chinese readers.

69
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,360
But if it weren’t for the Wall Street Journal’s
mistake,

70
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,470
the world might never have known of China’s
“generosity.”

71
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,730
See, Cameroon still owes China about 3 billion
dollars in total debt.

72
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,629
So the 78 million in debt forgiveness is actually
really small.

73
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,110
So now it should be clear why China

74
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,340
might have wanted to keep it a secret.

75
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,849
It’s not really a PR win.

76
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:27,610
I mean, 78 million is less than what

77
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,970
one rock star with sunglasses can do.

78
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,239
But there’s another reason the Chinese regime

79
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,610
may have wanted to keep news of the debt relief
under wraps.

80
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,209
Reporters might start to suspect that the
Chinese regime

81
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,629
plans to use debt relief to get something
in return.

82
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:45,629
Remember the story of how

83
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,440
“China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port”?

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,110
China lent billions to Sri Lanka,

85
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,480
no strings attached,

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,129
and when they couldn’t pay it off,

87
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,769
China asked for Hambantota port.

88
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,310
And China got it.

89
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,909
Sri Lanka was forced to sign a 99-year lease

90
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,069
in exchange for waving off about a billion
in debt.

91
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,939
So I guess there were strings attached.

92
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:10,939
Plus the deal gave China control of territory

93
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,909
right near its arch-rival, India,

94
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,110
as well as a strategic foothold along

95
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,500
a critical commercial and military waterway.

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,980
Unconditional debt forgiveness—

97
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,000
that’s for suckers.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
Setting up a long-term lending relationship

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,690
so that you can get something in return

100
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,890
that gives you a geostrategic advantage,

101
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,820
now that’s the kind of lending relationship

102
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,930
the Chinese regime likes.

103
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,540
Xi Jinping calls it “win-win mutual cooperation.”

104
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,260
I like to call it, “debt trap diplomacy.”

105
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,120
For more on that, you can watch my episode

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,290
“5 Countries That Have Fallen into China's
Debt Trap”

107
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,620
for all the sordid details of how China

108
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,540
leverages debt to get what it wants.

109
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,760
Wow, I forgot there was a time

110
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,090
when I didn’t have a beard.

111
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,890
Anyway, why would the Chinese regime

112
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,610
care about Cameroon?

113
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,450
Well, for one: mineral resources.

114
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,180
Like bauxite, iron ore, and gold.

115
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,640
And don’t worry, Chinese gold mining operations

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,980
there are totally legit and have no problems
whatsoever.

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,440
Ok, a few minor problems.

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,620
But look, there’s another reason China cares
about Cameroon.

119
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,860
Let’s go back to that map.

120
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,070
Cameroon sits along the Gulf of Guinea.

121
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,070
And that’s a good place to be when doing
trade

122
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,700
with a dozen other countries, like Nigeria.

123
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,150
So it should come as no surprise that China

124
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,140
has invested 1.2 billion dollars

125
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,610
to convert a fishing town called Kribi

126
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,490
into the region’s biggest deep-water port.

127
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,740
“Made up of four main parts,

128
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,800
a deep water port with roughly 20 wharfs,

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,270
a zone for industrial and logistics activity,

130
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,120
a multi-modal transport corridor,

131
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,220
a new city.”

132
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,020
And Cameroon’s Kribi port

133
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,600
is connected to a pipeline project

134
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,190
to bring in oil from land-locked Chad.

135
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:14,220
There’s also a 436 million dollar highway
China is funding there.

136
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,840
It ties the port with Cameroon's resource-rich
inland area.

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,370
And there are also plans to build a railroad

138
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,750
directly to a deposit of iron ore.

139
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,210
And those iron mines will definitely not have
problems.

140
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,780
So far it doesn’t look like Cameroon

141
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,330
has had to directly give up any of its infrastructure
or resources

142
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,310
for the 78 million dollars in debt forgiveness.

143
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,340
But the Chinese Communist Party’s overall
actions in Cameroon

144
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,770
are clearly the same strategy it has used
around the world:

145
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,840
Make generous loans,

146
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,390
get countries in debt,

147
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,050
and forgive the debt in exchange for small
things—

148
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,020
like all of their resources, or strategic
infrastructure.

149
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,110
Win-win mutual cooperation.

150
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,620
Which means that China-Cameroon relations

151
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,030
should be something to keep an eye on.

152
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,410
And before we go, it’s time for me to answer

153
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,130
a question from one of you who supports China
Uncensored

154
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,590
by contributing a dollar or more

155
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,660
though the crowdfunding website Patreon.

156
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,320
David Schwimmer asks:

157
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
“Happy Valentines Day!

158
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,240
It seems like the recent love that Putin and
Xi have shared,

159
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,020
particularly in Eastern Europe and Venezuela,

160
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,050
could be undermined by recent NBC media exposure,

161
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,220
what do you all think OF THIS!

162
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,040
Ah, I see you’re referring to this um,

163
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,740
“map” from season one of NBC’s Unbreakable
Kimmy Schmidt.

164
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,050
There are...several...problems with this map.

165
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,080
Among them,

166
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,490
China has taken over all of Russia.

167
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,000
Plus Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and
Asia.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,580
But don’t worry, Xi and Putin can’t be
torn apart that easily.

169
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,020
From holding joint press conferences,

170
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,770
to cooking delicious Chinese pancakes,

171
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,490
to cooking delicious Russian pancakes,

172
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,760
to putting friendship medals on each other,

173
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,820
it is the relationship between China in Russia

174
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,800
that is truly unbreakable.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
Thanks for your question, David.

176
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,340
