00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,120
the only thing blacker than heavy metal?

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,680
Politics.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,760
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,360
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,559
This is Freddy Lim,

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,949
the Godfather of Taiwanese death metal.

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,640
It’s a look that just screams “politician”.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,830
Ok, maybe just screams.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,070
But he’s also a politician.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,070
Seriously.

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,250
Here he is campaigning for office.

13
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,250
Here he is getting food

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,759
from a local street vendor,

15
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,710
because you have do do that in Taiwan, too.

16
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,710
And here he is looking like

17
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,790
a serious politician

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,400
because serious people

19
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,840
wear suits.

20
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,079
But unlike most politicians in suits,

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,250
Freddy Lim is inspiring young people

22
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,760
to get passionate about politics.

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,200
He expanded from death metal

24
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,190
to politics after the 2014 Sunflower Movement.

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,850
Students and civil groups were protesting

26
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,670
a trade pact they felt would make

27
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,780
Taiwan economically dependent

28
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,170
on the Chinese Communist Party.

29
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,399
So Freddy Lim co-founded

30
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,219
the New Power Party,

31
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,090
and ran for office himself.

32
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,080
He was elected to parliament in 2016.

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,860
His party is now Taiwan’s

34
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,640
most important third party contender.

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,920
I sat down with Freddy Lim

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,610
to talk about how Taiwan

37
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,009
needs to resist threats from

38
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,520
the Chinese Communist Party,

39
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,520
and promote a future as the only Chinese democracy.

40
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,430
Thank you for joining me today.

41
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,030
My pleasure.

42
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,220
So, you've said you got into

43
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,000
heavy metal music because you wanted

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,760
to shout, you needed to roar.

45
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,790
Do you think it's time for Taiwan

46
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,100
to shout and roar?

47
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,240
Yeah, but not just Taiwan,

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
not only Taiwan because there are

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,200
many countries who are

50
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,170
under oppression in the world.

51
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,619
There are many countries

52
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,619
that are suffering

53
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,110
under worse conditions.

54
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,950
So I think it's never too late

55
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,630
to let the voices be heard.

56
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,220
And I know in your music,

57
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,399
you're very inspired by the stories

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,509
and culture of Taiwan.

59
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,200
Do you see Taiwanese culture as something

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,689
distinct from Chinese culture?

61
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:08,689
Definitely.

62
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:09,689
Yeah,

63
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,370
Taiwan is a country with fruitful cultures,

64
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,770
and we have cultures from different regions,

65
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,460
like we have our local aboriginal cultures…

66
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,960
We have some cultures originally from

67
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
outside Taiwan,

68
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,900
even those cultures from outside

69
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,660
are quite localized now.

70
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,890
So yeah definitely.

71
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,720
And so you're a heavy metal music performer,

72
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,120
which is one of the blackest things there
is.

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,080
But, you decided to get into

74
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,110
the blackest field of all,

75
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,150
politics.

76
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,620
What inspired you to found

77
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,050
and co-found the New Power Party

78
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,620
and enter political life?

79
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,310
I think I have always been quite involved

80
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,340
in politics and social issues,

81
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,700
social movements.

82
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,340
But in 2013,

83
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,200
there were more and more

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,100
young activists and young opinion leaders

85
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,170
who joined the social movements.

86
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,490
They led the social movements.

87
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,610
So I felt it's quite important

88
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,690
for Taiwan if we want to

89
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,900
make bigger change,

90
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,980
we need all those young forces

91
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,890
being introduced from the movements

92
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,660
to the political arena.

93
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,430
So, I and some other activists,

94
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,560
we worked together,

95
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,420
tried to build up a new platform for them.

96
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,420
So I think, yeah

97
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,480
this is a new party for the young people.

98
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,620
How do young people in Taiwan

99
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,570
feel about the political life

100
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,570
of the country,

101
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,480
and the relationship with China?

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,510
I think most of the young Taiwanese

103
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,480
are just like the young people in other countries.

104
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,260
They are a bit frustrated with politics,

105
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,900
so most of the time they

106
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,380
aren't concerned with politics.

107
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,170
But if there's an opportunity for them

108
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,610
to make a bigger change,

109
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,180
they could be very enthusiastic too.

110
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,860
So, I think quite similar to the young

111
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,290
in other countries.

112
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,820
And regarding China,

113
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,790
I think most of the Taiwanese people,

114
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,180
most of the young Taiwanese,

115
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,660
they try to stay calm towards China,

116
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,680
they try to treat China just like

117
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,820
other countries in the world.

118
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
But at the same time,

119
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,100
they try to stay cautious

120
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,210
... especially when it comes to

121
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,500
issues regarding freedom

122
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,600
and human rights

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,570
and especially at international events.

124
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,470
Yeah, the young Taiwanese

125
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,980
could also be very ...

126
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,880
To stay high cautious against China too.

127
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,660
Well the Chinese Communist Party

128
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,290
has threatened to seize

129
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,600
Taiwan by force.

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,410
How does that affect what you do?

131
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,700
I think China's military threat

132
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,720
has always led all the neighboring countries

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,510
to stay very cautious

134
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,820
and also try to move forward

135
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,820
in their direction

136
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,820
very carefully.

137
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,820
So yeah of course it affects us,

138
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,760
but not just Taiwan I think,

139
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,230
all the neighboring countries

140
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,750
can feel the same threat from China.

141
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,660
Well because of the growing influence

142
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,620
of the Chinese Communist Party,

143
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,590
Taiwan has been losing allies around the world.

144
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,820
Where does that leave Taiwan?

145
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,110
I think Taiwan's diplomatic strategy

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,040
has been reformed,

147
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,820
has been changed a lot in the recent years.

148
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,950
We used to care, I think,

149
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,460
too much about the number of

150
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,650
official diplomatic relations,

151
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,890
and tried to buy relations from those countries.

152
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,290
But in recent years,

153
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,720
I think, it’s become not just about

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,900
the number of them,

155
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,570
but also about trying to work with those

156
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,000
non-diplomatic relationship countries,

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
and I think that's more important

158
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,040
in Taiwan in the current situation.

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,750
Especially when in the recent years,

160
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,750
there have been more and

161
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,930
more non-diplomatic relationship countries

162
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,320
supporting us in international meetings

163
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,040
and international organizations,

164
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,200
they spoke for us, they supported us

165
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,240
in joining those organizations.

166
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,520
So I think this is the right direction,

167
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,020
and we should work hard for this direction.

168
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,930
Now, Taiwan may have found

169
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,660
an unlikely ally in the Trump administration.

170
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
How would you like to see

171
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,960
the US and Taiwan work together?

172
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,790
I think, no matter who is in power in the
US,

173
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,560
I believe that it's in the interest of both
sides

174
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,000
to strengthen Taiwan/US relations.

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,640
And so, if we want to strengthen these relationships,

176
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,580
I do believe that eventually

177
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,240
we should establish

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,220
official diplomatic relations

179
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,660
between Taiwan and the US.

180
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,320
I think that can consolidate our relationship
more.

181
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,210
So ultimately, are you optimistic

182
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,280
about the future of Taiwan?

183
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, I'm quite optimistic,

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,350
and of course I think

185
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,160
we have to be optimistic.

186
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,250
Because like what I had said,

187
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,650
that although we have been oppressed

188
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,180
by China in the international arena,

189
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,320
but there are so many more nations

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,160
in the world under worse oppression.

191
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,000
And in Taiwan, at least

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,690
We’ve kept our independent sovereignty,

193
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:50,970
and also we maintain our economic strength.

194
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,780
So we should stay optimistic,

195
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,960
and then I think,

196
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,570
and we are like a hope for those nations

197
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,980
that are under worse conditions.

198
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,530
And also, on the other hand I think

199
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,590
the current international situation

200
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,290
is undergoing a big change now,

201
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,919
and the world can treat Taiwan fairly.

202
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,760
And they used to compare Taiwan to China,

203
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,820
and it makes Taiwan too small.

204
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,169
But actually Taiwan is a country

205
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,540
like what I just said, that

206
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,419
we have a rich landscape,

207
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,730
we have a rich culture,

208
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,430
and also we have a population of 23 million,

209
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,990
that's quite equal to the population of

210
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,260
now five northern European countries.

211
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,980
So we are small,

212
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,570
but not that small,

213
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,560
no country would consider

214
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,339
Scandinavian countries as nothing.

215
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,339
Yeah.

216
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:56,339
So, at the same time

217
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,330
I think we are a mid-sized country,

218
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,500
we deserve fair treatment,

219
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,390
and we are always an option

220
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,600
for those businessmen or tourists

221
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,000
or the people want to do culture exchange,

222
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,370
we are an option that can be fairly treated,

223
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,290
and I do believe that it's time,

224
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,040
there is a optimistic future ahead.

225
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,990
Well, I was going to ask,

226
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,560
what do you think Taiwan's role

227
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,020
or responsibility is as one of

228
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,080
Asia's few democracies?

229
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,490
Just like what I have said.

230
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,330
That we have to stay optimistic,

231
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,800
and we have to be an inspiration

232
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,890
for those people in Asia who are still

233
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,320
under worse conditions,

234
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,200
no matter whether in human rights

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,150
or other conditions ...

236
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,190
I know that there have been so many people

237
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,830
from Hong Kong, from China,

238
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,110
or from other Southeast Asian countries

239
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,770
who come to Taiwan to observe

240
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,960
our elections or to join some protests,

241
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,960
to join in some activities,

242
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,690
and I know that they try to learn

243
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,990
a lot from the experiences in Taiwan.

244
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,071
And so, I think we should stay optimistic,
a

245
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:26,110
nd we should keep moving forward,

246
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,899
and we should let the world know

247
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,740
that even in the frontline against China,

248
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,450
there is a small country still trying

249
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,220
to move forward, to our goal,

250
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,670
in our direction,

251
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,700
carefully but eventually we will be

252
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,890
in a position to never go back.

253
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,370
So I hope that we can cheer more people on

254
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,640
under worse conditions,

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,910
So they can believe in themselves,

256
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,870
and we will try our best to support you as
well.

257
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,900
So I have two very important questions for
you.

258
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,170
Number one,

259
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,090
can I get tickets to your next concert?

260
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,090
Sure!

261
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,380
All right.

262
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,870
It's a free entrance concert

263
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,470
that we will play at this Sunday.

264
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,470
Perfect.

265
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,720
So yeah, come at five o'clock this Sunday.

266
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
All right.

267
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,810
And then the other big question is,

268
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,500
can you teach me to roar like you?

269
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,620
Okay,

270
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,870
I'll try.

271
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah.

272
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,240
[Freddy Lim roars]

273
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
[Chris roars]

274
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,520
Yeah, now you are a metal singer..

275
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
All right.

276
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Yes.

277
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
I'm glad I have a fallback career.

278
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Okay, yeah.

279
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
All right.

280
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,010
Well thank you so much for joining us today.

281
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,010
Thank you.

282
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,010
My pleasure.

283
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,010
Good luck.

284
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,012
Thank you.
