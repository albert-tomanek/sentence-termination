1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,950
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,680
how the Chinese regime is using

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,540
the Czech Republic to infiltrate

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,040
the rest of Europe.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,640
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,240
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,279
The Czech Republic.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,400
Home to the world’s highest per-capita

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,780
beer consumption,

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,040
and the world’s best-slash-worst

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,040
pun-based T-shirts.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
The Czech Republic is also

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,200
the most successful post-communist country

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,580
in central Europe.

15
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,980
Unlike some other post-Soviet nations,

16
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,990
the Czech Republic—

17
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,990
or Czechia,

18
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,990
as nobody calls it—

19
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,880
has a vibrant growing economy.

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,460
And let's be real.

21
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,960
The Czech people never liked

22
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,370
the Soviets anyway.

23
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,630
Back in 1968,

24
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,100
when the Soviets tried to crush

25
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,050
the budding liberalization movement,

26
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,879
the people resisted.

27
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,769
It took two more decades but,

28
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:48,969
finally they got rid of

29
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,779
communist rule altogether.

30
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,940
The good news is,

31
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,530
all that is history.

32
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,530
The bad news is,

33
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,800
no one ever learns anything from history.

34
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,729
Which is why we now go to Prague—

35
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,140
where our friend Simon Whistler

36
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,059
from the YouTube channel VisualPolitik

37
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,260
has more.

38
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Thanks, Chris.

39
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Here in the Czech Republic,

40
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
China’s influence has grown considerably

41
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,300
in the last few years.

42
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,970
Which may seem a bit surprising,

43
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,540
given the Czech Republic’s traditional

44
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,660
anti-communist stance.

45
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,690
This is the Czech Republic’s first president

46
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,890
after communism,

47
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,890
Vaclav Havel—

48
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,560
seen here having a beer, of course.

49
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,640
He was outspoken against

50
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,760
the Chinese Communist Party's human rights
violations...

51
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,700
But the situation seems to have changed

52
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,940
with the newest president, Miloš Žeman.

53
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,480
He took office in 2013.

54
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,560
And he's a big fan of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

55
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,920
You could say he might even be

56
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,130
the president of Xi Jinping’s fan club.

57
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,130
Ummm wait,

58
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,700
actually that would be Mark Zuckerberg of
Facebook.

59
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,660
Žeman, though,

60
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,510
could probably be the vice-president of the
fan club.

61
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,440
He's met Xi Jinping six times

62
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,790
in just three years.

63
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,020
In 2014, Žeman became the first Czech president

64
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,380
to visit China in a decade.

65
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,390
Here he is at a ceremony

66
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,360
marking the anniversary of Sino-Czech relations.

67
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
Which was also the debut

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,450
of China’s newest military innovation,

69
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,020
the Stepford Soldiers.

70
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
Although, I do think I prefer the original
to the knockoff.

71
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,200
Good morning, ladies.

72
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,260
Good morning, Claire.

73
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,360
Anyway, in 2015,

74
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,600
President Žeman visited China again.

75
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,100
Miloš Žeman, the only Western leader

76
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,280
to attend a massive military parade

77
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,640
in Beijing marking the 70th anniversary

78
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,780
since the end of World War II.

79
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,700
...a parade celebrated with giant weapons,

80
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,120
and more Stepford Soldiers.

81
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,660
Then in 2016, just to mix it up,

82
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,260
President Žeman invited Chinese leader Xi
Jinping

83
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,620
to check out his hometown.

84
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,800
But just ten days ahead of Xi’s arrival,

85
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,310
Žeman faced a bit of a problem.

86
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,670
Around a thousand people welcomed

87
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,260
the Dalai Lama to the Czech Republic,

88
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,710
with a gathering outside Prague Castle,

89
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,800
the seat of the Czech president.

90
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
Yes, the Dalai Lama came to Prague

91
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,760
to spread his message of peace and compassion.

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Like a Nazi.

93
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,440
At least according to Chinese officials.

94
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,850
Now, President Žeman was afraid

95
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,680
that simply ignoring the Dalai Lama

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,810
wouldn’t be enough to please Xi Jinping.

97
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,209
So he took it a step further,

98
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,190
and “allegedly” actively punished a Czech
official

99
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,700
who met with the Dalai Lama.

100
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,360
There was a lot on the agenda

101
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,120
for the two leaders’ exciting three-day
party.

102
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,590
At least according to Chinese state-run media.

103
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,690
Both nations hope to increase bilateral ties

104
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,870
in areas such as trade, infrastructure,

105
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,100
finance, and cultural exchange.

106
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,940
The cultural exchange evidently does not include

107
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,620
the Stepford Soldier upgrade option.

108
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,920
Žeman may have rolled out the red carpet

109
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,310
for Xi Jinping—literally—

110
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,720
but a lot of people the Czech Republic

111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,590
were not very pleased with the visit.

112
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,849
Like the former Foreign Affairs Minister,
who said,

113
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,080
“This is a shame to our republic.

114
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,569
We have invited a dictator to the same place

115
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:55,920
where our founding fathers were.”

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,680
But since the visit,

117
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,180
Chinese companies and tourists

118
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,260
have been pouring into the Czech Republic.

119
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,700
Bank of China has even set up a branch in

120
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,310
Prague.

121
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,620
And then the Czech Republic announced

122
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,920
it would invest more than 200 million dollars

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China

124
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,090
in a special fund for projects

125
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,660
in Central and Eastern Europe.

126
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,740
So what does the Czech Republic

127
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,740
get in return?

128
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,970
Well, it signed a bunch of deals with Chinese

129
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,960
companies.

130
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,730
Žeman said he expected China to invest

131
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,120
four billion US dollars in the Czech Republic.

132
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,730
But it’s been more than a year—

133
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,560
and it seems like most of those companies

134
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,060
are not exactly keeping their promises.

135
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,190
At least Chinese communist money is saving

136
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,240
local football.

137
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,290
Or something.

138
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,360
But there’s more to this story...

139
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,920
Žeman has said said he wants his country

140
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,300
to “become the entry gate” for China into
the EU.

141
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,360
Chinese airlines now provide direct flights

142
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
to Prague

143
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,770
from three Chinese cities.

144
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,080
And there’s a new 7,000-mile freight train
service to Prague

145
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,750
that starts in China’s Hubei Province.

146
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,920
President Žeman is also a superfan of China’s

147
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,560
One Belt One Road Initiative—

148
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,480
a plan to expand Chinese trade

149
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,550
and build Chinese infrastructure projects

150
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,240
in dozens of countries.

151
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,240
In addition,

152
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,620
the Czech Republic is also a figurative entry gate

153
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,050
for China into the European Union.

154
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,400
Žeman has said the Czech Republic will

155
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,360
“fully utilize its influence to help further
boost

156
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,380
China’s relations with the EU

157
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,560
and Central and Eastern European countries.”

158
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,140
The Chinese Communist Party has wanted

159
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,280
to infiltrate the European Union for a long
time—

160
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
and now is its chance.

161
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,660
You see, as a whole,

162
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,860
the EU is strong enough to stand up to China

163
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,110
as trading bloc.

164
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,360
Like when they rejected signing

165
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,800
the One Belt One Road statement.

166
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,940
The EU’s concern was that One Belt One Road

167
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,620
wasn’t transparent enough,

168
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,560
and that it would too heavily favor China

169
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,990
over other participants.

170
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,100
One EU diplomat commented,

171
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,010
“Apparently to Chinese surprise,

172
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,580
the EU was united on this.”

173
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
And even worse,

174
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,600
from the Chinese Communist Party’s perspective,

175
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,660
the EU has also publicly called out

176
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,479
China’s human rights atrocities.

177
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,330
So instead of facing off with the EU,

178
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,440
China’s leadership would much rather

179
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,990
deal with individual European countries

180
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,139
that they could more easily influence.

181
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,290
Like what they’re doing with the Czech Republic.

182
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,720
And then these individual countries can advocate

183
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,880
for China’s interests within the EU,

184
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,130
making it hard for the EU

185
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,700
to unite against China.

186
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,130
And now that Brexit is weakening the EU,

187
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,360
this is a great opportunity for the Chinese
Communist Party

188
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,420
to implement their strategy.

189
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,040
Sounds paranoid, you might say...

190
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, China’s leaders have already done

191
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,050
this exact same thing closer to home, with
ASEAN,

192
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,120
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

193
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,580
China has territorial disputes in the South
China Sea

194
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,659
with about half of the ASEAN nations.

195
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,320
But despite years of trying,

196
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,830
ASEAN has never fully stood up to China about
the disputes,

197
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,380
even as the Chinese Communist Party builds
artificial islands

198
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,510
and militarizes them.

199
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,510
The reason?

200
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,570
Well, for years,

201
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,040
the Chinese Communist Party have been successfully

202
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,070
dividing and conquering ASEAN.

203
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,229
And they did it by befriending one

204
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,189
of its member states, Cambodia—

205
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,139
using foreign aid and investment.

206
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,580
And then Cambodia, in return,

207
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,460
blocks anything that ASEAN could do

208
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,820
that would be bad for China.

209
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,110
Sounds awfully familiar now, doesn't it?

210
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,420
The good news is that the EU

211
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,860
is almost three times the size of ASEAN,

212
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,610
so the Chinese Communist Party can’t influence
it

213
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,600
with the Czech Republic alone.

214
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,110
But it’s certainly a good place to start.

215
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,200
And now, back to you, Chris.

216
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,220
Thanks, Simon.

217
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,630
I guess President Žeman had better Czech
himself

218
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,770
before he wrecks himself.

219
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,040
Or the EU.

220
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,740

227
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,240
it’s about the relationship

228
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,580
between China and North Korea.

229
