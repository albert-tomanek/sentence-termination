00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Today's show is sponsored by new Findus Toilet Wallets!

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,000
We're not sure what they are either.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,540
We sell 'em, you smell 'em!

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,680
You just open it:
[Mechanical door noise]

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,740
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We are playing Citation Needed.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,220
I have an almost-randomly selected article from

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,340
everybody's favourite source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,160
in front of me, and these folks cannot see it.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,840
Every fact that they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,880
and there is a prize for particularly good answers which is...

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,900
And your topic today is: 'simplehuman'.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,740
[Laughter]

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,400
Hello!

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi!

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,860
Pass a bigger shovel, we're going to be digging deep today.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,100
I use the cardinal directions of 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right'.

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,580
I think I qualify.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,440
Is it like the whole Simple English thing, or something?

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,860
Oh, like a simpler version of the language?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,100
Yeah, is it sort of an overall thing to try and

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,180
achieve that in humanity or something, or...?

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,920
No.

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Is it an album?

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,140
Ooh, no it's not, but that's a nice prog rock album title there.

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,260
I was going to say, 'Simple Human' is a...

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,980
That is pretty much Granddaddy.

27
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,820
Yeah, I thought it would be something like that. Okay...

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,200
Let's get the obvious — is it an LP,

29
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,780
is it a film, or something like that?

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,740
Is it media? Is it a medium?

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,300
It's not media at all.

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,840
Okay. Is it some kind of eco-revolution?

33
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,540
Ooo, not really, no.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,900
Oh sure, like a Good Life thing.

35
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,920
A notion about how mankind used to exist...

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
pre-evolutionary or something like that?

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,780
You're all thinking really quite big-picture here,

38
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,160
and not at all commercial.

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,100
— Commercial?
— Commercial.

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,700
Oh, do they make bog roll?

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,560
Oh, you know what, you're getting a point. [DING]

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,760
What!

43
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,360
It's not that close...

44
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,580
They make rubbish bins,

45
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,460
but that's close enough out of the blue

46
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,920
that I'm going to...

47
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,720
That's like standing in a pub with a dart in your hand,

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
spinning around three times with your eyes closed,

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,680
doing THAT and getting a bulls-eye!

50
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,980
That's how I play darts.

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,300
And that's why you're banned!

52
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,060
Oh, actually yeah, I've seen Matt play darts.

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Flailing!

54
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,700
They go through to the other side and into the wall.

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,200
Actually, to be fair, it's more like standing in a pub

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
with a dart in your hand, a pint in the other hand,

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
throwing at the dartboard
and knocking everything down in the skittle alley.

58
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,720
Yes. Yes.

59
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
So simplehuman make bins.

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,700
They do. They are considered, and I quote here,

61
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,100
'among the most high-end [trash] cans on the market today'.

62
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,700
Can you tell me why?

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Why are they some of the best bins?

64
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,720
They wear a cravat.

65
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,800
Are they antibacterial or er, micro... biobial...

66
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,380
— Micro-biober...
— Miroberber...

67
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,380
There were some words there, Matt. And the answer:

68
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,600
No.

69
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Higher —
Are they made of gold?

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
Or diamonds? Or something otherwise desirable?

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,220
I'll give you a point for diamonds, because it's...

72
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,100
Carbon!

73
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,400
...durability. [DING]

74
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,900
Durability? They last a long time.

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,000
It's one of the reasons.

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
Huerrr...

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
I don't know what that noise meant.

78
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,420
I can't count the number of times I've broken my bins.

79
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,420
No, you literally can't, because it's zero.

80
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,880
— Yes. [Laughs]
— Yeah.

81
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,920
Yes. I've never broken a wheelie bin or anything in my life.

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,860
I mean, I've ridden in one, and I've never broken it.

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Are we talking dumpster-styley things, though,

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,840
— Yeah, actually...
— that get serious industrial...

85
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,120
No, we're talking much...

86
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,920
— Kitchen.
— Yeah, kitchen bins.

87
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,060
An unbreakable kitchen bin?

88
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,840
Do they do the solar compacting thing?

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,660
Are they odour-proof?

90
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,140
Odour-suppressant?

91
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Do they play a nice tune when you put something in them?

92
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,160
['Shave and a haircut' melody]

93
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,560
Do they make the tea?

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,060
I seem to recall a giveaway...

95
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,900
I feel like it was some soft drink or other,

96
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,700
that gave you a little thing that you attached to your bin

97
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,180
that made a noise every time you opened it.

98
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,380
What was the noise though?

99
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,380
All right, you come home late from the pub one night...

100
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,660
If you're in my situation — you're a married man,

101
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,980
you've snuck back in, not wanting to wake the wife up,

102
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,760
you've taken your shoes off, you've done the lot...

103
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,920
You've sneakily eaten the kebab

104
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,500
that you said you weren't going to have,

105
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,880
you tiptoe over to the bin...

106
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,540
[Comedy music riff]

107
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,060
At this point, it's good you've taken your shoes off,

108
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,580
because you're sleeping on the couch tonight.

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Yeah. 'Where've you been?!'
That kind of thing.

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Great. Thanks for making a noisy bin-thing.

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,780
You're right about technologically advanced bins here,

112
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,460
but it's one thing in particular that it does.

113
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,520
Techno-Bins!

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,120
No, that's just bins that dance to repetitive music.

115
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,640
[Dance beat]

116
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,360
This is not a product placement,

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
this is just what 'Random Article' pulled up for me.

118
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,420
Does it sift and sort and do your recycling for you?

119
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,740
No, it's much less advanced than that.

120
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,500
Does it play 'Free Bird'?

121
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Does it let you put rubbish in it?

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
— No.
— Yes. Easily.

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
What would make that more —

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
Front flap!

125
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,160
How more easy than an open-mouthed...

126
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,760
It's not open-mouthed.

127
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,620
It's got an automatic lid.

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,700
— Bingo! Point to you. [DING]
— Ahh.

129
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,860
It has an automatic sensor-activated lid.

130
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,000
— I think I've seen adverts for that now.
— Yup.

131
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,380
— What...
— Like, late night, on a silly channel

132
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,700
that no one ever watches anyway.

133
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
So what, you wave at it? Play a trumpet?

134
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,240
Call it?

135
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,400
There is just no hope left for humanity, is there really?

136
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,560
No, not really.

137
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,820
This is basically, you wave your hand toward the bin

138
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,580
and it opens for you.

139
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,540
Until of course it breaks down, at which point it just becomes...

140
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,820
But they don't break! It says.

141
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,700
What happens when the bin turns against you

142
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,620
and starts throwing banana peels in your face?

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,480
...which will happen!

144
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,960
When the monkeys take over the world, anyway.

145
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
What else have they added sensors to?

146
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Because there's other kitchen and bathroom stuff

147
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
they've added sensors to.

148
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,420
Oh. Knives. I've seen sensors in knives.

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,380
[Laughter]
Whoa, whoa — what?!

150
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,380
Forks! Sorry, no...

151
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,140
It wasn't a knife, it was a fork.
[Laughter]

152
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,100
Oh God. Curry tonight's going to be entertaining, isn't it.

[Caveman grunts]

154
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
What would you do to a fork? What possible...

155
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
When you're cooking a steak.

156
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,640
— Ah...
— It's got a temperature probe on it,

157
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,980
and it tells you when it's done.

158
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,520
'Bring the temperature probe...'

159
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,640
So surely you just need a knife and a temperature probe.

160
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Why, when you could have it in a fork

161
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,080
that you can then use to eat it?

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,320
Or something, I don't know.

163
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,740
But it was a thing you stuck in a steak.

164
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,760
There was another... a pan!
They put a sensor in a pan as well.

165
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,080
— What for?
— Steak, again!

166
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,860
— Okay.
— I've seen it on a shopping channel.

167
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,880
Of a pan that will tell you

168
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,020
of what manner your steak will be done...

169
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,740
— ...at the current temperature of pan.
— Oh, okay.

170
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,660
My big issue with this is that Brannan watches shopping channels.

171
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,620
Of course I watch shopping channels!

173
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,580

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,180
We're actually looking in the bathroom for this.

178
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,820
— Scales.
— Toilet.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,820
I like the idea that they put an insensitive in a scale.

180
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,800
[Laughter]

181
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
'Step off, lardo. I can't take this any more.'

182
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,300
That's the old gag, though, isn't it?

183
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,840
You step on the scale, it says 'One at a time, please.'

184
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,780
'No coach parties.'

185
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,480
Bog roll!

186
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,580
GARY: That's a good place!

187
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,800
No, it's not, actually...

188
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,100
It's very obvious when you've run out of bog roll.

189
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
But that answer's already got me points once before,

190
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,380
so I thought I'd try it again.
[Laughter]

191
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Not this time.

192
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
It's not absurd, though. Not in a private bathroom,

193
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,020
but in, like works ones,

194
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,020
— because you've got the automatic tap sensors...
— Yes.

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
I've seen ones for, erm...

196
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,920
You're getting close with automatic tap sensors, by the way.

197
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,700
Yeah. And there's the things where you give it that number,

198
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,460
and it gives you a couple of sheets to dry your hands on,

199
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,300
so bog roll's just the next one on that stage.

200
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,940
Yeah, but people want different amounts, don't they.

201
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,320
You don't just want one or two sheets.

202
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,820
Yeah, but you just go...
Toilets?

203
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Everything in the bathroom apart from the one...

204
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,140
— You've got the water, the towels...
— Toilets! Showers!

205
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,900
— Soap.
— Bingo! Point.  [DING]

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,340
Oh yeah. [Mechanical noise]

207
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,100
Just going back to your bog roll thing...

208
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,300
Do you want to be sat in a work setting, in a cubicle,

209
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,420
and if you have to do this or something

210
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,180
to get the toilet roll to come out...

211
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,500
It'd be great for the Queen.

212
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,460
[Laughter]
Yes.

213
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,620
She'd never stop it. She'd just be surrounded by it.

214
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,760
[Laughter]
She'd be like an...

215
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,120
Slowly — just this hand, as the paper rises...!

216
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,940
It's actually the train on her wedding dress.

217
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,140
It's winding around her hand...

218
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
'Nooo!'

219
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,640
She looks like a naughty Andrex puppy when they find her.

220
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,480
But the other thing is, a toilet roll dispenser telling you —

221
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,360
like you say, in a public one — that there's not much left...

222
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
— 'Go careful now!'
[Laughter]

223
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
'If it was a curry, choose another stall.'

224
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Isn't that what toilet attendants used to probably do?

225
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,660
Can you imagine?

226
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,020
'Not that one! She's out. Use Number 1.'

227
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Can you tell me anywhere they might be sold?

228
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,640
We're looking for American retail stores...

229
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,720
Walmart!

230
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,800
Well, possibly, but we're looking for some more...

231
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,540
Bed Bath & Beyond.

232
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
— Point!
— Ohh!

233
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,900
— Damn.
— [DING] Spot on.

234
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,440
I always did wonder what 'Beyond' was.

235
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,800
Electric bins!

236
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,760
[Laughter]

237
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Electric speaky clever bins,

238
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
and toilet roll warning devices.

239
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,940
'Danger: Bog Roll.'

240
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,980
I want Danger Bog Roll.

241
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,060
'Each sheet a new danger!'

242
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,700
— Cactus.
— 'This one is covered in crocodiles!'

243
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,920
Croc...!

244
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,600
[Gnashing sounds]

245
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
'There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this one...

246
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
'Poison ivy!'

247
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
But why would I? She's lovely.

248
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,660
[Groan]

249
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,600
No, just you've got Russian Roulette toilet paper.

250
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,300
One's chili.

251
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,680
Capsaicin, yeah.

252
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,100
One sheet out of every six has poison ivy or capsaicin on it.

253
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Ohh, yes!

254
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
One out of six: spearmint.

255
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Tingly, but not necessarily wrong!

256
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Mint sauce, kind of...

257
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,320
TCP.

258
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,220
You'd smell that one from a mile off.

259
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,640
Witch hazel.

260
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,140
Tea tree!

261
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,980
That would spice up toilet breaks, wouldn't it though?

262
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
Russian Toilette.

263
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
Yes!

264
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 'Wheel of Fart-une'.

265
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
*Weal* of Fart-une.

266
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes.

267
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,900
I've got in my head, Nicky Campbell...

268
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,440
Nicky Campbell!

269
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
Or Pat Sajak, for you Americans out there,

270
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,520
spinning the wheel, and you wonder what it'll land on.

271
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,380
'I'm sorry, that's porcupine.'

272
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,620
'You've got... aloe vera.'

273
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,060
— 'Allo, Vera.'
— 'Alright, Gene.'

274
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,760
Ayyy!

275
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,180
Does anyone want to tell me
what Bed Bath & Beyond used to be called?

276
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,840
Because the first one opened in 1971...
it had a different name.

277
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,380
Is it something really prosaic, like Harrison's Home Supplies?

278
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Sleep Health Privy & Whatever.

279
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,100
I'd say it's about one-third more prosaic.

280
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,760
Bed & Bath.

281
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,980
Correct!  [DING]

282
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,580
'Wait, we're selling more than just beds and baths.

283
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,060
'What do we call it?'

284
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,060
'Bed, Bath... "Beyond" will probably do.

285
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,580
'Everybody? Shall we knock off early?'

286
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
'Bed, Bath and... a third item.'

287
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,600
'Come in to see what it is!'

288
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,620
'I need some pillows, a new plug for the bath
and some Tarot cards.'

289
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
That was the second version of the name.

290
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,100
It was just hanging off the edge of the store.

291
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Bed Bath & Tarot Cards?

292
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,700
Bed Bath Pillows Some Other Things & Tarot Cards.

293
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
While we're on Bed Bath & Beyond, by the way...

294
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,460
since we seem to be going down this wiki-hole...

295
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
They've bought a lot of companies.

296
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
Can you tell me what the name of the company

297
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
that sold Christmas trees was

298
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,580
that they bought about 2003?

299
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,760
Green Pricks!

300
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,940
What?

301
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Chris Masterson's Christmas Trees.

302
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,380
You're all being far too serious here.

303
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,220
The Christmas Tree Shop.

304
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,840
— Point!  [DING]
— F*** off!

305
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,160
I was so close!

306
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,500
Ha! 'What do you sell?'
'Cars.'

307
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,620
All right. There is one last thing that simplehuman sell,

308
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,400
which is a sensor mirror.

309
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,160
Can you tell me what it does?

310
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,800
Tells you you're ugly?

311
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,260
'Mirror, mirror on the wall...'

312
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,180
'How do I look today?'

313
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,200
Northerner mirror:
'F***in' dreadful.'

314
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,280
Is it a sensorless mirror?

315
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,800
Ha! A senseless mirror.

316
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,280
'Idiot!'

317
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,900
A really insensitive —

318
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,200
'Why did you leave the house?!'

319
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
A sensor mirror? I mean, what, does it...

320
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,860
tell you you've brushed your teeth, or give you gestures...

321
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I've got to be honest, all the sensors so far are just

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
if something is close to it. It's not much of a sensor.

323
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,220
Does it turn the lights on?

324
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,440
Point.  [DING]

325
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It turns the lights on if you're close to the mirror.

326
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
How do you know you're close to the mirror

327
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
if the lights aren't on?

328
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
It doesn't turn the room lights on, it turns the mirror...

329
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
— Sensor mirror: Boomf!
— 'Oh f***!'

330
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,160
And you hammer the light switch,
which is just set a bit behind it.

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
'I've sensed the mirror!'

332
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,720
'Why did I install this s****y mirror?'

333
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,900
'I've got to turn the lights off again now.'
Doof!

334
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,280
'Mirror, mirror, on the wa — ohhh!'

335
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
'Oh, you bastard!'

336
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,780
Same with the oven!

337
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,340
[Sizzling noise]
'Aaargh!'

338
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,600
At the end of that...

339
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,820
It's the most dangerous house going.

340
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
— The hot tap on the bath.
— Turn the telly on? Doonk!

341
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,520
[Groans]

342
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
'Honey? Will you switch on the light in the living room?'

343
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't want to use the waste disposal.

344
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,220
'I need to fry some bacon. Can you turn on the gas?'

345
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,140
Whoomph!

346
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,860
At the end of that, congratulations Matt!

347
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,260
— F***!
— What?!

348
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
You did score all the genuine points though.

349
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,540
He did actually get the answers, yeah, you're right.

350
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,520
You win a gift voucher to everyone's favourite
