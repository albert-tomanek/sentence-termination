00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,140
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,180
no backsies in the Hong Kong handover to China.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,339
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,889
Well, you asked for it,

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:14,969
so here it is—

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,210
the reason why the British gave Hong Kong

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,070
back to China those 20 years ago.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,340
Hong Kong today is under a weird policy

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,780
called “One Country, Two Systems,”

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,830
where even though it’s part of China,

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,640
it’s governed separately.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,830
Mostly.

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,190
So you have freedoms in Hong Kong

15
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,239
that could land you in a labor camp

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,350
in the rest of China.

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,499
So why does the People’s Republic of China

18
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,199
have these two contradictory

19
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,899
systems of government?

20
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,819
And why did Great Britain give Hong Kong

21
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:45,070
back to China in the first place?

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,539
Well, once upon a time,

23
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,739
everyone wanted stuff that was made in China.

24
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,620
Because no one made better quality stuff than
China.

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,210
But China didn't really want

26
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,409
any of the cheap junk

27
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:59,079
made by other countries,

28
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,149
like say, Great Britain.

29
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,629
Which sucked for them.

30
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,780
But then, in the early 1800s,

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,460
the British figured out something

32
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,060
everyone wanted:

33
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,060
drugs.

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,950
Specifically, opium.

35
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,220
The Chinese tried to just say no to drugs

36
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,500
and threw a bunch in the water.

37
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
As an American,

38
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,250
I guess there's something about British goods

39
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,110
that makes people just want to throw them
in the water.

40
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,430
Anyway, the Chinese destruction of opium

41
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,770
led to the First Opium War.

42
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,850
And the British won Hong Kong Island!

43
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,600
The British had so much fun,

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,690
a few years later,

45
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,220
they decided to have a second Opium War.

46
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,770
And the British won Kowloon!

47
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,500
Then China lost a war with Japan

48
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,520
and the British thought,

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
what the heck,

50
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,860
let’s take some more land—

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,430
as the British liked to do in those days.

52
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,550
And that’s how the British Empire

53
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,500
ended up with the New Territories.

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
This time though,

55
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,300
they technically only leased the land

56
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,320
for 99 years,

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,720
as a concession to the Chinese.

58
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,159
99-year leases were a standard way

59
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,440
of owning property in Great Britain,

60
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,950
so they probably assumed a 99-year lease

61
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,100
really meant “sort of forever.”

62
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,080
Kind of like the way teenagers

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,750
borrow money from their parents.

64
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,090
Do parents really expect

65
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,260
to get that money back?

66
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,010
Little could the British have imagined

67
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,030
that a future government of China

68
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,481
would insist that the 99-year lease

69
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:22,480
should expire, with no option for renewal,

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,849
on July 1, 1997.

71
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,520
So for more than a hundred years,

72
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,230
the British built up Hong Kong’s

73
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,490
industry and commerce.

74
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,010
It eventually became a major financial hub
in Asia.

75
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,069
The quality of living was completely different

76
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,400
from mainland China,

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,090
which had been seized by Communist rule.

78
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,670
But by that point in history,

79
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,280
owning colonies overseas was getting

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,770
less and less fashionable.

81
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,550
According to a cache of colonial records

82
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,440
the British government declassified in 2014,

83
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,810
“the Brits [were] mulling granting Hong
Kong

84
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,430
self-governance in the 1950s.”

85
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,951
But the Chinese Communist Party

86
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:00,090
did not like the idea of a democracy

87
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,810
on their border.

88
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,650
So they sent a threatening message to Britain

89
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,709
that they would “not hesitate

90
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,320
to take positive action to have Hong Kong,

91
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,480
Kowloon and the New Territories liberated,”

92
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,500
from the oppression of self-governance.

93
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
In other words,

94
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,319
the CCP threatened to invade Hong Kong

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,350
if the British made it democratic.

96
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,569
But at the same time,

97
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,340
the Communist Party wanted the Brits

98
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,760
to stay and rule,

99
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,910
so China could use Hong Kong to

100
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,060
“trade and contact people of other countries

101
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,379
and obtain materials.”

102
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,450
So the best thing the British could do

103
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,730
for Hong Kong at the time was…

104
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,610
continue to colonize them.

105
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,340
Awkward

106
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
And the Communist Party was perfectly happy

107
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,190
to let the British build Hong Kong

108
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,310
into the financial hub of Asia.

109
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,370
Because ultimately,

110
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,340
the Communist Party had a plan:

111
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,610
to take back Hong Kong in 1997.

112
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,970
But wait a minute, you say.

113
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,120
It was only the New Territories that were
on lease!

114
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,520
Britain would still get to keep Hong Kong
Island

115
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,900
and Kowloon, right?

116
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,319
Well, here’s the thing:

117
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,800
If the British had insisted

118
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,360
on keeping Hong Kong Island and Kowloon,

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,180
the Communist Party could just make life

120
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,980
extremely difficult for the people there.

121
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,440
Like by shutting off their water.

122
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,500
Because almost all the water comes from China

123
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,650
and the New Territories.

124
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,859
So rather than let its people die of thirst,

125
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,510
or terrible B.O.,

126
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,490
the British were forced to deal with

127
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,490
the practicality that when the lease

128
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,100
to the New Territories was up,

129
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,660
they’d have to give up Hong Kong

130
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,100
and Kowloon as well.

131
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,699
Plus they didn’t want to fight

132
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,720
the People's Liberation Army.

133
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,420
But the British told the people of Hong Kong,

134
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,540
“Don’t worry.

135
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,030
It’ll be totally fine.

136
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,970
The Chinese Communist Party will respect your
freedoms.”

137
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,990
It’s like when you tell your kids

138
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,550
you’re going to Disneyland,

139
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,260
but really you’re taking them to the dentist.

140
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,099
The dentist from Little Shop of Horrors.

141
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,220
But wait,

142
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,430
didn’t many of the colonies

143
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,310
that belonged to the former British Empire

144
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,300
get to become independent?

145
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
Like Fiji and the Bahamas

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,530
and like 50 others?

147
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,310
Why was the only option for Hong Kong

148
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,990
to revert to Chinese rule?

149
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,990
Because of a very,

150
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,770
very sneaky move by the CCP.

151
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,810
In 1971,

152
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,639
the United Nations had the great idea

153
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,380
to recognize the People’s Republic of China—

154
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,790
and not the Republic of China in Taiwan—

155
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,759
as the one true China.

156
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,919
And one of the first things

157
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,351
that the new Chinese ambassador

158
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,290
to the UN did, was to send this letter

159
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,949
to the United Nations Special Committee

160
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,470
on the Granting of Independence

161
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,820
to Colonial Countries and People.

162
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,919
Ok, I know this sounds boring,

163
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,140
but trust me,

164
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,669
it's about to get really interesting.

165
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,510
The letter said that Hong Kong and Macau

166
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,650
should not be considered colonies at all.

167
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,120
Nope, they're just part of Chinese territory

168
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,699
occupied by the British and Portuguese.

169
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,350
Nothing to see here.

170
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,950
And the select committee decided

171
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,520
that was okay with them.

172
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,050
Buried in paragraph 183

173
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,500
on page 64 of volume 1,

174
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,979
of their five-volume,

175
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,070
thousand-plus-page annual report,

176
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,240
the committee removed Hong Kong and Macau

177
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,639
from the list of non-self-governing-territories.

178
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,830
In a separate document,

179
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,560
the committee referenced China’s letter

180
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,810
as the direct reason for their decision.

181
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,320
Why was this a big deal?

182
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,620
Well, later in 1972,

183
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,310
the UN adopted resolution 2908,

184
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,020
which was a resolution largely about

185
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,639
supporting decolonization.

186
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,639
Part of the resolution

187
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,949
was approving the special committee’s report.

188
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:22,949
You know,

189
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,620
the one that was over a thousand pages long

190
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,510
that I’m sure everyone definitely read.

191
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,699
Just like you thoroughly review

192
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,150
the terms and conditions on your smartphone

193
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,410
every time they change

194
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,500
and carefully consider

195
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,240
whether to agree to them.

196
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,850
No way do you just hit accept

197
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,820
and move on with your day.

198
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,230
That would be irresponsible.

199
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,950
The resolution passed 99 to 5.

200
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,690
Basically, the Chinese ambassador to the UN

201
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,190
buried an obscure line in a long document,

202
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,889
so that when the UN members voted to support

203
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,770
the independence of colonized people worldwide,

204
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,530
Hong Kong and Macau were no longer on the
list.

205
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,060
This technicality completely changed

206
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,039
the destiny of Hong Kong—

207
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,820
because they no longer had the legal right

208
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,150
under the United Nations

209
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,280
to be independent.

210
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,610
So with this legal manipulation,

211
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,110
plus threats to cut off the water supply,

212
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,940
the British had no choice

213
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,240
but to hand over Hong Kong to China.

214
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,090
In 1982, then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher

215
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,509
visited Beijing,

216
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,900
and began negotiations over the future of
Hong Kong.

217
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,389
At first, the British hoped that even if

218
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,430
they had to legally give Hong Kong back to
China,

219
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,700
they could still be involved in

220
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,610
administering the territory.

221
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,250
If the Chinese wanted.

222
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,310
To which the Chinese side said,

223
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,310
“Nope!”

224
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,190
They made it clear that the Communist Party’s

225
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,990
sovereignty over Hong Kong

226
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,530
was the most important thing.

227
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,780
After two years of negotiations,

228
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,120
the Sino-British Joint Declaration

229
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,810
was signed in 1984,

230
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,580
establishing the handover of Hong Kong,

231
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,350
and the "One Country, Two Systems" model.

232
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,020
You know who weren’t part of the negotiations?

233
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,870
The people of Hong Kong.

234
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,499
And many were justifiably upset about it.

235
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,770
To Britain's credit though,

236
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,810
before they were forced to leave Hong Kong,

237
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,819
they tried protect many of Hong Kong’s freedoms.

238
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,130
The last governor of Hong Kong,

239
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,130
Chris Patten,

240
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,980
even expanded the legislative elections

241
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,400
to make them more democratic.

242
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,630
Chinese Communist Party condemned Patten for

243
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,630
that,

244
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,759
and called him a "liar,"

245
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,759
"snake,"

246
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,759
"prostitute,"

247
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,300
and "tango dancer."

248
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,370
Presumably not all at once.

249
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,699
And so in 1997,

250
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:27,830
the British left Hong Kong.

251
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,560
And the rest is history.

252
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,020
But for those of you worried about

253
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,500
the future of Hong Kong after our last episode

254
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,400
on what's happened in the last 20 years

255
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,520
under the Chinese Communist Party's rule,

256
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,570
don't worry!

257
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,570
It turns out,

258
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,409
we were completely wrong.

259
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,110
Hong Kong is just as great

260
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,630
as it used to be,

261
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,050
according to this news article

262
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,270
in the respected British newspaper

263
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,910
The Telegraph...

264
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,490
an article that just happened to be written

265
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,460
by China's ambassador to the United Kingdom.

266
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,800
And as we now know from this episode,

267
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Chinese ambassadors are very trustworthy.

268
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,850
So what do you think of China’s

269
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,810
“interesting” way of getting Hong Kong?

Leave your comments below.

271
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
And remember,

272
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,140
we can’t keep making China Uncensored

without support from viewers like you.

274
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,960
And where else would you get to see

275
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,170
obscure UN documents from 45 years ago?
