00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,360
An out of control Chinese rocket

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,400
Crashes to Earth

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
And China blames the US

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
Good news! We’re all still\h
alive! Because this week,\h\h

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,720
debris from an out-of-control Chinese\h
rocket crashed into the Indian Ocean.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,560
The Long March 5B rocket blasted off April\h
29, carrying components of China's planned\h\h

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,320
space station Harmony of the Heavens. But the\h
Chinese space agency lost control of the rocket\h\h

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,400
as it continued its 17,000 mile\h
an hour orbit around the earth\h\h

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,880
edging closer and closer with each\h
pass. Sky watchers caught glimpses\h\h

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,280
of it as it tracked as far north as New\h
York and as far south as New Zealand.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,160
This was a big embarrassment\h
for the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,720
Back in April, Chinese state-run media had proudly\h
touted the successful launch of the rocket.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,360
China started out late to the space race. China\h
launched “its first satellite only in 1970,\h\h

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
13 years after the Soviet Union and\h
12 years after the United States.”

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,680
But dominating space has become a\h
priority for the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,440
In 2019, China became the first country to land an\h
unmanned spacecraft on the dark side of the moon.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,040
But the timing of this latest\h
rocket crash is particularly bad.\h\h

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,000
Later this month, China’s first unmanned\h
Mars rover is expected to land. But people\h\h

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,880
aren’t talking about how great that is.\h
Instead, people are now talking about this.

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,720
Criticism is now crashing down on China\h
after rocket fragments rained down near\h\h

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,840
the tropical islands of the Maldives. "It's an\h
alarming thing for them to be doing.'' Harvard\h\h

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,680
Smithsonian astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell\h
says China's rocket has a design problem.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,960
Well, you don’t need to be an astrophysicist\h
to know that! But please continue.

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,520
(We normally make sure they\h
don't go into orbit at all,\h\h

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,120
or if they do, they have a restartable engine\h
which can bring them down in a controlled way.\h\h

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,200
Let's be clear here, it's not that China can't,\h
right? It's that they don't. That's exactly right.\h\h

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,360
Was it price? Was it laziness? I\h
would think it was a lack of concern.

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
It’s not surprising there’s\h
a lack of concern. You see,\h\h

30
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,800
China’s space program is actually run\h
by the Communist Party’s military.

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,680
In fact, because of the military link of China’s\h
space program, “Since 1999, the US has imposed\h\h

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,160
export controls on satellite technology to China.\h
And in 2011, Congress passed a law that imposed\h\h

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,760
restrictions on NASA engagement with China.”
Even though NASA hasn’t been great about that.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,080
But China is actually banned from\h
the International Space Station.\h\h

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,440
So China is building its own. If only the rockets\h
carrying parts for it could make it to space.\h

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
After China lost control of the rocket, they\h
were pretty quiet about the whole thing.

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,240
NASA has been critical.

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,600
In a statement Nasa says “it\h
is clear that China is failing\h\h

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,880
to meet responsible standards\h
regarding their space debris.”

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
But now that the Chinese rocket has safely\h
crash landed in the middle of the Ocean,\h\h

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
China is taking responsibility.\h
By blaming the US for hyping fear!

42
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,720
It was 20 tons of flaming space debris\h\h

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,960
hurtling down on our heads! That’s\h
a reasonable thing to be afraid of!

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,000
But my favorite state-run media, the Global\h
Times, says US fussiness is a low ploy.

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,200
“These people are jealous of China’s\h
rapid progress in space technology.”

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,120
“Some of these people even try to use the\h
noises they made to obstruct and interfere\h\h

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,320
with China’s future intensive launches for\h
the construction of its space station.”

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,160
The Global Times says, “There is\h
also no evidence proving that the\h\h

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,520
landing points of US rocket debris are more\h
controllable compared with those of China’s.”

50
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
You know, evidence. With Chinese characteristics.

51
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
Now it’s true that uncontrolled space\h
debris is not a problem unique to China.\h\h

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,440
Back in 1979, the US Skylab space station broke up\h\h

53
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,360
over the Indian Ocean and scattered\h
debris across Western Australia.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,640
Last month, SpaceX debris\h
landed on a farm in Washington.\h

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,480
But the criticisms of the Chinese military’s\h
space program aren’t about accidental debris.\h\h

56
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,280
They’re about careless rocket design and whether\h
China is cutting corners to win the space race.

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,400
And the Chinese Communist Party\h
is deflecting those criticisms\h\h

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
by blaming the US for...criticizing them.

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,760
Failure will happen as humanity\h
tries to reach for the stars.\h\h

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
But failure is not something the Chinese\h
Communist Party has ever been willing to face.\h\h

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,360
Which is why it’s so much easier to blame America.

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,920
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,880
fans who support us and our efforts to expose\h
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

64
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Kenneth Crips asks, “Japan has always made it\h
clear they will not tolerate the Chinese mainland\h\h

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,480
invading Taiwan. I don’t know what China is\h
thinking. They are surrounded by enemies.”\h

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
That’s a very good question. It’s true, China\h
is surrounded by countries that are not happy\h\h

68
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,680
with its aggressive expansion or\h
desire for global hegemony. But,\h\h

69
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:42,400
as top-ranking Communist Party official Yang\h
Jiechi once said, “China is a big country and\h\h

70
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,400
you are small countries, and that is a fact.”\h
He was talking to Southeast Asian countries.

71
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,400
There is a limit to what any of the countries\h
surrounding China can do because of how much\h\h

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,400
power the Chinese Communist Party has. Sure,\h
all of China’s neighboring countries could unite\h\h

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
and form alliances against the Communist\h
Party—and to an extent they’re trying,\h\h

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,040
but it’s harder for a bunch of\h
countries to all work together,\h\h

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,720
than it is for the CCP to put enough pressure\h
on the weakest country to break that alliance.

76
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,320
Now, if an equally big country stood\h
behind them, like the United States,\h\h

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,640
that could present a real problem for the\h
CCP. But as Jim Fanell , the Former Director\h\h

78
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,000
of Intelligence and Information Operations for\h
the U.S. Pacific Fleet has told us on the show,\h\h

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,680
we’ve entered what he calls the decade of concern.

80
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,960
The idea is that in 2049, the CCP will celebrate\h
the 100 year anniversary of the founding of the\h\h

81
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,560
People’s Republic of China. The CCP has to take\h
Taiwan before then. It also knows if an invasion\h\h

82
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,760
of Taiwan happens too close to 2049, China will\h
be an international pariah. No one would be\h\h

83
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,360
celebrating the anniversary with China. Not good\h
for a country that wants to be a global hegemon.

84
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,600
But the CCP also knows that\h
it takes about 20 years\h\h

85
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
for the rest of the world to\h
forget something. For example,\h\h

86
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,480
in 1989, the Tiananmen Square Massacre\h
made China an international pariah.

87
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,920
20 years later, leaders from around the world\h
celebrated in Beijing the 2008 Olympics.

88
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,160
That’s why now is the decade of concern. The\h
CCP believes that if it takes Taiwan now,\h\h

89
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
the rest of the world will have\h
forgotten by the 2049 anniversary.\h\h

90
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,120
So what the Chinese Communist Party is thinking\h
is that it can’t afford not to take Taiwan now.

91
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Thanks for your question Kenneth and your support.

92
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,480
