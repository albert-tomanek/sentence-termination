1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,649
Problems at a Chinese nuclear reactor

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:06,520
A record number of Chinese jets harass Taiwan

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,380
And more arrests in Hong Kong

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,880
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:29,449
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:35,430
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,870
Starting off our great week in China, there
may have possibly been a leak at a nuclear

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,170
power plant.

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,760
French power group EDF said on Monday it had
been informed of a build-up of inert gases

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,239
at its plant in China, and had called for
a meeting with its Chinese partner.

11
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,010
CNN also reported that Framatome, the EDF
unit which designed the reactor, had warned

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,190
of an "imminent radiological threat."

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,110
Okay, it is true there is a potentially dangerous
issue at the Taishan Nuclear power plant.

14
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,810
But according to the Chinese Communist Party,
everything is fine.

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,229
State-run China General Nuclear Power Group,
the majority owner of the joint venture with

16
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:20,030
EDF said in a statement on its website on
Sunday that operations at the nuclear power

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,470
station met safety rules and the surrounding
environment is safe.

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,100
See, it’s safe!

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,780
Would the Chinese Communist Party ever lie
to the world to cover up a dangerous leak?

20
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,630
Yet despite the assurances, the US is apparently
still looking into the nuclear plant leak.

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,200
The French company warned that “The Chinese
safety authority was raising the acceptable

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,049
limits for radiation detection outside the
Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong province

23
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,219
in order to avoid having to shut it down.”

24
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,429
See?

25
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,249
China doesn’t have to lie about the data.

26
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:58,250
They can just change the definition of how
much radiation is safe!

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,490
Problem solved.

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,149
But here’s a hint that there may still be
a small problem.

29
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:11,440
As CNN put it, “It is unusual that a foreign
company, [Framatome], would unilaterally reach

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,860
out to the American government for help when
its Chinese state-owned partner is yet to

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,940
acknowledge a problem exists.”

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,030
Yeah, especially when it’s a French company.

33
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,930
Since when do the French ask for help from
the Americans?

34
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,280
Ultimately, this situation is pretty typical
for joint ventures in China.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,320
The foreign company often realizes too late
their Chinese counterparts aren’t as honest

36
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,440
or cooperative as they’d like.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,790
Especially when it has to do with a Chinese
nuclear plant that was supposed to be a propaganda

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,790
symbol.

39
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,650
It was “the first of its type in the world
to enter operation in 2018, after delays hit

40
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,680
similar projects in Finland and France”.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,980
Is it possible that the Chinese Communist
Party may have cut some corners to get this

42
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,290
nuclear plant up and running?

43
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,470
Nah.

44
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,340
Speaking of cutting corners, a gas pipeline
in China exploded.

45
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,940
It destroyed a busy market in Shiyan city
in central Hubei Province.

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,560
As of this recording, Chinese state state
media say 25 people have died.

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,370
But we all know how honest China is about
statistics.

48
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,700
Especially when it involves local government
screwups.

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,030
But as I said in a recent episode about enormous
sinkholes opening up throughout China,

50
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,840
the Chinese Communist Party tends to care
more about the look of a city than the lives

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,060
inside the city.

52
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,340
Corners get cut.

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,980
And coming up after the break, the G7 tries
to counter China.

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,290
Welcome back.

55
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,790
The G7 is a group of the most powerful economies.

56
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,980
They had their annual meeting and awkward
family photo last week.

57
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,010
A big part of that meeting was about countering
China.

58
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,850
We did a full rundown of their plan on our
other channel, America Uncovered.

59
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,900
Yes, we have another channel.

60
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,960
But the G7 this year also talked about China
issues that it ignored in the past—Taiwan,

61
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,360
the East and South China Seas, and human rights
abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,920
Obviously China is not happy.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,940
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said,
“The U.S. is ill and very ill indeed.

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,940
The G-7 had better take its pulse and come
up with a prescription.”

65
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,340
That sounds like a swipe at President Biden
being old and confused.

66
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,660
But the Communist Party isn’t just upset
at the G7, they’re also mad at NATO.

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,420
NATO called China a global security challenge.

68
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,730
Something they haven’t done before.

69
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,000
We’re talking baby steps here.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,370
NATO only expressed concern about China’s
growing military.

71
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,430
While NATO still considers Russia a threat,
China merely presents challenges.

72
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,060
But even that was enough to infuriate the
Chinese regime.

73
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,160
Which responded that “China is actually
a force for peace but will defend itself if

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
threatened.”

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,260
Which is like a burglar saying he’s all
about protecting private property, and if

76
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,490
you try to take anything from his sack he’ll
knife you.

77
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,740
China once again proved how devoted it was
to peace this week, by sending a record 28

78
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,730
fighter jets toward Taiwan.

79
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,940
That was in response to G7 leaders calling
for a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan-China

80
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,990
issue.

81
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,760
The problem is, the Chinese Communist Party
is never about peace.

82
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,030
It’s about leaving the world in pieces.

83
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,570
Meanwhile, the US sent the aircraft carrier
Ronald Reagan to the South China Sea, along

84
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,080
with two guided missile destroyers.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,940
The US said it was part of routine freedom
of navigation operations in international

86
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,260
waters.

87
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,460
Chinese state media called it “cold war
baiting”.

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,530
Unlike flying fighter jets toward a country
they’ve threatened to invade.

89
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,400
Last month, a botched marathon in China resulted
in 21 deaths.

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,010
An investigation was launched into why organizers
ignored extreme weather warnings.

91
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,060
And now the Communist Party chief who was
responsible has mysteriously died.

92
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,690
Well it wasn’t that mysterious.

93
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,410
He fell from a building.

94
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,260
Don’t worry, local police say it wasn’t
homicide.

95
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,470
But they also aren’t saying it was suicide.

96
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,170
How many other options are there?

97
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,020
Was he just walking on the roof of a building
and slipped?

98
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,030
Speaking of mysterious deaths, a top Communist
official at a University in Shanghai was stabbed

99
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,030
to death.

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,400
Yes, universities in China are all overseen
by a Party official.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,990
This one was stabbed to death by a fellow
professor.

102
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,970
But details are sparse because Communist Party
run media don’t really like talking about

103
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,190
Communist Party officials being murdered.

104
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,050
Instead they prefer to focus on how much the
Chinese people love the Communist Party!

105
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,810
After all, “International polls have indicated
over and again that Chinese people’s approval

106
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,630
ratings of the CPC and the government rank
the highest worldwide.”

107
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,440
Wow, how do they manage?

108
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,389
Well, the secret is, “EVERYTHING IS FOR
THE PEOPLE.”

109
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,460
And yes, state media wrote that in all caps.

110
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,950
Speaking of communist run newspapers, the
New York Times!

111
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,050
(They conducted a rare interview with the
Chinese scientist potentially involved in

112
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,240
the coronavirus lab leak.

113
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,910
The virologist is Dr. Shi Zhengli.

114
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,460
She’s known as China’s bat woman for her
research on bat coronaviruses.

115
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,560
Like the kind she was doing at the Wuhan Institute
of Virology.

116
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,389
That was getting US government funding approved
by Dr. Fauci.

117
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,610
To do research making coronaviruses more contagious
and deadly.

118
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,770
Did I mention the Wuhan Institute of Virology
had known safety issues?

119
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,800
Or that some scientists have been saying for
over a year that there are signs the coronavirus

120
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,290
was engineered?

121
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,400
Anyway, as the New York Times says, “The
idea that the virus may have escaped from

122
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,889
a lab had long been widely dismissed by scientists
as implausible and shunned by others for its

123
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,419
connection with former President Donald J.
Trump.”

124
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,930
But now that Trump is impeached, and out of
office, and banned from social media, can

125
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,699
we *please* start investigating the truth
of a deadly virus that was never actually

126
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,050
connected to Trump in the first place?

127
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,610
It turns out, still no.

128
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,210
That’s why the New York Times interviewed
the virologist at the center of all this—to

129
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,000
dismiss the idea once and for all.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,769
“Dr. Shi has denied these accusations, and
now finds herself defending the reputation

131
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,869
of her lab and, by extension, that of her
country.”

132
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:49,160
You see, saying the coronavirus may have leaked
from a lab is racist and xenophobic.

133
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,240
The New York Times says Dr. Shi “could barely
contain her frustration”.

134
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,639
“I don’t know how the world has come to
this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent

135
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,639
scientist.”

136
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,470
I’m glad the New York Times is still doing
the propaganda work of the Chinese Communist

137
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,000
Party.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,329
But you know who isn’t doing the CCP’s
work?

139
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,329
Romania.

140
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:13,759
They just banned Chinese telecom Huawei from
the country’s 5G network.

141
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,310
Every US administration, from Obama, to Trump
to Biden has warned about the risk of Huawei.

142
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,949
The fact that these three guys agree on anything
tells you something.

143
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,529
And more and more countries have been joining
the US in banning Huawei from 5G networks.

144
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:34,600
It’s part of what the US State Department
calls the Clean Network.

145
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,199
Just another Trump era initiative the Biden
Administration is carrying on.

146
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:43,370
And...Hong Kong police have arrested more
democracy advocates.

147
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,880
I’ll tell you why after the break.

148
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,250
Welcome back.

149
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,749
Over in Hong Kong, people celebrated the two
year anniversary of the 2019 anti-extradition

150
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:55,920
protest.

151
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,570
It launched months of protests against the
Chinese Communist Party and its growing control

152
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,149
of Hong Kong.

153
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,779
And of course ended with the Hong Kong national
security law.

154
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,709
Which was pretty much everything they were
protesting against.

155
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,170
Which is why this anniversary was celebrated
by police arresting people for commemorating

156
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,170
it.

157
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,899
But that’s not all!

158
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,860
Hong Kong police have had a busy week.

159
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,670
Hundreds of police raided the offices of the
Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper.

160
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,360
They also arrested the editor-in-chief and
other executives.

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,899
Police said Apple Daily was violating the
national security law by “publishing articles

162
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,779
which called for sanctions on Beijing or [Hong
Kong].”

163
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,649
When other media tried to ask the police which
Apple Daily articles violated the national

164
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:46,249
security law, the police refused to answer.

165
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:50,470
It’s almost like they’re trying to make
all Hong Kong media afraid of publishing things

166
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,550
that could get them arrested.

167
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,610
Police also froze Apple Daily’s assets.

168
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,610
So it’s not clear how long the paper can
keep going.

169
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,560
But Apple Daily defiantly printed half a million
copies the day after the police raid, with

170
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,569
the message that “everyone has to hang in
there.”

171
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:13,839
Meanwhile, Jimmy Lai , the founder of Apple
Daily, is being put on trial.

172
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,980
He faces life imprisonment.

173
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,040
For what?

174
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,240
Why, for violating the national security law.

175
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Somehow.

176
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,070
Something to do with colluding with foreigners.

177
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,079
To do something.

178
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,079
Look, they don’t need a reason.

179
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,550
On the bright side, the American anti-Communist
organization, the Victims of Communism Memorial

180
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,860
Foundation , awarded Jimmy Lai a top honor
for his lifelong commitment to democracy in

181
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,949
Hong Kong.

182
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,189
Hopefully he can accept the award in person
one day.

183
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:46,879
But if he ends up in prison for life, they
also will present Jimmy with this very nice

184
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,309
cake.

185
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:54,709
Jimmy, we put a special ingredient in the
cake.

186
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,459
But I’m happy to say I won’t need to bake
a cake for Hong Kong activist Agnes Chow . She’s

187
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,379
been released from prison.

188
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:03,949
She never should have been in prison in the
first place.

189
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:09,300
That’s according to the Congressional–Executive
Commission on China , a bipartisan group of

190
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,999
U.S. lawmakers.

191
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:15,929
They tweeted “A more appropriate action
to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of 2019

192
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:20,399
Hong Kong protests would have been to drop
charges against those who participated in

193
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,249
those protests & release all other political
prisoners.”

194
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:30,779
Which sounds to me like...these hostile foreign
forces have been colluding with everyone in

195
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:31,779
Hong Kong!

196
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,829
China’s gonna have to lock up everybody
now!

197
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:38,510
I’ve got a lot of baking to do.

198
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,839
But first, it’s time to answer a question
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent

199
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,339
Army, fans who support us and our efforts
to expose the truth about the Chinese Communist

200
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,879
Party, by contributing through crowd funding
website Patreon.

201
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,850
Mika Ranta asks “That sinkhole looks like
PhotoShop or something.”

202
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,540
Ah, Mika is referring to this thumbnail image
from our recent episode China’s MASSIVE

203
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,350
Sinkholes Are Swallowing Cars and Buses.

204
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,570
A lot of people asked me that actually.

205
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,970
It does look photoshopped, doesn’t it?

206
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,430
After all, it's kind of hard to believe this
is real.

207
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,829
It’s real.

208
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:18,939
Sometimes things that happen in China are
beyond belief.

209
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,440
Thanks for your question and your support,
Mika.

210
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,839
