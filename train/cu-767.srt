00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,790
could this be China’s new weapon for the
South China Sea?

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,220
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,460
War between the US and China.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,540
It would “destructive, “prolonged,”
and “ruinous.”

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,109
Those were the findings of this recent report
by the Rand corporation.

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,179
Even though the Chinese People’s Liberation
Army

8
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,640
is far behind the US army in terms of technology
and war capability,

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,160
“by 2025, that gap could be much smaller.”

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,080
One piece of the gap that China would need
to fill is aircraft carriers.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,640
The United States currently has 10 functional
aircraft carriers.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,310
China has one.

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,270
And it wasn’t even made in China.

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,770
It was built in Ukraine before the fall of
the Soviet Union.

15
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,300
It was sold to China as scrap.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,170
The Chinese buyer said he was going to turn
it into a casino.

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,680
But then, shockingly,

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,680
the Chinese government got ahold of it

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,420
and kept it as an aircraft carrier.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,160
After nearly two decades of refurbishing,
it set sail in 2012.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,340
It’s called the Liaoning.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,430
And it’s not even that functional.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,820
But now, these photos have surfaced,

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,200
showing China has almost completed a new aircraft
carrier.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,220
And this one is made in China.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,240
Chinese military sources say it will still
be several years

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,010
before construction is complete and

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,630
crews trained to make it fully operational.

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,540
Hopefully it will be more operational than
my Polystation.

30
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,791
Now a country having its own aircraft carrier

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,380
is a rite of passage of sorts.

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,390
Also helpful for protecting its military interests
overseas.

33
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,760
Only 13 countries in the world have them.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,270
And even though Douglas MacArthur described
Taiwan

35
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,409
as “the unsinkable aircraft carrier,”

36
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,540
at best that just makes it another US one.

37
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,370
But there are some pretty big differences

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,360
between even this newest under-construction
Chinese aircraft carrier

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,090
and the US ones.

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,400
For one, China’s is much smaller,

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,970
displacing only 60-70,000 tons.

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,649
Compare that to some of the bigger US ones

43
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,470
that displace 100,000 tons.

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,740
Also, both the Liaoning and this new one use
a ski ramp.

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,110
And while that’s fun for a weekend at the
Poconos,

46
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,190
it’s less useful for war.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,180
Basically, jets get the lift they need to
take off by going really fast

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,150
and the ramp adds the extra little something
to get them in the air.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,410
The US uses a catapult system.

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,880
No, a modern catapult system.

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,330
It hooks onto the front of the plane and throws
it into the air.

52
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,780
This means heavier or slower aircraft can
still launch.

53
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,030
But China, using the ski jump, wouldn’t
be able to launch turboprop planes,

54
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,459
for example cargo aircraft like the US C-2
Greyhound or early warning aircraft

55
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,920
like the E-2D Hawkeye.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,680
So that means Chinese supplies won’t be
so fresh off the boat.

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,540
That’s why a recent report by the Pentagon’s
Defense Intelligence Agency said,

58
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,910
“The aircraft carriers that [China is] building

59
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,220
will not have the same blue open ocean capability
that our aircraft carriers have.

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,810
Nor will it be able to execute air operations
the way we use our carriers.”

61
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,709
But directly competing with the US is probably
not China’s goal.

62
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,970
Since that whole, war between the US and China
would be

63
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,129
“destructive, “prolonged,” and “ruinous,”
thing.

64
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,270
A Chinese aircraft carrier doesn’t need
to be very powerful

65
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,110
or even go very far to achieve the Chinese
government’s goals.

66
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,660
That’s because “There are strong indications
that the new carrier

67
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,720
will be placed at a military port on Hainan
Island,

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,360
which faces the South China Sea.”

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,340
So as early as 2020,

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,300
we might be seeing a Chinese-made aircraft
carrier

71
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,540
sailing in those disputed waters.

72
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,700
And that’s not all.

73
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,020
According to this article,

74
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,730
“Some experts believe that the People's
Liberation Army

75
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,120
plans to have four to six aircraft carrier
groups in the near future.”

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
So who knows?

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,379
Maybe by 2025 we really can be on the brink
for a good old fashioned

78
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,310
“destructive, “prolonged,” and “ruinous,”
war!

79
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,980
So what do you think of China’s new addition
to their navy?

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,360
