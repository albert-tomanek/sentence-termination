1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,420
five Hollywood movies infiltrated by China.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,019
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,799
Hollywood seems to have a

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,600
difficult time dealing with Asia.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,050
Mickey Rooney as a Japanese man!

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,320
Who could have imagined that

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,350
taping your eyelids and wearing buck toothed
dentures

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,070
to play a living stereotype

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,450
would be in poor taste?

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,299
But we've moved way beyond that now.

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,439
These days,

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,190
whenever a story calls for an Asian character,

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,180
Hollywood just casts a white actor

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,120
and tells everyone that they're Celtic.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,329
It’s called whitewashing -

18
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,880
taking ethnic characters and making them white.

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,410
And who cares what anyone thinks?

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,300
You can see more on that here.

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,399
But at the same time,

22
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,480
Hollywood cares very much about what China
thinks.

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,750
And that’s because China is poised to become

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,110
the world’s largest movie market soon.

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,440
At a predicted 8.3 billion dollars for this
year,

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,590
China’s box office is already number two,

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,440
just a few billion away from catching up with
the US.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,080
But the Communist Party of China

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,260
only allows 34 foreign films a year.

30
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,920
And they’re subject to strict censorship
requirements.

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
So that means,

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,180
before the next Hollywood blockbuster goes
into production,

33
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,030
studios go to great lengths to ensure their
movies

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,180
won’t hurt the feelings of the Chinese censors.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,240
Yeah! Now that a more bettah!

36
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,740
Like when Angelina Jolie

37
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,950
was promoting Maleficent in Shanghai.

38
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,960
A reporter asked who’s her favorite Chinese
director.

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,860
She named Ang Lee,

40
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,860
and then said,

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,230
“I am not sure if you consider Ang Lee Chinese;

42
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,680
he’s Taiwanese!”

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,190
Well that made everyone pretty ang-ry

44
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,270
because that seemed to imply

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,370
that Taiwan was somehow a separate entity

46
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,940
from Mainland China,

47
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,370
just because it has its own government,

48
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,370
currency,

49
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,860
and Olympic team.

50
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,680
One Weibo user even called Jolie

51
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,160
a “deranged Taiwan independence supporter.”

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Disney was concerned

53
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,729
this could affect their movies chances in
China.

54
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,510
So they made Jolie go on a publicity tour
in Shanghai.

55
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,880
Moral of the story,

56
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,370
Maleficent made 48 million dollars in China.

57
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,810
Money is a moral, right?

58
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,290
But it’s not just celebrities that need
to be careful.

59
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,880
Everyone watching an American movie now needs
to be careful, too.

60
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,710
Because there’s a pretty good chance that

61
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,490
the next blockbuster you watch

62
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,470
will have been changed to appease the Chinese
Communist Party.

63
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,140
And here are 5 Hollywood movies that already
happened to.

64
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,320
Number 5

65
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,740
Great Wall

66
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,890
The biggest production in China’s film making
history!

67
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,910
It’s set 1000 years in the past,

68
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,690
and Matt Damon helps save China from monsters.

69
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,050
Matt Damon.

70
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,670
Something like that.

71
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,790
But there’s more to the story than whitewashing.

72
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,350
The movie is produced mainly

73
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,460
by Legendary Entertainment,

74
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,230
the people who brought you Jurassic World
and Interstellar.

75
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,400
Legendary is an American company,

76
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,230
but it was bought earlier this year by the
Dalian Wanda Group,

77
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,819
the same Chinese company that owns

78
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,069
the biggest theater chain the world.

79
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,510
Will the Great Wall finally give the Chinese
government

80
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,000
the soft power movie they crave?

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,760
I just hope they give us Matt Damon back.

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Number 4

83
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,480
Iron Man 3

84
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,560
So when the main villain

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,060
—or is he?—

86
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,100
is based on an offensive Chinese stereotype,

87
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,940
you can understand why that would be changed.

88
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,640
But Iron Man 3 takes it a step further.

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,760
For the Chinese release, they added a four minute new scene

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,150
featuring two famous Chinese actors

91
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,320
saving Tony Stark's life.

92
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,210
And don’t forget the product placement!

93
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,180
Enjoy Yili Milk today!

94
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,740
Remember that one.

95
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,270
Disney also partnered with

96
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,500
Beijing-based DMG Entertainment.

97
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,740
Not only did that help Iron Man 3

98
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,480
break past the 34 foreign film limit,

99
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,470
it also meant Disney got a bigger share of
the profits—

100
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,209
40% of the profits instead of just 25%.

101
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,230
Yeah,

102
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,320
the Chinese regime normally only lets foreign
movies

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,940
keep 25% of the box office revenue.

104
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,130
Robert Downey Jr,

105
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,070
the actor who plays Iron Man,

106
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,890
also went to Beijing for a press conference.

107
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,770
“I'm interested in all things Chinese,”
he said,

108
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,120
“and I live a very Chinese life in America.”

109
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,380
By which I can only assume

110
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,100
he means working for 5 dollars a day,

111
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,250
dealing with corrupt local officials,

112
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,900
and staying away from political issues

113
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,250
to avoid having his organs harvested.

114
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,710
Number 3

115
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,460
Independence Day: Resurgence

116
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,720
How do you make the sequel

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,980
to the highest grossing movie of 1996 a hit

118
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,419
in a country it was never shown in?

119
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,919
Well, for one,

120
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,690
get rid of that whole “America saves the
world” theme.

121
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,690
Instead,

122
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,040
why not have China and the US work together

123
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,139
as part of the Earth Space Defense

124
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,110
to defeat the aliens?

125
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,450
Be sure to throw in Hong Kong pop star Angelababy.

126
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,210
And let’s not forget \hMoon Milk,

127
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,889
a competitor to the Yili Milk

128
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,360
from Iron Man 3.

129
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,180
In fact,

130
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,760
Independence Day Resurgence features so much Chinese product placement

131
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,990
that even my favorite state-run media,

132
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,250
the Global Times,

133
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,690
makes fun of it.

134
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,090
On the plus side,

135
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,331
this level of teamwork did help get the movie

136
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:33,350
a same-day release in China and the US.

137
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,350
Pretty rare,

138
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,639
since usually there’s a long censorship
process involved.

139
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,699
Fortunately,

140
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,179
they just made censorship part of the script
writing.

141
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,010
Number 2

142
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,389
World War Z

143
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,430
The great thing about this movie is,

144
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,650
even if you read the book,

145
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,600
it will still seem fresh!

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,580
Because it’s an entirely different story.

147
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
Spoilers for the book:

148
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,160
The zombie virus that sweeps the world

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
begins in China.

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,250
It’s spread through the Chinese military’s

151
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,430
black market organ trade.

152
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,530
The Chinese regime covers it up

153
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,120
by launching a war on Taiwan.

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,310
Civil war breaks out as top officials

155
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,560
mobilize the army to protect their own skin,

156
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,050
leaving the rest of the country to burn.

157
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,060
That only ends

158
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,760
when a rogue Chinese nuclear submarine

159
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,990
nukes the Politburo Standing Committee.

160
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,639
Now, spoilers for the movie…

161
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,639
there are none.

162
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,639
It’s already been spoiled

163
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,169
because literally nothing in the book is in
the film.

164
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,720
This was all done

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,340
in the hopes of getting a China release—

166
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,260
which they did not get.

167
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,860
I mean, nuke the Politburo!

168
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,000
Plus, the Chinese regime has had problems
with Brad Pitt

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,479
ever since he was in that movie

170
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,660
about that separatist leader,

171
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,430
the wolf in monk’s robes,

172
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,169
the Dalai Lama.

173
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,169
So yeah,

174
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,240
that movie was never going to get a piece

175
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,750
of the Chinese market.

176
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,790
And finally, Number 1

177
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,130
Transformers: Age of Extinction

178
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,430
Not just the toys are made in China.

179
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,970
Transformers: Age of Extinction

180
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,360
was a co-production between Paramount pictures,

181
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,350
a Chinese company, Jiaflix Enterprises,

182
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,600
and, get this,

183
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,610
state-run newscaster and Communist Party mouthpiece, CCTV!

184
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,120
That means the Chinese Communist Party was
directly involved.

185
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
And you might just be able

186
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
to make out their fingerprints on the film.

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,070
For instance,

188
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,090
the villains of the film are the American
government,

189
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,140
specifically the CIA.

190
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,699
That hurts.

191
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,979
One US authority puts a gun to the hero’s
daughter’s head

192
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:39,280
to get him to reveal information.

193
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,540
The main villain is manipulating the US government.

194
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,850
His appeal to “national security”

195
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,270
is really just a cover for a secret project

196
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,449
he’s got with a big corporation that will
make him rich.

197
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,259
And he’s willing to kill for it.

198
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,130
As popular entertainment magazine Variety
wrote,

199
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,110
“My first reaction to “Age of Extinction”
was

200
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,030
that it was an astonishingly unpatriotic film.

201
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,340
But I was wrong.

202
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,680
‘Transformers: Age of Extinction’ is a
very patriotic film.

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,870
It’s just Chinese patriotism on the screen,

204
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,870
not American.”

205
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,480
Because how do Chinese authorities come off?

206
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Well,

207
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,100
when aliens attack Hong Kong,

208
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,420
who you gonna call? The Chinese central government!

209
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,419
And then the Chinese defense minister comes along

210
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,560
and vows to protect Hong Kong.

211
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,969
Just a few months after the movie came out,

212
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,969
tens of thousands of Hong Kong protesters
spoke out

213
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,060
against that very same Chinese “central
government”

214
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,970
for destroying their freedoms and way of life.

215
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,170
Then there’s this scene.

216
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,149
Even when running from CIA assassins,

217
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,170
there’s always time to stop for Shuhua milk,

218
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,069
made by our old friends at Yili!

219
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,569
And here you have Mark Wahlberg

220
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:03,249
stopping to use the ATM at his favorite bank—

221
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:04,959
China Construction Bank—

222
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,819
in Texas.

223
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,300
And what did they get for teaming up

224
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,360
with the Chinese government

225
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,800
to make anti-American propaganda?

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,140
300 million dollars,

227
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,949
surpassing China’s previous top grossing
movie,

228
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:17,949
Avatar.

229
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,309
Moral of the story is—

230
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,309
money!

231
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,379
In fact,

232
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:23,999
Paramount must really have enjoyed the experience

233
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:26,069
working with the Chinese regime.

234
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:28,779
That might be why the Dalian Wanda Group

235
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,829
is trying to buy a 1 billion dollar stake

236
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,930
to 49% of Paramount.

237
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,910
But this all is just the tip of the iceberg.

238
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,589
Check out our upcoming episode

239
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,879
where we dig deeper into how China’s cultural
takeover

240
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,420
of Hollywood is part of the Communist Party’s
larger plans

241
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,809
to influence and surpass the US.

242
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:53,490
So what do you think of the silver screen
turning red?
