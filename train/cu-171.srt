Five Chinese Military Fails

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,320
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,000
China's military.

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,650
The largest standing army in the world!

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,180
Now sure, they know how put on a good show

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,520
when the rest of the world is watching.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,840
Wow, that's just creepy.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,690
But the People's Liberation Army has its problems,
too.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,330
Like that it's riddled with corruption.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,730
And many of the top generals

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,340
are just high-ranking Communist Party officials

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,780
without real combat experience.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,880
And the fact that soldiers have to spend

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,910
20 to 30 percent of their time studying Party
propaganda,

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,890
singing patriotic songs, and discussing Marxist-Leninist
thought.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,420
Though that doesn't mean they aren't a force
to be reckoned with.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,860
In fact, their last large scale deployment
was a complete success!

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,180
In Beijing.

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,240
In 1989.

21
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:03,440
But when the opponent isn't a group of unarmed
protesters,

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,810
things might be a little more difficult.

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,450
So here are five Chinese military fails

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,939
Number 5

25
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,649
You want your artillery to be powerful.

26
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:16,389
Strong. Intimidating.

27
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,850
So it might not be so great for your image

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,570
if people see this when you're transporting
your artillery down the street.

29
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,560
Number 4

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,389
Here's a unique training method.

31
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:32,119
Surely it's a good idea to play a game hot
potato

32
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,959
with a live grenade.

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,840
I feel like there's potential for this to
go really, really badly.

34
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,439
Number 3

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,080
In Chinese movies like this one,

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,280
soldiers demonstrate great skill with grenades.

37
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,949
But life does not always imitate art.

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,170
Number 2

39
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,220
But when grenade fails prove too embarrassing,

40
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,920
leave it up to state-run media to turn a fail
into a propaganda piece.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
"In the few seconds between life and death,

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,750
we see the glorious tradition of our army,

43
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,040
which has already become a part of the blood
of our military officials and soldiers."

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,460
I don't think the viewers bought it.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,060
And Number 1

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,510
When you're not accidentally blowing things
up,

47
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,690
at least you should be able to blow up your
targets on purpose.

48
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,930
Here, the reporter is ready to witness the
military's technique for demolishing a tower.

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,280
That was a really long silence.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,900
So those are 5 Chinese military fails.
