1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,459
World War 3 is here

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:05,930
But it’s not being fought with nuclear weapons

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,960
It’s being fought with influence.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,730
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,430
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,070
World War 3 isn’t some far off nightmare.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,890
It’s been waged by China for decades.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,880
China is the only country fighting

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,800
a truly 21st century war.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,509
Their weapons aren’t guns or bullets,

11
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:31,640
or even nuclear warheads.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,330
Their weapon is influence being bought

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,400
with money and technology.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,800
And in this war,

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,780
we’re all soldiers.

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,080
How close is China to winning?

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,301
And when will the United States

18
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:46,020
realize it’s already at war?

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,100
Joining me today is retired Air Force Brigadier,

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,520
General Robert Spalding.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,480
He recently wrote this book,

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,120
Stealth War: How China Took Over

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,460
While America's Elite Slept.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
It's basically the playbook

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,730
of how China waged an unrestricted war

26
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,560
against the United States.

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,840
Great to be back.

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,900
So, for decades now,

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,890
the US and China have been involved

30
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,100
in this strategic cooperation.

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,210
And as promised,

32
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,570
China's become a liberal democracy.

33
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,570
Correct?

34
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,929
Oh, that's so true.

35
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,670
And that's why the people of Hong Kong

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,719
are protesting right now,

37
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,859
so that they can actually move into the mainland
China,

38
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,539
and join this wonderful free

39
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:26,869
and great society that she's [crosstalk].

40
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,229
I believe Taiwan is trying to do the same
thing.

41
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,229
The same thing.

42
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,539
In fact, they're pushing Hong Kongese out
of the way,

43
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,630
so they can get into mainland faster.

44
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,619
Hand over feet.

45
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,749
So, tell us a bit about your book.

46
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:44,100
So, the whole idea behind the book was to
get out

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,999
as fast as I could,

48
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,789
everything I had learned working

49
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,439
in the Defense Department,

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,439
and the State Department,

51
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,439
and the White House,

52
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,219
over the last five or six years,

53
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,931
understanding what the Chinese Communist Party

54
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,340
was doing to our country,

55
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,249
because quite frankly,

56
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,670
now within DC the government gets the joke.

57
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,459
So, within the Executive Branch,

58
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,759
we understand the challenge

59
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,529
that the Chinese Communist Party has,

60
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:08,039
not just for our economy,

61
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,170
but also for our democracy,

62
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,629
and in the Hill on both sides of the aisle,

63
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:15,970
Democrats and Republicans,

64
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,900
they understand that.

65
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,790
Who doesn't understand it quite frankly,

66
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,430
because most Americans don't really understand

67
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,620
what China is,

68
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,200
in terms of Chinese Communist Party's power

69
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,610
to control the entire society,

70
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,610
is the American people.

71
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,370
And so, the idea was to get this information

72
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,370
to the American people,

73
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,159
so they could understand not only

74
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,020
what was going on in terms of the Chinese
Communist Party,

75
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,540
but why there was this essentially unspecified
angst

76
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,990
about what's going on with our own society,

77
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,950
in terms of the ability to deliver

78
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,730
on the promise of a more perfect union.

79
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,739
Well, so my question is,

80
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,930
is this just an issue of China out

81
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,299
competing the US on an even playing field,

82
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,140
or is something else going on?

83
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,730
No, first of all, there's no even playing
field.

84
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,069
When we talk about international economics,

85
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,560
the word we use is free trade.

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,099
Well actually,

87
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,680
that's based on an idea of market-based

88
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
approaches to economics,

89
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,819
and China is anything from a market based
economy.

90
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,260
In fact, they have done, especially since
Xi Jinping

91
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,480
has come into control of the Chinese Communist
Party,

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,700
they've slowly consolidated the power

93
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,240
of the state owned enterprises within China,

94
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,069
so that the Chinese Communist Party

95
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,150
actually had more power over the economy.

96
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,170
Not only they've done that,

97
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,080
but they've essentially decapitated the leadership

98
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,340
of a lot of the private companies within China.

99
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,260
So HNA, Anbang, Alibaba,

100
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,810
they've taken out the billionaires

101
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,030
that had founded those companies,

102
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,320
and essentially so that the Chinese Communist
Party

103
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,760
could retake control of those companies, as
well.

104
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,159
Recently, they just sent a bunch of government
officials

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,069
to work in companies,

106
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,830
so they had even more control over

107
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,769
what was going on in the economy.

108
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:10,841
So, everything that they said that

109
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,670
they were going to do, the WTO,

110
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,670
everything that we believe in

111
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,739
in terms of free trade and a level playing
field,

112
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,709
they don't absolutely agree with at all.

113
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,860
So, the Chinese Communist Party,

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,789
isn't into the free markets?

115
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,090
Well, of course Xi Jinping will go to Davos,

116
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,759
where everybody will gently clap, when he
says,

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,039
"We need to keep globalization going,

118
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,690
we need to collaborate."

119
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,190
But in fact, no,

120
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,430
they're into continuously growing the Chinese
economy,

121
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,990
for the purpose of maintaining legitimacy,

122
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,310
so the Chinese people don't overthrow them,

123
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,250
for being despotic totalitarians.

124
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,110
Well so, I know there are people who will
say,

125
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,940
"Is this really just an issue of the United
States

126
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,210
losing its position of global dominance?"

127
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,210
And they would say,

128
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,210
"They don't really care

129
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,539
whether it's the United States or China,

130
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:03,780
that's the global superpower."

131
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,940
Well, I think the NBA offers a good example

132
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,760
of what that means for a democratic society,

133
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,380
and that is the institutions of your society,

134
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,110
whether they be political,

135
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,060
academic, corporate or financial,

136
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,400
are in league with the Chinese Communist Party.

137
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,000
So, if the NBA can basically

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,789
come very close to firing the General Manager

139
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,110
for tweeting something like,

140
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,400
"Support democracy in Hong Kong,"

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,479
then you understand the power

142
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,130
that Chinese Communist Party has

143
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,319
over the entire system.

144
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,319
When I was at the White House,

145
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,630
I would call lawyers, think tanks, and say,

146
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,150
"Hey, I need help either exposing

147
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,080
what the Chinese are doing,

148
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,229
or come up with the policy options

149
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,419
that we can actually use,

150
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:46,479
to stop what they're doing."

151
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,130
And they would all come back and say,

152
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,190
"Sorry, we can't help,

153
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,750
because we don't want to anger our Chinese
funders,

154
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,750
or customers."

155
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,470
And so, it's pervasive throughout our society.

156
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,900
And quite frankly,

157
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,860
the leaders of these institutions know it.

158
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,500
But, they're under the mistaken belief

159
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,020
that embracing the Chinese Communist Party,

160
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,720
will somehow unlock this magical move towards
democracy.

161
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,030
So, the idea of open markets leading wealth
to wealth,

162
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,080
and wealth leading to democracy,

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,349
drives them to say,

164
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,410
"Okay, I'm going to have

165
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,210
the same worldview as Xi Jinping.

166
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,599
Only, the world view that he has,

167
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,259
and the world view that our leaders have,

168
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,270
are completely counter to each other.

169
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,100
Because, if you read document number nine,

170
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,500
which I know you have,

171
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,629
you understand that rather than the Bill of
Rights,

172
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,600
they believe in the anti Bill of Rights,

173
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
and in fact,

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,990
they want to suppress and destroy the Bill
of Rights,

175
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,169
because they see it as a challenge to their
continued rule.

176
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,000
So basically, these American companies is,

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,490
and think tanks are, their idea is,

178
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,000
"We will make China more free and democratic

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,610
by imposing self-censorship in the United
States."

180
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,120
Well, they've been told that.

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
And so, what we do,

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,699
is we incentivize them to do that kind of
behavior.

183
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,800
So for instance,

184
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,610
with MSCI World Index going from 0 to 20%

185
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,020
weighting in Chinese equities, what that does,

186
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,919
is take our retirement funds over to China

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,420
to help invest in the Belt and Road Initiative,

188
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,580
or Made in China 2025.

189
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,580
You're talking about US pensions being vested
in China.

190
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,960
US pensions funds.

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,340
But, at the same time,

192
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,020
the Securities and Exchange Commission,

193
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
who's responsible for ensuring

194
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,409
that there's a level playing field

195
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:32,639
for the US stock holder,

196
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,920
allows Chinese companies

197
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,730
not to abideby audit requirements,

198
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,340
or transparency requirements.

199
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,569
Now, why is that?

200
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,060
Why does Intel have to have a 10Q and a 10K,

201
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,710
a quarterly statement, and an annual statement?

202
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,620
Because SEC forces them to.

203
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,509
But why doesn't Ali Baba,

204
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,789
who's really a Cayman Island company...

205
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:55,270
And you don't know who owns the assets.

206
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,550
Why aren't they required to do the same thing?

207
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,349
Well, because there's this belief,

208
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:03,819
that if we just gave them a little bit of
a good deal,

209
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,039
or a benefit, that they will again,

210
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,400
open up and become democracies.

211
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,650
But of course, all the Chinese Communist Party
does

212
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,650
is take this policy, and say,

213
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,419
"Let's take as much money out of the system
as we can,

214
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,220
so that we can keep this thing going."

215
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Sort of the idea of the China's

216
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,639
this poor developing country,

217
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,400
and as Joe Biden said,

218
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,409
"They're not a competition for the United
States."

219
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,290
They're not a problem, folks.

220
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,450
So, how widespread is Chinese money,

221
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,560
in the United States?

222
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,660
So, it's in the university system.

223
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,260
So what's happened since essentially

224
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,790
since the National Security Strategy in 2017,

225
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,140
we've started to focus

226
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,990
more on foreign agent registration.

227
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,010
So, FAR registrations.

228
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,380
You're starting to see now,

229
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,570
if you go and look at those online,

230
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,329
you can see literally,

231
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:02,329
tens of thousands,

232
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,329
hundreds of thousands,

233
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,520
if not millions of dollars pouring in from
China

234
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,300
to pay former congressman, former senators,

235
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,220
that are essentially lobbying on Capitol Hill.

236
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,310
All of these Chinese media,

237
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,630
Chinese language media companies

238
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,500
that are delivering Chinese media,

239
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,260
language media content in the United States,

240
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,140
are having to register as foreign agents.

241
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,430
And you started to get a real idea

242
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,510
of how entrenched they are in our system.

243
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,850
Of course, you can also look at the think
tanks today,

244
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,980
like the major think tanks in Washington,
DC.

245
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,470
Look on the boards of those think tanks,

246
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,740
and look at their relationships

247
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,050
to the Chinese Communist Party,

248
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,760
and you realize that nearly every major institution

249
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,130
that we would count on

250
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,730
to uphold the democratic principles of our
free society,

251
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,140
have essentially created these a economic

252
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,260
and financial relationships with China.

253
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,390
Now, did they go out and seek these out,

254
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,520
or did China come...

255
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,200
There's a little bit of both, quite frankly.

256
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,149
I see there's a desire on the part of business

257
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:13,430
in the United States to prevent conflict,

258
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,700
and they think that if they're over talking

259
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,889
to the Chinese Communist Party,

260
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,440
that somehow they will create this connection,

261
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,290
that will make them not aggressive,

262
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,570
or want to have conflict.

263
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,700
But, of course,

264
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,649
it just shows a lack of knowledge

265
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:31,260
of how the Chinese Communist Party

266
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,810
thinks about competition,

267
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,840
thinks about warfare,

268
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,470
thinks about warfare in ways that

269
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,269
are completely different from the United States.

270
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,889
I think it's very interesting in your book
how you frame it.

271
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,820
China is the only country fighting a 21st
century war.

272
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,950
Yeah.

273
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,660
We talk about World War 3.

274
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,430
And, when is it going to happen?

275
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,709
What's going to be the catalyst,

276
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,170
and how's it going to play out?

277
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,170
Nuclear bombs flying.

278
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,170
Nuclear bombs flying,

279
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,470
and it's going to start with a biological
agent

280
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,000
that's released in some city,

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,140
or there's all kinds of these scenarios

282
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,300
that we have war games in the military,

283
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,680
and talk about, and try to think about how
war

284
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,430
is going to change in the future.

285
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,320
Meanwhile, it's being waged

286
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,590
for decades in our neighborhoods.

287
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,060
And so, we're programmed in the military

288
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,690
to fight abroad,

289
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,930
to fight outside the borders because we think,

290
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,769
"Well, if we protect America from abroad,

291
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,870
then we don't have to worry about it being
at home."

292
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,550
But what we fail to recognize,

293
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,779
is a globalization and the internet,

294
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,730
brought the adversary right into our television,

295
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,290
in our [inaudible].

296
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,710
Or the internet,

297
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,710
we don't want to see [inaudible].

298
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,710
The internet.

299
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,230
And so, we're off defending our families,

300
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,060
and our families are slowly

301
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,640
being influenced by these economic,

302
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,390
financial, and informational ties.

303
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,390
Well, so in the book,

304
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,420
you really make it out that China

305
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,260
has it in for the United States.

306
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Why is that?

307
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,360
Well, they have it in for the constitution,

308
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,850
because if you read Document Number Nine,

309
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,620
it really talks about those ideas of freedom
of speech,

310
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,140
and freedom of religion, freedom from oppression.

311
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,610
This real idea that you can make your own
future,

312
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,550
is antithetical to the desires

313
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,860
of the Chinese Communist Party,

314
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,050
which is to maintain

315
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,430
its totalitarian rule over China.

316
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,750
And so, one of the things they recognize

317
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,220
during the Tiananmen Massacre,

318
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,390
is this is a very viral idea.

319
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,329
Once it gets instantiated, you can't stop
it.

320
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:26,100
And so, you have to inoculate the society.

321
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,389
The way you inoculate the society,

322
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,070
is you teach them from kindergarten,

323
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,660
every single grade level,

324
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,329
about the importance of the Chinese Communist
Party,

325
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,449
how the West is evil,

326
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:37,589
how the Japanese are evil,

327
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:40,550
and how we've had the century of humiliation.

328
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,649
And then, you bombard them.

329
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:42,649
First of all,

330
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:44,640
you protect him with a great firewall,

331
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,750
then you bombard them with media,

332
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,060
and social media-

333
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
Patriotic education.

334
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Patriotic education.

335
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,709
You've got an app now that that watches you,

336
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:53,490
while you watch it.

337
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,750
And you have to learn everything you can

338
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,920
about the Chinese Communist Party.

339
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,870
Meanwhile, all that's been curated

340
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,170
to take out any sort of history,

341
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,000
that would give you some kind of counter narrative

342
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,710
that says, "Hey Mao killed tens of millions
of people.

343
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,070
And, we had this thing called the Cultural
Revolution,

344
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,530
where we broke all ties with the past,

345
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,320
and history has been rewritten."

346
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,149
None of this that the Chinese people know.

347
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,149
Take that back.

348
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:19,149
The ones that know,

349
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,899
are the ones that are tasked to sensor

350
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,149
the people on social media.

351
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,519
So, it's interesting to see those people

352
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,829
when they learn about the Tiananmen Square.

353
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,700
Some people interviewed them and they said,

354
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,620
"Well, did you go home and tell your family?"

355
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
"Oh no, no.

356
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,830
I don't want to start rumors."

357
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,860
So, it's really interesting how...

358
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,200
By the way, that model of teaching the censors

359
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,130
what to censor, is exactly replicated in Facebook.

360
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,720
It's replicated in Twitter.

361
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,600
So the business models,

362
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,430
of the open data system,

363
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,040
are replicated in the West and in China.

364
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,470
In the West, they're for profit ostensibly,

365
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,750
but in China they're for profit and control.

366
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,750
And what's happening,

367
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,270
is there's a convergence in these two models.

368
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,280
And particularly, that's what 5G is about.

369
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,110
It's about converging these two models,

370
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,680
and about the China's model,

371
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,320
becoming ascendant in that competition.

372
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,190
Because the 4G world was about the smart phone,

373
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,750
the 5G world's really about the internet,
as thing.

374
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,070
So, rather than saying,

375
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,560
"Hey, I want to get on my phone and get an
Uber,"

376
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,029
you walk out the front door of this building,

377
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,500
and you say, "Uber."

378
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,760
And it shows up,

379
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,340
because the camera picked up your face.

380
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,509
Now, all of that data of everything

381
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,769
that you do walking around the city,

382
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,959
is going to be controlled by,

383
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,550
perhaps an American tech company,

384
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,190
but I would venture to say,

385
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,050
it may be Baidu, Ali Baba or Tencent,

386
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,509
that is taking that back to China.

387
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,139
Now, you might say,

388
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,399
"Oh, this is complete bogus stuff

389
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,019
made up by a general that wants

390
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,381
to get everybody worked up.

391
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:55,110
I was going to say it was Uber terrifying.

392
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,740
Well, it is Uber terrifying,

393
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,899
but the fact is Samantha Hoffman,

394
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,279
a researcher at Australian Strategic Policy
Institute,

395
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,480
recently came out with a paper called,

396
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,730
Engineering Global Consent.

397
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,089
And it talks about Global Tone Communication
Corporation,

398
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,420
GTCOM for short.

399
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,430
Now, what does GTCOM do?

400
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,709
It does translation services in 65 different
languages.

401
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,240
It labels itself, a big data and AI company.

402
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,620
And in order to do translation in 65 languages,

403
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,250
it collects two to three petabytes of data
per year.

404
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,700
Now, the interesting thing about

405
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,560
Global Tone Communication Corporation,

406
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,620
is it's jointly owned by the Ministry of Finance,

407
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,040
and the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist
Party.

408
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Oh, my God.

409
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,350
So, the two to three petabytes of data,

410
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,600
and this is by the way on their own website,

411
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,829
goes to the intelligence arm of

412
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,480
the People's Liberation Army,

413
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,400
and the propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist
Party.

414
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,210
So, this is what we face in the 5G world.

415
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,019
The Chinese Communist Party really was smart
about this,

416
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,040
because they saw the United States dominate
the 4G world,

417
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,569
by coming up with a platform, the smartphone,

418
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,199
and being the second country in the world

419
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,250
to build the network.

420
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,670
The 5G network is the platform itself.

421
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,949
So the smartphone goes away.

422
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,329
The camera that you talk into

423
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:08,750
when you go out the front door,

424
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,670
and all of these machines,

425
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,930
the Internet of Things,

426
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,420
becomes the things that collect data about
you,

427
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,750
to make your life more convenient,

428
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,509
but also makes it very easy

429
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,990
to know exactly who you are,

430
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,639
and what you do.

431
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,089
So, if this technology is built by Chinese
companies,

432
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,199
that's the Chinese Communist Party

433
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,279
having an all seeing eye, globally.

434
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,520
Well, that's the brilliance of what they did,

435
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,329
because now, companies like AT&T,

436
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:35,230
and Verizon who've not instituted,

437
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,170
or given one recommendation to 3GPP,

438
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:43,220
which is industry standard's making body,
for 5G,

439
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,210
is completely dominated by the Chinese Communist
Party.

440
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,640
Not only the standards for 5G,

441
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,250
but the underlying patented technology for
5G.

442
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,910
So, if you're Samsung, Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei,
or ZTE,

443
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,190
it really doesn't matter if you're building
a 3GPP network,

444
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,149
you're building a Chinese network.

445
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,850
So, if this works,

446
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,130
China will have successfully taken over the
world,

447
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,130
without anybody knowing,

448
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,970
without a single shot being fired.

449
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,890
And it's really because we in the West,

450
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,220
stopped investing in ourselves.

451
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,180
We stopped investing in infrastructure,

452
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,810
we stopped investing in our industrial base,

453
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,320
we stopped investing in STEM education,

454
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,300
we stopped investing in basic science and
research,

455
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,380
research and development.

456
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,600
We just stopped.

457
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,830
We stopped taking care of our own people.

458
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,670
So, how is it that you have figured out all
of this,

459
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,560
and yet there's still the think tanks,

460
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,400
business leaders, politicians,

461
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,690
Democrats and Republicans,

462
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,790
how are you seeing this,

463
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,790
but they aren't?

464
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,480
So I had a team, and I was at a group of

465
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,930
fellow officers in the Pentagon from 2014
to 2016,

466
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,420
that really started to uncover this.

467
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,060
And frankly, the Defense Department

468
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,140
decided to put some resources to it,

469
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,110
and we started this office called

470
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,350
the Office of Commercial and Economic Analysis,

471
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,170
so that we could get analysis on what was
going on.

472
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,360
And so, it's just spread.

473
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,620
Once you start to peel back the layers of
the onion,

474
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,510
you start to realize that it's quite frankly,

475
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,490
pervasive across all society.

476
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,450
And so, once you start on that path,

477
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,200
I learn something every single day

478
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,900
about what the Chinese Communist Party is
doing,

479
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,930
and how deep their infiltration

480
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,200
in democratic societies goes.

481
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,410
But, it's almost like the...

482
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,600
You remember the scene in The Matrix,

483
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,950
where are you going to take the red pill,

484
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,360
or are you going to take the blue pill?

485
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm very familiar that with the Matrix.

486
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,790
Most people want the blue pill.

487
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,510
They don't want the red pill.

488
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,660
And because if you take the red pill,

489
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,990
you have to realize that it's time

490
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,410
to stand up and fight for the survival of
freedom,

491
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,050
and the United States.

492
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,050
I'm slightly overwhelmed.

493
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,150
So, clearly Democrats and Republicans

494
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,530
have dropped the ball on this.

495
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,260
Is a solution going to take Democrats

496
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,100
and Republicans working together?

497
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,880
Oh, absolutely.

498
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
It's never going to happen.

499
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
We're screwed.

500
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
Just like, just like in the Soviet Union,

501
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
the good thing is,

502
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,730
I walk the halls of Congress,

503
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,210
and the one issue that you get

504
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,920
congressmen and senators agree on,

505
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,190
is we need to do something about

506
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,620
the Chinese Communist Party.

507
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,240
And so, I think once Americans understand...

508
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
We're a free country,

509
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,100
and people can think for themselves.

510
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,940
Once they're presented with logical,

511
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,800
fact-based arguments that aren't covered

512
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
with a smoke screen,

513
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,860
which is what this Stealth War is about.

514
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,360
It's about hiding everything that they do.

515
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,190
Then they can begin to make their own decisions.

516
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,190
They can say,

517
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,420
"Hey, we don't have to send our retirement
funds to China.

518
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,050
We don't have to not have tariffs on Chinese
products,

519
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,490
which are basically designed to balance a
playing field.

520
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,240
We don't have to have our kids be censored

521
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,870
in our own universities,

522
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,810
because we have so many Chinese students

523
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,060
and we have these Confucius Institutes

524
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,120
and Chinese Student Associations,

525
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,160
which are designed to stifle speech

526
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,840
in our university system.

527
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
We can take back control of our country.

528
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,820
So, you say your book is not to sound an alarm,

529
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,400
but it's a call to arms.

530
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,520
What do you mean by that?

531
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,780
I mean that if America is to survive,

532
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,270
and what I mean by that is if it's going to
continue

533
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,690
as a Democratic Constitutional Republic,

534
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,190
then Americans are going to have to stand
up

535
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,190
and fight for it.

536
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,020
It's not going to be given to you free.

537
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,360
It's not going to be handed to your children,

538
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,400
and your grandchildren for free.

539
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Our founding fathers had to fight for it.

540
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,390
Along the 240 plus years of our existence,

541
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,940
people had to stand up and fight.

542
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,590
The fight is just different this time,

543
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,770
and you don't have to go pick up a weapon

544
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,820
and go fight in some far away land.

545
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,660
You have to fight for democracy right here
at home,

546
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,910
by recognizing that democracy here is under
assault.

547
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,250
Look at what happened with the NBA.

548
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,580
It's clear as day,

549
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,870
if you choose to look at it.

550
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,380
So in a way, we're already in World War 3?

551
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,170
We are in World War 3,

552
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,630
and you are in the front lines.

553
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,500
I am now in the front lines.

554
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,790
When I had a uniform on,

555
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,690
I was working in the government.

556
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,830
I wasn't really paying attention.

557
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,890
But now, I'm fully woke

558
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,450
and I'm taking up the battle cry,

559
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,600
and this is one of the ways that I'm doing
it.

560
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,201
Well, thank you so much for joining us,

561
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,090
and for writing an incredible book.

562
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,740
Once again, the book is Stealth War:

563
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,130
How China Took Over While America's Elite
Slept.

564
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,030
We'll put a link in the description below.

565
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,030
Be sure to check it out.

566
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,030
It's a great book.

567
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,040
Thank you so much for joining me today.

568
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,580
Great to be here.

569
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,240
Thank you.

570
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,680
Welcome to the battle.
