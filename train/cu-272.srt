00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,930
I know how much you trust the label Made in
China.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,410
Well, that same great quality is soon coming
to

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,260
the drugs you get at your local pharmacy.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,520
And you might not have a choice

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,980
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,089
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,939
China wants to sell drugs to Americans.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,089
I mean, sure,

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,359
they’re already selling drugs to Americans.

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,029
But I’m talking about selling legit drugs,
like vaccines.

12
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,460
And not just to Americans, but to the entire
world.

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,040
It’s part of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s
plan called Made in China 2025.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,410
The goal is to make you have the opposite
reaction

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,730
to Made in China that you do right now.

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,300
According to this report from the US Chamber
of Commerce,

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,760
China’s goal for 2020 is to have “at least
100 pharmaceutical enterprises

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,750
obtain US, EU, Japanese, World Health Organization
authentication

19
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,690
and achieve product export.”

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,980
Plus get “3-5 new biotech drugs, complete
drug registration in Europe,

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,370
[the] US and other developed nations,

22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,960
[and] speed up the development of internationalization
of

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,680
domestically produced drugs.”

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,760
In other words, get the world to buy drugs
Made in China.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,450
And before 2020,

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,880
their goal is to take over 90% of generic
drug production.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,220
But there’s a problem:

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,900
That is, that initial gut reaction you had
to “made in China,”

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,200
is still the right reaction to have right
now.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,150
You see, drugs made in China have been known
to have a few problems.

31
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,360
Earlier this month,

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,270
a Chinese pharmaceutical company recalled

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,110
a heart drug it sold in the US because...

34
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,270
it may cause cancer.

35
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,240
“European regulators said the problem likely
dates

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,360
to changes in manufacturing processes

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,150
at Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical in 2012,

38
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,659
suggesting that many patients could potentially

39
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,900
have been exposed to cancer risk.”

40
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,780
I mean, heart disease or cancer.

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,310
It’s like the world’s worst choose your
own adventure novel.

42
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,399
The drug is called Valsartan.

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,800
It was one of those blockbuster drugs that
went off patent

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,880
and a Chinese pharmaceutical company

45
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,540
started producing a generic version.

46
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,290
And this has been a bad month for Chinese
drug makers.

47
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,290
Because now...

48
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,670
“...Police in China are probing Chinese
biotech firm

49
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,530
Changsheng Bio-technology for allegedly faking
documents

50
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,760
related to a rabies vaccine given to babies.”

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,950
Now I know what you’re thinking,

52
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,980
babies with rabies?

53
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,150
Is that really a thing?

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,700
Well, I think it was the inspiration for this
statue in Norway.

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,819
The rabies vaccine was part of a state-sponsored
vaccine program,

56
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,660
using vaccines specifically from Changsheng
Bio-technology.

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,900
Only one problem though.

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,320
Well, several problems.

59
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,520
One is that Changsheng

60
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,510
had given out more than a hundred thousand
doses

61
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,080
of a rabies vaccine for which it falsified
data.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,160
Another is, it had to recall more than

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,800
a quarter million other faulty DPT vaccines.

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,640
And also, according to internal documents,

65
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,090
Changsheng sold vaccines worth about 5 million
dollars

66
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,660
to “more than ten countries like India,
Cambodia, Nigeria,

67
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,880
Egypt, Belarus and some other European, African,

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,240
Middle Eastern and South American countries.”

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,900
Though there is no indication that any of
the bad vaccines

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,519
were shipped to those countries.

71
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,430
So far, 15 people have been arrested in the
scandal,

72
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,390
including the chairwoman of Changsheng.

73
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,550
The scandal was first exposed by an anonymous
post on WeChat.

74
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,560
It was quickly deleted by Chinese censors
of course,

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,900
but it lives on through the Ethereum blockchain.

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,100
“The incident has sparked one of the country’s

77
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,430
largest public outcries in years,

78
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,000
one that officials and censors have struggled
to contain.”

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,409
But that doesn’t mean they didn’t try!

80
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,409
According to Weiboscope,

81
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,489
a censorship monitoring project at the University
of Hong Kong,

82
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,340
“vaccine” was one of the most restricted
words

83
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,930
on the Chinese version of Twitter.

84
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,470
After all, as my favorite Chinese state-run
media the Global Times said,

85
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,280
“If nothing is done to manage online public
discourse,

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,650
it could become a festering gateway leading
the country

87
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,160
towards chaos and creating serious unpredictability.”

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,530
Wow, a festering gateway?

89
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,699
Sounds like the Chinese internet could use
a vaccination.

90
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,620
State-run People’s Daily said the bad vaccines
were safe,

91
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,550
just ineffective.

92
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,550
What a relief!

93
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,290
“Safe” means the vaccines didn’t directly
cause harm.

94
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,460
Not “safe” as in you thought you were
immunized for a disease

95
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,669
that you’re actually still in danger of
getting.

96
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,690
Even so, people found out about it, and were
not happy.

97
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,060
Things that hurt kids tend to generate a lot
of outrage in China.

98
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,710
In fact, the outrage has been so intense,

99
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,930
Chinese leader Xi Jinping had to respond directly,

100
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,580
which almost never happens.

101
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,940
One Chinese woman called them all devils in
hell, which is really rude.

102
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,070
While others were kind of beaten down by the
futility of it all.

103
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,520
“If we can’t even guarantee the basics
of vaccine protection

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,540
for our children,

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,040
is there any difference between getting a
vaccine or not?

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,940
(Getting one) may even affect your kid’s
health.”

107
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,070
“Why is this such a long-term problem?

108
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,000
(There’ve been similar health scares) in
2003, 2006, and 2013.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,830
This has happened many times in China.”

110
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,930
Just for clarity, 2003 was when the Chinese
Communist Party

111
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,810
tried to cover up the deadly outbreak of SARS.

112
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,240
2006 I’m pretty sure refers to the beginning
of what became

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,169
the 2008 tainted milk scandal,

114
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:42,889
when officials tried to cover up the tainted
milk powder

115
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,270
that killed 6 infants and sickened 300,000
others.

116
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,229
And 2013 might refer to when seven babies
died

117
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,900
after getting a bad hepatitis vaccine...

118
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,480
although after an investigation,

119
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,900
Chinese officials said the deaths were unrelated
to the vaccines.

120
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,580
She should have been a bit more specific.

121
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,960
And really, she should have also mentioned
the 2010 case

122
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,789
of unrefrigerated vaccines that killed four
children.

123
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,550
Or the time in 2015 when hundreds of children

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,889
were sickened by expired vaccines.

125
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:17,570
Or the giant scandal in 2016,

126
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,139
...that involved 24 provinces, 29 pharmaceutical
firms,

127
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,169
16 health departments, and more than 300 officials.

128
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,660
In that incident, a woman was selling expired
vaccines

129
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,539
that she bought for cheap from a bunch of
licensed

130
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,320
and unlicensed agents, and then—

131
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
with the help of local officials—

132
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,699
sold them across China.

133
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,380
Police discovered the stash of expired vaccines

134
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,930
in an unrefrigerated abandoned factory.

135
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,270
And then the government took action—

136
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,350
by covering it up for a year.

137
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,979
I mean yes,

138
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,300
this woman could have mentioned those other
times,

139
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,889
but there’s so many, who can keep track?

140
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,660
But remember,

141
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,449
China wants to sell vaccines around the world

142
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,889
as part of the Made in China 2025 plan.

143
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,229
The problem is,

144
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:11,100
now people in China don’t even want to buy
Chinese vaccines.

145
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,240
And that’s why Chinese state-run media wants
you to know:

146
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,940
Chinese vaccines are definitely safe.

147
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,669
“Are China’s vaccines safe?

148
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,660
Amid widespread public concern and questions
from the media

149
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,770
the World Health Organization expressed

150
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,240
its confidence in China’s vaccines.”

151
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,610
“The Chinese National Regulatory Authority
for Vaccines

152
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,259
is known to regulate at international standards.”

153
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,600
So, I guess the World Health Organization

154
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,960
is going to be on board with China selling
vaccines around the world.

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,120
That sounds...great.

156
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,330
So how do you feel about China’s plan to
sell you vaccines?

157
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,650
Well, guess what?

158
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,070
No one cares.

159
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,270
Because of how the pharmaceutical industry
works,

160
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,919
you usually have no idea where your drugs
are actually manufactured.

161
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,199
You just pick up the prescription at a pharmacy.

162
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,300
So...if that bothers you,

163
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,020
you might want to be concerned about China
becoming,

164
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,110
“a major player in the global pharmaceutical
industry.”

165
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,110
And before you go,

166
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,250
it’s that time on the show when I answer
a question

167
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,440
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

168
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,039
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

169
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,040
Spartaner 251 asks, “hey Chris,

170
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,479
what's the situation on the indian - chinese
border ?”

171
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,669
Great!

172
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,870
The border is great.

173
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,410
The border is very tranquil.

174
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,059
As I’m sure you saw on last week’s episode,

175
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,860
the Chinese military has built a potential
nuclear missile garrison

176
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,479
in Sichuan province,

177
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,440
not too far from the border between China
and India.

178
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,520
At least it’s not far, as the missile flies.

179
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,449
And, according to a US official,

180
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,869
but denied by the Indian government,

181
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:52,269
China may be resuming activity in that disputed
territory.

182
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:53,689
In any event,

183
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:55,170
you ought to stay tuned to China Uncensored

184
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,670
to find out if anything big happens.

185
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,360
