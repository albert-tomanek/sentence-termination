1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,780
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,100
don’t look a gift from the Communist Party
in the mouth.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,019
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,070
This woman committed a terrible crime.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,079
She married a writer.

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,880
You’d think that would be punishment enough.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,899
But that isn’t just the punchline of a bad
joke.

9
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:27,050
Artist Liu Xia was kept under house arrest
for 8 years

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,489
because she was married to prominent Chinese
dissident,

11
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,080
writer, and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Liu
Xiaobo.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,520
That’s it.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,660
That was her crime.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,680
“Her only crime was that she never gave
up on her late husband,

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,580
and she paid a dear price for her love for
Liu Xiaobo,

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,660
who died last year of lung cancer, while still
in custody.”

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,890
And if 8 years of house arrest doesn’t sound
that bad to you,

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,520
imagine being locked in your house for 8 years,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,270
in a country with no Facebook, YouTube, Twitter,
or Netflix.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,690
Now that’s torture.

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,000
But what am I saying?

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,440
Liu Xia has been free this whole time,

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,199
according to the Communist Party.

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,649
Doesn’t she seem like a free woman,

25
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,319
whispering in a reporter’s ear about how
the authorities

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,759
can hear everything in her apartment?

27
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,149
But now, after tons of international pressure,

28
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:19,520
the Communist Party has allowed Liu Xia to
leave China for Berlin.

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,530
Obviously they didn’t let her leave because
of international pressure.

30
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,609
China’s foreign minister gave a different
explanation.

31
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,350
“China’s Foreign Ministry said Liu Xia

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,880
had travelled to Germany for medical treatment.”

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,380
Oh, that makes sense.

34
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:45,840
Because there are no hospitals in China.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,530
Now correlation doesn’t always mean causation...

36
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,139
but that top level Communist Party official’s
visit to Germany

37
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:56,639
just maybe had something to do with Liu Xia’s
sudden freedom.

38
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,469
Germany has been pushing for Liu Xia’s release
for a while.

39
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,270
In fact, German Chancellor Angela Merkel personally
brought it up

40
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,689
with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

41
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,320
Apparently told her “maybe”,

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,350
if she kept it hush-hush.

43
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,720
Well, they did finally release Liu Xia.

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,640
And it comes ahead of an EU-China summit next
week.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,300
You see, the Chinese Communist Party is dealing
with

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,510
the US-China trade war.

47
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,980
And making nice with Germany and the EU

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,110
might provide the Party the economic lifeline
it needs.

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,240
As Quartz puts it, “Given the troublesome
relations with the US,

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,430
China needs to put effort into winning over
Germany...

51
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,290
Allowing Liu [Xia] to travel to Germany was
a concession

52
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,510
from a China that wants to be recognized

53
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,100
as a responsible global player.”

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,280
And really, don’t you think we should applaud

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,280
the Chinese Communist Party for doing the
right thing?

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,220
It’s so generous of them to let Liu Xia,

57
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,560
who did nothing wrong in the first place,

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,530
leave the country as a gesture of goodwill

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,210
during their talks with Germany and the EU.

60
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,020
The same talks where Chinese officials will
try to convince

61
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,010
Germany and the EU to stand with China,

62
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,640
against the US.

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Such compassion.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
But wait!

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,070
“Chris,” you ask,

66
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,130
“Now that Liu Xia is free,

67
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,780
won’t she become an outspoken dissident?”

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,761
Ah, that kind of simple thinking is why you
are not

69
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:21,420
in charge of your own Marxist-Leninist authoritarian
state.

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,870
See, Liu Xia’s brother is still in China.

71
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,900
Although he tried,

72
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,630
he was not allowed to leave with her.

73
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,180
And if Liu Xia knows what’s good for her
brother,

74
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,200
she’ll keep her fool mouth shut.

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,540
And in case you thought Liu Xia’s release

76
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,350
means the Chinese Communist Party

77
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,190
is turning over a new leaf,

78
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,040
well, the next day,

79
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,150
they sentenced a democracy activist to 13
years in prison.

80
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,910
The Party wouldn’t want you to think they’re
getting soft.

81
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,960
So what do you think about the Communist Party’s

82
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
generous release of Liu Xia?

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Leave your comments below.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
And before you go,

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,640
it’s that time when we answer questions

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,930
from fans who support China Uncensored

87
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,000
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,010
SciNerdGirl asks

89
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,660
“Have you ever eaten ‘Stinky’ Tofu?

90
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,130
Does it really smell as bad as they say?”

91
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,280
Ah, the tough questions.

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,440
Have I eaten stinky tofu?

93
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,239
Yes, and I’ll never forget it.

94
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,650
For those of you who don’t know,

95
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,780
stinky tofu is fermented tofu.

96
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,270
Meaning...it’s stinky.

97
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,650
Some people really love it.

98
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,650
Not me.

99
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,260
I had it for the first time in Shilin Night
Market in Taipei.

100
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,930
That’s the capital of Taiwan province, China.

101
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,810
There were many strange foods there I really
enjoyed,

102
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,910
like giant deep fried squid,

103
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,520
and even pig blood sausage.

104
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,900
But the stinky tofu?

105
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,639
Well, let’s just say I’d prefer durian.

106
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
What’s that, Shelley?

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,760
Stinky tofu is amazing?

108
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,040
We’ll have to agree to disagree.

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,680
Thanks for the question SciNerdGirl.

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
By the way,

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,310
if you’re really a sci-nerd,

112
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,440
I recommend reading the Three Body Problem.

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,990
Excellent Chinese science fiction.

114
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,710
And for all of you, remember,

115
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,180

So check back frequently.

130
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,030
But I’ve heard from many fans

131
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,611
that YouTube won’t notify you,

132
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,460
even if you have notifications on.

133
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,460
Come on Google,

134
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,060
that’s not nice.
