1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,859
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:05,100
10 movie remakes you won’t be seeing from
Hollywood.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,759
Sponsored by a Hong Kong film

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,800
that Hollywood would never allow.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,660
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,090
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,910
Hollywood loves remakes.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,090
They’re seen as less risky investments—

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,750
compared to actually coming up with original
ideas.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,050
Which explains why there have been

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,029
12 different Batman movies and counting.

12
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,520
Or take Karate Kid,

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,620
the beloved 1984 classic that taught the virtues

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,620
of waxing both on and off.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,149
But a few decades pass,

16
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:40,309
and it’s time to make more money.

17
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,949
So Sony Pictures decided to do

18
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:44,879
a Karate Kid remake in 2010

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,190
that taught the virtues

20
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,309
of sucking up to the Chinese regime—

21
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,420
because China has the second largest

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,659
movie market in the world.

23
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,179
They did this by, for example,

24
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,199
by setting the remake in Beijing instead of
Los Angeles.

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,199
And...What?

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,239
Don’t you know that everyone practices kung
fu

27
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,239
on the Great Wall?

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,140
It’s only a two-hour drive from Beijing.

29
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,960
Also, can I just say,

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
as someone who who does

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,920
actual Kung Fu every morning,

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,020
Kung Fu is not the same as Karate.

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,490
But don’t worry,

34
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,240
it was only called the Karate Kid in the US,

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,229
in order to suck nostalgia dollars from our
wallets.

36
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,229
In China, t

37
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,570
he movie was called The Kung Fu Dream.

38
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,570
But anyway,

39
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,810
Hollywood did what it had to do

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,210
to reach the Chinese market,

41
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,899
even if it meant casting Jackie Chan

42
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,380
as the Mr. Miyagi character,

43
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,420
seen here beating up children in the courtyard.

44
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,999
He then goes on to lecture the kids about

45
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,780
why Chinese people shouldn’t have freedom.

46
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,109
Ok, that was a joke.

47
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,939
But since Jackie Chan is now appearing

48
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,149
in Communist Party propaganda videos

49
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,240
that play before every movie that’s shown
in China,

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,329
it’s not that far off.

51
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,700
But sucking up the Chinese regime

52
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,149
is a relatively new phenomenon in Hollywood.

53
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,950
There was a time when movie studios

54
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,369
didn’t care about the Chinese market.

55
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,100
But these days, well,

56
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,100
some of those movies

57
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,619
will never get Hollywood remakes—

58
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,249
because it would cost studios access to that
precious,

59
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:07,119
precious Chinese market.

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
So here’s ten movies that will not be getting
remakes.

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,510
Number 10: The Mask of Fu Manchu
​

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,340
There were several films about the evil Fu
Manchu,

63
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,540
a character created by British author Sax
Rohmer.

64
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,319
But The Mask of Fu Manchu is considered

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,620
the worst-slash-best—

66
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,360
depending on how you look at it.

67
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,780
Let’s see, there’s racist slurs.

68
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,220
“You hideous yellow monster!”

69
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,959
There’s the Chinese bad guy played by a
white actor.

70
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,860
And the whole terrible depiction of Chinese
people in general.

71
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,460
“Then conquer and breed!

72
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,360
Kill the white man, and take his women!”

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,020
Even during its original release in 1932,

74
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,340
the Chinese government launched a formal complaint

75
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,120
through its US Embassy.

76
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,860
Not that Hollywood cared at the time.

77
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,159
They were too busy making movies

78
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,380
for the German market.

79
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,420
Number 9: Macao

80
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,000
When this movie was released in 1952,

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,549
Macau was still a Portuguese territory.

82
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,019
And it was no stranger to gambling,

83
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,569
prostitution, and all the exciting corruption

84
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,180
that goes along with it.

85
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,290
Just like today under Chinese rule.

86
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,290
But now, of course,

87
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,180
Macau’s dark underbelly is more embarrassing,

88
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,200
since it’s frequented by corrupt Chinese

89
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,939
political and business leaders

90
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,340
laundering their ill-gotten gains.

91
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,290
So this one’s probably not getting remade.

92
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,150
Number 8: The Sand Pebbles

93
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,739
This film takes place on the Yangtze River
in China in 1926.

94
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,740
It involves an American crew aboard the fictional
USS Pablo.

95
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,210
But during its filming in the early 1960s,

96
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,140
Mao Zedong was busy killing millions of people,

97
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,550
and foreigners weren’t exactly welcomed
in China.

98
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,860
So it was filmed mainly in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

99
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,580
It was nominated for eight Oscars,

100
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,750
including best actor for Steve McQueen.

101
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,799
But despite being a great film,

102
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,140
its depiction of American gunboat diplomacy
of the era

103
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,560
means this story will never be remade by Hollywood.

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,359
Number 7: Year of the Dragon

105
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,380
This film was about a New York City detective

106
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,120
fighting gangsters in Chinatown.

107
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,210
Some loved it; some hated it.

108
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,850
But objectively, it flopped—

109
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,550
losing millions of dollars in theaters.

110
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,970
But that’s not why Year of the Dragon

111
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,600
won’t be remade by Hollywood.

112
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,570
It’s because of complaints from the Chinese
community

113
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,180
about racial slurs, and the general depiction

114
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,550
of Chinese people as thugs, criminals, and
triads.

115
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,030
Sure, there are triad movies

116
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,100
made by Hong Kong directors,

117
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,940
but Chinese government draws the line

118
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,650
at foreigners airing their dirty laundry.

119
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,650
Literally,

120
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,150
I mean, since they censored a scene

121
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,770
in Mission Impossible III

122
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,060
when Tom Cruise walked past laundry

123
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,570
hanging from balconies in Shanghai.

124
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,310
Number 6: Big Trouble in Little China

125
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,470
The Chinatown-themed movie also flopped

126
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,530
when it was released,

127
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,720
but it has since become a cult classic.

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,630
Sure, there was some talk about a remake

129
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,950
a few years ago,

130
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,390
starring the Rock.

131
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,500
But I doubt that’s going to happen.

132
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,380
Is it because of China’s current box office
clout a

133
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,720
nd Hollywood’s aversion to offending Beijing?

134
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
Nah.

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,260
Two words: Chinese wizards.

136
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,630
Although now that I think of it,

137
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,470
if anyone could defeat Chinese wizards

138
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,070
to get the movie made,

139
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,780
it would be the Rock.

140
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
But even the Rock

141
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,040
couldn’t get this movie shown in China.

142
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,570
Chinese villains and making fun of Chinese
culture

143
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,720
is a total nonstarter,

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,700
regardless of the intentional buffoonery.

145
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,430
I don’t know if you’ve noticed,

146
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,430
but the Chinese Communist Party

147
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,980
doesn’t exactly have a sense of humor.

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,380
Number 5: The Last Emperor

149
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,660
This film won all nine Oscars it was nominated
for,

150
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,820
and pulled in $109 million at the global box
office.

151
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,660
It was based on the life of Puyi,

152
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,690
the boy who became emperor

153
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,060
of the Qing Dynasty at age 3,

154
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,520
and died during the Communist Party’s

155
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
Cultural Revolution.

156
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,710
Amazingly, the production got the official
blessing

157
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,940
of the Chinese government at the time.

158
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,220
But this was in the mid-80s,

159
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,040
when China seemed to be reforming

160
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,560
and its leaders were craving international
recognition.

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,020
The Tiananmen Square massacre a couple years
later

162
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,150
pretty much erased all those efforts.

163
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,660
A remake of this story

164
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,320
in today’s hyper-sensitive Chinese political
environment

165
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,810
would be problematic—

166
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,280
because, despite Puyi’s eventual loyalty

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,940
to the Communist Party,

168
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,860
the Party treated him pretty badly,

169
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,660
and no one wants embarrassing things like
the truth

170
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,970
to come out.

171
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,250
Number 4: Red Corner

172
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,250
In this film,

173
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,940
an American businessman visits Beijing

174
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,770
and is blackmailed for murder

175
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,190
by corrupt Chinese businessmen

176
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,560
and government officials.

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,780
It’s critical of the Chinese government,

178
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,620
plus it reinforces some of the sexist

179
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,050
Western stereotypes about Chinese women.

180
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,190
This is also one of the films

181
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,880
that got Richard Gere banned

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,180
from most Hollywood productions—

183
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,370
although his remarks at the 1993 Oscars

184
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,660
supporting human rights and the Dalai Lama

185
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,030
had already put him on many studios’ blacklists.

186
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,030
In Hollywood,

187
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,060
you’re free to criticize the US government
all you want,

188
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,490
but criticizing the Chinese Communist Party
is a no-go.

189
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,560
That’s why Hollywood studios are hesitant

190
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,030
to cast Richard Gere in any role these days.

191
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,490
They know that it will make it hard for them

192
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,660
to get their films shown in China.

193
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,490
Number 3: Seven Years in Tibet

194
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,500
This film is based on a true story.

195
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,660
It stars Brad Pitt as a heroic, sexy

196
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,900
Nazi?

197
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,400
Well, he was Austrian,

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,410
and he was cleared of any crimes.

199
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,410
But anyway,

200
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,410
he was trying to climb a mountain in the Himalayas

201
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,120
when World War II started,

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,810
and he spent pretty much the entire war

203
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,280
in a British POW camp in India,

204
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,770
until he escaped to Tibet in 1944.

205
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,810
Anyway, Brad Pitt—

206
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,080
I mean his character—

207
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
meets the Dalai Lama

208
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,460
and a lasting friendship ensues.

209
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
But the important part here

210
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,300
is that it shows the CCP’s benevolent “liberation”
of Tibet

211
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,640
as more of a brutal invasion.

212
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,780
That is way too accurate for Hollywood.

213
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,040
So yeah, this film is not going to get remade
anytime soon.

214
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,680
Number 2: Kundun

215
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,300
Another Tibet-related film,

216
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,840
released in the same year.

217
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,460
This one tracks 20-plus years

218
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,110
of the Dalai Lama’s life,

219
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,190
from childhood through when he flees Tibet

220
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,590
after the CCP’s “liberation”—

221
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,610
where he was liberated from his throne

222
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,060
and very nearly liberated from his life.

223
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,979
This one will also forever be banned in China,

224
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,660
and therefore Hollywood.

225
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,579
And Number 1: Spy Game
​

226
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:43,870
A-listers Robert Redford and Brad Pitt

227
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,330
ensured box office success for this spy thriller,

228
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,009
but when your third act climax

229
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,240
involves a US Navy SEAL team

230
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,819
landing on Chinese soil

231
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:55,339
to extract two American political prisoners

232
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,860
held by the People’s Liberation Army,

233
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
you know you’ll have problems

234
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,220
getting the film into Chinese theaters.

235
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,600
But of course back in 2001,

236
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,149
China’s box office was negligible,

237
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,410
so that wasn’t a major factor for Universal
Pictures.

238
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,660
If Spy Game were remade today,

239
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,819
the third act would probably involve North
Korea.

240
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:14,930
Like that terrible,

241
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,500
terrible remake of Red Dawn.

242
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,079
It was terrible.

243
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
Now I’m not saying Hollywood is bad.

244
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:24,050
I’m just saying...

245
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,649
it’s pure evil and feeds on the souls of
innocent children.

246
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,329
But no judgement here.

247
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:30,329
Unfortunately,

248
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:31,970
Hollywood has so much power,

249
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,649
that it’s hard for smaller movies to get
made—

250
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:36,410
even if they’re potentially really,

251
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,720
really awesome.

252
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,930
Which brings me to an indie film

253
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,560
that both the Chinese Communist Party

254
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,279
and Hollywood will censor:

255
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,810
“The Last Days of Hong Kong.”

256
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,139
The producer and I worked together

257
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,589
to bring you this episode.

258
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,160
“Last Days” is a political thriller

259
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,199
about a maverick private detective

260
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,209
who uncovers a plot that threatens

261
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,529
the lives of all Hong Kongers.

262
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,800
And it takes place on the eve

263
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,790
of Hong Kong’s complete turnover

264
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,160
to Chinese communist rule

265
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,500
in the year 2047.

266
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,579
Not only will this film anger the Communist
Party,

267
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,520
but it will also feature actors and artists

268
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,220
who’ve been blacklisted in China.

269
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,230
So it’s really not getting made by Hollywood.

270
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,420
And that’s why it needs your support.

to watch the teaser.

274
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,210
They’ve just launched a kickstarter campaign,

275
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,600
and if you can help them raise 500,000 HK
dollars—

276
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,840
which is about 64,000 US dollars—

277
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
by November 17,

278
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,889
it’ll actually get made.

279
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:33,240
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

280
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
