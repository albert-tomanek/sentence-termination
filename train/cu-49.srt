1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,209
China’s most dangerous bear

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,600
is Winnie the Pooh.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,360
Do you see a resemblance?

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,880
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,509
I’m Chris Chappell

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,410
China bans a lot of things.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,779
Like...a lot.

8
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:18,779
Facebook.

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:19,840
Falun Gong.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,670
Even, for a time, the letter N.

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,949
Yeah, that would make the Chinese version
of Sesame Street

12
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:28,029
a little awkward.

13
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,839
But that’s what happens when you live under
an authoritarian regime

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,960
with absolutely no freedom of speech.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,210
So is everyone’s favorite honey bear banned,
too?

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,390
Sort of. Sometimes.

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,390
It’s complicated.

18
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,609
It began back in 2013 when Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

19
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,730
met with US President Barack Obama.

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,579
Chinese internet users noticed

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,140
a more than passing resemblance.

22
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,140
The next year,

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,559
Xi Jinping met with Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe.

24
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,870
And this image got passed around.

25
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,610
And thus a meme was born.

26
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,929
Now it may surprise you,

27
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,270
but Communist leaders don’t always have

28
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,390
the best sense of humor.

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,350
Which is why Xi Jinping definitely didn’t
think this was funny.

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,390
And so Chinese censors began to remove comparisons

31
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,270
of Winnie the Pooh and Xi Jinping

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,090
from the Chinese Internet.

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,530
And they can actually do that,

34
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,390
because China has its own internet.

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,560
China’s technological overlords built

36
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,720
what’s referred to as “The Great Firewall”.

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,579
It separates China’s internet from the rest
of the world.

38
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,579
This is not to say that Winnie the Pooh is
outright banned.

39
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,930
But Winnie the Pooh is sometimes censored
or not,

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,040
depending on how he’s used,

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,469
and depending on the political situation.

42
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,590
For example, in 2015,

43
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,040
this became the most censored image on the
Chinese Internet.

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
In early 2018,

45
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,000
Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared himself
president for life.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,409
And Chinese netizens started posting this.

47
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,869
That was also censored.

48
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,500
In some ways, it’s hard to understand why
Xi Jinping

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,100
wouldn’t want to be compared to a loveable
cartoon bear.

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,380
It definitely could be worse.

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,400
Former leader Jiang Zemin has been compared
to a toad.

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,440
And the Minions from Despicable Me.

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,580
Maybe Xi doesn’t like being compared to
Pooh bear

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,510
because it triggers some deep insecurity he
has.

55
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,360
Like a traumatic childhood memory of being
sent to the countryside

56
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,090
to do forced labor without any honey.

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,740
Or a recurring nightmare where he’s giving
a big speech,

58
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,740
and he looks down...

59
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,950
and he’s not wearing any pants.

60
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,890
But it doesn’t matter *why* Xi Jinping

61
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,800
doesn’t like Winnie the Pooh.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,000
As leader of the un-free world,

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,380
he has the power to censor those Winnie the
Pooh comparisons.

64
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,980
And every time Chinese censors block Winnie
the Pooh,

65
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,450
it makes headlines outside China.

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,850
I mean, what a story, right?

67
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,780
China: the country that banned Winnie the
Pooh.

68
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,870
Except it’s not always true.

69
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,900
Like this story that claimed that Winnie the
Pooh

70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,030
was about to be removed from Shanghai’s
Disneyland.

71
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,950
But then definitely wasn’t.

72
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,980
And this story that movie theaters in China

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,110
were forbidden from showing the movie Christopher
Robin,

74
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,100
because one of the characters is Winnie the
Pooh.

75
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,450
But it could have also been blocked because
China

76
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,440
has a quota of foreign movies it lets in each
year,

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,590
and Christopher Robin simply didn’t make
the cut.

78
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,790
After all, you can still watch Winnie the
Pooh cartoons

79
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,140
on state-run China Central Television.

80
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,730
I mean, how else will the kids learn about

81
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,740
Winnie the Pooh Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.

82
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,390
So in summary:

83
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,390
Winnie the Pooh:

84
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,520
not banned in China.

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,010
Comparing Winnie the Pooh to Chinese leader
Xi Jinping?

86
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,820
Definitely banned in China.

87
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,850
Like in early 2019,

88
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,680
when a Taiwanese horror video game called
Devotion

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,270
had this little easter egg.

90
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,680
It says Xi Jinping Winnie-the-Pooh moron.

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,310
That got the game banned in China.

92
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,810
And then amazingly,

93
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,180
Steam banned the game internationally,

94
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,340
fearing a Chinese backlash.

95
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,730
Sadly, that would not be the last time Western
companies

96
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,500
decided to censor something s

97
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,600
o as not to hurt Xi Jinping’s sensitive
feelings.

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,519
But the damage is already done.

99
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,510
The more Chinese censors ban the comparison,

100
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,260
the more Winnie the Pooh is linked

101
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,130
in people’s minds with Xi Jinping.

102
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,970
Remember when Blizzard created a huge backlash

103
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,650
after banning a gamer for supporting Hong
Kong protests?

104
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,560
Well, when Blizzcon rolled around in November,

105
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,440
people showed up in Winnie the Pooh costumes.

106
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,580
That had nothing to do with Hong Kong,

107
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,090
but it was a great way to troll Xi Jinping.
And Blizzard.

108
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,410
And in the South Park episode,

109
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,070
Band in China, that came out in October,

110
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,460
they showed Winnie the Pooh in Chinese prison.

111
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,090
And then South Park joined Pooh

112
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,900
in being banned by Chinese censors.

113
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,930
But now, with the Hong Kong protests heating
up even more,

114
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,460
and anger at Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam,

115
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,040
There’s been a new addition to the Hundred
Acre Wood.

116
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,740
Poor Piglet.

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,760
So what do you think about

118
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,200
China’s Winnie the Pooh sort-of ban?

119
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,710
Leave your comments below.

120
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,690
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

121
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,260
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

122
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,080
see you next time.
