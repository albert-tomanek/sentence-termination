00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,590
Edward Snowden’s Autobiography Gets Censored
in China

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,269
Trump Promises He Won’t Say the word cheat

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,719
And a World Bank Deal in Xinjiang.

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,049
What could go wrong ?

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,500
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,710
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,110
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,970
This week’s China news headlines!

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,350
Edward Snowden.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,650
The former NSA whistleblower.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,300
Guess what?

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,770
He has some thoughts about democracy and privacy.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,800
But his new autobiography,

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Permanent Record,

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,120
seems to be missing those parts in the Chinese
edition.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,969
And I understand the Chinese Communist Party’s

17
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,820
dilemma here with the Chinese edition.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,260
On the one hand,

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,309
you have the autobiography of the guy

20
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,019
who exposed massive corruption in the United
States.

21
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,500
That’s good!

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,659
But, on the other hand

23
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,840
he advocates for democracy and Internet privacy.

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,449
That’s not so good.

25
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,280
But Snowden has come up with a novel solution.

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,579
He wants to crowdsource a corrected

27
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,840
and unabridged simplified Chinese version.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,430
To be published for free online.

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,890
Sure, he won’t make money off it.

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,890
But then again,

31
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,090
he wasn’t making money off the Chinese version
anyway.

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,570
China’s paramount leader is Xi Jinping.

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,390
His title is General Secretary of the Communist
Party.

34
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,320
He also gave himself the title of president,

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,060
but don’t call him *that*.

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,090
That’s what a Congressional panel recommends
in a new report.

37
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,119
Because calling Xi Jinping a president

38
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,930
makes it sound like there’s democracy in
China.

39
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,930
Thank you!

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,740
I’ve been saying this for years!!!

41
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,130
In fact, that’s why I came up with a new
word last year

42
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,649
to describe Xi Jinping.

43
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,130
He’s not a president,

44
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,259
he’s not a dictator,

45
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,679
he’s a presitator.

46
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,770
Presitator.

47
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,619
Put that one in your report.

48
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,220
On to US-China trade:

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,240
President Trump spoke at the Economic Club
of New York.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,590
And he says he’s got China right where he
wants them.

51
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,090
They are dying to make a deal.

52
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,790
We're the ones deciding whether or not

53
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,670
we want to make a deal.

54
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,940
We're close.

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,480
A significant phase 1 trade deal with China
could happen.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,860
But if that doesn’t happen,

57
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,120
then tariff man will...well, you know.

58
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,660
If we don't make a deal we're going to substantially
raise those tariffs.

59
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,989
No one has manipulated numbers better,

60
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,980
or taken advantage of the United States more,

61
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,680
and I won't use this word cheated,

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,519
I will not say the word cheated,

63
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,129
but nobody's cheated better than China,

64
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,550
but I will not say cheated.

65
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,700
Okay, everyone, that’s just between us.

66
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,210
Cheated is off the record, got it?

67
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,340
What is on the record, is this message to
China.

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,110
The US has sailed another warship through
the Taiwan Strait.

69
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,370
Which honestly is kind of a mixed signal.

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,360
Yeah, it shows that the US is ready to defend
their ally.

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,020
But it also means that if the US

72
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,030
can sail a warship through the Taiwan Strait,

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,850
China can too.

74
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,690
But China has bigger things to worry about.

75
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,180
For example, the plague.

76
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,500
Yes, the plague, as in the Black Death

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,420
that wiped out a third of Europe.

78
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,890
Now today, we have antibiotics that can treat
it.

79
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,519
And this was only two people.

80
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,459
According to Chinese authorities.

81
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,760
So that’s no reason to panic right?

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,750
Or, is it the perfect reason to panic?

83
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,470
Remember, this is the regime

84
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,640
that covered up the SARS Outbreak in 2003.

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,650
According to the New York Times,

86
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,890
“Fears are mounting in China over a possible
outbreak of the disease.”

87
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,760
“Residents are asking why the authorities
took so long

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,370
to diagnose and disclose the problem.”

89
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,560
Don’t worry, the problem was short lived.

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,769
Not the plague problem,

91
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,159
the people asking questions problem.

92
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,239
In good old SARS tradition,

93
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,939
Chinese censors ordered online news companies

94
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,909
to “block and control” online discussion.

95
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,689
And that my friends is how you breed an atmosphere
of paranoia.

96
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,260
This Australian researcher is struggling to
get his PhD.

97
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,560
And he blames China’s influence in Australia.

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,470
James Jing has been teaching at Perth’s
Curtin University for 12 years.

99
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,590
But according to the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation,

100
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,120
“He said he had spent years unsuccessfully
trying to convince

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,190
more senior members of Curtin's academic staff...

102
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,210
to supervise his research into censorship

103
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,900
and the Chinese social media platform WeChat.”

104
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,940
But they’ve never given their approval.

105
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,340
They haven’t rejected it either.

106
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,440
So Jing is in academic limbo.

107
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,389
I wonder why they wouldn’t want to sponsor

108
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,419
research into censorship and WeChat?

109
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,870
Could it have anything to do with the fact
that WeChat

110
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,740
sponsors events and programs at Curtin University?

111
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,610
Nah.

112
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,300
The World Bank is scaling back on a project
in China’s Xinjiang.

113
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,389
You know, the place where the Chinese Communist
Party

114
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,100
has built concentration camps for over a million
Uighur people.

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,600
And has sent men to sleep in the same beds
as Uighur women

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,240
while their husbands are in those concentration
camps.

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,790
Yeah, that Xinjiang.

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
There were allegations

119
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,810
that a 50 million dollar World Bank loan

120
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,320
would be used for these concentration camps.

121
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,210
The World Bank couldn’t confirm that,

122
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,210
but then decided that because of the risks
and difficulty

123
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,480
in monitoring how the money would be used,

124
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,889
“the scope and footprint of the project
is being reduced.”

125
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,400
Why the World Bank even considered giving
money

126
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,199
to a regime that has concentration camps is
beyond me.

127
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,990
Meanwhile, China Uncensored struggles to survive

128
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,020
because YouTube demonetizes pretty much every
video we make.

129
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,880
And the World Bank has not offered us even
one cent.

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,820
Maybe if I start putting people in concentration
camps...

131
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,000
But fortunately, I don’t need the World
Bank.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,920
I’ve got my wonderful China Uncensored 50
cent army,

133
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,460
fans who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

134
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,690
So as a thank you to them,

135
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,360
I answer a question from one of them

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,430
at the end of some of my episodes.

137
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,200
Today’s question comes from...Logan.

138
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,660
“How long did it take the West to forget
about

139
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,190
the Tiananmen Square massacre

140
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,520
and the subjugation of Tibet?

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,790
Was there any meaningful political actions
taken then?

142
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,340
How where those actions compared

143
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,830
to what is being done for Hong Kong now?”

144
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,160
I’m sorry to say,

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
the West forgot about the Tiananmen Square
massacre

146
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,630
almost immediately.

147
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,880
Well, not the people of the West.

148
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,810
The governments of the West.

149
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,630
Less than a month after the massacre,

150
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,919
then US president George Bush Senior

151
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:53,890
sent a secret delegation to China.

152
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,379
The goal was to continue the US relationship

153
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:58,289
with Chinese leaders.

154
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,520
Freeing Tibet, meanwhile,

155
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,600
was a big thing in the 1990s,

156
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,670
thanks to Richard Gere and the Beastie Boys.

157
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,599
Oh, and the Dalai Lama.

158
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,289
But then Hollywood realized

159
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,050
that China has 1.4 billion people.

160
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,590
And the Communist Party saw

161
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,960
that the same international community

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,349
that condemned the Tiananmen Square Massacre

163
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,340
and who called for a Free Tibet

164
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,590
had completely forgotten about it by the 2008
Beijing Olympics.

165
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,199
It taught the Party that they can literally
get away with murder,

166
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,550
and sooner or later,

167
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,949
the West will be on their doorstep,

168
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,710
ready for access to that sweet, sweet China
market.

169
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,060
It actually reminds me of what a guest

170
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,440
on our China Unscripted Podcast told me.

171
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,690
Captain Jim Fanell,

172
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,729
the Former Director of Intelligence and Information
Operations

173
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,710
for the U.S. Pacific Fleet,

174
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,180
talks about what he calls the “decade of
concern.”

175
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,610
The decade of concern is the idea

176
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,270
that sometime over the next decade,

177
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,050
China will invade Taiwan.

178
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,290
That way, by the 100 year anniversary

179
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,870
of the People’s Republic of China

180
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,740
rolls around in 2049,

181
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,569
there will have been time for the West

182
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,530
to have also forgotten about that—

183
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,120
and be eager to travel to Beijing for the
celebrations.

184
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,880
But Hong Kong may be changing this plan.

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,449
US lawmakers have passed legislation

186
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,340
supporting the Hong Kong protesters.

187
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,419
So maybe, at least the United States,

188
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,720
is beginning to wise up to

189
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,159
the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party.

190
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,520
Thanks for your question.

191
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,050
