1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,200
could I interest you in a set of beautiful,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
leather-bound,

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,330
pre-censored encyclopedias?

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,500
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,460
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,400
The Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,470
has a big problem on its hands.

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,300
Uh, I’m not talking about North Korea.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,390
Or a faltering economy either.

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,220
Or even children spending too much time on
their phones.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,080
I’m talking about Wikipedia.

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,349
Wikipedia simply refuses to take into consideration

14
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:36,579
the unique societal conditions of Chinese...society.

15
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,579
And by that I mean

16
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,760
they refuse to censor content.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,460
Wikipedia Co-Founder Jimmy Wales

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,909
has said he would rather have no Wikipedia
in China

19
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,130
than comply with any form of censorship.

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,130
Well Jimmy,

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,670
wishes do come true.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,530
Because when pesky Western companies

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,819
refuse to comply with draconian censorship
demands,

24
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:59,260
what’s a totalitarian regime gonna do?

25
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,790
Simply create their own knockoff!

26
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,909
The Chinese internet is like

27
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,970
a bizarro version of the global Internet.

28
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,350
Because the Chinese Communist Party has certain
things

29
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,280
that they would rather Chinese people

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,030
not know about,

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,510
many of the websites that we're used to seeing

32
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,390
on the rest of the Internet are blocked.

33
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,290
Like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

34
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,290
Don't worry,

35
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,730
China has its own censored versions of these.

36
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,730
And at long last,

37
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,860
the Chinese regime is coming out

38
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,160
with its own version of Wikipedia,

39
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,340
creatively named “Chinese Encyclopedia.”

40
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,070
And it will roll out sometime next year.

41
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,090
You see, the problem with Wikipedia

42
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,000
is that its content is generated

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,060
by the users themselves.

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,750
People around the world create, edit,

45
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,220
and re-edit the articles.

46
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,930
So people can post all kind of false information
about...

47
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,140
various squares...

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,960
and massacres that may or may not

49
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,930
have happened inside them.

50
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,110
The Chinese Encyclopedia gets around this
problem

51
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,250
because the government directly employed

52
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,920
“more than 20,000 authors from universities

53
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,410
and research institutes.”

54
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,220
So you can be sure,

55
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,910
the Chinese Encyclopedia won’t even

56
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,030
need to be censored.

57
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,220
Because it comes pre-censored!

58
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,209
Like those bags of spinach at the supermarket

59
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,030
that are prewashed.

60
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,470
Wait...Shelley,

61
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,810
I still need to wash those?

62
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,910
Really?

63
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,849
Anyway, the Editor in Chief

64
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,689
of the pre-censored encyclopedia,

65
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,629
Yang Muzhi, said in a meeting

66
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:22,659
at the Chinese Academy of Sciences

67
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,810
that “The Chinese Encyclopaedia is not a
book,

68
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,260
but a Great Wall of culture.”

69
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,700
Yes, a Great Wall of culture!

70
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:33,719
That will keep out the angry hordes of...

71
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,019
information.

72
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,709
So why is China putting so many resources

73
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,060
into the Chinese Encyclopedia?

74
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,519
“Yang [Muzhi] told the meeting

75
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,590
China was under international pressure

76
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,349
and felt an urgent need to produce its own
encyclopaedia

77
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,480
to ‘guide and lead the public and society.’”

78
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,590
Because if there’s anything the international
community

79
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,290
has been begging China to do,

80
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,889
it's do a better job guiding and leading

81
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,709
the Chinese public and society—

82
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,450
by censoring them.

83
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,870
Wikipedia, which turns 16 this year—

84
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,459
don’t worry, you're not old—

85
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,670
has never had it easy in China.

86
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,519
The Chinese version was launched in 2004

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,790
and right away resulted in flame wars.

88
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,999
Is Taiwan a country?

89
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,609
What’s the nationality of someone in Hong
Kong?

90
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,569
Is the Dalai Lama the anti-christ?

91
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,879
Users in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan

92
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,290
all had very different views.

93
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,400
And this was the problem:

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,379
People were actually using Internet forums

95
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,379
to broaden their horizons.

96
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,209
One 17-year-old Wikipedia editor from Shanghai

97
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,629
told the New York Times,

98
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,400
“I was furious when I came across

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,379
terms like Taiwan and the Republic of China.

100
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,430
But after more interactions,

101
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,440
I understand how people in Taiwan think,

102
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,099
and I become much more tolerant.”

103
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,829
Which is exactly WHAT HE WAS NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO!

104
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,950
Mainland Chinese kids these days…

105
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,860
Mainland users have had intermittent access

106
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,610
to Wikipedia.

107
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,299
But the Great Firewall of China blocks user
access

108
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,959
to topics like the Dalai Lama and Falun Gong.

109
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,669
Then there was the time in 2015

110
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,059
Jimmy Wales went to China’s World Internet
Conference.

111
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,919
Yes, the Chinese regime holds

112
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,760
a World Internet Conference,

113
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,849
despite having the world’s least free internet.

114
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:12,910
Which would be like me hosting

115
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,580
the State Administration of Press,

116
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,449
Publication, Radio, Film and Television's

117
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,420
annual State-Run Media Correspondents Dinner.

118
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
Xi Jinping really killed it this year

119
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,060
with his long-drawn out monologue.

120
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,840
In a speech,

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Jimmy Wales said that

122
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,250
thanks to technological changes in the future,

123
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,979
“The idea that any one government

124
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,740
can control the flow of information

125
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,509
of what people know in their territory

126
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:36,390
will become completely antiquated

127
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,370
and no longer possible.”

128
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,660
But then the Chinese media, um, fixed his
quote...

129
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,320
to be pro-Chinese government surveillance.

130
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,300
Yes, that is actually what they changed it
to.

131
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,560
You know, China has one of the longest continuous histories

132
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,870
in human civilization

133
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,470
partially because Chinese people

134
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,790
have always revered their history and culture.

135
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,360
Some recent exceptions may apply.

136
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,159
The first edition of the Chinese Encyclopedia

137
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,610
was created by a group of idealistic Chinese
scholars.

138
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,730
Many of them had been persecuted

139
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,050
during the Cultural Revolution

140
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,071
and wanted to "enlighten the people

141
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,889
with knowledge and modern ideas

142
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,680
and avoid similar catastrophes

143
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,169
in the future.”

144
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,509
Hundreds of scientists, historians, artists
and writers

145
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,830
worked on it and in 1993,

146
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,389
the first 74-volume edition was released.

147
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,790
But unfortunately for those involved,

148
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,870
their efforts to enlighten people with knowledge

149
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,340
came with a few hiccups.

150
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
The entire thing was funded

151
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,710
by the Chinese government,

152
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,789
“which resulted in omissions and distortions

153
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,020
for political purposes.”

154
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,370
So when the head of the Wikimedia Foundation
said,

155
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,419
“If governments try to get us

156
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,090
to take information down,

157
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,190
we don’t.

158
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,750
We have very strong encryption technology

159
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,560
that means that if you choose to block Wikimedia
[sites]

160
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,210
you block ‘all of it’ or ‘none of it.’

161
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,600
We found most places in the world

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,300
choose ‘none.’”

163
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,520
I don’t think they were really ready for
China.

164
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,729
What do you think about China’s

165
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,340
state-sponsored encyclopedia?

166
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,080
Leave your comments below.

167
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,620
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

168
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,720
See you next time.
