1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,540
The Chinese Communist Party is great...

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,460
At spying on people.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,569
And not just inside China...

4
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:09,860
but also in America.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,420
Welcome back to China Uncensored. I’m Chris
Chappell.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,460
The Chinese Communist Party has an extensive
network of spies.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,779
And over the last two decades,

8
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,560
the Party has rapidly developed its espionage
tools.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,439
Shelley Zhang sat down with intelligence researcher
Matt Brazil,

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,089
co-author of Chinese Communist Espionage:

11
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:38,319
An Intelligence Primer, to learn more.

12
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,129
Thank you for joining us, Dr. Brazil.

13
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,200
Happy to.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,109
So, in your book, you say that Chinese espionage

15
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,010
has now become like a global superpower.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,499
So, how scared should we be?

17
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:55,059
They're world-class.

18
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,659
And the reason we like to call them world-class

19
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,459
is that they have recently become equal in
ability

20
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:08,369
and reach to any other world-class power like
the United States,

21
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,369
Russia, France, and Britain.

22
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,450
Looking at the history of Chinese intelligence,

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,729
it seems like it wasn't really ...

24
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,460
Especially in terms of foreign intelligence,

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,780
it wasn't really that way until the early
2000s, is that right?

26
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,899
They began to really get serious in the 1990s.

27
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,080
And as we talk about in the book,

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,219
it was in 1989 that state security decided
that they wanted to revamp education

29
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,700
not only for their own officers but for the
general population.

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,130
And so right after Tiananmen Square, they
commissioned a book on Li Kenong,

31
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,649
one of their early heroes and who was also

32
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:03,030
the head of their intelligence service in
the '50s.

33
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,700
So, they paid for it, they found the researchers.

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,260
They wrote the introduction to the book on
Li Kenong.

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,099
And they emphasize that this is for younger
generations to learn

36
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,760
about the heroes of the past so that they
can sharpen their own skills

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,890
and realize that they too can make a contribution
to the revolution.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,860
So, why is it important to look back at the
history

39
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,110
of the communist party's espionage activities?

40
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,769
Chiefly because it tells us the facts about
how the Chinese communists

41
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,959
have run intelligence operations like everybody
else.

42
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,870
The reality of “everybody spies” applies
to the Chinese

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,519
as well as to everybody else.

44
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
It also underlines the fact that their operations

45
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,670
have always been professional, secret, compartmented,

46
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,520
limited to only a few people.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,692
And it runs against the old American idea
that there is

48
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:10,380
a grains of sand approach by the Chinese,

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,500
which means basically that China likes to
use thousands of ordinary

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,640
Chinese people overseas to do their spying
for them.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,569
Nothing could be further from the truth,

52
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,230
and that unfortunate characterization leads
to the idea that

53
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,879
every Chinese person is a potential spy, which
is silly,

54
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,110
but it's gained a lot of traction in the US
and some other countries.

55
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,700
And so, we were very concerned about that
idea

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,489
because it leads to false assumptions.

57
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,750
It leads to bad policy.

58
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,930
And so we tried our best to make clear that,

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,550
that's not the case using this book.

60
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,430
What would you say is the biggest misconception

61
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,140
about Chinese communist espionage?

62
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,810
One of the biggest misconceptions is that
it's mysterious.

63
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,150
And indeed, in the modern day, Kang Sheng,

64
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,941
the black sheep of the communist party

65
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:10,370
who was actually expelled after he died,

66
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,980
he's criticized for his mysticism because
he used to insist

67
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,630
that he could smell a spy, that he could tell
a spy by looking at them.

68
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,050
And indeed, he persecuted innumerable people
with that kind of assumption,

69
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,420
and it was accepted, and he was backed up
by Mao.

70
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,640
He was one of Mao's most loyal adherence and
Mao was loyal to him as well.

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,080
It doesn't seem like a great way to run a
spy organization though.

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,290
Shoot first and ask questions later.

73
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,510
Not a good thing. I agree.

74
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,720
So, one of the things that you brought up
in your book

75
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,610
that I thought was particularly interesting
was the idea

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,660
that in the Chinese Communist Party,

77
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,900
the intelligence information would kind of
get filtered through

78
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,820
this Marxist Leninist lens.

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,050
Can you give us an example of what that means?

80
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,590
One of the most difficult problems they face
internally,

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,190
which they may or may not acknowledge internally

82
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,190
is they use this Marxist Leninist lens to
analyze practically everything.

83
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,330
So, they have a historical sense that ...

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,370
They've got it all figured out as Marxist
Leninist.

85
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,130
They have a theory. They have science.

86
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,100
They have a way of looking at history that
enables them to predict the future.

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,580
And when things go wrong,

88
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,220
then they typically ascribe that to being
somebody's mistake

89
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,370
or a leftist deviation or something of that
sort.

90
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,850
And that makes it hard for them to explain
things

91
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,170
when they can't find that deviation or that
villain to blame things on.

92
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,490
And so that means that when they try to explain
a problem

93
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,380
to their higher ups who also go for this view,

94
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,600
that if they can't find somebody to blame
it on,

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,350
then it becomes difficult to make a proper
explanation.

96
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,750
So, this is why they've actually gone after

97
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,620
foreigners like Nate Thayer, for example,

98
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,100
the man who reported on the death of Pol Pot.

99
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,720
He was approached by the Shanghai State Security
Bureau

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,410
and asked to write some briefs on different
problems,

101
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,040
and they can take something like that, something
written by a foreigner

102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,850
and show it to somebody who wants to know
about a particular problem.

103
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:37,080
And if there's some piece of information in
that analysis that's a little bit heretical,

104
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,550
they don't get blamed for it.

105
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,650
So, it's like, "Well, that was what this foreigner
said, so that's okay."

106
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,410
But if it's from an internal source,

107
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,700
then it has to kind of be politically correct.

108
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,860
Yes. You may be familiar with Cankao Xiaoxi,

109
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,300
which until the mid '90s was a classified
publication.

110
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,920
So, for the audience, Cankao Xiaoxi or Reference
News

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,290
is a collection of foreign news reports

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,250
that would not ordinarily make it into the
Chinese press.

113
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,190
And same thing there.

114
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,880
We can put information out about something
going on outside of China

115
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
or maybe even inside of China through a foreign
news report

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,120
and not get blamed for it, and not get persecuted.

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,790
Interesting. In the book, you talk a little
bit about the difference

118
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,700
between the Ministry of State Security and
the People's Liberation Army,

119
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,190
how they're both responsible for intelligence.

120
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,780
But in terms of Western analysis of that,

121
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,560
we seem to focus more on the PLA than the
MSS.

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,050
Is it important to have that distinction?

123
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:48,210
It is, because until the reorganization that
happened three years ago,

124
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,140
the PLA was perhaps the leader in foreign
intelligence,

125
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,090
or at least they were the more visible part
of PRC foreign intelligence,

126
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,890
because they were getting caught.

127
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,850
You may be aware of how a US cybersecurity
organization,

128
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,010
a private company managed to actually turn
the cameras

129
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,700
back on the PLA's laptops and view the pictures
of the analysts at work

130
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,230
and that's how the FBI got their pictures
for those wanted posters.

131
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,890
Right. When the justice department indicted
some PLA soldiers. Right?

132
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,480
Yes, exactly.

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,370
Now, MSS apparently has been just as successful,

134
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,360
maybe even more successful in cyber operations,

135
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,570
but the point is they have maintained a much
lower profile.

136
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,699
And so my coauthor, Peter Mattis,

137
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:51,310
likes to call this realization that has occurred
in the last 10, 15 years

138
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,450
that there's so much more stuff to be gained
through cyber espionage.

139
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,740
He likes to call it a dreadnought moment,

140
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,470
as in the change in navy ships at the turn
of the last century

141
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,560
where ships suddenly had more armament

142
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,610
and bigger guns and longer range.

143
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,860
That whole idea of having bigger guns and
longer range

144
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,970
can be applied here, because now instead of
having to recruit spies,

145
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,970
get them in, or run a very expensive

146
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,040
and very elaborate signal intelligence operation

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,910
to get your information that requires satellites
and outstations

148
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,100
and thousands of analysts and intercept operators.

149
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,990
A lot of technology, a lot of money.

150
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,709
Now, the ability to get these things done
can be seen in the software code

151
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,339
that's used to infiltrate foreign systems.

152
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,510
And, of course,

153
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,790
once you get into the Office of Personnel
Management computers

154
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,610
or United Airlines computers,

155
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,930
because a lot of U S government people fly
on

156
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,040
United or Anthem Insurance computers,

157
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,670
a lot of US government people took insurance
through Anthem.

158
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:12,019
There's an unbelievable wealth treasure trove
of information in these places.

159
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,329
As they've done throughout their history

160
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,720
and as all intelligence agencies do,

161
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,060
the Chinese services are going where the secrets
are.

162
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,269
You say in the book that they could have been
targeting the OPM hack

163
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,810
to get the information of government officials.

164
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,910
What would they do with that information?

165
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,709
Well, every government official who gets a
security clearance

166
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,620
has to fill out a form.

167
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,259
If it's the case of most of the agencies,

168
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,850
it's called the SF-50, the Standard Form 50.

169
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,060
So, you're putting down in that form not only
your name,

170
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,680
social security number and date of birth,

171
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,029
you're putting down all your friends,

172
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,240
all the addresses you've lived in the past
X number of years.

173
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,379
Whether or not you've had exposure to foreign
nationals.

174
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:04,939
And so all this information together provides
a marvelous profile

175
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:08,470
for someone who is thinking about testing
out,

176
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,610
possibly recruiting an American.

177
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:18,399
So, they could actually be targeting officials
to spy for the MSS or something?

178
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,439
Yes. And, of course, not only the OPM information,

179
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,079
but also the stuff we use every day now,

180
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,560
because we need to get our names out there
to further our careers.

181
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,249
LinkedIn has, as you may have read,

182
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:37,259
become a big resource for not only the Chinese
services,

183
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:42,120
but also ... If you look at the Open Source
Center

184
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,560
that's run by our intelligence community,

185
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,699
they have advertisements out there for people

186
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:50,379
to work for them and do precisely the same
thing.

187
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:54,910
I want to ask about corporate espionage now.

188
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,870
Can you name a company that's gone into China

189
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,420
that hasn't been spied on?

190
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,569
That would be hard to do in the affirmative
or the negative,

191
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:08,059
but there's a baseline of surveillance on
all foreigners

192
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,620
and all Chinese people in China.

193
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,370
And that baseline of surveillance,

194
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,190
if you're Chinese, it includes your urban
personnel file.

195
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,889
It includes all the information that goes
into your national ID card,

196
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,029
including your race and so on. It includes
where you work.

197
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,920
If you're a foreigner, when you travel to
China, just like ...

198
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,910
This happens in Thailand to where I recently
visited.

199
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,279
You check into a hotel, they copy your passport

200
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,629
and they immediately give it to the police.

201
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,190
Now, the reason they do this ...

202
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,790
And if you put yourself in the shoes of the
local public security bureau,

203
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,290
if something goes wrong with a foreigner,

204
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,410
then they're responsible, because you're on
their turf.

205
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,899
They're going to have to answer for whatever
it is you did or didn't do,

206
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,790
the movements you made or didn't make.

207
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,749
So, that's why they have a strong incentive

208
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,730
to know all about you at that basic level.

209
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,769
But they don't really look at you unless they
have reason to.

210
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,040
They have interest in you if you are working

211
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,870
for some sort of sensitive company with high
technology

212
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:25,959
or if you've come to China and you start to
do religious proselytizing.

213
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,880
Or on the Chinese side, if you're a Chinese
citizen,

214
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,980
they're interested in you if you're a Tibetan,

215
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,360
or if you're a Uyghur, or if you're a dissident,

216
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,889
or if you're a lawyer for dissidents.

217
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,959
Then, of course, they intensify the surveillance.

218
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,610
If you're a foreigner who goes to China and
you misbehave,

219
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,410
even if it looks to you like certain things
are legal.

220
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,059
If you misbehave, you don't cross all your
T's and dot all your I's,

221
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,689
then you might be subject to a more intense
examination as well.

222
00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:01,600
So, does that include people who go to China
for business reasons?

223
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Yes.

224
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,980
As a former corporate security advisor,

225
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,389
do you think that companies in the US are
cognizant

226
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,579
of the risks of going into China now?

227
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,800
Is that pretty well known?

228
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,649
They are, but whether or not they do proper
training is another question.

229
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,720
And whether or not their employees accept
these realities

230
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
is another question.

231
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,589
Because when you go to China,

232
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,949
the first thing you notice if you're from
a Western country

233
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:34,480
that has a Western level of street crime

234
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,269
is there tends to be less street crime.

235
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,279
And you also run into people who are very
polite to you,

236
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,480
who treat you with deference.

237
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,730
And it's easy to fall into the impression
that everything is a lot better here.

238
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:56,769
But the reality is that if there's any interest
in you as a foreigner,

239
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:02,139
then you're going to be subject to very intense
surveillance.

240
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:05,379
And you won't see it because it's done very
well.

241
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:10,920
So, it won't be in kind of like guys in sunglasses
following you

242
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,990
that you could necessarily spot.

243
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,980
A lot of it might be technology related.

244
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,480
Yes. With all the cameras in China now,

245
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,480
it's amazing how many cameras there are and
what they can do.

246
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,180
Of course, we've read about how artificial
intelligence,

247
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,709
AI, is being employed to be able to identify
people.

248
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:38,850
Police are now experimenting with glasses
that they can use to identify people

249
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,529
that are linked through WiFi to mainframe
servers with all that information.

250
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:51,839
So, it's difficult to evade surveillance in
China if you're a subject of interest.

251
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,220
Of course, if you're not, if you're considered
to be an ordinary person

252
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,750
going about their business and you're no threat
to the state,

253
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,699
then you're virtually ignored.

254
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,959
How do you think you and I would do?

255
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,070
I think they'd go after you.

256
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,869
That makes me feel better.

257
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:16,240
Because of your exposure in public.

258
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:25,309
I know that when I used to do my work there
that I was watched.

259
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:32,069
And I used to do stuff that was only recently
legal.

260
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:36,589
For example, it used to be totally illegal
to do TSCM work,

261
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:39,420
which stands for technical surveillance counter
measures.

262
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,759
That's finding bugs in tables and walls and
stuff like that.

263
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,339
That used to be totally illegal.

264
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,540
However, the company in the United States,

265
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,769
which I won't name, that sells this stuff,

266
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,640
that has world-class equipment.

267
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,689
I've been trained at their Tennessee facility

268
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:06,060
and they have lots of customers in China.

269
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,500
And why is that?

270
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,570
That's because surveillance,

271
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,910
electronic surveillance in China has become
so ubiquitous.

272
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,030
It's not only the government anymore,

273
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,330
it's also private individuals.

274
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,750
It used to be, for example, up until about
2005

275
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,910
that if you wanted to buy electronic eavesdropping
equipment,

276
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,250
you had to go to Hong Kong.

277
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,880
You'd go to Nathan Road in Kowloon where all
the camera shopsare

278
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,010
and you'd be able to find bugs that would
work with an FM radio

279
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,930
and more sophisticated ones that had their
own receivers and so on.

280
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:45,120
But starting about then, this stuff was sold
on the mainland by mail.

281
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,140
And so now, companies are spying on each other.

282
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,120
There are plenty of private investigations
companies

283
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,700
that are using this stuff like mad.

284
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,310
And so the Chinese side decided to make legal
the acquisition

285
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:09,160
and use of anti-bug detection equipment at
that level,

286
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,920
at that sort of semi-professional level,

287
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,610
but they don't allow you to search for stuff
that is at the professional level,

288
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,270
the police level listening devices.

289
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,110
So, if it's corporations,

290
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,090
like Chinese corporations spying on each other,

291
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,570
that's something that you could try to protect
against?

292
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:38,250
Yes, and that's something that is consistent
with the Chinese approach

293
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,440
using law to rule China.

294
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,490
So, as you probably heard many people say,

295
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,190
China is not a country that is governed by
law.

296
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,700
It's a country that they use law to govern.

297
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:59,660
And so what they've wanted to do over the
past 10 years is institute laws

298
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,710
that are relevant to many areas,

299
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,730
but also relevant to espionage so that

300
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:11,230
they can have codified approaches to catching
spies

301
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:17,390
that don't allow for any deviation from Party
policy.

302
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,450
So in other words, they've got it all down
on law,

303
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,630
what you can do and what you can't do.

304
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,350
And that eliminates some measure of corruption,

305
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,360
because local officials don't have latitude
to do whatever they want.

306
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,290
They have to follow the law if they're trying
to catch spies.

307
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:38,930
Obviously Taiwan is a huge interest to the
Chinese Communist Party.

308
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,160
Has there been a lot of espionage related
to things like the Taiwan elections

309
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,650
that are coming up?

310
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,020
Espionage between those two sides, Taiwan
and the Mainland,

311
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,140
indeed is a long running activity on both
sides.

312
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:03,460
There are a lot of cases that we have in the
book.

313
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,670
We scratched the surface only in the book
of course.

314
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,770
And indeed when we did our research,

315
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,050
we had a chance to go through some archives

316
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:18,450
at the Interior Ministry in Taiwan to get
some of the historical stuff.

317
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,810
And the number of cases there is in the thousands.

318
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:28,550
So there's a long practice of the two sides
spying on each other

319
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,500
because each considers the other to be its
major threat

320
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,300
because each offers a Chinese alternative
to the other.

321
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,670
And the elections of course are a very strong
interest to Beijing,

322
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,020
Taiwan elections,

323
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,300
because they are concerned about the incumbent
government

324
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,910
eventually moving toward advocating independence
of Taiwan

325
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,330
from the Mainland.

326
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,330
Do you have an example of the type of espionage

327
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,380
that they would use related to Taiwan?

328
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,910
Yes. There are numerous examples.

329
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:08,240
One of them, for example, involved a Colonel
in the Taiwan Army

330
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,620
who went to China after he retired and was
recruited there,

331
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,330
probably not intending to be recruited,

332
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:23,420
but he was spotted, assessed, cultivated and
recruited,

333
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:29,010
and then he went back to Taiwan and started
to try to recruit others.

334
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:35,000
And he was found out by a junior officer that
he had known in service

335
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,240
whom he approached and thought he could recruit
to be part of aspiring,

336
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,010
but that junior officer reported him.

337
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,450
The Taiwanese military has been a special
target

338
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,680
of the PRC services for obvious reasons.

339
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,990
In terms of the US, what do you think the
US government

340
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:58,340
has to watch out for from these Chinese security
agencies?

341
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,470
The problem that US officials tend to complain
about

342
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:08,960
is that they're overwhelmed and under resourced.

343
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,900
That's the biggest problem.

344
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,130
It's important to remember that the Chinese
agencies

345
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,420
are using professionals to do their work.

346
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,120
And there's another aspect to this too,

347
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,110
on the industrial espionage side of relatively
amateurish operations

348
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,400
done by state-owned enterprises themselves.

349
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,550
They've been given letters of marque from
the King, if you will,

350
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,290
to go out and get technology secrets by themselves.

351
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,490
And this is illustrated quite well

352
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,050
in these two FBI videos that you may be aware
of.

353
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,460
They're kind of cheesy, but they're factual.

354
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,130
One is called Game of Pawns.

355
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,850
I did watch that one.

356
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,850
Yes.

357
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,850
Yes.

358
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,970
Game of Pawns about the Glen Duffie Shriver
case.

359
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:03,270
When this young man who was studying in China
in a very controlled,

360
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,130
where there's a baseline of surveillance and
then you can drill down

361
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,500
if you're really interested in somebody.

362
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,920
Well, the Shanghai State Security Bureau

363
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,680
became very interested in him and they recruited
him

364
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,040
to try to pass the foreign service exam,

365
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,150
and then to try to join CIA and paid him a
lot of money to do that.

366
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,850
So, that's Game of Pawns.

367
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,230
The other video is called Company Man.

368
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,700
And Company Man is about a state-owned enterprise,

369
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,450
trying to get industrial secrets regarding
industrial glass

370
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,310
from a company in New York.

371
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:45,990
And you can see in this particular video that
they went about it

372
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,770
in a very slapdash and reckless way

373
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,320
and they got caught because of that.

374
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,550
There seems to be a certain level of entrepreneurial
espionage

375
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,460
when it comes to the corporate espionage things.

376
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,910
Thanks to Deng Xiaoping.

377
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,400
Was there anything that surprised you as you
were researching this book?

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,690
I was surprised by the number of cases that

379
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,150
we were able to uncover and talk about.

380
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,450
And one of the things I was very surprised
about

381
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,720
was the level of sophistication that has been
pursued successfully

382
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,030
over the past 20 years.

383
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,940
But I think it's important to remember that,

384
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,210
that the whole Marxist Leninist thing with
them being

385
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,170
super committed to Marxism and communism as
a vision,

386
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:46,000
the part of the Chinese government where the
truest believers reside.

387
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,810
There's no moral equivalence in my mind,

388
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,920
but you might say the same thing about our
own security services

389
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,650
and we like to make fun of it.

390
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,390
The television series on Adult Swim called
American Dad for example,

391
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,580
features a dad who works for the CIA.

392
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:03,730
He has this misshapen square jaw.

393
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,370
It's ridiculously huge.

394
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,310
He wears an American flag on his lapel.

395
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,380
He's totally macho and full of testosterone,

396
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:18,010
and he doesn't tell his family anything about
his work.

397
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,450
Because everybody spies,

398
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:29,090
every society that has a sophisticated and
large bureaucratic intelligence service,

399
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,650
their citizens are human beings.

400
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,740
They react to that stimuli in kind of a human
way.

401
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,090
Thank you so much for joining us, Dr Brazil.

402
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,140
Happy to.
