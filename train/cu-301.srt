1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,419
China has a knife violence problem

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:14,830
And the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t
like to talk about it

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,930
Welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,250
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,029
As we’ve all been told, everything is harmonious
in China.

6
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,200
But that might not quite be the case.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,300
And the content we’re going to talk about
in this video may be disturbing.

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,059
Which means, I can bet you YouTube will demonetize,
and maybe age restrict this video.

9
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:46,989
That means YouTube is going to prevent people
from seeing this, even though this is a really

10
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:51,469
important story and we’re choosing not to
show any gratuitous violence.

11
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,289
You can help us fight back against the censorship
by sharing this video, and if you can, contributing

12
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:02,360
a dollar or more on the crowd funding website
Patreon.That lets us stand up to YouTube’s

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,230
demonetization, and we’ll give you some
cool perks as a way of saying thank you.

15
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,700
So, here we are in Guangxi province in southern
China—

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,650
where in April, Xi Jinping did an inspection
tour.

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,380
Yep, the mountains look good.

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,079
Yep, your tiny kitchen looks good.

19
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,960
Yep, the giant red star looks imposing.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,000
But the day after Xi Jinping’s visit, there
was a brutal knife stabbing in the same region

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,520
that killed 2 people and injured 16.

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Including children.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,810
“The suspect’s wife worked as a teacher
in the kindergarten.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,930
The two couples divorced because of a quarrel.

25
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,659
The man then climbed the fence and broke into
the kindergarten and knifed people.

26
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:49,340
‘Even his own son was hacked to death.’”

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,310
Now there’s no evidence suggesting that
this knifing was related to Xi Jinping’s

28
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,040
inspection tour the day before.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,850
But for the Chinese Communist Party, the timing
was very inconvenient.

30
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,990
Social media platforms like Weibo quickly
blocked users from discussing the incident.

31
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,930
But perhaps this knifing was just an isolated
event.

32
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,660
At least that’s how state-run media report
on it every time it happens: as if it’s

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,780
a very rare event with absolutely no larger
context.

34
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,080
But unfortunately, knife attacks happen a
lot in China.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,000
Back in 2010, the Chinese government publicly
promised to prevent these incidents—even

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,100
though they, um, almost never happen.

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,020
They’ve given the death penalty to a number
of the perpetrators, and they’ve also tightened

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,890
public surveillance measures.

39
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,020
But that clearly hasn’t solved the problem.

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,560
In 2018 in Chongqing, a 39-year-old woman
assaulted a group of kindergarteners with

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,630
a kitchen knife.

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:57,030
In 2020, in Guanxi, a 50-year-old security
guard attacked 39 students and teachers at

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,820
a kindergarten.

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,240
According to Ding Xueliang, a sociology professor
in Hong Kong: ‘The Chinese society has generated

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,790
enormous pressure on individuals and some
of those individuals have perhaps had emotional

46
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,180
and psychological problems.

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,030
They want to cause general attention from
the population and attacking kids perhaps

48
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,160
is the best way from their perspective of
achieving this objective.’

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,550
Chinese society appears harmonious if you
look at state run media reports.

50
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,850
But there’s a huge amount of pent up anger.

51
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,710
And people aren’t even allowed to talk about
it!

52
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:38,790
There’s no outlet.A video that circulated
online this May shows a man in Nanjing running

53
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,770
over his ex-wife with a car in public.

54
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,540
The man later ran out of his car swinging
a knife, and injured 7 nearby pedestrians.

55
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,260
In May this year, a woman brought a fruit
knife into the Shanghai Business Center and

56
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,370
attacked 5 people.

57
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:01,500
Earlier in June, a man in Anhui in Eastern
China attacked people in the street with a

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
knife.

59
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,710
These acts of violence seem to be getting
worse.

60
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,790
And they’re not just knife attacks.

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,870
In May, a man drove a car through a red light
on purpose—plowing right through dozens

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,680
of pedestrians in a crosswalk.

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,310
“The suspect, a hairdresser surnamed Liu,
had decided to take revenge against society

64
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,060
after losing money in a failed investment
scheme.”

65
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,700
“The police said Liu had not been drinking
or on drugs... nor did he have a history of

66
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,160
mental illness: He was clear-minded when he
committed his crime.”

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,650
These “revenge against society” attacks
are some of the darkest social issues facing

68
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,280
China.

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,940
So much for everything being harmonious.

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,020
If you haven’t heard about it, it may be
that Chinese state-run media are too busy

71
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,610
to cover it.

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,830
Instead they spend their energy on more productive
things, like criticizing America’s gun violence.

73
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,680
You see, according to state-run media, China
can offer lessons to the US in protecting

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
human rights.

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,130
“The US should learn from China and genuinely
protect human rights.

76
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,520
If the US does not control its guns, problems
caused by firearms in the foreseeable future

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
will continue plaguing US society.”

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,590
Now, they’re right—the US does have a
problem with mass shootings.

79
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,460
But in China, no one is allowed to have guns.

80
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,030
And there are still essentially the same problems.

81
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,610
But with knives.

82
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,040
And cars.

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:36,400
And yet, according to Chinese state media,
rampant gun violence makes the U.S. a proven

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,460
hypocrite on human rights.

85
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,160
Gun ownership and deaths are out of control
in the US.

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,420
And how can the US police the world when it
can’t even protect its own people?

87
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:56,370
Surely if the US adopts China’s model of
authoritarian harmony, that will solve everything.

88
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,830
As long as you censor what gets reported.

89
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:06,000
And now to do what Chinese state-run media
would never do: Answer a question from a supporter!

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Oh, especially a Freedom Fighter: “I think
the best way to handle the CCP is to boycott

91
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,730
all Chinese goods.

92
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,150
Can you think of any other way to hurt the
CCP?”

93
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,150
You make a good point, Freedom Fighter.

94
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,060
The way to hurt the CCP is to go after the
money.

95
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,890
But it should be about more than just boycotting
goods.

96
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,250
That’s a great way you, as an individual,
can help.

97
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,130
But what can have a larger impact is if Western
governments—I’m looking at you, America

98
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,460
—stop their companies from investing in
China.

99
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,980
The CCP is running out of cash.

100
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,660
Especially American dollars.

101
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,070
It needs dollars to sustain its own currency.

102
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,760
So one thing China’s doing is opening domestic
bond markets.

103
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,970
They’re trying to get foreigners to invest
their American dollars into China, with the

104
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,560
promise of big returns.

105
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,190
They want you to think: Wow, they’re giving
me an opportunity to make money!

106
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,230
They’re not giving you an opportunity to
make money.

107
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,130
They’re giving themselves an opportunity
to make money.

108
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,200
But American investment companies are pitching
it.

109
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,100
And American investors are snapping it up.

110
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,360
You’re giving the CCP the money it needs
to sustain its authoritarian regime!

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,010
And also, it’s a trap!!!

112
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,970
You’re not going to get your money back,
stupid.

113
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,020
Don’t do it!

114
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,580
The US government has already restricted investments
in certain Chinese companies with military

115
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,610
ties.

116
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,790
But Wall Street needs to know that investing
in China is bad for their bottom line.

117
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,040
If the world stopped pumping money into China,
that would hurt the CCP.

118
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Badly.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,050
In fact, it would eventually bring down the
CCP.

120
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,180
But it’s a long road ahead.

121
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,200
