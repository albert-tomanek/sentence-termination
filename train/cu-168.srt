bjbj,(,( Chinese Admiral Discovers Weak Point
of US Military Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,080
I m your host, Chris Chappell. The US military
pivot to the Asia Pacific region is undone.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,510
Stability in the region will deteriorate and
North Korea will rain nuclear fire up on all.

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,030
And it s all because of the plucky wit of
one intrepid Chinese Admiral. The US is about

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,960
to deploy the new Zumwalt-class destroyer
in the Pacific, a three and a half billion

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,100
dollar, 15,000 ton vessel of death equipped
with the latest stealth technology and high

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:43,320
powered electromagnetic rail guns. But much
like Superman has his kryptonite, the Zumwalt

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,579
has a weakness its designers never could have
imagined. Chinese fisherman. That s right,

9
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,149
according to Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, the
chief weapons specialist and strategist for

10
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,409
the Chinese navy, all he has to do is send
out fishing boats, wobbly in the water, inching

11
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,210
toward the Zumwalt, place the explosives onto
its hulls [and] blow many holes in the hull.

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,630
It will be finished then. The Zumwalt is no
good! But, but what about submarines?! I mean,

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,280
those are underwater! Looks like the US is
one step ahead of you Admiral Zhang. Not to

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,970
fast. Zhang has a plan for that too. You see,
seaweed is the one challenge the US never

15
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,980
imagined a submarine in the ocean would ever
encounter. The Yellow Sea is too shallow.

16
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,070
So as Zhang, again the chief weapons specialist
in China, says, they can lay out ropes of

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,700
seaweed that will get caught in the propellers.
Then they won t be able to move. I wonder

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,720
what he ll suggest to stop fighter jets. Admiral
Zhang has become known for his admirable,

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,870
but often wrong optimistic predictions. In
2003 he said the US would never attack Saddam

20
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,890
Hussein. The next day they did. He said Libyan
rebels would never find Moammar Gadhafi s

21
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,790
hiding place, just a few hours before they
found and killed him. When North Korea was

22
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,520
preparing to launch a rocket last year, he
said they had an 80% chance of success. It

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,600
exploded moments after launch. Man, I m glad
I don t live in a country that makes ridiculous

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,050
military predictions that are instantly disproven.
