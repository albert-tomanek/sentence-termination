1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,419
The jailed Umbrella Movement hero:

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,820
Freed

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,210
as Hong Kong boils.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,550
As Beijing bears down,

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,540
what's Hong Kong's endgame?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,860
Welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,871
I'm Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,810
I'm talking to a man who needs no introduction:

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,320
Joshua Wong, leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,220
Josh, you've been in and out of prison

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,919
for standing up for the rights of Hong Kong.

12
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:29,089
You were just released from prison.

13
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:30,319
How was the food?

14
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:33,570
I left prison 26 hours ago.

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,180
It's hard for me to describe the food inside
prison.

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,660
It's possible for me to recognize it as food,

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,780
I'm really curious.

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,160
And I head you were wearing the same pair
of underwear for how long?

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,449
Same pair of clothes for every four days.

20
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,989
It's hard for me to understand the logic or
the mechanism inside prison.

21
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,450
However, at least I left prison, and can join
the fight now.

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,820
Do you think your release was politically
timed?

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,640
I was locked up in prison on the 16th of May.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,290
During that day, according to the announcement
from

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,320
the correctional service department,

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,450
the head of the prison already let me know,

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,950
on the 17th of June, I will leave prison.

28
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,740
But nobody expected, on the 16th of June,

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,180
two million people joined the rally.

30
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,250
So that was very good timing!

31
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,720
It's really quite good timing, at all!

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,860
So were you able to get news inside prison?

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,880
While I was in prison I can still read news.

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,810
However, 24 hours with censorship and pressure
is not easy to overcome.

35
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,030
But it was a surprise that even the staff
in prison told me,

36
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,470
hey Joshua, I joined the fight

37
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,380
last Wednesday, 12th of June,

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,430
to fight Beijing's oppression.

39
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,640
It surprised me that even someone who gets
salary from the government,

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,240
recognized as a civil servant,

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,030
but even the ones that were inside government,

42
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,030
were in that prison,

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,970
also joined our fight now.

44
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,230
Wow, so there's a lot of support for that.

45
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,980
It's really impressive.

46
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,560
So what was your reaction when you head that

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,910
2 million people took to the streets to protest
the extradition bill?

48
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,510
When I was in prison, I watched TV news,

49
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,500
and recognized that 2 million people joined
our fight, I get an idea.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,880
Well, Carrie Lam, perhaps by also watching
the TV news,

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
recognized that 2 million people joined the
rally,

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,010
and really excited for it.

53
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,150
I believe it's hard for Carrie Lam to have
a good sleep since two weeks ago.

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,070
Now these protests are much more decentralized

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,470
and leaderless than the 2014 Umbrella Movement.

56
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,410
Do you think that's an advantage?

57
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,650
Leaderless, decentralized, organic, is a kind
of uniqueness of this movement,

58
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,380
that we are against the extradition law amendment.

59
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,510
I would say it encourages people to have more
self-initiated action,

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,890
and it's also hard for Beijing to target any
leader.

61
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,640
Previously if they needed to end the action
they could just arrest the leader,

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,730
arrest the representative, but now, without
any specific leader,

63
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,860
it's hard for them to figure out how to deal,

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,950
how to negotiate with those activists.

65
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,620
The only way out is to withdraw the evil law.

66
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,630
So are you concerned that some of the people
in this protest

67
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,130
will face the same kind of retribution

68
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,880
that you and other leaders of the Umbrella
Movement did?

69
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,200
What we asked for is to withdraw the extradition
law amendment,

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,910
stop defining protests as riots,

71
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,190
not arrest any activists anymore in the future,

72
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,360
and Carrie Lam must step down to end her political
career.

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,510
I hope none of the activists will face prosecution.

74
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,200
They are the ones who fight for the future
of our hometown.

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,030
Now I know you said these protests are not
the endgame.

76
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,209
What do you mean by that?

77
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,509
In the short run, we urge Beijing and Hong
Kong government

78
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,779
respect the voice of the people,

79
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,779
to withdraw the evil proposal,

80
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,430
withdraw the evil leader, and the evil law.

81
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,969
But in the long run, we ask for free elections,

82
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,099
just like how we fought for freedom and democracy

83
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:35,199
five years ago during the Umbrella Movement.

84
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,840
That's why it's a long term battle.

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,180
And what role do you think you have to play
in these protests?

86
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,029
I hope the international community continues
to keep its spotlights in Hong Kong.

87
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,889
I hope that people around the world can,

88
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,930
through my participation,

89
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:53,009
to lead the world to realize that, even under
the uprising China model,

90
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,770
we are not afraid of president Xi and Carrie
Lam.

91
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,860
Well I know a lot of my viewers have been
expressing their support for the protesters.

92
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,930
What can people outside of Hong Kong do to
show their support?

93
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,729
People around the world should pressure their
goverrnment

94
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,550
to keep their eyes on Hong Kong.

95
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,779
Especially Hong Kong is such a global city,

96
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,050
already become kind of a protest city.

97
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,310
The extradition law amendment is still not
withdrawn yet.

98
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,629
And how those police of Hong Kong will just
purchase

99
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,389
rubber bullets and pepper spray from Western
countries

100
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,740
to attack on activists.

101
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,309
What I hope is government around the world
will never

102
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:35,620
sell rubber bullets or pepper spray to Hong
Kong police force

103
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,379
to physically attack on activists.

104
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,580
Well we don't know what's going to happen
in the next couple of days,

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,680
so just in case,

106
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,729
I was wondering if you could give me any advice

107
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:50,199
over how to survive Hong Kong prison.

108
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,979
With support from people who can try our best
to overcome

109
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,749
pressure and threats inside jail.

110
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:00,400
The fight for democracy is not easy.

111
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,360
But compared to the price paid by others,

112
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,110
just like activists against Beijing pressure

113
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,800
have been shot by rubber bullets and sent
to the hospital last week,

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,259
and other that fight for freedom have been
jailed for seven years.

115
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,469
As for ones who have just been jailed for
a few weeks,

116
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:21,930
It just pales.

117
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,920
It's just a small piece of cake for me.

118
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,980
Well thank you for joining me today.

119
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,780
Thank you.
