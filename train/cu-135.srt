1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,690
Like sands through the hourglass,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,010
so is this episode of China Uncensored.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,600
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,700
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,250
As a professional China watcher person,

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,310
I like to use the three C's

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,420
when describing the People's Republic.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,960
Yes, it's complicated, confusing, and contradictory.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
For example,

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,960
if you've been paying attention to Western
media reports on China,

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,140
you've seen headlines like this.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,719
The Communist Party is locked in an

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,300
unprecedented internal power struggle.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,079
Ok, that seems pretty clear.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,140
But wait.

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,799
You've also seen headlines like this,

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,429
about how Xi Jinping is a tyrannical dictator.

18
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:50,139
So...Xi is an absolute dictator with total
control...

19
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:55,659
in a system fracturing because of non-stop
power struggles?

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,580
Complicated, confusing, and contradictory.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,140
Check!

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,479
Western media has consistently focused on
Xi Jinping

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,540
being the source of everything bad happening
in China.

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,320
Yes, when Xi came to power in 2012,

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,700
some people had high hopes he’d be a reformer.

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,880
But under his rule,

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,840
China seems to have become worse...

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,329
And worse...

29
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,350
And worse.

30
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,009
Even though Xi has repeatedly said

31
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,880
“China is a country ruled by law.”

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,990
And Party members must

33
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,869
“abide by the country’s constitution and
laws.”

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,340
Riiiight.

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,640
I mean is this guy a huge hypocrite?

36
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:36,290
Or is he just having crazy mood swings?

37
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,179
Well, there could be another explanation.

38
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:42,829
You see, getting to the top of the Communist
Party,

39
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,270
or rather, surviving long enough to get to
the top

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,710
of the Communist Party,

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,759
requires careful planning and maneuvering.

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,420
It's full of scheming, deceptions, backstabbing,
revenge,

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,649
mysterious disappearances, mysterious reappearances,

44
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,539
and lots and lots of murder.

45
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:01,759
What's that, Shelley?

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,900
Yeah, I guess it is kind of like a soap opera.

47
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,320
What would it be called?

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,659
The Old and the Restless?

49
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,080
All My Comrades?

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,750
General Hostility?

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,760
General Hostility.

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,569
I actually kind of like that one.

53
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,140
Let's go with that.

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,580
Previously on General Hostility,

55
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
Scheming!

56
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,580
Deceptions!

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,580
Backstabbing!

58
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,580
Revenge!

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,610
Mysterious disappearances!

60
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,860
Mysterious reappearances!

61
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,260
And lots and lots of murder!

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,120
I think that pretty much brings us up to speed

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,010
on General Hostility.

64
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,640
And on today’s episode,

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,400
I think Xi Jinping has amnesia!

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,459
Xi seems to be acting...erratically.

67
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,989
He abolishes the labor camp system,

68
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,280
only to have black jails spring up in their
place.

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,490
He emphasizes judicial transparency and independence,

70
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,980
and then arrests human rights lawyers.

71
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,620
He talks about getting rid of nuclear weapons,

72
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
and then Chinese media reports that China

73
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,280
parked nuclear missiles near Russia's border.

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,970
What is going on?

75
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,970
Gasp!

76
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,480
It wasn’t amnesia after all!

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,560
It's was Xi Jinping's evil twin separated
at birth,

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,470
Xi Pinjing!

79
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,980
So that's who's been undermining Xi at every
turn!

80
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,739
Or, is it?

81
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,950
It turns out that wasn’t Xi’s evil twin!

82
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,950
That’s a mask hiding the real evil criminal
mastermind,

83
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,000
Stefano DiMera!

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,850
Uh, wait, wrong show.

85
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,050
I mean, evil criminal mastermind

86
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,200
and former Communist Party leader,

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,260
Jiang Zemin!

88
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,760
If you’ve been watching General Hostility
since the beginning,

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,439
you know former leader Jiang Zemin

90
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,129
established a massive Orwellian security system

91
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:48,870
that gave him and his cronies total control
over China.

92
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,390
Then Xi Jinping comes along

93
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,120
and tries to take control himself.

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,409
And he uses what he calls an anti-corruption
campaign

95
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,659
to purge Jiang’s allies.

96
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,440
But they’re fighting back.

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,329
Even as head of the Communist Party,

98
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,400
Xi Jinping doesn’t have absolute power

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,609
to do whatever he wants.

100
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,290
Xi Jinping still must answer

101
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,719
to the Politburo Standing Committee,

102
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,569
which includes these three guys,

103
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,769
who are big in the Jiang Zemin faction.

104
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,050
And they’re trying to stop Xi from becoming
too powerful.

105
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,450
So are all the bad things you hear about in
the media

106
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,130
really Xi’s fault?

107
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,570
Well, he has said some things that make him
seem like a dictator.

108
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,130
Like speaking out against Western Values.

109
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,110
Saying universities should be Communist Party
strongholds.

110
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,950
And religious groups must obey the leadership
of the Party.

111
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,690
But he’s also said things that make him
look like a reformer.

112
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,850
Like China must learn from western economics
and political science.

113
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,380
And pushing for judicial independence and
transparency,

114
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,590
And said that for rule of law to be established
in China,

115
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,100
“power must be exercised in accordance with
the constitution.”

116
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,450
Granted the constitution’s preamble makes
it clear things will

117
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,170
always be “under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China.”

118
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,250
Plus that whole abolishing labor camps thing.

119
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,010
Labor camps where a huge part of the system
of control

120
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,510
established by Jiang Zemin.

121
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,450
And demolishing those was a big win for Xi.

122
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,120
So are all the bad things really the doings
of Xi’s rivals

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,010
to make him look bad?

124
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,330
Well, that also is probably not entirely the
case.

125
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,120
But this is why reading Western media reports
about China

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,500
can be so confusing.

127
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,330
You could say that the media are also getting

128
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,180
played in this power struggle.

129
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,400
Come of them can see that there's a struggle
going on,

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,630
but usually their reports make it seem like

131
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,280
everything going on in China is because Xi
Jinping

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,440
wants it that way—

133
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,780
when it's often actually the opposite.

134
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,900
And then the negative media reporting on Xi
Jinping

135
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,370
becomes part of the power struggle itself.

136
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,610
Because when Xi Jinping looks bad,

137
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,710
it's a win for his enemies.

138
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,140
So what would Xi do if he was in complete
control?

139
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,090
It's hard to know.

140
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,310
Meaningful reform is pretty much impossible

141
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,480
from within the Chinese Communist Party right
now.

142
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,670
Since if Xi tries to change things,

143
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,240
Jiang's faction will try to undermine him.

144
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,770
They don't really want things to change,

145
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,860
since that would expose what they've done
in the past.

146
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860


147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
So to move forward,

148
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,740
Xi Jinping will need to purge these three
guys

149
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,110
on the Politburo Standing Committee tied to
Jiang.

150
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,960
And he’ll try to do it as soon a possible

151
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,010
so he can fill the slots with his own people.

152
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,110
And of course one day,

153
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,110
Xi Jinping will go after the big baddie himself,

154
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,900
Jiang Zemin.

155
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,950
So is Xi a reformer, or a dictator?

156
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,740
Find out, on the next several...

157
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,770
hundred episodes of General Hostility.

158
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,090
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

159
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,300
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

160
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,520
See you next time.
