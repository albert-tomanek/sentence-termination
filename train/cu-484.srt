1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,720
Taiwan!

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,120
The greatest country

3
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:04,440
Slash region

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,740
Slash province of China

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,040
It depends on who you ask.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,940
What makes Taiwan so different from China?

7
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,880
Here are 5 more ways.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,440
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,000
There are two governments claiming to be

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,260
the legitimate government of China.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,780
In one corner, representing Mainland China,

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,590
you have the Red Terror,

13
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,780
the People’s Republic of China!

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,880
And in the other corner, representing the
island of Taiwan,

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,460
putting the rock in ROC, the Republic of China!

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,340
This match has been going for 69 years.

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,720
And in that time, a lot of changes have happened.

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,680
Taiwan and China are very different places—

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,710
even though they share a lot of history and
culture.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,600
And since so many of you liked my first episode

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,130
about five differences between Taiwan and
China,

22
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,260
I thought I’d do another one with five more
differences.

23
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,260
So here is

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,980
China vs Taiwan:

25
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,390
Top 5 Differences Part 2

26
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,489
Number 5

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,920
Toilet Paper

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,900
You’d think this wouldn’t be a difference,
but it is.

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,360
In many public toilets in China, you won’t
find toilet paper.

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,240
That’s because there’s a huge problem
of people stealing it.

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,030
So if you’re ever traveling in China,

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,160
you might want to bring your own.

33
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,220
But there’s an upside to living in a surveillance
state.

34
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,060
In a few public restrooms, they’ve recently
come up with

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,810
a perfect solution to both providing toilet
paper,

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,200
and combating would-be thieves:

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,080
Dispensers with facial recognition!

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
The way it works is,

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,740
the machine scans your face,

40
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,729
and then distributes a small amount of toilet
paper.

41
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,680
And it won’t give you any more unless you
wait

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,420
a certain amount of time.

43
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,820
The downside is,

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,810
if you’re a criminal or a dissident,

45
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,110
you have one more type of surveillance to
worry about.

46
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,810
Also no one gets enough toilet paper.

47
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,530
In Taiwan on the other hand,

48
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,030
there’s toilet paper.

49
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,420
Yeah, just...it’s like a normal country.

50
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
I’m sorry,

51
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,829
it’s not any more interesting than that.

52
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,009
Number 4

53
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:08,009
Different Visas

54
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,840
If you want to visit most places in mainland
China,

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,040
you need to visit your local PRC embassy or
consulate

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,200
and apply for a travel visa.

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,680
And just to get a normal 30- or 60-day travel
visa,

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,290
you have to submit a lot of information,

59
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,760
like your current employment,

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,400
which hotels you’re going to stay out,

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
your criminal record,

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,950
and whether you’ve visited certain Muslim
countries.

63
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,390
But even if you get that travel visa,

64
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,200
you still won’t be able to go just anywhere
in China.

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,129
For example, Tibet.

66
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,129
These days,

67
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,760
Tibet is harder to get into than North Korea.

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,400
I wonder if there’s something there the
Chinese Communist Party

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
doesn’t want foreigners to see.

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,050
Or maybe they just don’t want foreigners
to get sick.

71
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,260
From the altitude, I mean.

72
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,830
And even if you get into China,

73
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,110
there’s always a risk that you just might
never want to leave.

74
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,129
China has recently created a simplified visa
program,

75
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,209
where visitors from certain countries can
visit

76
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,730
a handful of major cities—

77
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,440
but it’s only good for 3 days,

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,180
and you can’t travel outside those places.

79
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,310
Now to visit Taiwan,

80
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,940
people from a lot of countries,

81
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
including the US,

82
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,629
can just show up at the airport,

83
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,629
and get a visa waiver to stay 90 days.

84
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,629
And don’t worry,

85
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,150
you can visit pretty much anywhere in Taiwan.

86
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,510
Maybe they don’t have so many things to
cover up.

87
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,510
Number 3

88
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,640
Happy ethnic minorities

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
The Chinese Communist Party has a long history

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,540
of treating the 56 ethnic minorities of China
right.

91
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,720
That’s why the Party calls them the happy
56 ethnic minorities.

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,240
Just look at the Tibetans!

93
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
State-run media

94
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,099
wants you to know they’re just so happy.

95
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,269
So happy, in fact, you probably don’t want
to disturb them.

96
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,680
Say, by visiting Tibet.

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,750
Of course, for now—

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,409
if you get your visa—

99
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,840
you can still visit the happy Uighur ethnic
people over in Xinjiang.

100
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,260
Just keep in mind, the state will be keeping
tabs on you.

101
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,760
I’m sure it’s just to make sure you have
a good time.

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,989
After all, the Uighur Muslims there are the
happiest in the world.

103
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,890
And the Chinese authorities know this,

104
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,129
because they’re monitoring them 24/7.

105
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:16,100
Over in Taiwan, they also have ethnic minorities.

106
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,180
But their government has been very open a

107
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,680
nd honest about the fact that indigenous people

108
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,949
have not always been treated well.

109
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,360
The President of Taiwan even apologized in
2016.

110
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,629
I guess they could really learn a thing or
two

111
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,710
from communist China about how to treat minorities.

112
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,439
Because that government has never felt the
need to apologize!

113
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,849
Number 2

114
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,119
Constitutional Freedoms

115
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,089
Now you know at first I thought this would
be something

116
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,119
China and Taiwan have in common!

117
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,619
I mean, after all,

118
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,960
the Chinese constitution guarantees freedom
of speech,

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,339
the press, assembly, association, etc etc.

120
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,330
And Taiwan’s constitution guarantees pretty
much the same things.

121
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,110
Except, there’s a reason why protests in
Taiwan look like this.

122
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,969
And protests in China look like this.

123
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,610
It’s almost like...

124
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,889
having a constitution doesn’t actually guarantee
rule of law.

125
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,300
And Number 1

126
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,830
International Relations

127
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,539
So by now you might have the impression that

128
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,770
Taiwan is essentially a modern democracy.

129
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,819
And China is a modern...

130
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,249
nightmare version of George Orwell’s Nineteen
Eighty-Four.

131
00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:25,610
But with really impressive skyscrapers and
high-speed trains.

132
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,770
But which one is the real China?

133
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,889
Get this: More than 170 countries have chosen

134
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,999
to recognize the People’s Republic of China
as the true China,

135
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:40,710
and cut off official diplomatic ties with
Taiwan’s Republic of China.

136
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,419
And I totally understand.

137
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,380
The People’s Republic of China has waaaay
more people.

138
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,289
Which means you can make a lot more money
there.

139
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,590
After the Chinese Communist Party took over
mainland China in 1949,

140
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,349
most countries kept their diplomatic ties
with the Republic of China,

141
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:58,729
which had fled to the island of Taiwan.

142
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:01,789
But starting in the 1970s, more and more countries

143
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,069
shifted their alliance over to the big China.

144
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,270
Sure it’s authoritarian,

145
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,499
and kills its minorities,

146
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,460
and it’s restrooms don’t even have toilet
paper,

147
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,949
but...did I mention how much money you can
make there?

148
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,529
Today, there are only 17 countries

149
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,369
that still have diplomatic relations

150
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,059
with the Republic of China.

151
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,219
They’re mostly smaller countries,

152
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,710
one of which is the Vatican.

153
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,990
And let’s just say, even that might not
last.

154
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,659
The Chinese Communist Party has been using
money

155
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,399
to isolate Taiwan internationally.

156
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,990
For example, in 2017,

157
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,559
they got Panama to switch allegiances

158
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:39,030
in exchange for the promise of millions of
dollars

159
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,819
of Chinese investment.

160
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,990
And they did the same in 2018 with El Salvador,

161
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,349
the Dominican Republic, and Burkina Faso.

162
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,879
Maybe the Communist Party hopes that

163
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,099
if Taiwan has no more allies,

164
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,590
they can just take it over.

165
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,089
But there are countries like the US

166
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:59,270
that officially recognize the People’s Republic
of China,

167
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,419
but also work closely with Taiwan.

168
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,539
In the US’s case,

169
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,979
that includes the promise to defend Taiwan

170
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,789
from any threat of Mainland invasion,

171
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:13,030
including by selling Taiwan weapons.

172
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,749
So those are five more ways Taiwan and China

173
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,400
are not the same.

174
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
What do you think?

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
And if you’ve been to both Taiwan and China,

176
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,379
let me know in the comments section below

177
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,779
what differences you’ve seen!

178
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,749
