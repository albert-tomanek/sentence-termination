1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,540
Trump Threatens China on trade

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,840
China’s mysterious discovery on the moon

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,030
And a CIA agent found in Hong Kong

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,200
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,859
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,859
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,150
We’ve entered a new phase in the US-China
Trade War.

8
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,429
On September 1,

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,630
the first in a new round of tariffs against
China went into effect—

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,869
15% on 112 billion dollars worth of goods.

11
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,750
That means about two thirds of Chinese imports

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,590
are now being taxed.

13
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,390
Thankfully, that doesn’t include

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,870
everyone’s favorite seasonal Chinese import:

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,660
pumpkin spice mooncakes.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,330
Hey, it could happen.

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,110
There’s already a spicy chicken mooncake.

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,510
It’s filled with real chicken...

19
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,510
and real regret.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,990
Anyway, by December 15,

21
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,520
virtually all Chinese imports will be taxed,

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,030
when the second round of new tariffs go into
effect.

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,070
That will be 15% on another 160 billion dollars
worth of imports.

24
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,390
And President Trump is warning China:

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,759
Things can get much worse.

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,859
Even worse than spicy chicken mooncakes.

27
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,060
But the Chinese Communist Party is playing
a waiting game—

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,170
hoping things will get worse for Trump instead.

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,590
They hope Trump will lose the 2020 election,

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,869
and someone more favorable to Beijing will
be elected.

31
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,369
Obviously, Trump is pretty confident in himself.

32
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,109
He tweeted that *when* he wins reelection,

33
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:31,630
a trade deal will get much tougher.

34
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,499
Tougher than a Trump steak served well done.

35
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,460
Meanwhile, according to the latest data,

36
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,350
the trade gap between the US and China

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,280
is actually getting smaller.

38
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,759
And both sides are now meeting again

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,770
for more trade talks in October.

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,469
Of course, as we’ve already seen,

41
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:48,270
actually getting a trade deal won’t be easy.

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,109
And as former U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis said

43
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:54,289
at a recent talk at the Council on Foreign
Relations,

44
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,439
just look at Hong Kong.

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,850
“And watching what’s going on in Hong
Kong right now,

46
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,979
their authoritarian mode against their own
people,

47
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,679
it takes a real stretch of imagination to
say

48
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,259
they would treat foreigners better than they’d
treat

49
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,010
their own people at home.”

50
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,060
The US-China Trade War isn’t just about
trade imbalances.

51
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,000
In a way it’s an ideological battle

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,030
between America’s free market model,

53
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,930
and China’s communist model.

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,500
The Chinese Communist Party has used illegal
trade practices,

55
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,890
intellectual property theft,

56
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,340
and currency manipulation to boost the Chinese
economy

57
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,170
at the expense of American workers.

58
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,810
The most recent example?

59
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,600
According to the Wall Street Journal,

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,680
the Chinese telecom giant Huawei is being
investigated

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,320
over new allegations of technology theft.

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,030
“Huawei was accused of stealing intellectual
property

63
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,150
from multiple people and companies over several
years.”

64
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,430
This is obviously really unfair.

65
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,140
The US calling China out, I mean.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Obviously.

67
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,720
That’s why China is taking the US to court.

68
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,360
China has lodged its third complaint about
tariffs

69
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,470
to the World Trade Organization.

70
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,010
It’s a strange move,

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,630
considering how many times the US

72
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,000
has lodged complaints about China to the WTO—

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,110
complaints China simply ignored.

74
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,000
So the Chinese regime should have first hand
experience

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,210
with how toothless one of those WTO complaints
can be.

76
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,590
But don’t worry,

77
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,020
the Chinese regime is taking steps to ensure

78
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,990
you’ll be seeing fewer stories about technology
theft—

79
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,710
like this one from the Wall Street Journal.

80
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,450
No, not because they’re going to stop stealing.

81
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,280
They just banned a Wall Street journal reporter.

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,860
Much easier.

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,040
Another sticking point in the trade war

84
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,810
is actually China’s drug war against the
United States.

85
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,260
President Trump has been complaining

86
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,750
that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has not honored
his agreement

87
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,780
to block shipments of fentanyl from China.

88
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,100
Of course, China’s top drug enforcement
official

89
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,510
has said that’s not true at all.

90
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,420
In April, China said it would ban all forms
of Fentanyl,

91
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,110
cutting the supply to the US.

92
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,290
But, they never specifically said they wouldn’t
ship it to Mexico,

93
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,360
and use drugs cartels to smuggle it across
the border!

94
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,950
Speaking of mysterious substances turning
up,

95
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,260
China’s lunar rover has apparently found

96
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,150
a mysterious and strange shiny gel on the
Moon.

97
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,060
Here’s a picture of it.

98
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,080
Wait, no.

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,490
That’s just the crater they say

100
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,640
they found the mysterious gel in.

101
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
They haven’t actually released

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,910
any photos of the gel itself yet.

103
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,969
But they say it’s there.

104
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,600
So take their word for it.

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,819
When have they ever lied?

106
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,819
This just in:

107
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,789
Don’t always take their word for it.

108
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,130
This footage of an American man

109
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,539
getting arrested in Hong Kong

110
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:28,539
went viral.

111
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:29,710
You have to tell me why!

112
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,710
Tell me why!

113
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,169
And Chinese media said he was actually a CIA
commander.

114
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,389
The initial accusation came from a single
post by a Chinese netizen.

115
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,979
Then several Chinese media outlets reported
it,

116
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:47,160
and then a major pro-Beijing Hong Kong television
network did.

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,819
It was later taken down.

118
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,310
Just goes to show that the Chinese media

119
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,389
don’t know how to spot a CIA commander.

120
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,340
But they do know how to cover up their mistakes.

121
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,270
So how are things in Hong Kong?

122
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,280
After all, Hong Kong chief Executive Carrie
Lam this week

123
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,800
officially announced the pending withdrawal

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,159
of the extradition bill

125
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,580
that was the source of all the protests.

126
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,169
And that’s not all.

127
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,580
"Clearly, the most important challenge

128
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,990
to resolve the current problem

129
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,919
is to stop violence,

130
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,372
strictly enforce law and restore the peace
situation.”

131
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,372
Wow, that’s great!

132
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,372
The Hong Kong government is *finally*

133
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,930
going to stop police from getting violent

134
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,020
and make sure that they follow the law.

135
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,860
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

136
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,610
Lam wasn’t talking about the police,

137
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,789
she was talking about the protesters?

138
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,229
That’s weird.

139
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,229
Because I think it’s pretty clear that things

140
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,400
get much more peaceful in Hong Kong

141
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,539
when the police stop beating people in the
subway.

142
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,250
Meanwhile, Hong Kong protesters say

143
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,810
withdrawing the extradition bill isn’t enough.

144
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,750
Actually, they were a little more graphic
than that.

145
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,780
“If you scrape your knee,

146
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,660
applying a bandaid onto the wound will be
a quick fix.

147
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,340
But if you don't do that,

148
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,349
and even start rubbing dirty fingers onto
the wound,

149
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,400
what used to be a small easily fixable injury,

150
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,770
will morph into an infection,

151
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,969
then eventually rotting flesh,

152
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:10,720
and eventually amputation or death by sepsis.

153
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,659
If Carrie Lam had withdrawn the bill two months
ago

154
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,099
that may have been a quick fix.

155
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:21,430
But applying a bandaid months later,

156
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,430
onto rotting flesh,

157
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,979
will simply not cut it.”

158
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,160
I think what she’s saying is,

159
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,889
Carrie Lam’s going to need a much bigger
bandaid.

160
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,979
And while students around the world

161
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,279
are headed back to the classroom,

162
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,110
not so in Hong Kong.

163
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,960
Thousands of students are boycotting the first
days of school.

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,319
Middle school and high school students held
hands...

165
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,319
And pens…

166
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,319
And umbrellas…

167
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,020
To protest the government.

168
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,789
My first day of school was never so much fun.

169
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,229
With the trade war and the situation in Hong
Kong,

170
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,229
things are looking pretty grim

171
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,310
for the Chinese Communist Party.

172
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,919
But that’s okay,

173
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,060
because all they need is a little fighting
spirit,

174
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,990
according to Xi Jinping.

175
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,419
Because decades of relentless Communist “struggle”

176
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,360
has worked out so well for the people of China.

177
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,689
October 1 is the 70th anniversary

178
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,939
of the Communist takeover of China,

179
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,180
and state-run media are going into overdrive.

180
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,349
They’ve been calling Xi “the People’s
Leader,”

181
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,580
a title previously only given to Mao.

182
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
And this week,

183
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,830
the People’s Daily ran a front page commentary

184
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,699
criticizing, “some cadres, especially the
young ones”

185
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,259
for being “weak-kneed and unwilling to fight.”

186
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,089
Yeah, if only they could be willing to fight,

187
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,620
like the young people of Hong Kong!

188
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,009
On second thought, nevermind.

189
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,180
But this will be a challenging time for Xi
Jinping.

190
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,439
During the anniversary,

191
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,469
the Central Committee will meet

192
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,539
for the first time in 20 months.

193
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,339
And Xi Jinping may have a lot to answer for.

194
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,869
But at least Xi Jinping can say

195
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,979
he’s still bringing home the bacon.

196
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,680
Because, did you know China

197
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,189
has emergency pork reserves?

198
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:56,430
Neither did I.

199
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,849
But with the African Swine flu

200
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,900
devastating China’s pig farms,

201
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,589
the government had to open the vaults.

202
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,189
China consumes a lot of pork.

203
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,580
Half of all the pigs in the world are in China.

204
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,840
It’s a crucial part of the diet.

205
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,180
Because remember,

206
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,629
some animals are more equal than others.

207
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,219
Of course, Chinese pork lovers

208
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,319
might be a little better off if their government

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,469
hadn’t put that 25% tariff on US pork.

210
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:21,789
And in a move that’s sure to anger

211
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,080
the Chinese Communist Party,

212
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,909
the US and 10 ASEAN countries have begun

213
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:30,240
their first joint naval exercises in the South
China Sea.

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,650
“The US said the drills

215
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,070
will help ‘maintain maritime security.’”

216
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,750
Not from any particular threat or country
of course.

217
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,459
Now the drills will be held in the South China
Sea—

218
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:43,510
in what the US considers international waters.

219
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,389
But since China considers the whole thing
to be

220
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,820
Chinese territorial waters,

221
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,459
things could get dicey.

222
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,639
So long as China gets rid of those young cadres

223
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,170
too weak-kneed and unwilling to fight, that
is!

224
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,140
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

225
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,570
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

226
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,420
a fan who support China Uncensored

227
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,389
with a dollar or more per episode,

228
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:08,290
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

229
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,240
Ralph K. Ginorio asks

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,769
“Can you recommend a film documentary series...

231
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,420
that studies the Great Leap Forward

232
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,040
and the Cultural Revolution;

233
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,670
Mao's true legacy?

234
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,680
A wonderful question.

235
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
It’s really hard to find a truly comprehensive
documentary

236
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,570
about the Chinese Communist Party,

237
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,630
but if you’re interested in the Great Leap
Forward,

238
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,790
the Cultural Revolution and Mao,

239
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,010
I’d recommend PBS’s “China: A Century
of Revolution.”

240
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,130
The three part series is six hours,

241
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,790
full of archival footage of a China

242
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,380
the Chinese Communist Party would like to
sweep under the rug.

243
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,870
Let me know what you think of it.

244
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,440
Thanks for your question.

245
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,480
And if you have a question for me

246
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,790
you want to hear answered on the show,

247
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,509
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

248
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,230
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

249
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,300
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

250
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,899
we would have to shut down the show

251
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,970
if it weren’t for your support.

252
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,880
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

253
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,160
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,140
See you next time.
