00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,129
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,880
here comes the pain!

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,340
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,110
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,629
For years, the Chinese Communist Party has
engaged in

6
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:17,090
unfair trade practices and intellectual property
theft.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,680
Which leaves us with a very important question…

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,980
“How do you get the Chinese to change behavior?”

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,980
“Pain.

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,240
Got to give them pain.”

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,680
And President Trump is dishing out the pain.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,790
I know, but believe me,

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,119
this graphic could have been a lot worse.

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,510
Anyway, Trump has taken another step

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,500
in his trade war with China.

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
At the end of May,

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,270
Trump announced the US was putting

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,720
$50 billion dollars in tariffs on Chinese
goods.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,930
And now, Trump is threatening to bring that
total

20
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,800
to more than $450 billion dollars.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,340
That’s basically the same price tag

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,230
as the total value of goods

23
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,690
the US imported from China last year.

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,350
For that kind of money,

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,120
Trump could buy 90 million Chinese fidget
spinners.

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,760
Or 9 of those golden toilets from Hong Kong.

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Those would go well inside

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,239
Trump’s golden New York Penthouse.

29
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,249
I know I should be impressed,

30
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:09,439
but all I can think about is how you can buy

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,509
multiple castles in the French Riviera

32
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,549
for less than Trump’s New York apartment.

33
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,549
But this week,

34
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,179
Trump backed new measures against China.

35
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,600
So whether you like Trump or not,

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,819
we can all agree,

37
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,700
he’s bringing the pain.

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,479
“Senior officials saying the administration

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,880
is getting behind bipartisan legislation

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,340
that passed yesterday in the House

41
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,609
on a 400 to 2 vote

42
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,079
that would expand the powers of

43
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,409
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States.

44
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:40,310
It would expand CFIUS.”

45
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,299
We’ve talked before about CFIUS.

46
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,920
It’s a group of government agencies

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,700
led by the Treasury Secretary.

48
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,420
It’s supposed to monitor foreign investment
in US companies.

49
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,310
But CFIUS doesn’t have the resources or
authority

50
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,579
to deal with all of the recent investments
from China,

51
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,009
where big companies usually have ties to the
Communist Party.

52
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,170
That’s a big deal because Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

53
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,359
has been promoting Chinese investment

54
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,539
in American tech companies

55
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,349
as part of his “Made in China 2025” plan.

56
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,370
He wants China to become a world leader

57
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,189
in cutting edge tech—

58
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:16,459
and one way to do that is by buying

59
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:19,860
or even stealing it from American companies.

60
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,120
So if Congress approves the new measures

61
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,670
Trump is pushing for,

62
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,829
it would strengthen CFIUS by expanding

63
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,190
the types of transactions CFIUS can review.

64
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,079
Trump said in a statement supporting the legislation,

65
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:34,049
“We have the greatest technology in the
world,

66
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:36,130
people copy it and they steal it,

67
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,110
but we have the great scientists,

68
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,900
we have the great brains,

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,689
and we have to protect that.

70
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,400
And that can be done through CFIUS.”

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,030
Chinese state-run media have responded

72
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,650
the way you might expect.

73
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,469
“State media blasted the Trump administration

74
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:51,719
in an editorial titled

75
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,689
‘Protectionism symptom of paranoid delusions...’

76
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,420
The paper said it reflects the damage

77
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,409
being done to trade with China

78
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,739
by the, quote, ‘crusade of Trump and his
trade hawks.’”

79
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,150
Trump does not like the term “trade hawks”
though.

80
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,450
He prefers trade...golden eagles.

81
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,150
But anyway, state-run China Daily

82
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,190
said it would be the US that would “feel
the pain.”

83
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,409
Aww, it’s so nice that state-run media cares
about

84
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,430
how the US feels.

85
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,049
My favorite state-run media the Global Times
said,

86
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,760
“It’s time for China to take further self-defense
measures.”

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,120
For example, they’re going to come up with
a safe word.

88
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,829
Actually, because of fears of a trade war,

89
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,609
the Chinese economy is already dealing with

90
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,380
some potentially serious issues.

91
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,829
For example, one state-backed Chinese think
tank

92
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,859
warned in a leaked note of potential “financial
panic.”

93
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,019
The leaked note was obtained by Bloomberg.

94
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,569
Why could China have financial panic?

95
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,329
The note cited bond defaults,

96
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,760
liquidity shortages and the recent plunge
in financial markets

97
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,940
against rising U.S. interest rates and the
trade war.

98
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,069
It doesn’t stop there.

99
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,069
As you know,

100
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,609
the Communist Party loves to censor things—

101
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,639
from critical voices to Winnie the Pooh memes.

102
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,060
But now there’s a new thing to censor—

103
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,290
China’s own economic plans.

104
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,549
Since CFIUS has gotten everyone talking about

105
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,959
Made in China 2025,

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,070
Chinese state-run media has apparently

107
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,970
decided to go the opposite way.

108
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,110
“The government has instructed Chinese state
media agencies

109
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,210
to avoid mentioning Made in China 2025 in
their reports.”

110
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,360
So all in all, it looks like the Trump administration

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,540
is making China feel the pain.

112
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,830
It’s still too early to tell exactly how

113
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,580
this trade war will go down,

114
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,980
but one thing’s for sure.

115
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,150
The biggest loser in this war is going to
be...

116
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,570
vape nation.

117
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,570
And before we go,

118
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,790
it’s time for another question

119
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,670
from a China Uncensored supporter.

120
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,220
Shane Butler asks:

121
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,090
“What would your first question be

122
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,550
if you did land an interview with Xi Jinping?”

123
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,840
I’d ask Xi Jinping the hard-hitting questions

124
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,630
that viewers want to know.

125
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,850
Like, “Why do you wear your pants so high?

126
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,510
Is it a stylistic choice?

127
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,420
Or is it a medical thing?”

128
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,940
Thanks for your question, Shane.

129
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
What?

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,660
What do you think I should ask him?

131
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,280
Leave your comments below.

132
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,750
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

133
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,800
See you next time.

134
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,280
Trump may be bringing the pain,

135
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,670
but he won’t be bringing you the latest
China news!

136
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,130
So subscribe to China Uncensored

137
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,560
and turn the notification bell on!

138
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
And share this video with your friends.

139
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,030
Because for some reason,

140
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,600
YouTube has decided to remove us

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,050
from the search autocomplete.

142
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,590
Go on, give it a try.

143
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,220
Search China Uncensored in YouTube

144
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,000
and see what it suggests.

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,580
Not that I’m bitter or anything.
