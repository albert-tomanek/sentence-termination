1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,180
On this episode of China Uncensored—

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,740
ISIS is now going after China.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,860
And now the Chinese Communist Party versus
ISIS.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,540
No, not that ISIS.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,620
Though now I have a cool idea for season 9.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,820
I’m talking about the real ISIS,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
the one so evil that it forced the writers
of Archer

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,650
to quietly drop the name from the show.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,080
This ISIS, also known as ISIL.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,080
One of the world’s most brutal terrorist
organizations.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,430
ISIS has killed tens of thousands of innocent
people.

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,300
Well ISIS is now targeting the Chinese Communist
Party,

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,050
which...is also one of the world’s most
brutal organizations,

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,489
and has killed tens of millions of innocent
people.

15
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:44,800
So who do you root for?

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
It’s like Alien vs. Predator.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,840
Whoever wins, humanity loses.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,890
Back in March, ISIS released a video threatening
the CCP.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,750
ISIS said it would to “come to [China]

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,780
to clarify to you with the tongues of our
weapons,

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,219
to shed blood like rivers and avenging the
oppressed.”

22
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,410
The oppressed?

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,410
In China?

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,260
Sorry, you’ll have to be more specific

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,250
about which group of oppressed people in China

26
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,560
you’re talking about.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,890
But you get the gist:

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,510
It’s a threat.

29
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,510
But you know,

30
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,510
there’s something I don’t get.

31
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,630
It’s not like China is sending its troops

32
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,930
into the Middle East to fight ISIS.

33
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,390
Actually, the United States has been complaining

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,290
that China isn’t doing its part

35
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,140
in the fight against global terrorism.

36
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,140
And in some ways,

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,360
it seems the Chinese regime is doing the opposite.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,180
Like when they defended their close ally Pakistan,

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,750
saying Pakistan is totally not a harbor for
terrorists.

40
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,040
And that came just months after ISIS

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,010
killed two Chinese nationals in Pakistan.

42
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,210
And the Chinese regime—

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,380
just to prove it really, really didn’t care—

44
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,020
blamed the Chinese victims.

45
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,090
ISIS killed those Chinese citizens

46
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,700
because they were illegally preaching Christianity

47
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,740
in Pakistan.

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,270
Although, to be fair,

49
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,270
that could have been their fate

50
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,880
for illegally preaching Christianity in China,
too.

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,490
The Chinese regime has basically stated

52
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,080
it won’t join the global fight against ISIS.

53
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,180
This is not to say the CCP

54
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,730
is buddy-buddies with ISIS.

55
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,480
It’s mainly that their strategy

56
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,810
for dealing with the complexities of terrorism

57
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,980
in the Middle East is basically:

58
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,040
Meh, you guys sort it out.

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,500
I mean, I told you in the last segment

60
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,240
that other BRICS countries got China

61
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,870
to sign a joint statement

62
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,600
to “express concern” about ISIS—

63
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,580
and that’s considered a big win,

64
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,220
but still doesn’t require China to do anything.

65
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,800
As Business Insider puts it,

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,670
“While relying on the region for oil supplies,

67
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,570
China has tended to leave Middle Eastern diplomacy

68
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,180
to the other permanent members

69
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,560
of the UN Security Council.”

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,330
Take Iraq for example.

71
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,630
The US initially led the war effort to liberate
Iraq—

72
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,390
from its oil reserves.

73
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,200
But now it’s China buying most of Iraq’s
oil.

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
The Chinese regime also recently announced

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,830
an almost half-a-billion dollar construction
deal in Iraq…

76
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,581
...to rebuild after the defeat of ISIS.

77
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,100
I mean, not that the Chinese regime

78
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,590
is specifically planning for the defeat of
ISIS.

79
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,110
It’s more that the Chinese regime

80
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,900
wants to include Iraq in its

81
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,590
One Belt One Road initiative.

82
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,600
And by and large,

83
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
this has been the Chinese regime’s

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,821
international strategy in the Middle East

85
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,319
since the Cold War:

86
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,740
“an ‘offend no one’

87
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,300
and ‘attach no strings’ strategy.”

88
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,650
Offend no one and attach no strings.

89
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,280
Sounds more like my friend Chad’s dating
strategy.

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,970
And much like Chad’s love life,

91
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,840
the Middle East is still a hot mess.

92
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,760
So how did ISIS get so offended

93
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,240
by the Chinese Communist Party?

94
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,050
I mean they seem so reasonable.

95
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,870
Well, it’s because the Chinese regime

96
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,569
is fighting a war against terrorists...

97
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,680
And by terrorists,

98
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,070
they mean the Uyghur people in Western China,

99
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,209
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

100
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,870
In China, an “autonomous region”

101
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,770
is like a province.

102
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,330
“Autonomous” means “self-governed”—

103
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,030
in the same way that the “People’s Republic
of China”

104
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,250
means it’s runs by the people.

105
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,750
Because in the case of Xinjiang,

106
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,620
the CCP has been ridiculously heavy-handed

107
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,580
in how things are run.

108
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,630
About 10 million of Xinjiang’s 22 million
residents

109
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,120
are the Turkic-speaking Uyghur people.

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,830
Who are these Uyghur people?

111
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
In a lot of ways,

112
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,019
they’re just like you and me.

113
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,220
They enjoy riding horses

114
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,430
through golden hills on a warm September day.

115
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,790
Eating spicy noodles at the local street market.

116
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,700
Sitting through boring college PowerPoint
presentations.

117
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,750
And loading up on carbs

118
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,960
when they know they really, really shouldn’t

119
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,320
but it’s my cheat day so don’t judge me.

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,810
Of course, there’s one thing that distinguishes

121
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,120
the Uyghur people from most other Chinese.

122
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,860
A lot of them are Muslim—

123
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,220
mostly secular Muslims,

124
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
although of course there are lots of

125
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,630
religious Muslims there, too.

126
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,520
The Chinese regime has effectively labeled

127
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,760
all Uyghurs as a threat.

128
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,180
But it’s not like they’ve singled them
out

129
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,700
for their religion or anything.

130
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,040
Remember, over the years

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,430
the Chinese regime has persecuted

132
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,430
all sort of groups:

133
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,830
Tibetans, intellectuals,

134
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,880
wealthy people, poor people,

135
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,710
Christians, lawyers, activists,

136
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,590
and even those people who just sit there quietly

137
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,630
in yellow shirts.

138
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,940
It’s equal opportunity oppression.

139
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,410
I’m sorry, Uyghurs.

140
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,890
You’re just not that special.

141
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,169
But according to this policy paper,

142
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,169
over the years,

143
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,880
“the Chinese government gradually turned

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,940
Uyghur national identity and Islamic practices

145
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,490
into national security threats.”

146
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,930
You see, after 9/11,

147
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,420
the Chinese regime realized that they had

148
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,199
a golden opportunity to finally get international
support

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,710
for one of their insane persecutions—

150
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,050
because these victims were Muslim.

151
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,320
So any locals who were angry at the CCP for,

152
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,830
really any number of reasons,

153
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,820
were suddenly labeled as “terrorists.”

154
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,780
And you don’t want to stand up for terrorists,
do you?

155
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,080
And the CCP thinks that nothing is effective
at stopping terrorism

156
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,750
like going after people’s traditions.

157
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,460
So the CCP banned burqas and abnormal beards.

158
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,780
Plus they banned traditional Muslim clothing,

159
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,070
the name Muhammad,

160
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,050
and fasting during the holy month of Ramadan

161
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,360
for students and civil servants.

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,630
The CCP has also put

163
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,600
extreme surveillance measures in place

164
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,960
in the entire Xinjiang region—

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,150
like requiring a GPS in every car,

166
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,690
and forcing residents to install

167
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,790
spyware on their mobile phones

168
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,900
that tracks everywhere they go,

169
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,130
every website they visit,

170
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,120
and every text message they send.

171
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,450
Yeah, that’s not going to make anyone mad.

172
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,970
Of course, to keep them in line,

173
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,640
the CCP has added a heavy military presence
in Xinjiang.

174
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,560
Incidentally, the Communist Party chief

175
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,390
in charge of Xinjiang is this guy.

176
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,010
Previously, he was in charge of Tibet for
five years.

177
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,760
He did excellent work in Tibet,

178
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,700
making sure no one there had freedom, either.

179
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,990
So after years of the CCP

180
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,580
treating its Muslim population horribly,

181
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,040
guess what?

182
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,229
It actually ended up driving

183
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,910
some of them to terrorism.

184
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,910
Over the years,

185
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,009
there have have been several acts of terror

186
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:56,350
carried out by Islamic extremists in Xinjiang.

187
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,490
Like the 2014 car bomb attack

188
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,850
that killed 31 people.

189
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,430
Actually, Chinese state-run media

190
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,800
has labeled about 15 incidents in Xinjiang

191
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
to be “acts of terror” in the two decades,

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,870
although it’s hard to know how much of that

193
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,979
is really terrorism and how much

194
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,910
is just regular crime,

195
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,530
spun by state-run media to justify

196
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,120
the heavy-handed treatment of locals.

197
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,860
None of the incidents were claimed by ISIS.

198
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,290
But after ISIS became an evil,

199
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,100
global sensation in 2014,

200
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,670
ISIS tried to take advantage of Uyghur people’s

201
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,500
widespread anger with the CCP.

202
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,670
This study from a US think tank found that

203
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,810
114 ISIS fighters came from Xinjiang.

204
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,259
And now, you have ISIS actively recruiting
in Xinjiang,

205
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,229
even rolling out slickly produced songs in
Mandarin to do it.

206
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:48,800
And ISIS is threatening the CCP.

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,880
But as I mentioned,

208
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,100
the CCP kind of created their own problem.

209
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
For instance,

210
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,590
if the Chinese regime hadn’t

211
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,419
actively destroyed Tibet—

212
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,270
killing monks, burning temples,

213
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,169
and trying to wipe out the culture—

214
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,990
and instead treated everyone reasonably well,

215
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,810
there’d be no anti-China movement

216
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,680
in the Tibetan community.

217
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,780
And the world might never have seen

218
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,650
the Beastie Boys and Smashing Pumpkins

219
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,740
together on stage at the same time.

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
And in Xinjiang,

221
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,780
the CCP’s oppression has also bred resentment.

222
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,600
Most of the Uyghurs there are very moderate

223
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,950
in terms of their religion,

224
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,120
and just want to be left alone by the CCP—

225
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,170
don’t we all?

226
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,770
But once the CCP started destroying their
culture,

227
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,380
monitoring their every move,

228
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,300
and labeling them as terrorists,

229
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,249
it’s no wonder some of them have turned
violent.

230
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,500
And it’s no wonder ISIS is now trying to
use

231
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,979
that anger for its own terrible agenda.

232
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:40,979
Although actually,

233
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,360
in a region with 10 million Uyghurs,

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,949
ISIS has only been able to recruit 114 fighters—

235
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:49,369
which is really, really few.

236
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,100
And the number of Islamist terrorist attacks
in Xinjiang

237
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,890
has also been pretty small,

238
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,850
compared to the size of the population at
least.

239
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,850
But it’s a great excuse

240
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,170
for the world’s biggest totalitarian regime

241
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,019
to blame the world’s scariest terrorist
group—

242
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,809
and oppress millions of innocent Uyghurs,
just in case.

243
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,939
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored,

244
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,269
once again I’m Chris Chappell,

245
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,480
see you next time.

246
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,120
Don’t let the terrorists win.

Visit China.Uncensored.tv.

248
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,540
I don’t know exactly what that will do

249
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,329
to stop the terrorists from winning,

250
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,422
but at least you’ll be able to see

251
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:26,529
full half hour episodes of China Uncensored.

252
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,240
Freedom costs a buck o’five,

253
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,180
but this is for free.
