1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,950
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,390
if China keeps taking bites out of Apple,

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,820
there won’t be anything left!

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,420
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,430
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,320
Apple is finally taking a hard line

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,839
with the Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,340
over its draconian internet censorship.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,109
Apple and its CEO Tim Cook

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,519
have always been champions

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,859
of freedom of expression.

12
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,429
I mean, a few months ago,

13
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,659
he even won a free expression award!

14
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,439
Apple always goes that extra mile

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
to support free expression.

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,900
Like being the Platinum Sponsor

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,550
of the Free Expression Award

18
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,930
that Tim Cook coincidentally happened to win.

19
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,790
And now Apple is putting the screws

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,520
on the Chinese regime.

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,570
The CCP demanded Apple remove

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,980
some of the apps in the App Store

23
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,920
that let Chinese users go around

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,590
Chinese internet censorship.

25
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,880
They’re called virtual private networks

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,280
or VPNs.

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,210
VPNs are the only way Chinese netizens

28
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,860
can access the internet the rest of the world
sees,

29
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,200
including things like Facebook,

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,230
Twitter, or YouTube.

31
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,550
So when the Chinese regime made that demand,

32
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,620
Tim Cook took a stand.

33
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,610
He said, “We’re hopeful that over time

34
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,210
the restrictions we’re seeing are lessened,

35
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,550
because innovation really requires

36
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,470
freedom to collaborate and communicate.”

37
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,630
That was of course after he totally caved

38
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,920
and banned a bunch of VPNs

39
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,490
from the App Store,

40
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,850
just like the Communist Party wanted.

41
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,570
Very brave.

42
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,900
Just as brave as establishing

43
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,810
that new data center in Guizhou, China,

44
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,190
just like the Communist Party wanted.

45
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,229
That was in compliance with a new

46
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,570
cyber security law.

47
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,000
It will speed up Apple’s service

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,410
to Chinese customers,

49
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,040
as well as totally freak everyone out

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,909
because it means Chinese authorities

51
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,770
will also have access to data

52
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,690
from Apple customers in China.

53
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,940
Now Tim Cook has defended Apple’s actions,

54
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,950
following the same blueprint every company

55
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,170
operating in China uses.

56
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,700
The law is the law in China.

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,340
Our product does more good in China

58
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,780
than if we withdrew.

59
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,740
Vague, softly worded hopes

60
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,560
that the law will change someday.

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,049
Followed by complete subservience.

62
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,150
Just like the Communist Party wanted.

63
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,390
Look, when Steve Jobs said,

64
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,970
“Stay hungry, stay foolish,”

65
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,550
I don’t think he meant,

66
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,000
“Stay stupid.”

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Because over the years,

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,240
Apple has been bending over backwards

69
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,959
to please the Chinese regime

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,790
in a desperate attempt to maintain

71
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,069
its market presence in China.

72
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,760
Almost 20% of Apple’s revenue

73
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,720
comes from China.

74
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,990
Which is too bad for Apple,

75
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,780
because man, the Chinese regime

76
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,060
is really trying to screw them.

77
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,360
From bizarre fines,

78
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,920
to smear campaigns on state-run media,

79
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,450
to awarding this Chinese leather goods company

80
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,099
the right to the iPhone trademark,

81
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,099
the Chinese Communist Party

82
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,760
is not making life easy for Apple.

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,069
And for all Apple’s efforts

84
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,560
to make the regime happy,

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,569
it’s not working out for them.

86
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,130
Apple’s earnings dropped for the

87
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,740
fifth straight quarter in a row.

88
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,489
And it’s thanks largely to losing out

89
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,340
to local competitors that have state support,

90
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,620
including some that stole technology

91
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,270
and designs from Apple.

92
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,840
Not that Apple isn’t getting its just deserts.

93
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,990
But Huawei has recently said

94
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,819
it plans to surpass Apple

95
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,420
at being the world’s number one

96
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,640
smartphone manufacturer.

97
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,110
As long as the world is fine with

98
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,410
the security concerns that come with Huawei.

99
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,739
And if anyone should be an expert

100
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,550
on invading people’s privacy,

101
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,470
it’s the former head of the NSA.

102
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,599
So what do you think of Apple’s willingness
to,

103
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,170
you know, comply with Chinese law?

104
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,349

105
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,220
And coming up after the break,

106
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,500
China demonstrates its “peaceful rise.”
