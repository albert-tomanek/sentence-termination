1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,680
-it's Chris Joel.
-In space.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,800
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,520
Nice to see you, to see you...

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,560
Nice!

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,520
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,040
-You planned that?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,760
I planned nothing.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,640
In front of me I've got an article from
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,880
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,320
and there's a special prize for
particularly good answers, which is...

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,760
And today we are talking about
Juan Pujol Garcia.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,200
Juan Pujol, is there are two of them,
is he on his own?

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
It's a good job this isn't QI, Gary,

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
because at that part large klaxons would be
going off with that joke.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Just saying t*** repeatedly.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,040
Can I guess that this person is from a
Spanish or Portuguese speaking country?

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Er, yeah, Spain.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,520
-Hey!
-I don't know very much about Spain.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,200
It's funny you say
that you don't know much about Spain.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,160
Did he neither?

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,880
He didn't know much about England and that
became important during part of his life.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Did he just end up here and was like
'S***, what's this?'

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,080
Well, I'm going to have a run at this one
and miss it,

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
but was he some kind of captain
of the Spanish Armada?

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
Ooh, no,
you're far, far, far too early for that.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,680
Was he not the captain of any kind of
Spanish Armada?

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,960
Yes, but you're not getting a point
for not saying he's not something.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,120
Was he not the first man
to walk on the moon, is true.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,440
If he was too early for an armada
he's going to be too early for the moon.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,520
No, he's too … he's too late for an armada.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,800
-Too late for an armada.
-The armada was too early for him?

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,160
-Yes. The armada left, he hadn't been born yet.
-He missed the bus.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,520
It was centuries, it is centuries later.

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,120
"Did I miss the train
or did the train miss me?" he cries.

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,960
Yeah, he was centuries late for the armada,
he was born in 1912, died in 1988.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,080
Aha, that doesn't help much.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,560
It doesn’t, but he had a code name.

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,680
-Did he now?
-Given those dates,

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,560
why might you want a code name?

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,080
-Spies.
-Yes.

43
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
-Is this to do with the government of Fran...?
-Oh!

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,280
Was he a spy placed in England but
he just didn't know anything about the place?

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,600
So was he s*** spy?

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,510
No, he was a spy placed in England to look
after sheep and therefore:

47
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,820
was a shepherd-spy!

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,840
[Subtitler's note: Gary's joke is a pun on "shepherd's pie",
but for the first time in the show's history,
this pun is entirely untranslatable to text.]

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
That's not olden, that's golden.

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,040
Two people in the audience just going,
"No. No, we're not rewarding that."

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,280
No, he was … he was an excellent spy,
but for which side?

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,680
And we're talking World War 2 here.

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,400
-Both.
-Yes, absolutely right, he was a double agent.

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Is he involved
in the 'man who never was' thing?

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,360
No, this was not Operation Mincemeat.

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,480
-Right.
-This was not that.

57
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,720
Because there was someone in that who was
sending information both ways, wasn't there?

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,480
This was … this was a man who received
both an Iron Cross from Germany

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,040
and an MBE from Britain.

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,480
How can that make him a good spy?
Surely that makes him a s*** spy.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
Only for one of those sides.

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,040
♪ Dun dun dun! ♪

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,000
So during the early days of World War 2

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
he decided he had to make a contribution for
the good of humanity.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,800
And he went to the British who said…

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,720
Alright.

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
Nah.

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Have a point, Gary.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,640
Sorry, British. "...No."

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,480
Three different times they turned him down
as a spy, so what did he do instead?

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,680
Oh, did he just go in and start feeding us
information without …

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,200
without us asking him to?

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,240
"That was dreadfully rude of him
but jolly useful."

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,440
He's only helped the British without asking,
but not by talking to them.

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,760
-Oh, did he talk…
-I was…

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,240
-Chris.
-Guz... ah...

77
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,200
Posed as a British spy and fed false
information to the Germans.

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,760
Spot on, absolutely right, he …

79
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,480
he created an identity as a fanatically
pro-Nazi Spanish government official,

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
who could travel to London on business

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and he just started
sending false reports to the Germans.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,520
"Hello, I'm a fanatical Nazi. (I'm not.)"

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Which meant everyone thought he was a spy...

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,360
but he just wasn't.

85
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,240
Yes, have a point.

86
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,920
So the Germans accepted him and said,
"Okay, you're a spy now."

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,520
They gave him equipment, they gave him a bit
of money and he moved to Lisbon in Portugal.

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,200
Can he see the coast, can he see what ships
are going round Portugal?

89
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
Look at England from afar!

90
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,960
"I'd go over there to spy directly
but the weather, really."

91
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,440
His instructions were move to Britain
and recruit a network of British agents.

92
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,520
Did he pretend he was in Britain
when he was actually in Portugal?

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,600
Yes.

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,240
-Clever bastard.
-He's a really good spy,

95
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,000
He's such a good spy that he isn't a spy
and everyone thought he was a spy.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,800
And then he told them that he was spying
and he wasn't doing the spying.

97
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,840
How is he actually sending a report to them?
Because he is sending reports in.

98
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,200
Is he sending them to London who will then
direct it via London or something,

99
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
so they're coming from the right route?

100
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,000
He's just throwing them over the wall
and running away?

101
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,320
No, he's staying in Lisbon for this.

102
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,560
Pretending?

103
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,480
Yes.

104
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,640
Did he just lie?

105
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
Yes.

106
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,120
What might he have used
as a basis for that?

107
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,120
Because remember, he's just sitting in Lisbon
sending completely false reports about Britain.

108
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,360
Was he listening to British radio?

109
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Erm, newsreel reports in cinemas.

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,680
But, yeah, he's looking at the news,
and using a tourist guide to Britain.

111
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,680
Which, correct me if I'm wrong:
the Nazis could watch the news as well?

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,920
Yes. But they still believed him.

113
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Because they saw it on the news, they thought
that what he was saying was correct,

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
because he'd seen it on the news.

115
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,600
He was confirming the British propaganda

116
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,680
but by…

117
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,680
But he was, if he's dressed up as a spy saying,
"Yes, I know these things."

118
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,800
And then the news says those things because
he's already seen the news and they think he's…

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,080
Yeah, he's right.

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Yes, you're absolutely right,
that's pretty much what happened.

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
There was one slight problem, and he's putting
expense reports in, by the way here.

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,480
-He's getting reimbursed for this.
-He's living the dream now, now I'm with him.

123
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,640
What's the slight problem
with his expense report?

124
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,080
Oh, was Portuguese currency decimals,
so he couldn't forge the receipts?

125
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,040
Yes.

126
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,360
Because it's really hard to convert
decimal to an imperial currency system

127
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
because it's pegged completely differently.

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,240
Yeah, more than that, he didn't know
how pounds, shillings and pence worked.

129
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
Because he'd never been there.

130
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,160
Yes, so he's making mistakes
but the reports are still credible,

131
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,720
so credible that what happens?

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Do we spend a lot of time trying to find him
and couldn't because he's in Lisbon?

133
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,680
MI5 launched a full scale spy hunt
after they intercepted his reports.

134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,280
How can they intercept his reports
when they're coming from Portugal?

135
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Because he's probably radioing them
or Morse coding them across

136
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,960
and they'll be cracking that, won't they?

137
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,680
Yeah, through the Ultra programme, yes,
you're absolutely right.

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,040
So they did eventually move him to Britain
and they gave him a code name.

139
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,160
Was it a bit of a shock for him
to actually move to Britain?

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,160
He was given a code name
for a very British drink.

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
Crème de menthe.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,040
"Tea."

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,080
Bovril.

144
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,200
Oh!

145
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,440
And he's no idea, they're going around,
"What's your code name?"

146
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,080
-"Agent Bovril."
-"Midnight."

147
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,360
What's yours? "Bovril."

148
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,720
But they did change his code name later to…

149
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,960
-Marmite.
-Marmite.

150
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,440
Code name Garbo.

151
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Nice. So from Bovril to Garbo.

152
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
Yes.

153
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,280
An autobiography there for everybody.

154
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,360
So what was he actually sending?

155
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,720
We've got a mixture of three things here,
complete fiction,

156
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
what's the other two categories?

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
-Newspaper clippings.
-Football scores.

158
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
Genuine information of little military value,
but you know what, football scores is fine,

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,640
I'll give you a point.

160
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,080
Was he sending stuff that …
well, okay, for want of a better phrase,

161
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,400
was he leaving them breadcrumbs of things
he thought might be happening soon,

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,120
so they would keep drip-feeding very small
amounts in to keep them on the hook?

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,000
Ooh! You're close,
but there is one thing they did.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,720
He … the first bit of this
is 'valuable military intelligence'.

165
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,480
He did actually send proper intelligence to
the Germans, there's just one catch with it.

166
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,200
It was harmless,
so it was out of date or late?

167
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Yes, artificially delayed.

168
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
Ah!

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,760
So he sent perfectly accurate data,
it was postmarked in time.

170
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,920
Ah! And they're going to say,

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,320
"If we had only read this quicker,
this would have…

172
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,720
"We'd intercept this because we read this
about three days later than we could have.

173
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,520
"And if only we had more staff reading this
stuff, we would have got there quicker."

174
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
So they employed more staff, yeah?

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,600
I quote, 'We are sorry they arrived too late,
but your last reports were magnificent.'

176
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,800
The Germans wanted quicker reports
and better encryption.

177
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
They didn't get that.

178
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,080
Well, they did, what did they send him?

179
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,120
-An Enigma machine.
-Yes.

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,320
No! No!

181
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,120
You knobheads!

182
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,040
It's not an Enigma machine but it's the
strongest code book that the Germans had,

183
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,400
-was promptly sent to him.
-F***ing hell!

184
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,720
He must have thought it was bleeding Christmas
when that happened.

185
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,040
Straight down Bletchley on his bike,
"Got one!"

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,720
What was Operation Fortitude in 1944?

187
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,120
A good hearty breakfast.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,840
Did it come after Operation 39itude?

189
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,480
Oh!

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,120
No.

191
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,460
But it came immediately before
another famous operation.

192
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,740
-41itude!
-41itude!

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
I set that one up, didn't I?

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,920
-Overlord.
-Yes, which was?

195
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,080
-D-Day.
-Yes.

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
So immediately before Operation Overlord
was the D-Day landings.

197
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,480
Operation Fortitude was designed to do what?

198
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
This isn't the thing with the inflatable tanks,
is it?

199
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
Yes, it is, and in fact...

200
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,640
Mystery Biscuits.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,320
They'd made some tank shaped balloons...

202
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,680
balloon shaped tanks.

203
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,480
-Tank shaped balloons, right the first time.
-I've heard of this before.

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,760
Yeah, and they positioned them strategically

205
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,560
in exactly the place the Germans thought
they would be positioned.

206
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,920
And for some reason,
I've never quite worked out, that was enough.

207
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,240
Despite the fact I'm almost certain one of them

208
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,120
will probably have got ended up filled with
helium, it might have floated upwards.

209
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,880
I like the idea that they're not pumped up
enough and they just got really limp guns.

210
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,520
So they accept he's going to send some
genuine information.

211
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,880
And he's got the German …

212
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,440
he's got the German radio operators
listening in all night.

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,240
And he sends them, at 3am, some reasonable,

214
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,760
maybe slightly too late details of a bit of
what's going on.

215
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,000
"There's an invasion happening, you know!"

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,560
-What happened?
-The Germans were asleep.

217
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,280
-Yes.
-Oh!

218
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,560
Well, we don't know if they were asleep,
they just didn't send a reply until 8am.

219
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,840
"Sorry, was asleep, had phone on silent",
that kind of thing.

220
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,960
Yes, so what does he do
because it's now definitely too late?

221
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,480
Sends an incensed message
that they aren't listening to him.

222
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Yes. "I cannot accept
excuses or negligence."

223
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
He's bollocking them, I love it.

224
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,720
And then sends pretty much
the accurate details of the invasion,

225
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,320
which is happening right now,

226
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
and they can't do anything about
because they were too late.

227
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,400
Oh!

228
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
That, oh, that gives him a free pass.

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,240
Yes, it does.

230
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,960
Because he's like, "I would have told you
had you been awake at 3:00am."

231
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,920
The Germans paid Garbo how much,

232
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,520
over the network of agents,
over 27 fabricated people,

233
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,000
over years, I've got a number here in US dollars,
the Germans sent straight to MI5?

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
Am I allowed to guess in Reichsmarks?

235
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,520
No. But we're going to do
Price is Right rules here, as usual,

236
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,160
-closest without going over.
-US dollars?

237
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,680
US dollars, 1944.

238
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,040
One million.

239
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm going to say it's about $10.92
because they never actually paid him,

240
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,080
because he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

241
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,640
Clever, I was going to go for about 600,000.

242
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,000
Matt is closest without going over ,
340,000 US dollars.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
Ooh!

244
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,280
Went straight from the German Treasury
to the British one.

245
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,040
They might as well have just like
sent a plane over

246
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
and just bombed us with banknotes,
mightn't they.

247
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,680
He was presented with some awards for this.

248
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Best spy and also controversially, worst spy.

249
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,680
A German military award.

250
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,640
-You said the Iron Cross.
-I was hoping you'd forgotten that.

251
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,080
That must have been awkward turning up
for your…

252
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,760
because you said a George Cross
or something, didn't you?

253
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,200
-MBE, he's still wearing the MBE.
-With the Iron Cross.

254
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,360
A suspiciously Iron Cross shaped mark
on where his breast pocket was.

256
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,040
S***, did he turn up in Germany
to receive awards?

257
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,080
No, it was awarded by radio,

258
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,920
and then he received the physical medal
from one of his German handlers

259
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,320
after the war had ended.

260
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
But if he didn't like the institution

261
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,840
and he had all of these awards from two
different institutions,

262
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,720
surely he f***ing hated that.

263
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,360
Yes.

264
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
But why did he have to accept it anyway?

265
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,400
Because otherwise it would blow his cover
and he'd get killed by some mysterious agents,

266
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,240
they probably thought still existed
at the time.

267
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,040
Yes. He feared reprisals after the war.

268
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,960
Because we all assume, like,
neatly the war ended in '45.

269
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,800
They weren't very sure the war was
actually over for quite a long time.

270
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,320
Because he kind of thought,
"They'll be back", like they are in films.

271
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,440
Like there's a secret cache of Nazis that...

272
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
After the credits.

273
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,480
Yeah.

274
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,320
A single Nazi helmet pops up
out of the ground, ♪ Dun dun dun dun ♪

275
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,480
Well, you know,
70 years later they're back. Anyway…

276
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,680
Ooh!

277
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,440
So what did he do?

278
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,480
Moved to America and lived a quiet life.

279
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,040
You know what, I'll give you that, he …
he went to Angola.

280
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,240
That's not America!

281
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,400
And then went to Venezuela.

282
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,160
Like the Nazis did.

283
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,720
-So if you say America, Venezuela is sort of -
-It's South America.

284
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,920
-I'll give you the point.
-It's an America.

285
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,960
-He also did something else.
-Faked his own death.

286
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,120
Yes, he did, he faked his own death
from malaria in 1949.

287
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,280
And then...

288
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,520
changed his identity,
moved to Venezuela and lived doing what?

289
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,560
Hard drugs.

290
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
Printing expense forms.

291
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,600
Money laundering.

292
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,440
A bookshop. A bookshop and gift shop.

293
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,280
"The books are full of spies."

294
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,000
In 1971, British politician, Rupert Allason is
trying to track down Garbo.

295
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,160
Is this for his MBE?

296
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,280
-No, he's got the MBE.
-He's already got that?

297
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,680
But no one knows his real name.

298
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,960
Does everyone just know him as Bovril or Garbo?

299
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,040
Yes, essentially.

300
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,000
I like the name as a full name, Bovrila Garbo.

301
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,200
Eventually Allason tracks down someone who
supplied his full name

302
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
and knew roughly where he was.

303
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
So what does Allason then do?

304
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,440
Has he gone through every Juan Garcia in
Venezuela but there are loads of them?

305
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,280
You know, that's close enough,
I'll give you the point.

306
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,800
He went through every J Garcia in the Barcelona
phone book

307
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,760
and eventually got in touch with his nephew.

308
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,080
-In Barcelona?
-In Barcelona.

309
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,120
That's not Venezuela.

310
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
No, because no one knew where he'd gone.

311
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Oh, of course, yeah, we know that, so yeah,
"Hello was your… was anyone you know a spy?"

312
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
Yes, that's basically what happened.

313
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,200
And this person said yes and they believed him.

314
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
That's exactly the thing a spy wouldn't do.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
And you make an excellent point there.

316
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,200
I was going to say that Pujol travelled to
London and it says here,

317
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,600
"was received by Prince Philip
at Buckingham Palace".

318
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
But now you've said that, who knows who it was?

319
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,480
Because Prince Philip never met him.

320
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,440
Well, you say that, he then went to the
Special Forces Club and was reunited

321
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,800
with a group of
his former colleagues.

322
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,160
He told them he'd had plastic surgery while he
was in Venezuela.

323
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,720
And so looked and sounded different
because was…

324
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
"Oh, Bovril, up to your old tricks."

325
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
"Yeah, Bovril."

326
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,520
You do know that plastic surgery doesn't work
like it does in the Bond movies, right?

327
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
Shut up.

328
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,920
Yes, they called every single J Garcia in the
