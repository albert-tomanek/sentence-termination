1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,690
Violence erupts in Venezuela

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,940
And China will have to choose

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,140
Maduro or Guaidó?

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,599
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,450
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,810
Venezuela is in chaos.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,050
Again.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,750
Protesters and military clashed on Wednesday,

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,580
as armored vehicles drove into crowds of unarmed
civilians.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,230
Tens of thousands took to the streets,

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,400
following a call from opposition leader Juan
Guaidó

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,830
to overthrow the ruling Maduro regime.

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,250
“The call is for everyone to come out

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,980
into the streets at this moment

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,200
to give backing to what we have built over
years.”

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,240
But Nicolás Maduro is not backing down.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,460
And that’s become a big problem

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,770
for the Chinese Communist Party.

19
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,620
The Chinese regime has some tough decisions
to make

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,600
when it comes to Venezuela.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,100
First, to intervene or not to intervene?

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,830
The Chinese Communist Party has always criticized
the US

23
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,540
for getting involved in other countries’
internal affairs.

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,010
At a meeting in Beijing over the weekend,

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,240
Xi Jinping expressed that it’s “totally
unacceptable

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,170
when anyone tries to topple authorities in
a third country,

27
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,500
attempting to use force and illegal international
pressure

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,470
against a sovereign state,

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,210
in order to change the leadership there.”

30
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,190
And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,130
has said the US would potentially intervene
in Venezuela.

32
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,909
“Did the United States back this push by
Juan Guaidó

33
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,220
or give any assurances to Guaidó

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,250
that the US would support him?”

35
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,000
“Oh we've made clear assurances Wolf all
along

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,620
that we'll support Juan Guaidó and the National
Assembly.

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,070
They're the duly elected leaders of the Venezuelan
government,

38
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,530
so yes we've provided strong assurances to
them.”

39
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,530
Uh oh.

40
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,750
That’s not what the Chinese regime wants!

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,780
They’ve invested tens of billions of dollars
into Venezuela

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,409
under the Nicolás Maduro regime.

43
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,159
They supplied Venezuelan police

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,520
with a lot of their equipment.

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,810
And during this meeting last September,

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,640
Xi Jinping promised Maduro to

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
“provide whatever help it can offer.”

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,349
Part of that help included a 5 billion dollar
credit line.

49
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,709
China has also sent delegations to Venezuela

50
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,950
as a show of support for Maduro.

51
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,300
Which is why Pompeo has recently said,

52
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,969
“China and others are being hypocritical

53
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,659
in calling for ‘non-intervention’ in Venezuela’s
affairs.

54
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,349
Their own financial interventions

55
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,650
have helped destroy the country.”

56
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,830
Basically, he’s saying China has no problem

57
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,720
with countries intervening in

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,870
the internal affairs of other countries.

59
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,060
As long as the country doing the intervening
is China.

60
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
Or Russia.

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,590
Or just not the United States.

62
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,250
But that leaves another tough decision

63
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,879
for the Chinese Communist Party.

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,109
What’s the best way to intervene in Venezuela?

65
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:49,560
Will it continue to throw its weight behind
Maduro

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,349
and hope he can keep his grip on power?

67
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,139
Or should it back Guaidó?

68
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,010
Again, there’s tens of billions of dollars

69
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,590
of investment on the line.

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,650
If China backs Maduro,

71
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,989
but he gets ousted,

72
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,900
Guaidó might think twice about all that Chinese
investment.

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,419
On the other hand, if China backs Guaidó,

74
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,379
and Maduro does manage to stay in power,

75
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,419
that’s pretty embarrassing.

76
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,840
How do you explain that at your next friendship
meeting?

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,389
Everyone knows you can only have one best
friend.

78
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:21,769
And Guaidó is definitely making his case

79
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,769
to the Chinese regime

80
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,349
that he can be their new bestie.

81
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,370
He penned a letter,

82
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,340
appealing to the better nature of Communist
Party officials.

83
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,340
He wrote that

84
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,840
“At least 87 percent of Venezuelans live
in poverty,

85
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,340
subject to 90 per cent shortages in food and
medical supplies.

86
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,409
Basic services such as electricity and water
have collapsed.

87
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:48,530
The inflation rate exceeded 2.6 million percent
in January 2019

88
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,069
and threatens to reach 10 million percent

89
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,590
by the end of this year.”

90
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,769
But just in case Communist Party officials

91
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,889
don’t feel enough empathy for the people
of Venezuela,

92
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,339
Guaidó also added another incentive.

93
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:03,730
“China is the world’s largest oil importer

94
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,379
and Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves
in the world.

95
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,760
For those two reasons alone,

96
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,099
the economic relationship between our nations

97
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,099
will inevitably grow.”

98
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,430
That’s better.

99
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,250
But for now, it seems like the Venezuelan
military

100
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,430
is still backing Maduro.

101
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,120
And there’s always a chance Guaidó

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,750
could end up being detained or even disappearing.

103
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,800
Of course, if that happens,

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
the US has said military options are on the
table.

105
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,690
Or at least not off the table.

106
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,889
“I don't think anyone should be fooled,

107
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,060
that if the president makes that decision,

108
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,040
if he chooses a military option,

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,039
that the United States military has the capacity

110
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,919
to execute that option in a way

111
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,660
that will achieve the outcome the president
intends.”

112
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,930
Which is the third problem for China—

113
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,960
how to deal with the US.

114
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,730
On the one hand, the Chinese Communist Party

115
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,129
likes to act like a superpower,

116
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,790
one that resists the US.

117
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,919
Here’s China’s Foreign MInistry Spokesman

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,289
and retired Mortal Kombat character Lu Kang

119
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,150
responding to criticism from Mike Pompeo

120
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,110
about China’s role in Venezuela.

121
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,110
“US Secretary of State Pompeo willfully
tarnished China

122
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,289
and deliberately drove a wedge into relations

123
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,930
between China and Latin America.”

124
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,050
But on the other hand,

125
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,599
“China would not want to hurt

126
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,689
its all-important ties with the US

127
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,090
because of its economic and investment interests
in Latin America.”

128
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,830
China is still negotiating a trade deal

129
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,550
with the Trump administration.

130
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,060
It wouldn’t want to to jeopardize a deal
with America,

131
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,220
just to help Maduro.

132
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,030
Even less would the Chinese Communist Party

133
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,330
want to find itself in a position where Chinese
troops

134
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,740
were caught in a skirmish with US troops.

135
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,400
What do you think of China’s choices in
Venezuela.

136
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,569
Who will they give their friendship necklace
to?

137
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,740
Let me know in the comments below.

138
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,620
What’s that, Shelley?

139
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,880
Oh right.

140
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,040
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

141
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,910
a fan who support China Uncensored

142
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,659
with a dollar or more per episode,

143
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,340
by contributing through Patreon.

144
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,050
Peter Malchiodi asks,

145
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,280
“How does it make good business sense

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,580
to deal with people who will end you

147
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,319
as soon as they are done benefiting from you?”

148
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,099
Peter is asking about Western companies

149
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,270
doing business in China.

150
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,259
That’s a good question.

151
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,909
Basically a lot of Western companies

152
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,599
that have gone to China

153
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,360
end up getting their intellectual property
stolen,

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,750
or they’re forced to give it away,

155
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,439
and a Chinese company then reverse engineers
their product

156
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,980
and then out-competes the American company

157
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,069
by making cheap knockoffs.

158
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,500
And this is no accident.

159
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,280
It’s done precisely according to

160
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,159
the Chinese Communist Party’s plans

161
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,250
for economically out-competing the US.

162
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,449
So why do Western companies

163
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,199
keep jumping into the China market?

164
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,000
Because there’s money now!

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,260
Consequences are later.

166
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,229
Plus, when a lot of these companies

167
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:47,639
started getting hacked and robbed,

168
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,360
they...tried to cover it up.

169
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,780
I mean, getting taken advantage of like that

170
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
is so embarrassing.

171
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,259
What would shareholders think?

172
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,479
So wave after wave of companies go into China,

173
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,659
not knowing how previous companies

174
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:02,979
had been taken advantage of,

175
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,419
or thinking that of course they would be too
smart

176
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,139
to get taken advantage of...

177
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,810
and they keep falling for it.

178
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,280
Thanks for your question, Peter.

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,610
And thank you to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

180
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,110
who support China Uncensored.

181
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,780
It’s only because of your support

182
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,229
that we’ve been able to cover topics

183
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,500
that most other media don’t want to,

184
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,319
because standing up to the Chinese Communist
Party

185
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,080
is really hard.

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,260
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

187
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,580
See you next time.
