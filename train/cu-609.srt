00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,800
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,040
it’s a trap!

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,700
HI, Welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,540
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,769
If you’ve noticed that China seems to be
coming up

6
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,500
a lot more often in the news lately,

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,420
well, you would be right.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,600
Chinese officials are eager to make China
a superpower.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,990
And they’re doing it with the help of

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,530
an ancient Chinese Communist Party secret:

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,080
Lots and lots of money.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,660
Yes, money.

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,570
The key to a successful communist regime.

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,769
The Party has over the last few years lent

15
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,249
huge sums of money to cash-strapped countries,

16
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:40,659
and then leveraged that debt to get what it
wants.

17
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,319
A lot of this is tied to a trillion dollar
plan

18
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,229
to build infrastructure around the world

19
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,829
and then use it to create wealth,

20
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,339
mostly for Chinese companies,

21
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:51,979
move goods, mostly from China,

22
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,589
and gain influence,

23
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:56,030
mostly for the Chinese Communist Party.

24
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,109
This project is the Belt and Road Initiative.

25
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:01,319
Also known as One Belt, One Road.

26
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:04,670
Let’s get together and feel alright.

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,369
Now it’s nothing new for countries with
money

28
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:08,979
to spare to help out their needy neighbors

29
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:10,960
by offering them a loan.

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,991
Plenty of countries do it,

31
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:13,700
including the US.

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,090
But the Chinese Communist Party does it,

33
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,240
as they like to put it, “with Chinese characteristics”

34
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,200
“This stands in stark contrast to China’s
approach,

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,780
which encourages dependency using opaque contracts,

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,869
predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals

37
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,070
that mire nations in debt and undercut their
sovereignty,

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,289
denying them their long-term, self-sustaining
growth.”

39
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,200
As you might guess, some of the countries

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,789
who have made these deals with China

41
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,399
aren’t feeling so alright anymore.

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,869
On today’s episode,

43
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,420
we’ll look at five countries

44
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,799
gripped by the Chinese regime’s debt trap.

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,619
Number 5: Sri Lanka

46
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,189
The first port of call is Sri Lanka.

47
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,270
In 2010, Sri Lanka got a 1.5 billion dollar
Chinese loan

48
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,859
to build a giant port in the town of Hambantota.

49
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,409
Which would be great—

50
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,659
except it has barely any shipping traffic.

51
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,080
Without traffic through the port,

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,409
Sri Lanka realized it couldn’t pay back
its debt to China.

53
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:21,720
So instead, it signed away the entire port
with a 99-year lease.

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
The China Merchants Port Holdings

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,489
got a 70% controlling stake Hambantota port.

56
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,069
“With this agreement, we have started to
pay back the loans,”

57
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,420
the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka told Parliament,

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,660
and talked about there being more money for
economic development.

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,690
But critics say the cure might be worse than
the disease.

60
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,500
Some see the deal as a precedent for countries
that owe money

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,862
to China to accept deals that involve signing
over of territory.

62
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:51,010
Territory that the Chinese regime might want
to

63
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,629
eventually use for military purposes.

64
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,420
“There is concern that the Chinese will
transform

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,239
its 99-year lease of the Sri Lankan port of
Hambantota

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,810
into another naval base,

67
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,840
the exact ‘debt-trap’ method the Chinese
used in Djibouti.”

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
And a Chinese naval base in Hambantota

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,610
would be uncomfortably close to India.

70
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,489
Which might be one reason India might be considering

71
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,760
a deal with Sri Lanka to run what’s been
called

72
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,430
the emptiest airport in the world.

73
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,879
Sure, there may not be much air traffic,

74
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,230
in fact, there is currently no air traffic
at all,

75
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,049
but it is pretty close to the now-Chinese
port.

76
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,620
That airport, by the way,

77
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,860
was also built with the help of huge loans
from China.

78
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,709
Speaking of uncomfortably close to India...

79
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,200
Number 4: Pakistan

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,890
With an overall lending pipeline of over 40
billion dollars

81
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,219
for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,
or CPEC,

82
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,459
which is a big part of the Belt and Road,

83
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,579
Pakistan already owes China more than 6 billion
dollars.

84
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,590
That kind of debt gives China some leverage.

85
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,290
First, China took control of

86
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,019
the strategic deep-sea port of Gwadar…

87
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,959
…and will get to call the shots for 40 years
thanks to a lease.

88
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,690
And now, the Chinese military is building
a joint naval

89
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,680
and air force base for Chinese troops.

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,930
And it’s just a short distance up the coast
from Gwadar.

91
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,570
According to this report,

92
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,950
Pakistan not only owes a ton of money to China,

93
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,210
but it’s paying high interest rates on those
loans as well—

94
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,260
with some loans as high as 5%.

95
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,920
In other cases, Chinese investors were promised

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,280
crazy high returns on these infrastructure
projects—

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,030
like 34 percent each year,

98
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,580
guaranteed by Pakistan’s government for
30 years.

99
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,920
But there are signs that Pakistan isn’t
all that comfortable

100
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,050
being so heavily indebted to China.

101
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,050
Back in November,

102
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,780
Pakistan announced it would not seek Chinese
funding

103
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,320
for a new large-scale development.

104
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,190
They said China’s conditions for financing
the long-delayed

105
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,960
$14 billion Diamer-Basha dam on the Indus
River

106
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,190
“were not doable and against our interest”

107
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,290
Pakistan is also heading toward a debt crisis.

108
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,250
That means they might have to get bailed out

109
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,630
by the International Monetary Fund.

110
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,580
Which would not only be embarrassing for Pakistan
and China,

111
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,510
but also would probably limit future Chinese
investment.

112
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,680
Plus, after a recent election,

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,450
it’s not clear how the new prime minister

114
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,270
is going to treat these ongoing deals with
China.

115
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,280
Has Pakistan learned its lesson after being
forced

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,460
to let China open a military base on its soil?

117
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,660
Who knows?

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,390
But certainly it’s not enough of a lesson
to stop...

119
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,050
Number 3: Montenegro

120
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,180
What’s Montenegro?

121
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,620
It’s one of those Eastern European countries

122
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,610
that’s approximately the size of Yankee
Stadium,

123
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,650
and is located here.

124
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,340
No wait, it’s here.

125
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,070
It’s also the only country in Europe without
a highway.

126
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,960
That’s not a joke.

127
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,780
But then the Chinese Communist Party

128
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,140
offered to help Montenegro build one.

129
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,710
The Montenegro government calls “the construction
of the century

130
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,070
and a pathway to the modern world.”

131
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,360
It would be 100-mile highway with massive
bridges

132
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,870
that cut through difficult mountains and valleys.

133
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,840
But Montenegro only has 630,000 people.

134
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,800
Which is fewer people than my small neighborhood
in Queens.

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,450
So you might wonder why it has spent

136
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,110
950 million dollars on a highway.

137
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,490
Especially since no one even knows where Montenegro
is,

138
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,000
so are they really trying to get there on
a highway?

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,730
There were two feasibility studies done in
2006 and 2012.

140
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,380
Both of them suggested that their proposed
highway

141
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,830
would not have enough traffic to justify the
cost.

142
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,340
But fortunately,

143
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,410
the Chinese Communist Party was there to help
with that.

144
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,990
So construction has begun.

145
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,520
And surprise!

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,210
China got a pretty sweet deal.

147
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,100
70 percent of the workers building the highway
are from China,

148
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,160
and in case of any legal dispute,

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,630
an arbitration court in China has jurisdiction.

150
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,650
And we all know the Chinese justice system

151
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,040
is a model of fairness and rule of law, right?

152
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,740
A European Union official,

153
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,270
who asked to remain anonymous,

154
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,720
is a little less enthusiastic,

155
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,930
saying that Montenegro has run out of money.

156
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,740
“They have strangled themselves.

157
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,200
And for the time being this is a highway to
nowhere,” the official says.

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Hmmm.

159
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,110
Highway to the Nowhere Zone doesn’t sound
as cool, does it?

160
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,550
What’s worse, the road is only partly done.

161
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,530
They need another 1.2 billion dollars to finish
it,

162
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,290
which the International Monetary Fund

163
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,900
says Montenegro can’t afford to borrow.

164
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,640
With a debt to GDP ratio expected to hit 80%
soon,

165
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,270
Montenegro’s government has already had
to raise taxes,

166
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,180
freeze public sector wages and cut social
spending.

167
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,750
But Montenegro’s Prime Minister has vowed

168
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,200
to finish the highway “at any cost”

169
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,260
and promises “to deepen cooperation with
China in other areas,

170
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,850
including hydropower and tourism.”

171
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,550
And that’s exactly the kind of commitment

172
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,380
Chinese officials want.

173
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,110
Number 2: The Maldives!

174
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,950
Ah, the Maldives!

175
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,400
A tropical paradise located in...ok,

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,590
I had to look this one up, too.

177
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,150
It’s here, in the Indian Ocean.

178
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,470
Gorgeous weather,

179
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,230
secluded beaches,

180
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,500
and what’s this?

181
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,200
The China Maldives Friendship Bridge??

182
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,280
It’s a 225 million dollar bridge that’s
funded

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,849
mainly through a grant and a loan from,

184
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,589
you guessed it, China.

185
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,399
The loan is the tough part.

186
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,719
With the funding of this bridge,

187
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,670
it puts the Maldives’ debt to GDP ratio
at nearly 100%—

188
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,570
meaning it owes as much in debt as its entire
economy

189
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,110
generates in one year.

190
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,209
Sounds kind of like my student loan debt.

191
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,209
And take it from me,

192
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,790
that’s not healthy.

193
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,139
But the Maldives is already dealing with

194
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,920
being swallowed up by rising sea levels,

195
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,170
and could be underwater in 60 years.

196
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,820
So really, does it matter if they’re also

197
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,400
financially underwater from debt to China?

198
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,029
They’re like, “Yeah, China,

199
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,550
why don’t you try to collect your money
from the ocean.”

200
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,079
Well, the problem of course,

201
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,009
is that before the Maldives becomes the next
Atlantis,

202
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:24,319
the Chinese Communist Party could still force
them to, say,

203
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,939
give up land for a Chinese military base,

204
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,860
which would just so happen to be in

205
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,079
an excellent strategic location near India.

206
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:33,519
But don’t worry,

207
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,819
the Chinese Ambassador said in a recent speech

208
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:39,720
that Chinese investments in the Maldives are
totally normal,

209
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,209
and that “The allegations of ‘land grabbing’

210
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,459
and ‘debt trap’ are totally groundless.”

211
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,879
Not that anyone asked, but...

212
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,910
it’s better to get out ahead of these things.

213
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,910
Sometimes.

214
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,910
And that brings us to...

215
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,560
Number 1: Djibouti.

216
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,949
If you don’t know where Djibouti is,

217
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,970
you’ve got a problem.

218
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,240
Because I’ve talked about it so many times
on China Uncensored.

219
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,170
The African country of Djibouti is home to
China’s first,

220
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,730
but definitely not last, overseas military
base.

221
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,339
Also, it’s just a few miles down the road

222
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,699
from an American military base.

223
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,439
Giving rise to a shocking incident where Chinese
personnel

224
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:18,529
allegedly pointed lasers at US pilots.

225
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,260
Well the joke’s on them,

226
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,269
because the US military had already stopped
using cats as pilots.

227
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:28,959
But childish laser games are the least of
America’s worries.

228
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,920
The Washington Post recently asked,

229
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,439
“Can the Trump administration stop China

230
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,680
from taking over a key African port?”

231
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,120
Why would it want to?

232
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,569
Well, ever since the government of Djibouti

233
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:43,160
seized control of the Doraleh Container Terminal

234
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,160
from a Dubai-based company in February,

235
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,790
there have been reports that it plans to strike
a deal

236
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,769
with a Chinese-state-controlled firm to run
the facility.

237
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,279
And it just so happens that the port is the
main access point

238
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,079
for American, French, Italian and Japanese
bases in Djibouti,

239
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,379
and is critical to launching anti-terrorism
missions

240
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:07,080
in parts of Africa and the Middle East.

241
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,920
The U.S. military is now warning

242
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,009
that if a Chinese-state-run company gains
control of the port,

243
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,810
“U.S. national security interests will be
put at risk.”

244
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,420
Meanwhile, officials warn that Djibouti has
been growing closer to,

245
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,660
and is increasingly indebted to,

246
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,620
the Chinese government.

247
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,660
If only someone could shine a light on this
problem.

248
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,500
Some kind of bright, single-color beam of
light.

249
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,480
So what do you think of the debt traps some countries have fallen into with China?

250
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
Leave your comments below.

251
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,060
And before we go, it’s time to answer a
question

252
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:43,249
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

253
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,440
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

254
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,350
David Michael White Chris,

255
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,579
which flavor of tea would you

256
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,709
highly recommend for others to taste?

257
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,300
This is probably the most important question

258
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,220
I’ve ever answered on the show.

259
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,269
I take tea very seriously.

260
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:02,829
Years before I started China Uncensored,

261
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:05,199
I worked at a Chinese tea house.

262
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:07,509
So I know a thing or two.

263
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,490
First of all, if you ever see some kind of
blended tea,

264
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,430
like strawberry samurai green tea matcha latte,

265
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,210
run the other way.

266
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,879
Get some high quality, loose leaf tea,

267
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,309
and learn how to brew it.

268
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,209
Boiling water and green tea do not mix.

269
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,480
Start with some cheaper teas to develop your
palate

270
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,070
and gradually work your way up to more expensive
tea.

271
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,120
My favorite type is Phoenix Oolong teas.

272
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,550
And my personal favorite Phoenix Oolong tea

273
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,970
is one called Ya Shi Xiang.

274
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,460
Which means the fragrance of duck...poop.

275
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,660
To use the more--polite--translation.

276
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,939
The story goes the tea got that name because
it was so good,

277
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:51,879
locals didn’t want to share it with outsiders
so they gave it

278
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,410
a less than appealing name.

279
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,180
And that’s the lesson.

280
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,300
Jealously hoard your tea.

281
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,910
Tea’s no joke.

282
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,150
Thanks for the question!

283
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,150
And remember,

284
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,440
