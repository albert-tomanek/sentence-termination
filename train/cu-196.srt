1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,440
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,200
why Apple is giving in to Chinese censorship...

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,280
again.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,570
I’m producer Matt Gnaizda,

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,720
in for Chris Chappell, who’s out on a family
vacation.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,500
Can't wait to see those photos.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,470
Shot on iPhone 7.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,950
Speaking of which: Apple.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,070
It’s the world’s most valuable company.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,120
Its iPhones are hugely popular in China.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,170
But on December 23,

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,580
Apple made a move in China that tarnished

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,899
its international image.

15
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,510
Last month, government authorities asked Apple

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,320
to remove the English language and Chinese
language

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,800
New York Times apps

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,039
from its Chinese iTunes store.

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,109
Come on!

20
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,749
First they remove the headphone jack.

21
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,850
And now, freedom of speech.

22
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,100
Not for everyone, of course.

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,059
Just for the one-fifth of the world’s population.

24
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,010
But this is a huge tragedy for people in China.

25
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,059
How are they going to access important news,

26
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,879
like this story about three New Yorkers

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,070
co-parenting a goldendoodle?

28
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,070
Or this one,

29
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,550
about how your teenager can help you pick

30
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,490
your next multimillion-dollar real estate
property?

31
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,490
Actually,

32
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,829
with all of the rich Chinese trying to

33
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,740
park their money in US real estate,

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,329
that second article might actually be useful.

35
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:14,430
Anyway,

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,600
we could sit around

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,750
making fun of the New York Times all day.

38
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,400
And it would be so much fun.

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,850
But while we’ve criticized the Times in
the past

40
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,479
for omitting certain sensitive stories

41
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,840
from its China coverage—

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,009
and even getting a few China stories wrong—

43
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,899
it is one of the few major US media companies

44
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,750
with reporters in China.

45
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,000
And they even publish a Chinese version.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Without it,

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,409
Chinese people lose an important perspective

48
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,020
on how the Western world views China.

49
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
The funny thing is,

50
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,450
this isn’t even the first time the New York
Times

51
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,869
has been censored in China.

52
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,760
Authorities started blocking the New York
Times website

53
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,700
back in 2012

54
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,679
after it published an exposé on the family

55
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,880
of the Chinese prime minister.

56
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,570
But Chinese censors were technologically unable

57
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,719
to block citizens from directly accessing
New York Times articles

58
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,179
through its iPhone app.

59
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,240
Eventually, though,

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,320
the censors figured it out:

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,739
Just make Apple to do the censoring!

62
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,440
An Apple spokesman told the New York Times

63
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,620
that it removed their app because it was

64
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,660
in violation of local Chinese regulations.

65
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,440
Now you might be a bit surprised

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,140
that Apple would bend over backwards

67
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,000
for the Chinese authorities like this—

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
considering that,

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
last year,

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,849
Apple fought tooth and nail against US authorities

71
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,180
to protect user data.

72
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,190
That’s when the FBI wanted the company

73
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,590
to create a backdoor

74
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,159
so they could get into a suspect’s iPhone.

75
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,940
Eventually, Apple won.

76
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,909
In the sense that the Justice Department dropped
the case.

77
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,750
Because the FBI figured out how to unlock
the phone themselves.

78
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,900
After being on hold with Apple Customer Service
for 32 days.

79
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,180
But, in China,

80
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,069
a fight with authorities wouldn’t just mean
an expensive legal battle.

81
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,370
It would put Apple’s entire, multibillion-dollar
future in jeopardy.

82
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,080
Because the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t
play fair.

83
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,220
For example,

84
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,900
Apple is still fighting a ruling

85
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,350
that initially banned iPhone 6 sales

86
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,150
over a patent-infringement claim

87
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,090
by a Chinese company so small,

88
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,780
it doesn’t even have a website.

89
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,790
So in a country where the legal system is
a joke,

90
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,439
Apple probably decided it’s easier to give
in

91
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,270
than to fight its way out.

92
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,439
And the part Apple didn’t tell the public

93
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,970
is that it owes the Chinese regime a big favor.

94
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,939
You see, Apple and its China manufacturing
partner Foxconn

95
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,480
took billions of dollars in government subsidies
and perks.

96
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,340
That’s according to this damning piece

97
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,290
published in the New York Times—

98
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,610
six days after their app was removed.

99
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,079
Which is why you shouldn’t pick a fight

100
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,940
with investigative reporters.

101
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,650
Anyway, this isn’t even the first time Apple

102
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,690
has caved to the Chinese censors.

103
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,140
In 2013,

104
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,541
Apple removed an app from its Chinese App
Store

105
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:51,020
that let users get around the Great Firewall
of China.

106
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,050
They’ve also in the past removed other media
apps

107
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,050
from their app store

108
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,069
that let Chinese people read uncensored information.

109
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,770
The New York Times is just the most high-profile
example so far.

110
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,380
So what’s Apple’s motivation for kowtowing
to the Chinese Communist Party?

111
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,240
This is gonna suprise you... just kidding. It's money.

112
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,319
And it’s more about sales than just the
cheap manufacturing.

113
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,629
You see,

114
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,709
China is the world’s biggest consumer of
iPhones.

115
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,420
As of a year ago,

116
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,329
there were 131 million iPhone users in China,

117
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,330
compared to just 110 million in the US.

118
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,340
But Apple hopes it still has a ways to go,

119
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,730
since that’s still only 17% of the Chinese
smartphone market.

120
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,570
Yeah, there’s a lot of people in China.

121
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,169
So it seems poor Apple

122
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,610
has no choice but to do what the Chinese regime
tells them,

123
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,590
under the excuse of following “local regulations”—

124
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,030
and to hope that keeps the door open

125
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,520
for future sales in China.

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,100
But if Apple thinks the Chinese regime

127
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,680
intends to let them continue to be the biggest
smartphone

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,840
retailer in China,

129
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,010
they’re kidding themselves.

130
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,970
Like how eBay went to China in 2004 with big
dreams,

131
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,490
but left with its tail between its legs

132
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,419
after Chinese website Taobao

133
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,100
pushed it out of the market.

134
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,440
Google had high hopes to be

135
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,720
the primary search engine in China,

136
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,610
and even agreed to the regime’s censorship
requirements

137
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,630
initially—

138
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,979
only to be pushed out

139
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,990
by Chinese search engine Baidu,

140
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,979
whose co-founder is a member

141
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,610
of the Chinese government’s top advisory
body.

142
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,620
Microsoft assumed it would keep expanding

143
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,310
Windows in China forever,

144
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,210
only to see the Chinese government take moves
in 2014

145
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,460
to require that Windows 8 be replaced

146
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,560
with a Chinese knockoff.

147
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
And most recently,

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,130
Uber got taken for a ride

149
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,270
when it was suffocated

150
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,910
by Chinese government regulation,

151
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,270
and was forced to sell its China business

152
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,290
to a local competitor.

153
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,389
And Apple itself has gotten in trouble in
China.

154
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,509
In addition to the iPhone 6 delay,

155
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,770
Apple’s own iTunes Movies and iBooks stores

156
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,300
were shut down by government regulators.

157
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,810
And state-run media has targeted the company
as well.

158
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,009
So Apple already knows that their road in
China

159
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,640
is going to be dangerous.

160
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,570
And Apple’s not exactly bulletproof—

161
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,449
unlike those Huawei phones.

162
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,729
But they’re still holding onto dreams

163
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,449
of a larger market share.

164
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,449
The thing is,

165
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,410
the Chinese regime almost certainly intends

166
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,310
to let homegrown Chinese smartphone makers
like Huawei

167
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,910
rule in the long-term.

168
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,060
Which means that even if Apple

169
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,789
tosses its reputation into the garbage today

170
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:19,139
in exchange for a piece of the Chinese market,

171
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,139
in the end,

172
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,150
they’re going to get Shanghaied.

173
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,150
So what do you think?

174
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,150
Leave your comments below.

175
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,830
Once again, I’m Matt Gnaizda,

176
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,510
filling in for Chris Chappell.
