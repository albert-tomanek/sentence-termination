1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,690
Wow, how do make such great noodles?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,340
Shh...Ancient Chinese secret.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,460
My sister.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,320
Some hotshot!

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,360
Here's her ancient Chinese secret.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,720
Opium poppy powder.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,040
Opium poppy powder contains traces of morphine
and codeine,

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,619
for that satisfied post-hotpot feeling.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,980
Itâ€™s guaranteed to keep you coming back
for more.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,760
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,400
Well, ok.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,920
Ancient British secret.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,479
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,589
You know, it was the ancient Greek physician
Hippocrates who famously said,

16
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:48,159
"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be
thy food."

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,059
Well, that's actually the way traditional
Chinese medicine looks at food, too.

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,989
But I don't think they had this in mind.

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,569
"35 restaurants are in trouble with the Chinese government

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,860
after adding that special something to their dishes.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,580
The secret ingredient was ground poppy powder."

22
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,080
Poppy powder.

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,570
You know,

24
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,300
the stuff that's used to make morphine, opium
and heroin.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,920
Now I know why Kung Fu Panda

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,600
couldn't stop eating.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,900
Suddenly MSG doesn't seem so bad.

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,860
Five of these restaurants in China are already
being prosecuted,

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,840
while the other 30 are still under investigation.

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,890
The restaurants range from noodle shops and
dumpling joints,

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,310
to one of the most popular Beijing hotpot
chains.

32
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,560
Now it's unclear how effective it is in these
doses,

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,710
but some cooks believe adding ground poppy
powder can get customers hooked on their food.

34
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,560
Cooks? More like crooks.

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,500
I mean, can you imagine adding a potent narcotic
just to sell your product?

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,260
Anyway, I believe we have footage from inside
one of these restaurants in Chongqing.

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,380
Something with poison in it I think.

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,300
Poppies. Poppies."

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,560
Now this isn't the first time this has happened.

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,260
According to the Guardian,

41
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,090
a noodle seller was busted for this in 2014,

42
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,749
seven restaurants were closed in 2012,

43
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:15,379
and 215 restaurants were shutdown in 2004.

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,940
C'mon, people.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,560
Don't you know that China's Food Safety Law
forbids businesses

46
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,540
from selling food made with "nonfood materials
or chemicals"?

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,939
Like melamine in milk.

48
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,019
Or heavy metals in rice.

49
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,079
The problem is,

50
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,969
according to a professor from China Agricultural
University,

51
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,909
"There are so many restaurants in China,

52
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:38,309
and it is very difficult to effectively inspect
every one of them

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,700
to ensure they all follow the law."

54
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,640
That's the funny thing,

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
in a country without the rule of law,

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,159
you have a hard time getting people to follow
the law.

57
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,569
Plus, all the government's inspection resources

58
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,779
are busy spying on China's 700 million Internet
users.

59
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:59,519
Now, China seems to frequently suffer from
horrendous food scandals.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,380
Ground poppy seeds that may or may not do
anything

61
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,760
are really the least of the country's worries.

62
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,529
Toxic bean-sprouts.

63
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,149
Glow-in-the-dark meat.

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Exploding watermelons.

65
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,659
Well the list really goes on.

66
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,569
And on.

67
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,299
It's even affected Western companies operating
in China.

68
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,069
A Shanghai-based supplier was giving unsanitary
expired chicken meat to,

69
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,849
among others, Starbucks, KFC, and McDonalds.

70
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,669
Many China social commentators say it comes
from a society pushing to get rich quick,

71
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:31,590
without really thinking of the long-term consequences.

72
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,590
Case in point,

73
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,120
basing your country's energy resources around
coal.

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,129
So what do you think?

75
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,309
And if you've been to China,

76
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:42,620
go to the China Uncensored Facebook page now
and leave a comment

77
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,739
or post a video

78
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,480
about the craziest food experience you've
had in mainland China.

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,819
I may even feature the best stories in one
of my videos.

80
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,080
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
