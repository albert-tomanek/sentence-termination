00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,889
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:03,420
the head of the FBI has warned

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,990
that the CCP has spies

4
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,109
all over the United States—

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,380
including people who appear to be

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,580
ordinary students and employees.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,240
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,860
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,660
You know, some people call me paranoid.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,560
At least that’s what I imagine they’re
saying

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,580
behind my back.

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,270
But let me tell you,

13
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,539
you may laugh at this tinfoil hat now,

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,910
but I’ve heard from a very reliable source,

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,230
there are spies!

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,220
Spies everywhere!!!

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,760
Oh no, my source isn’t the homeless guy

18
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,300
down on 10th avenue.

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,380
I’m talking about head of the FBI Christopher
Wray.

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,240
“One of the things we’re trying to do

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,130
is view the China threat as not just

22
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,739
a whole of government threat,

23
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,940
but a whole of society threat on their end.”

24
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,910
Oh whoa, all Chinese people are a threat?

25
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,910
That sounds like something

26
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,860
my racist uncle Ted would say.

27
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,220
I mean seriously,

28
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,180
the head of the FBI is basically saying

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,910
Americans must band together

30
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,440
to resist the yellow menace?

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,850
I haven’t heard anything that racist since...

32
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,180
the 1943 Batman movie.

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,840
“Known as Little Tokyo.

34
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,060
Since a wise government rounded up

35
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,470
all those shifty eyed Japs…”

36
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,590
Whoa, that was a dark night.

37
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,950
But back to FBI Director Christopher Wray.

38
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,110
He was speaking at

39
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,340
Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

40
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,380
And China was a big concern.

41
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,240
“The biggest issue of our time...

42
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,729
is China and the risk they pose.

43
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,210
I’m not sure in the 240 some odd year history

44
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,590
of this nation we have ever faced

45
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,659
a competitor and potential advisory of this
scale,

46
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,440
scope and capacity.

47
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,020
Wray and other leaders of US Intelligence
agencies

48
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,630
like the NSA and CIA released this report,

49
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,229
detailing the biggest threats facing the United
States.

50
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,909
And China is named dropped a lot.

51
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,650
Cyber espionage, intellectual property theft,

52
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,850
space weapons, drug warfare—

53
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,001
it’s not looking good.

54
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,580
Also, the intelligence community

55
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,340
does not think you should buy

56
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,860
Chinese cell phones,

57
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,410
because they could be spying on you.

58
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,950
And when it comes to spying,

59
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,149
the NSA probably knows what they’re talking
about.

60
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,630
But it was Christopher Wray’s comments

61
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,349
about Chinese students studying in the United
States

62
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,909
that got some people’s backs up.

63
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,879
“Use of non traditional collectors,

64
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,519
especially in the academic setting,

65
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,200
whether it’s professors, scientists, students..

66
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,260
.it’s across basically every discipline,

67
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,269
and I think the level of naivete

68
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:29,480
on the part of the academic sector

69
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,829
about this creates its own issues,

70
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,790
they’re exploiting the very open

71
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,199
research and development environment

72
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,069
that we have, which we all revere,

73
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,099
but they’re taking advantage of it.”

74
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,019
The idea that all Chinese students are

75
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,909
potential spies for the Chinese Communist
Party

76
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,919
is a bit shocking.

77
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,859
Especially to China’s Foreign Ministry.

78
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,650
“I don't know where the United States’

79
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,999
sense of insecurity comes from.”

80
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:59,689
Well, that sense of insecurity

81
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,849
probably comes from the fact that

82
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,779
the Chinese Communist Party has been

83
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:04,150
actively trying to influence

84
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,559
and infiltrate the United States.

85
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,480
The CCP has documented this

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,169
in its own strategic papers.

87
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:12,900
The way Christopher Wray explained it,

88
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,620
he said that it’s not just official CCP
agents

89
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,989
doing the infiltration and spy work.

90
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,519
It’s “non-traditional intelligence collectors”—

91
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,859
like Chinese students at American universities,

92
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:25,329
and Chinese workers inside American companies

93
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,620
who are gathering small pieces of intelligence

94
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,930
on a large scale.

95
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,609
Christopher Wray’s statement has upset

96
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:35,280
a lot of Chinese communities inside the US.

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,029
The organization United Chinese Americans
said,

98
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,610
“painting all Chinese students

99
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,589
and indeed Chinese in America

100
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,169
with such a broad brush

101
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,379
as a national security threat

102
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,439
is paranoid, inflammatory,

103
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,569
un-American, and simply wrong.”

104
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,239
The Organization of Chinese Americans called
it,

105
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,409
“Dishonest and insulting.”

106
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,450
And John C. Yang,

107
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,959
head of Asian Americans Advancing Justice,

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,209
told the Daily Beast,

109
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,180
“We cannot have every Chinese student or
scientist

110
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,489
assumed guilty until proven innocent

111
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,909
of a national security threat.”

112
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,609
So was the director of the FBI onto something,

113
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,349
or was he just being racist and paranoid?

114
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,349
For more on this,

115
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:15,609
I’m joined by China Uncensored’s

116
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:17,019
senior Chinese person,

117
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,019
Shelley Zhang.

118
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,019
Shelley?

119
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,019
Thanks, Chris.

120
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,180
So Shelley,

121
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,030
was FBI director Christopher Wray

122
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,860
being very racist?

123
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,100
Or just a little bit racist?How about not
racist?

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,050
But he said that all Chinese students

125
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,389
are a potential threat.

126
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,789
That’s not what he said.

127
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,210
He said that the Chinese government

128
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,580
uses students and other academics as spies.

129
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,800
And that’s not racist Chris,

130
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,990
it’s just true.

131
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,990
You mean there really are

132
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,990
spies everywhere?

133
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,520
Where did I put that tinfoil hat?

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Calm down.

135
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,740
We’re not talking about James Bond, here.

136
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,490
Sure, the CCP uses professional spies.

137
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,289
But they also use part-time spies.

138
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,289
Part-time spies?

139
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:57,970
What, like they need some extra cash on the
side?

140
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,090
Or they’re pressured into it,

141
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,729
or told they’re fulfilling their patriotic
duty.

142
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:03,970
These aren’t professional spies.

143
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,939
They’re just ordinary students,

144
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,939
or employees,

145
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,729
or business owners who are in the US

146
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:10,430
for legitimate reasons.

147
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,080
The CCP just asks them to pass on information

148
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,610
every once in a while.

149
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,550
What kind of information?

150
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,770
Maybe you’re a grad student

151
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,580
doing research in a lab.

152
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,960
Maybe you just take a few photos

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
of what you’re working on

154
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,819
and send it in an email.

155
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,419
Are there a lot of these

156
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:26,930
unprofessional spies?

157
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,759
Well, it’s hard to know.

158
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,310
But according to this article,

159
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,552
a Chinese diplomat who defected said last
year

160
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:35,610
that Australia had about 500 professional
spies,

161
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,710
and up to 700 of these part-time spies.

162
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,289
That might not sound like much,

163
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,770
but if the CCP has the same number in the
US,

164
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,289
adjusted for population,

165
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,159
the US would have about 16,000 Chinese spies.

166
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,600
16,000 sounds like a lot of spies.

167
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,150
And I assume there could be even more here

168
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,930
because America is way more important than
Australia.

169
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,380
Riiight...

170
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,250
But remember that there are more than

171
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,469
330,000 Chinese nationals studying in the
US,

172
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,919
so it still would be a very small percentage.

173
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,650
So on a scale of one to infinity,

174
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,040
how worried should we be

175
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,490
about Chinese spies in the US?

176
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,050
Not that worried.

177
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,770
That’s not the answer I was expecting.

178
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,700
Look, should we be aware of

179
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,169
what the CCP is doing?

180
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,169
Yes.

181
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,659
And it’s important that the FBI is on it.

182
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,229
But most of us aren’t in a position

183
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,830
to stop Chinese spies.

184
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,439
Hey, speak for yourself.

185
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,919
Ok, sure.

186
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,360
Look, I think the Asian American groups

187
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,800
were overreacting to what the FBI director
said.

188
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,430
But they’re also right in that we shouldn’t
start

189
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,819
another yellow peril red scare.

190
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,110
We can’t suspect every Chinese person

191
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,340
of being a spy.

192
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,440
I was born in China.

193
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,870
Does that make me a spy?

194
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,050
I don’t know.

195
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,500
Does it?

196
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Are you serious?

197
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,400
Hey, you’re the one who brought it up.

198
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,370
Ok, you got me.

199
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,499
The Communist Party secretly trained me

200
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,249
in espionage tactics until I left China

201
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,189
when I was three years old,

202
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:04,690
and since then I’ve been playing the long
game.

203
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,199
First, I waited for YouTube to be invented.

204
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,279
Then I joined a YouTube channel

205
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,300
that exposes the Chinese regime.

206
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,030
Now I’m just waiting for the day

207
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,999
when I can take over the channel

208
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,879
and start broadcasting communist propaganda.

209
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,330
I can’t believe you just said all that.

210
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,800
I’m not a spy, Chris.

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Oh, I believe you.

212
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,219
You would make a terrible spy.

213
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,080
You just admitted everything!

214
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,310
Yes I did.

215
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,470
There is something that FBI Director Wray

216
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,470
talked about though,

217
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,870
that’s even more important for Americans

218
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,100
to know about.

219
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,330
The CCP’s influence activities.

220
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,669
How is that more important

221
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,090
than worrying about spies?

222
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,599
The Party puts a lot of effort into influencing

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,970
how the rest of the world sees China.

224
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,300
And they can do it in sneaky ways

225
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,800
that are hard to detect.

226
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,590
Like using the Confucius Institutes,

227
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,979
which the Chinese government sets up

228
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,039
in foreign schools and universities

229
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,759
to teach a version of Chinese culture

230
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,680
that’s approved by the Communist Party.

231
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,259
I still think spying is a bigger issue.

232
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,949
Well, they’re actually kind of related.

233
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,439
This is what Director Wray was talking about

234
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,840
when he said the FBI viewed

235
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
what the CCP is doing

236
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,379
as a “whole of society” threat.

237
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:12,840
Whether it’s spying or propaganda,

238
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,909
the CCP will use all of Chinese society

239
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,249
to get what they want.

240
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,809
Here’s another example.

241
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,059
The Chinese Students and Scholars Associations—

242
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,490
or CSSAs.

243
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,110
These groups are set up in universities

244
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,599
across the United States.

245
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,599
On the surface,

246
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,059
they exist to support Chinese exchange students,

247
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,430
organize fun group activities,

248
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,509
and so on.

249
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,169
But the CSSAs can also be

250
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,940
connected to the Chinese government

251
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,229
and help spread the Party line on China issues.

252
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,229
According to a defector

253
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,260
from China’s Ministry of State Security,

254
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,940
the CCP views CSSAs as “information collection”

255
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,130
and propaganda organizations.

256
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,450
So they’re part-time spying on us?

257
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,450
No.

258
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,610
Well, maybe some people are.

259
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,690
We don’t know.

260
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,550
But we do know that CSSAs definitely help

261
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,600
the CCP push certain views.

262
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,060
Like last year when the Dalai Lama

263
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,290
came to speak at UC San Diego,

264
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,589
the CSSA there kicked up a fuss...

265
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:06,220
after coordinating with the Chinese Consulate
in LA.

266
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,190
And this isn’t something new.

267
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,190
In 2007,

268
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,190
a human rights lawyer

269
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,630
came to Columbia University

270
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,670
to give a speech about

271
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,769
forced organ harvesting in China.

272
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,691
The CSSA organized Chinese students

273
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,620
to protest that, too.

274
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,399
On the Columbia University CSSA’s website,

275
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,769
they boasted that their constitution was reviewed

276
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,740
by the local Chinese consulate,

277
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,449
and their advisory board consisted of two
members...

278
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:29,829
also from the Chinese consulate.

279
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,339
Wait a minute, these CSSAs

280
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,459
are directly working with the Chinese government?

281
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:36,600
Some of them are.

282
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
This Foreign Policy article showed that

283
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,700
the Georgetown CSSA gets half of its annual

284
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,610
operating budget from the Chinese Embassy.

285
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,470
People have been digging up other links as
well.

286
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,910
Here’s a video from the George Washington
University CSSA

287
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,600
saying that they are directed by the Chinese
Embassy,

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,589
found by the same reporter.

289
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,700
The University of Tennessee CSSA

290
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,830
says they get funding from the Embassy.

291
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,959
They also require members

292
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,300
to believe in the one China policy.

293
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,820
The Southwestern CSSA,

294
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
which is an umbrella organization that includes

295
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,779
CSSAs from 26 US universities,

296
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,550
requires any candidates running for office

297
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,180
to be approved by the Chinese Consulate in
LA.

298
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,779
I could go on.

299
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,860
Please don’t.

300
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,380
A lot of those statements you showed

301
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,670
are in Chinese.

302
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,889
Yeah, they don’t always translate them to
English.

303
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,589
Are they trying to hide their links to the
CCP

304
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,200
by using a language spoken by 1.3 billion
people?

305
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,839
These people would make terrible spies.

306
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,000
Well, remember, a lot of the spying going
on here

307
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,471
is actually the CCP using Chinese students

308
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,480
to spy on each other.

309
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Just to make sure that they’re

310
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,009
not doing anything out of line.

311
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,220
Here’s a case of a Chinese student activist

312
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,540
who recorded a call from the Chinese police

313
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,850
asking him to spy on fellow activists.

314
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,040
Chinese students in Australia

315
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,779
have found things they said in class

316
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,630
were reported back to the Chinese police

317
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,549
by other students.

318
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:57,549


319
00:10:57,549 --> 00:10:58,549
Think about it.

320
00:10:58,549 --> 00:10:59,549
Having something you say

321
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:00,549
in a college class outside China

322
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,330
reported to Chinese authorities.

323
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,330
That’s awful.

324
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,139
I wouldn’t want to be held responsible

325
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,370
for anything I said in college.

326
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,300
Ok, so you’ve convinced me that this is

327
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,600
an issue that’s at least as important as
spying.

328
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,540
Is there anything we can do about this?

329
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,490
Well, obviously we should all expose

330
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,730
what the CCP is doing.

331
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,899
But besides that,

332
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,310
I think the most important thing we can do

333
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,580
is to separate the CCP

334
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,259
from ordinary Chinese people.

335
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,810
We need to understand that the Communist Party

336
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,160
has a very specific agenda

337
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,959
that they use Chinese people for.

338
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,970
But we shouldn’t blame all Chinese people

339
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,310
for what the CCP is doing.

340
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,500
But that’s not the way

341
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,320
a lot of Chinese people see it.

342
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
Well, that’s true.

343
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,699
The CCP has done a great job

344
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,779
of making Chinese people think

345
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,450
that the Communist Party is the same thing

346
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,930
as the country, and the people.

347
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,040
If we do the same thing,

348
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,709
we’re helping them.

349
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,630
Look, imagine being a Chinese student

350
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,630
here in the US.

351
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,000
It’s a completely different language and
culture.

352
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,079
You can be pretty isolated

353
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,230
from mainstream American society.

354
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,560
And you’re constantly told,

355
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,630
by Chinese media,

356
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,440
by the Chinese education system,

357
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,459
by your friends,

358
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,190
that America just wants to keep China down—

359
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,800
and therefore keep you down.

360
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,579
If people start calling you a Chinese spy,

361
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,970
doesn’t that just make you believe it’s
true?

362
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,370
So what are you saying?

363
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,410
I’m saying:

364
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,480
Don’t vilify Chinese people.

365
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,649
Treat them like individuals.

366
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,800
Isn’t that part of what

367
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,460
makes America great?

368
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,949
So you’re saying we should...

369
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,440
make America great again?

370
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Why do I even bother?

371
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,639
Thanks Shelley.

372
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,639
So what do you think?

373
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,639
Leave your comments below.

374
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,670
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

375
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,660
See you next time.

376
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,960
With basically every company

377
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,290
desperately trying to get into the China market,

378
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,720
and selling out in the process,

379
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,450
it’s hard to find advertisers

380
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,980
willing to support China Uncensored.

381
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,370
But Thrive Life believes in our show,

382
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,699
and, wants to feed you.

383
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,790
They have ready to go meal delivery service

384
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,459
with gluten free, organic, and GMO free options.

385
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,779
If you make a purchase through the link below,

386
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,459
China Uncensored gets a commission.

387
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,620
You’ll be supporting the show you love,

388
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,700
and getting some pretty great tasting food
as well.
