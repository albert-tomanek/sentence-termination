1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,120
Police draw their weapons in Hong Kong

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,330
Will months of protests be stopped with force?

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,660
Or will there be a peaceful resolution?

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,400
Welcome back to China Uncensored;

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,530
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,560
Hong Kong is on the brink of becoming

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,330
the next Tiananmen Square Massacre!

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,920
Or else everything is going to be totally
fine.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,330
Depends on who you ask.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,939
But it's definitely somewhere on that spectrum,

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,730
between huge massacre and nothing at all.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,950
Hong Kong has been embroiled in two months
of protests.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,180
Citizens are fighting a last ditch battle
against

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,410
the Chinese Communist Party’s attempt

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,390
to destroy the freedoms in the city.

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,230
On August 18, a quarter of the city came out
to march.

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,420
There have also been a number of smaller protests,

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,250
like the 10,000-person protest in Tsuen Wan
on Sunday.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,960
That’s the same area where men in white
shirts

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,650
had attacked protesters two weeks ago.

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,330
The protesters on Sunday were largely peaceful,

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,330
but towards the end,

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,570
a few of them threw bricks and molotov cocktails
at the police.

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,620
And police responded—

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,990
with tear gas...

26
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,280
and water cannons.

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,240
And police even drew their service weapons

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,520
and pointed them at protesters.

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,900
That happened after protesters chased the
police

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,760
with sticks and one police officer

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,150
“fired a warning shot into the air after
another officer fell.”

32
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,479
One local resident,

33
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,940
not a protester,

34
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,460
went on his knees in front of the police to
ask them not to shoot,

35
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,409
and got kicked in the stomach.

36
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,409
But according to a police spokesperson,

37
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,850
that was just a natural reaction.

38
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,810
But with the protests now continuing into
their 12th week,

39
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,350
is there an end in sight?

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,510
According to this article,

41
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,130
a prominent pro-Beijing Hong Kong legislator

42
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,440
says he was informed by “a reliable source”

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,909
that the Chinese military will send in troops

44
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,729
if protests don’t end by early September.

45
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,210
Which is…next week.

46
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,640
Why the tight early September deadline?

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,100
Because October 1 is the 70th anniversary

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,310
of the People’s Republic of China—

49
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,500
that is, the day the Chinese Communist Party
defeated the KMT

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,520
and took over the country.

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,680
According to Michael Tien,

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,580
“the last thing Beijing wants to see is
attention

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,380
focusing instead on violent clashes,

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,000
or even a peaceful march involving

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,400
hundreds of thousands of people here on that
day.”

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Which makes sense.

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,490
It’s hard to throw a party

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,740
when the guests keep complaining that they
don’t want to be there.

59
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,040
While handcuffed to their chairs.

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,150
That’s why Tien predicts that if the protests

61
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,310
are still going on in September,

62
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,630
either Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam

63
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,630
will ask for the People’s Liberation Army
to come to Hong Kong,

64
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,020
or China just will just send in the troops
of their own accord.

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,390
Of course, the logic of massacring innocent
protesters in September,

66
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,450
to make the Party look good in October...

67
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,160
that doesn’t exactly hold.

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,980
It *would* get the world’s media attention
focused on China,

69
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,319
but as my first grade teacher used to say,

70
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,690
“Negative attention is the wrong kind of
attention, Chris.”

71
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,200
Obviously Miss Armstrong didn’t know what
she was talking about.

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,870
Anyway, Michael Tien’s larger point was
that the Hong Kong government

73
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,959
needs to “take decisive steps to address
the key demands of protesters”

74
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,629
and said that he personally recommends

75
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,770
“the complete withdrawal of the [extradition]
bill,

76
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,060
and [setting up] the committee of inquiry”

77
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,030
So Michael Tien is urging Chief Executive
Carrie Lam

78
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,260
to meet the protesters’ demands.

79
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,970
And remember, he’s a *pro-Beijing* lawmaker.

80
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,560
In fact, many pro-establishment people have
been urging Carrie Lam

81
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,030
to withdraw the extradition bill and set up
a police inquiry.

82
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,410
But it seems like there are some things she
just can’t do.

83
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,270
So does that mean the troops are going to
roll in?

84
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,270
Not necessarily.

85
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,099
There’s another prediction on the other
side of the spectrum.

86
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,519
According to the Chinese edition of the Epoch
Times,

87
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,560
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has recently ordered

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,099
Hong Kong authorities to “Stand Still.”

89
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,099
According to an insider,

90
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,980
“Xi Jinping would not order

91
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,620
‘sending troops’ to Hong Kong.”

92
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,730
Because, as Xi Jinping’s first grade teacher
used to say,

93
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,950
“Negative attention is the wrong kind of
attention, Jinping.”

94
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,840
Wait, Xi Jinping had Miss Armstrong, too?!

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,810
But more importantly, US officials have threatened

96
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,840
to tie US-China trade to a peaceful resolution
in Hong Kong.

97
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,150
And while Xi Jinping may not care about human
rights,

98
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,660
he does care about the Chinese economy.

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,370
Because he needs a strong economy to stay
in power.

100
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,370
But it’s important to note that

101
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,930
both the Epoch Times and Michael Tien’s
statement

102
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,770
rely on “insiders” and “reliable sources.”

103
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,650
So it’s hard to tell who’s right.

104
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,669
But one thing is clear,

105
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,131
even though the Chinese Communist Party

106
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,300
isn’t sending in the troops yet,

107
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,080
that doesn’t mean they’re not fighting
back.

108
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,180
From a propaganda campaign designed to make

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,430
the Hong Kong protesters look like violent
rioters

110
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,199
To having police infiltrate the protesters

111
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,830
To encouraging violence against the protesters

112
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,229
To forcing companies to condemn the protests

113
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,740
The Chinese regime is trying to turn the rest
of Hong Kong society,

114
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,310
and really, the rest of the world,

115
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,240
against the protesters.

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,880
But it doesn’t seem to be working.

117
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,710
Hong Kongers have staged a variety of peaceful
protests

118
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,360
over the past few days.

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,479
From this extremely boring march involving

120
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,400
thousands of accountants...

121
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,580
yes, accountants...

122
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,800
to this also very boring protest by relatives
of police officers.

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,690
And then there was the actually quite impressive
human chain.

124
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,280
See, 30 years ago, two million people joined
hands

125
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,880
to form a human chain across the three Baltic
states—

126
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,360
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

127
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,560
They were calling for independence from the
Soviet Union.

128
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,350
The protest became known as the Baltic Way.

129
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,130
And those were in the days before Purell.

130
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,350
Well, on Friday, the 30th anniversary of the
Baltic Way,

131
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,400
hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,009
joined hands in a similar protest.

133
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,020
They were calling for, you know,

134
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,250
police to not hurt people and stuff.

135
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,100
They spread out all across Hong Kong Island

136
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,200
and parts of Kowloon.

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,199
They even climbed up Lion Rock,

138
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,810
where 5 years ago protesters hung this banner

139
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,460
for the Umbrella Movement.

140
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,590
It looked kind of awesome this past Friday
night.

141
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,600
And it’s also a pretty bold symbol that
the people of Hong Kong

142
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,070
are going to come together no matter what.

143
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,560
And so the Chinese Communist Party might not
want to risk

144
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,020
sending in the troops for a massacre—

145
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,270
unless they’re to massacre millions of people.

146
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,860
Oh, and all the journalists.

147
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,310
All these people in yellow vests are journalists.

148
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,490
And they’ll have their cameras rolling the
whole time.

149
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,050
That’d be some serious negative attention.

150
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,300
So what do you think?

151
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,440
Leave your comments below.

152
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,300
And now it’s time for the last part of the
show,

153
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,450
where I pull a question out of a hat.

154
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,970
It’s a reward for the fans who support China
Uncensored

155
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,090
by contributing to us through the crowdfunding
website Patreon.

156
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,090
Zhou Rui asks:

157
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,220
“Is the new bridge between mainland China
and Hong Kong

158
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,790
the likely path of the upcoming invasion by
the PLA?”

159
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,120
Good question.

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,190
It sounds like you’re talking about

161
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,540
the new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge,

162
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,150
which opened 10 months ago.

163
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,570
The bridge was designed for an invasion,

164
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,690
but not the military kind—the economic kind.

165
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,139
The idea was that the more integrated Hong
Kong

166
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,819
can be with mainland China’s economy,

167
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,350
the more people there would prosper,

168
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,850
and the more they’d love the Communist Party.

169
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,250
That turned out to...not be the case.

170
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,550
But the bridge itself is too small for a military
invasion,

171
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,060
and too easy to block.

172
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,460
Also, the bridge from Zhuhai and Macau

173
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,630
only goes to Lantau Island,

174
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,330
and from there troops would need to cross

175
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,530
two smaller bridges to get to the New Territories,

176
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,250
which is the main land mass of Hong Kong.

177
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,930
The best place to launch a ground invasion
from is Shenzhen,

178
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,850
which shares a border more than 12 long long
with Hong Kong.

179
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,500
And that’s why the People’s Armed Police

180
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,479
have been using Shenzhen for drills.

181
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,690
You know, general practice drills.

182
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,020
Thanks for your question.

183
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,870
And thank all of you for watching.

184
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,431
Support our continued coverage of Hong Kong

185
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,610
by pledging a dollar or more per episode

186
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,050
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

187
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,120
YouTube is demonetizing all of our Hong Kong
coverage

188
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,389
so we really rely on your support.

189
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:07,640
Go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn
more.

190
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,860
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

191
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
See you next time
