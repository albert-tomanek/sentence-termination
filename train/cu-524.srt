1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,350
The Chinese regime is trying to destroy religion

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,169
But Bitter Winter is exposing what’s happening.

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,670
But getting these stories out of China

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,740
Can be deadly.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,360
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,911
The officially atheist Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:24,090
has launched an unprecedented war on religion.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,190
But to get away with it,

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,590
the Party needs to move in secret.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,539
And that’s what makes Bitter Winter a thorn
in Beijing’s side.

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,910
For over a year, the online magazine

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,480
has been getting exclusive stories and video
out of China,

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,260
shining a light on what the Communist Party

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,890
tries to keep in the dark.

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,460
But the battle has not been fought without
a cost.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,760
Shelley Zhang went to Milan to sit down with
Marco Respinti,

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,949
the Director-in-Charge of Bitter Winter.

19
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,960
Mr. Respinti, thank you for joining us in
this park in Milan.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,050
Thank you.

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,569
Your magazine last November published

22
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:57,960
a ground breaking video of what the Chinese
communist party

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,769
calls the vocational schools in Xinjiang for
the Uyghur muslims.

24
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,310
We're going to play a little clip from the
video now.

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,940
Could you tell us why this video's so important?

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,940
Yes.

27
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,909
We know for sure that Xinjiang is full of
detention camps

28
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,890
that CCP is calling something like training
school

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,770
or vocational school, professional schools.

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,100
We know for sure again that they are there.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,380
There are proofs.

32
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,399
There are evidences of that.

33
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,469
For the first time, Bitter Winter was able

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,950
to release some footage from within

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,079
one of those detention camps

36
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:44,759
and this is something very cool, something
very unique.

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,950
In fact, it was a very successful video.

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,189
This documents without any doubt that the
CCP

39
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,490
is lying when it says that those camps are
school

40
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,499
for supposedly professionals.

41
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,310
They are as you can see from the footage,

42
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,539
they are indeed prisons, detention camps,

43
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,200
detention places, jails.

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,150
They are devised for detaining unlawfully
people

45
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,360
and unlawfully because they had no trial.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,640
They had no, in many case, they had no official
charges.

47
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,030
One of the reasons why this is so important

48
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:39,670
is that it shows people what these so called
schools are.

49
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,550
They are lies and they are jails.

50
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,490
Has the Chinese communist party responded

51
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,810
to the release of that video?Well, they didn't
respond directly because

52
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,720
it's quite impossible to respond directly.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,180
Other than saying that this is a fake thing,

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,290
but you can demonstrate that it's real footage.

55
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,000
They did it indirectly and they,

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,330
this is a common policy of the CCP.

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,290
They did it indirectly in two ways.

58
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,290
First of all,

59
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,460
in the beginning, they denied that they had
any camps.

60
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,970
Then when we and other people published articles,

61
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,660
resources and then the video, they said yes.

62
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,190
This is a school again.

63
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,760
The third way of trying to respond to that
is silence

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,060
which is very revealing.

65
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,620
They are not dealing directly with things
like our video

66
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,810
and this tells a lot of what is the truth.

67
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,110
That video showed a so called vocational training
center

68
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,440
which is for adults to go to,

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,410
but your organization also released a video

70
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,210
about what happens to children in Xinjiang.

71
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,860
Could you tell us a little bit about that?

72
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,860
Yes.

73
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,840
One of the dramatic part of this tragedy

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,570
is then when adults are put into jail, detention
camps.

75
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:11,210
They are put in families like mother, father,

76
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,040
uncles, aunts, grandma, grandpa,

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,840
they try to erase the whole family.

78
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,010
What remains out of that many times are children.

79
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:27,320
Underaged children that are left to no one.

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,410
This CCP manages to take care also of them

81
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,150
and there are special structures, special
camps,

82
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:44,760
special vocational camps for children—and
this is a very clever move that the CCP makes

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,410
because here in the sense the importance of
education

84
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,750
and they try to indoctrinate to the communist
ideology

85
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,160
this younger children starting from a very
young age.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,070
Putting in jail or in detention camps,

87
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,040
their families, their relatives,

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:12,380
easy for them the way 
to indoctrinate them

89
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,780
because they take care completely of them.

90
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,000
We know and we published, released the video

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,940
that there are special structures also for
children.

92
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,250
Essentially they are creating orphans

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,380
by taking away their family members

94
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,510
and then putting them in places where they

95
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,790
are educated or brainwashed by the state?

96
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,790
Yes, of course.

97
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,780
We've published many articles

98
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,660
just saying that one of the policies of the
CCP

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,740
is destroying families because they can divide
people

100
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,590
and rule upon them much more easily this way.

101
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,400
How was Bitter Winter able to get videos

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,250
like the ones that you talked about out of
China?

103
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,620
One of the unique features, peculiarity of
Bitter Winter,

104
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,560
is that of having many correspondents and
journalists in China.

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,110
Of course, they work undercover.

106
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,760
They work at the risk of their own lives

107
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,260
and sometimes the risk is very high,

108
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,460
but this is the only way first of all

109
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,190
to get real stuff out of China

110
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,860
to have the truth and to publish reliable
things.

111
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,490
Of course there is a long process through
which we verify

112
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,850
what we get from inside China,

113
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:37,330
but this peculiarity makes Bitter Winter unique.

114
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,590
The risk that these journalists or correspondents

115
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,020
take on themselves put them in real danger.

116
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,540
In more or less six months,

117
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,660
45 of them last year had been arrested.

118
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,830
Half of them,

119
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,840
more or less have been released after that,

120
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,160
but the second half just disappeared.

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,270
We know nothing on them.

122
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,960
The guy who published the video on the Uyghurs

123
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,300
from the detention camps,

124
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,060
inside the detention camps was one of them.

125
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,750
In fact, we published his video

126
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,169
after he has been already arrested

127
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,630
and we didn't know.

128
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,290
We published the video and he was already
in jail.

129
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,310
He's one of the people about whom we know
nothing.

130
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,430
He disappeared.

131
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,300
Do you know if he was arrested for filming
that video?

132
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,340
We are not sure.

133
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,650
We don't have any proof, but we suspect that.

134
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:47,740
We know for sure and we published documents
from within the CCP,

135
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,229
mentioning namely Bitter Winter

136
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:52,930
and pointing at Bitter Winter as an enemy,

137
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,540
as a danger for the state, for the CCP, for
the regime.

138
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:02,680
We are sure that if they know that people
work with us,

139
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,110
they go after them.

140
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,150
From what you said, they really are risking
their lives

141
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,150
to report some of these things and take them
out of China.

142
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,350
Why do they do that?

143
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
Totally.

144
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,350
They risk their lives ...

145
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,290
I think they do that for an easy reason.

146
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,570
Not doing that would be worse.

147
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,199
They think that helping Bitter Winter

148
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,189
speaking the truth all over the world will

149
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:36,269
in some way or another help their cause

150
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,099
and their cause is freedom and respect for
human rights

151
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,639
and human liberty and for religious freedom.

152
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,980
Once our correspondents were arrested as I
said,

153
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,100
half of them have been released and we were
thinking

154
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,550
of maybe stopping what we were doing

155
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,040
because that would put people in danger.

156
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,079
When those people that were arrested

157
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:06,810
and then liberated knew that, they told us,

158
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,810
"No.

159
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,810
Please don't stop.

160
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,069
We'll keep on.

161
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:11,069
We'll continue."

162
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:15,009
This is very rewarding and they're doing it.

163
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,819
They're still reporting.

164
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:20,050
Tell us a little bit about why Bitter Winter
was founded?

165
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,279
Why focus on religious persecution in China?

166
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,690
One of the other peculiarities of Bitter Winter

167
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,759
is that it is kind of a regional combination

168
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,819
between professional journalists,

169
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,790
activists for human rights,

170
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,510
refugees excised from China,

171
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,529
escaping in the West

172
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,939
and other countries and academic scholars.

173
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:47,569
I am the director in charge.

174
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:48,930
The editor of Bitter Winter

175
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,889
and to some extent the founder

176
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,079
is professor Massimo Introvigne,

177
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,439
a very well known scholar worldwide of religion.

178
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:01,579
I mean, he's a scholar of new religious movement
and religion.

179
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,509
He got interested in the study of religion
in China

180
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,660
and very soon he realized that

181
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,949
it's not possible to start a religion in China.

182
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:13,540
Academically only without taking care

183
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,910
or at least paying attention

184
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,319
to the problem of religious freedom.

185
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,769
He got the idea that starting religion,

186
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,730
we need to do something to address the topic

187
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,860
of religious persecution and religions freedom.

188
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,509
He managed in that two months,

189
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:33,369
he managed to put together different people.

190
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:34,370
He was an academic.

191
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,149
He needed some activists.

192
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,999
He needed some journalists to do the real
work

193
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,819
so we put together this very unique combination
of people

194
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,259
and that's Bitter Winter.

195
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,929
In just over a year and a half,

196
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,670
you've already come to the notice

197
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,449
of the Chinese communist party as you said.

198
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,429
Yes, yes, yes.

199
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,360
This means that we're doing the right thing

200
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,250
and I'm not taking the merit to bat.

201
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,160
We westerners are not taking the merit to
bat.

202
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,959
The merit goes to those people that I just
mentioned.

203
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,300
They are in China.

204
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,350
They risk every day of their lives.

205
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,980
They risk every day their job,

206
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,079
their family and their health,

207
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,290
but they keep on.

208
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,929
They deserve all the credit to do that.

209
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:26,290
Without them, Bitter Winter would be nothing.

210
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,660
Thank you so much for joining us today.

211
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Thank you.

212
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,740
Join us next week for Part Two,

213
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,370
which Marco Rispinto talks about

214
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,499
how the Communist Party puts religions in
three categories:

215
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,019
Black Market, Gray Market, and Red Market.

216
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,199
And then uses those to undermine people’s
beliefs.

217
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,180
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

218
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,740
Thanks for watching China Uncensored
