1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,270
The Central Threat of our Times

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,279
is the Chinese Communist Party.

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,110
And a coverup of the Wuhan Coronavirus.

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,460
That and more today’s China News Headlines.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,640
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,860
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,490
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,680
First up, the Wuhan coronavirus.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,570
We’re not going to tell you what the latest
numbers are,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,150
because the situation is moving so quickly,

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,060
by the time you watch this video,

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,740
they will be different.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,790
But we can tell you more about the coverup.

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,250
Remember those eight people who were detained
by police

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,200
for “spreading rumors” about the coronavirus
back in December?

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,310
It turns out, they were all doctors!

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,310
The Beijing Youth Daily interviewed the original
doctor

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,480
who spread the so-called rumor.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,881
It turns out, the doctor

20
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:55,070
“had warned a WeChat group of former medical
school classmates

21
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,850
about seven patients from a local wet market”

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,720
who were exhibiting symptoms that he initially
thought was SARS.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,940
After screenshots from the private group leaked
on social media,

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,560
“The doctor was summoned to a police station

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,750
and forced to confess his error

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,000
and pledge not to repeat it.”

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,070
So were the other doctors in the group chat,
apparently.

28
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,540
According to the Beijing Youth Daily,

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,700
the doctor is now himself in an isolation
ward

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,600
after he fell ill while treating patients.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
As you can imagine,

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,870
this news has contributed to the ongoing backlash

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,299
against Chinese officials for covering up
news about the virus.

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,870
People are so unhappy,

35
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,049
that even the Supreme People’s Court has
published an article

36
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,619
about how that the police were wrong for detaining
the doctor.

37
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,340
The good news is, the Chinese Communist Party

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,830
has obviously learned their lesson about the
need

39
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,080
for greater openness in this time of crisis.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,840
Which is why the Party has ordered the article
about the doctor

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,880
be deleted from the internet.

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,380
Nothing to see here, folks.

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,840
Ok, so maybe propaganda can’t defeat the
new coronavirus.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
But you know what can?

45
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
Drones.

46
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,640
Specifically, drones that yell at you.

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,920
Yes, auntie, this is the drone speaking to
you.

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,060
You shouldn’t walk about without wearing
a mask.

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,840
Yes, you’d better go back home and don’t
forget to wash your hands.

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,420
You see we’ve been telling people to stay
at home but you still wander outside.

51
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,080
Now a drone is watching you.

52
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,540
My favorite state-run media, The Global Times,

53
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,669
published this compilation of drones in China
policing people

54
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,749
and telling them to wear masks,

55
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,360
or go back home.

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,829
Clearly, the best way to keep people healthy

57
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,859
is to scare the bejeezus out of them,

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,220
and then post that footage on China’s version
of TikTok.

59
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,340
Hey kid! We are in unusual times!

60
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,680
Don’t stroll around outside!

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,200
You don’t even wear a mask.

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,680
Hurry up and go back home!

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,600
The coronavirus is very serious...

64
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,760
Run!! Don’t come outside.

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,420
Staying home is contributing to society.

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,319
That little girl just got yelled at by a drone.

67
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,939
She’s never leaving her house again.

68
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,079
In non coronavirus news,

69
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,719
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

70
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,779
had some pretty harsh words for China.

71
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:20,459
“The Chinese Communist Party presents the
central threat of our times.”

72
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,459
Central threat?

73
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,159
Personally, I feel like it’s that second
helping of pancakes.

74
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,739
Sure, it tastes great.

75
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,379
But don’t expect your day to be productive
anymore.

76
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,189
And too much of it will probably give you
a heart attack.

77
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,449
But Pompeo has reason for singling out the
Chinese Communist Party.

78
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,760
The chairman of Harvard’s Chemistry Department
Charles Lieber

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,590
was arrested on charges of lying about

80
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,549
getting millions of dollars in Chinese funding.

81
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:47,439
He’s a pioneer in the field of nanotechnology.

82
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,699
That’s something the Chinese Communist Party

83
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,449
is extremely interested in.

84
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,809
And I know about mostly through Metal Gear.

85
00:03:55,809 --> 00:04:00,379
The nanomachines inside soldiers bodies adapt
to different conditions,

86
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,939
promoting the release of neurotransmitters,
hormones, and stimulants,

87
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,099
giving them an edge in battle.

88
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,150
The US was funding Lieber’s research with
$15 million dollars.

89
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,659
At the same time,

90
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:15,719
he was part of China’s Thousand Talents
Plan.

91
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,719
As part of that,

92
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:21,340
a Chinese tech university gave him $1.5 million
dollars

93
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,530
to set up a research lab in China.

94
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,190
“The school also agreed to pay him a $50,000
monthly salary

95
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,030
and offered about $150,000 in annual living
expenses

96
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,060
for “significant periods” from 2012 to
2017.”

97
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,430
As a side note, that Chinese tech university
was located in Wuhan.

98
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,040
So lucky for him, now that he’s been arrested
in the US,

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
he won’t have to go back to Wuhan—

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,190
where the coronavirus has been spreading.

101
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,090
There were two other people charged

102
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,970
along with professor Charles Lieber:

103
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,330
One is Yanqing Ye,

104
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,320
a Chinese robotics researcher at Boston University.

105
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,150
She had concealed that she was also in the
Chinese army.

106
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,990
The other is Zaosong Zheng.

107
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,680
He’s a cancer researcher who was caught
traveling to China

108
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,130
with 21 vials of biological samples.

109
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,790
There’s also been a string of Chinese “students”

110
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,540
getting caught spying at the Key West Navy
Base.

111
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,700
Pretty freaky stuff.

112
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,820
There’s also been an increase in trademark
theft

113
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,180
committed by Chinese factories.

114
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,920
According to China Law Blog,

115
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,380
Chinese factories are stealing intellectual
property

116
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,660
much faster than even a year ago.

117
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,980
It comes as they fear US companies

118
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,680
will move their manufacturing out of China

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,310
because the trade war has made China production
more expensive.

120
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,060
Despite warnings from the US,

121
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,920
the UK has given the go ahead Chinese telecom
giant Huawei

122
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,440
to build part of its 5G network.

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,590
I believe we have footage of the UK’s prime
minister on this issue:

124
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,660
Tell me why.

125
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,770
Ain't nothin' but a heartache.

126
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,770
Tell me why.

127
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,450
Ain’t nothing but a mistake.

128
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,660
I never want to hear you say...

129
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,600
But I want it Huawei.

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,340
Huawei has connections to the Chinese military.

131
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,400
This makes the entire UK telecom system vulnerable.

132
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,660
And that also puts the US system at risk by
proxy,

133
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,480
as well as jeopardizing the entire Five Eyes.

134
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,020
That’s a security alliance between the US,
UK,

135
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,670
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

136
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,180
So the UK’s decision is very, very stupid.

137
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,660
Do they not get China Uncensored in the UK?

138
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,850
And the European Union is also rather stupid
about this whole thing.

139
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,520
The European Commission has set new guidelines

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,100
that basically leave the decision to use or
ban Huawei

141
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,020
up to individual countries.

142
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Letting countries make their own decisions
is not a problem per se.

143
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,280
But it’s a concern in this case because\hthe
Chinese regime

144
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,240
has been working to pick apart the EU country
by country.

145
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,440
Through investment deals, which often include
Huawei deals,

146
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,810
China is able to buy off European countries.

147
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,280
Greece is a great example.

148
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
After heavy Chinese investment in its struggling
economy,

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,500
Greece blocked the EU from criticizing China’s
human rights record.

150
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,950
Now, China is using Huawei as a wedge issue
across Europe.

151
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,180
Germany is especially at risk.

152
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,740
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has favored
a Huawei deal.

153
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,800
It’s nice to know that despite Brexit,

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,900
Boris and Angela still have one thing in common.

155
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,960
Merkel is pushing for Huawei

156
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,030
even against the recommendations of her own
intelligence agencies.

157
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,030
In other words…

158
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,520
“The Chinese Communist Party presents the
central threat of our times.”

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,970
And that does it for this week’s China News
headlines.

160
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,970
What do you think?

161
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,520
Let me know in the comments below.

162
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,500
Be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon

163
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,980
so you’ll get notified when new episodes
come out.

164
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,400
And as I’ve mentioned before,

165
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,190
YouTube often demonetizes episodes like this,

166
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,410
because they’re too controversial.

167
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,180
We would have been run out of business years
ago,

168
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,640
if it weren’t for fan support

169
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,000
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,850
So as a thank you to these fans,

171
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,710
I answer their questions at the end of some
of my episodes.

172
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,990
This question comes from Kevin Oberdick.

173
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,290
“How did the KMT Party morph into a pro-unification
party?

174
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,050
Is Chiang Kai-shek rolling over in his grave?

175
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,830
Or, what am I missing?”

176
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,140
Very interesting question.

177
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,260
So the KMT party was the party of the Republic
of China.

178
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,519
They were the government of China

179
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,740
before the Chinese Communist Party won the
Chinese Civil War,

180
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,839
and the KMT retreated to Taiwan.

181
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,909
Today Taiwan is a multi-party democracy,

182
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,100
so the KMT is just one of many parties.

183
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,370
But it is known as generally a more Beijing-friendly
party.

184
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,379
So how did the mortal enemy of the CCP have
such a drastic turn around?

185
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,339
Well, that’s a pretty clear example of just
how successful

186
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,370
the Chinese Communist Party is at infiltrating
groups and subverting them.

187
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,319
Money is a big part of it.

188
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:13,149
The KMT argues that Taiwan needs closer economic
ties to China

189
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:14,820
for the economy.

190
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,860
And maybe KMT politicians get some money for
that view along the way.

191
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,279
There are claims that China spent 200 million
dollars in the last election

192
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,930
to support the KMT candidate.

193
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,499
But also, keep in mind there’s a spectrum
to the current KMT.

194
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,240
No prominent KMT politician is arguing

195
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,389
for a one country two systems arrangement
like Hong Kong.

196
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,570
At least not any more.

197
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,430
Some, as I said,

198
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,319
genuinely believe the Taiwanese economy

199
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:46,149
requires close dealing with the Communist
Party.

200
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,290
I mean, the best way to make money is to work
with Communists,

201
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,660
we all know that.

202
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,569
Others still have this sort of old timey nationalistic
feeling

203
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:00,430
that Taiwan and China should unify in some
way.

204
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,589
So it would be a little unfair to say

205
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,889
that every KMT member is pro-Communist.

206
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:08,670
Is the former head of the KMT, Chiang Kai-shek,

207
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,129
who fought Mao,

208
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,120
rolling over in his grave?

209
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,019
Well, I can’t say for sure.

210
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,970
Grave robbery is a crime.

211
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,130
And I don’t encourage people to commit crimes.

212
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,880
Well, except thought crimes.

213
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,000
