1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,020
Trump calls Xi Jinping The King of China

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,260
Taiwan scrambles as Chinese jets invade their
airspace.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,740
And China gets personal on Grindr.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,000
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,320
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,730
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,740
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,430
On Tuesday, President Trump spoke at

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,859
the National Republican Congressional Committee
spring dinner.

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,599
You know, dinner and a show.

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,210
What more could you want.

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,219
His speech hit the usual fan favorites—

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,670
China has been ruining the country,

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,640
but it’s not really China’s fault,

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,940
it’s bad US leadership.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,579
Bad previous US leadership that is.

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,079
But then he dropped this very unusual anecdote.

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,690
“I was in China, making a speech,

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,539
President Xi, who is a strong man,

20
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:53,629
I call him king.

21
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:55,230
He says, 'but I am not king,

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,230
I am president.'

23
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,370
I said no, you're president for life,

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,260
and therefore, you're king.

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,140
He said, ‘Huh.

26
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,799
Huh, I like that.’”

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
I believe we actually have footage of Xi’s
response.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
“Oh ho ho thank you!”

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,620
Last year,

30
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,260
Xi Jinping got term limits removed from the
presidency,

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,040
making him effectively president for life.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,770
So he’s more than a president,

33
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,510
but also not quite a dictator.

34
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,049
Which is why I call him the presitator.

35
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,570
But Trump’s story about calling Xi

36
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,180
a king shows Trump’s unique ability

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,810
to sound like he might be complimenting you

38
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,190
while also possibly trashing you.

39
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,810
Does calling him king help or hurt Xi?

40
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,310
Hard to say.

41
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,619
Xi Jinping is locked in a battle for control
of China

42
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,799
with a rival political faction tied to former
Chinese leader

43
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,640
and toad king Jiang Zemin.

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,990
One of the weapons Jiang’s faction uses
against Xi

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,850
is portraying him like he’s trying to become
a new emperor.

46
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,329
Having the president of the United States

47
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,210
call him king and saying that he liked it,

48
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,290
could put Xi in an awkward position.

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,689
Does that mean Xi Jinping could be less willing

50
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,380
to make a deal with Trump on trade?

51
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,320
I have no idea.

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,900
Former Pentagon leaders released this statement,

53
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,050
warning of the risks of Chinese 5G.

54
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,819
5G is the future of wireless communication.

55
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,849
None of us really know how it works,

56
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:26,690
but we do know: It’s the future!

57
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,810
But if Chinese companies like Huawei

58
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,280
are building these networks,

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,780
that could be a problem.

60
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,330
That letter bluntly lays out the risk to national
security.

61
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,650
It says “As military leaders who have commanded
U.S.

62
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,830
and allied troops around the world,

63
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,720
we have grave concerns about a future

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,220
where a Chinese-developed 5G network

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,690
is widely adopted among our allies and partners.”

66
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,460
Current defense leaders are also warning about
Chinese 5G.

67
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,990
Ellen Lord, the Under Secretary of Defense

68
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,080
for Acquisition and Sustainment,

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,129
recently said Chinese 5G is such a serious
issue,

70
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,180
it could change US alliances on a fundamental
level.

71
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,920
She said at a conference last week,

72
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,739
“If our allies and partners go with a Huawei
solution,

73
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,860
we need to reconsider how we share

74
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,300
critical information with them.”

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,180
Specifically, the US is part of

76
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,630
what’s called the “Five Eyes”—

77
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,989
an intelligence network that also includes

78
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,500
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK.

79
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
But don’t worry,

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,460
it’s not like any of them would consider
using Huawei.

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,420
Ugh, guys!

82
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,060
Of course, you can’t totally blame

83
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,940
New Zealand and the UK.

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,370
Well, actually you can.

85
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,370
But the problem is,

86
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,250
the US hasn’t developed its own

87
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,269
end-to-end 5G service provider.

88
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,530
Major US telecom companies have said t

89
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,830
hey won’t use Chinese 5G providers

90
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,660
like Huawei or ZTE.

91
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,310
But they still need to rely on

92
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,510
European telecom companies.

93
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,890
So the lack of options definitely gives

94
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,349
Chinese competitors an advantage.

95
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,620
Fortunately, I’ve come up with

96
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,860
an unhackable system of telecommunication.

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
And for email,

98
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,069
I have an equally unhackable system.

99
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,810
You know how I’ve been talking about

100
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,409
how China plans to invade Taiwan?

101
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,970
Well, Chinese fighter jets

102
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,609
just flew over the maritime border

103
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:21,720
between the two countries, slash regions.

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,130
And so Taiwan scrambled its own jets

105
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,150
to confront the Chinese fighters.

106
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,440
That’s according to this statement

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,199
from Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

108
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,910
This is how the world ends, people!

109
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,009
Not with a bang,

110
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,100
but with a tweet.

111
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,240
Now it hasn’t yet been confirmed

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,620
if the Chinese jets did it intentionally.

113
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,770
It’s been almost 20 years since

114
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,850
the last time that happened.

115
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,960
But it does come just a few days after

116
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,630
a similar incident near Japan.

117
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,750
Japan had to send out its fighters

118
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,360
after 4 Chinese bombers flew near,

119
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
but not quite through,

120
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,350
Japanese airspace.

121
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,860
But again, it could be unintentional.

122
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,800
Maybe Chinese pilots just got lost...

123
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,150
because they were using the new

124
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,680
made-in-China GPS navigation.

125
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,009
A Chinese woman was arrested after entering

126
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,290
Donald Trump’s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago.

127
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,919
She was, “carrying four cellphones

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,720
and a thumb drive infected with malware,”

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,580
into Mar-a-Lago while Trump was visiting

130
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,630
over the weekend.

131
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,150
That’s according to federal court records.

132
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,200
The woman had said she was there to use the
pool.

133
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,020
But then security wondered why

134
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,940
she didn’t bring a swimsuit.

135
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,860
I mean, I think the four cell phones is more
suspicious.

136
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,400
But maybe they were just curious

137
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,910
what she planned to do without a swimsuit.

138
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,970
Anyway, when she was questioned by Secret
Service,

139
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,160
she said she was there for a United Nations

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,680
friendship event that evening.

141
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,990
Turns out, that event that did not exist.

142
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,490
Which is so weird,

143
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,610
because she had been told about it by her
friend Charles.

144
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,710
You know, Charles!

145
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,039
I mean, she only ever spoke to him by text,

146
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,840
so there was no way Secret Service

147
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,310
could actually learn anything about this Charles
guy,

148
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,490
but I don’t know.

149
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,080
Something about the name suggests to me

150
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,610
that this Charles guy is in charge.

151
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,250
Now I’m not saying that this woman was a
spy.

152
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,350
Because that seems like a truly incompetent
level of spycraft.

153
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,150
She might just be a huge Trump groupie

154
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,800
who wanted to get close to that beautiful
mane of hair.

155
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,759
At any rate, she wasn’t charged with espionage.

156
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,990
Just lying to a federal agent

157
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,639
and gaining access to a restricted area.

158
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,639
And frankly,

159
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,550
it’s unlikely that the woman ever would
have

160
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,850
been able to get the malware

161
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,800
to an area used by the President, since,

162
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,820
according to the Secret Service,

163
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,020
“Entering the resort does not permit access

164
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,310
to areas used by the president,

165
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,930
which require additional security screening.”

166
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,419
It was almost the perfect plan.

167
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,250
Except for all the ways it failed.

168
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,970
The Trump administration is interested in
Grindr.

169
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,990
For national security concerns, obviously.

170
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,319
Grindr is a popular gay dating app.

171
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,699
And it was mysteriously bought by a Chinese
company

172
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:58,780
two years ago.

173
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,710
That’s why, the Committee on Foreign Investment
in the U.S

174
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,460
“began investigating Grindr as early as
July 2018

175
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,889
because of concerns about the security

176
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,080
of sensitive user data collected by the app,

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,340
which included the HIV status

178
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,460
of millions of gay people around the world.”

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,720
For example, the Chinese government could
use

180
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,510
the HIV status of someone in the US military
as blackmail.

181
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,200
But how would this information

182
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,340
get from Grindr to the Chinese government?

183
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,180
Well, once Grindr was taken over by a Chinese
company,

184
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,050
they got a new chief technology officer.

185
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,389
And he was really keen on working with

186
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,480
a Chinese state-backed HIV research group.

187
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,700
But in an email sent to employees,

188
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,550
obtained by NBC news,

189
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,729
he wanted to make sure people wouldn’t say

190
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,990
it was about sharing HIV data

191
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,930
with the Chinese government.

192
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,040
Not that they didn’t share data with the
government.

193
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,740
He just didn’t want people to say that.

194
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
And finally,

195
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,970
the US has a drug problem.

196
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,650
Drug overdoses are the leading cause

197
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,400
of unintentional death in the United States.

198
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,970
In fact, it’s more than gun homicides

199
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,750
and car accidents combined.

200
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,950
And guess where a lot of these

201
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,850
deadly synthetic drugs are being made?

202
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,139
China!

203
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,060
According to this report by the U.S.-China

204
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,360
Economic and Security Review Commission,

205
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,810
China is \h"the largest source of illicit
fentanyl

206
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,580
and fentanyl-like substances" in the US.

207
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,389
Trump has been pushing Chinese regulators

208
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,170
to go after the source—

209
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,260
laboratories inside China.

210
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,219
And now it seems like that might happen.

211
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,240
“China has announced that all variants of
fentanyl

212
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,250
will be treated as controlled substances.”

213
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,430
The problem in the past was that drug makers

214
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,540
could get around fentanyl bans by just alternating

215
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,320
the chemical structure of the drug slightly,

216
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,420
and then their new drug would technically
not be banned.

217
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,830
But now, Chinese law will consider all fentanyl-related
drugs

218
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,120
to be controlled substances.

219
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,209
That sounds good,

220
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,640
But a drug policy researcher told NPR

221
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,230
that the regulations may not be easy to enforce.

222
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,240
He said, “law enforcement would have to

223
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,769
‘take a sample’ from a facility and eventually

224
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,459
‘analyze whether it's a fentanyl-related
structure.’”

225
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,670
Boy, that sounds like a lot of work.

226
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,990
Instead of taking a sample,

227
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,330
wouldn’t it just be easier to just...

228
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,029
take a bribe?

229
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,029
Besides, Chinese police

230
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,420
are not exactly known for good enforcement.

231
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,010
Well, except when arresting dissidents.

232
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,170
Then they’re great at it.

233
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,460
And before you go,

234
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,840
now is the time I answer a question

235
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,090
from a member of the China Uncensored 50-Cent
Army—

236
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,090
fans who support the show

237
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,800

through the crowd funding website Patreon.

239
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,500
Tyler Fausnaught asks

240
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,630
“Would zoos be obligated to pay the panda
fee

241
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,630
if American scientists were to clone a panda?

242
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,779
If so, what international law binds us

243
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,140
to obey China's global panda hegemony?

244
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,800
Perhaps we could donate the cloned panda

245
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,610
to a zoo in Taiwan.

246
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,870
Wouldn't it be worth it

247
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,790
just to see the CCP pitch a fit?”

248
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,140
Tyler, you are perhaps a mad genius!

249
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,480
But technically, wouldn’t the clone,

250
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,070
being genetically identical to its “parent”,

251
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,329
still belong to China?

252
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:10,570
I don’t know,

253
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,130
science is making things weird and complicated.

254
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,130
But anyway,

255
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,170
I can’t see any American scientist

256
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,579
trying to clone a panda

257
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,050
without getting China’s permission,

258
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,720
and I can’t imagine that permission

259
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,160
being given without any further obligations.

260
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,079
Panda diplomacy is just too valuable a tool

261
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,360
for the Chinese Communist Party.

262
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,540
The ultimate in soft, cuddly power.

263
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,410
Not that I’d want to cuddle a panda.

264
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,410
What am I,

265
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,060
the prime minister of Canada?

266
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,300
But would I personally encourage a scientist

267
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,230
to violate the laws of nature,

268
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,580
and play God just to troll the CCP?

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,180
I’ll have to think about that one.

270
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,060
Thanks for you question, Tyler.

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,820
