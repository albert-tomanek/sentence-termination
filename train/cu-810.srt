00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,610
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,350
a detained Taiwanese activist

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,060
gives a “confession”

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,900
at an “open” trial in Mainland China.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,550
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,219
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,970
Love means never having to say you’re sorry.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,480
Unless you’re a Taiwanese citizen

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,089
who betrayed the love of the Chinese Motherland

10
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,869
by criticizing the Communist Party.

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,649
Then you need to apologize.

12
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:27,819
On television.

13
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,340
With two policemen behind you.

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,340
This is Lee Ming-che.

15
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,930
He’s a Taiwanese democracy activist.

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,180
He went missing back in March

17
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,540
when he visited mainland China.

18
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,460
People were worried about him at the time,

19
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,040
but then he reappeared,

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,090
only six months later,

21
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,910
safely in a courtroom in China,

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,550
being charged with subversion of state power.

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,010
It’s what authorities called

24
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,010
an “open trial.”

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,079
Open in that it would be

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,420
an open and shut case.

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,079
His wife was allowed to fly in

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,070
from Taiwan to attend.

29
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,660
She had this to say before leaving Taiwan.

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,810
“I want to plead to the Taiwanese people,

31
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,449
that if they see Lee Ming-che

32
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,619
making unpleasant actions or statements

33
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,030
during the trial that are

34
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,689
not in accordance with his free will,

35
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,159
please forgive him.

36
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,210
This is just the forced guilty plea

37
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,400
that China is so good at.”

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,549
And to show her support,

39
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,259
she even got these arm tattoos.

40
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:24,710
They say, “Lee Ming-che, I’m proud of
you.”

41
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,700
Yeah, Chinese prison is so hard-core,

42
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,659
people on the outside get the tattoos.

43
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,270
Well, anyway, with three very serious-looking
judges,

44
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,560
and policemen seated nearby,

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,569
Lee Ming-che made his confession—

46
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,619
totally of his own free will.

47
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,619


48
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:42,979
“I spread malicious attacks

49
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,630
that defamed the Chinese Communist Party

50
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,060
and China’s government

51
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,369
and China’s current political system,

52
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,979
and I incited subversion of state power.”

53
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,979
Subversion of state power

54
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,270
is a really broad charge

55
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,451
that can pretty much mean

56
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,819
anything the Communist Party wants it to.

57
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,700
Lee also confessed he committed

58
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,670
these acts of subversion because

59
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,249
he had been misled by media

60
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,319
in the West and Taiwan

61
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,270
about the reality of mainland China.

62
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,420
Hmmm...

63
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,400
That sounds suspiciously similar to the confession

64
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,840
by Chinese human rights lawyer

65
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,550
Jiang Tianyong last month.

66
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,070
Jiang also said that

67
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,330
he had been misled by Western ideas.

68
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,920
So what kind of misleading ideas

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,160
did Lee Ming-che have?

70
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,850
Well, Lee is a community college professor

71
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,330
in Taiwan.

72
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,350
More importantly,

73
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,410
he also volunteers with an NGO

74
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,740
that monitors Taiwan’s adherence

75
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,980
to international human rights standards.

76
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,610
And he had frequently made trips to China

77
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,610
to discuss Taiwan’s transition

78
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,320
from martial law to democracy.

79
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,870
But when Lee traveled to mainland China

80
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,330
this past March,

81
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,850
he disappeared.

82
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,930
Eventually the Communist Party announced that

83
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,660
yes, they had abducted Lee,

84
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,720
a citizen of Taiwan,

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,250
and held him for over 170 days,

86
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,740
under investigation for

87
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,350
“harming national security.”

88
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,720
So, apparently, the Chinese regime

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,760
has decided to make it crystal clear

90
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,380
to the entire world

91
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,700
that they will never adhere

92
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,040
to those evil Western ideas

93
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,210
like international human rights standards

94
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,780
or transitioning to democracy.

95
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,490
This is especially a big deal in Taiwan.

96
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,570
Lee Ming-che is the first Taiwanese citizen

97
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,670
to be charged in mainland China

98
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,730
with “subversion of state power.”

99
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,760
And his case has created a big strain

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,050
on China-Taiwan relations.

101
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,670
Relations have already not been

102
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,440
particularly good since the new Taiwan president

103
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,960
Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016.

104
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,540
She belongs to the Democratic Progressive
Party,

105
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,840
which believes that Taiwan is independent

106
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,730
from mainland China.

107
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,130
After Tsai took office,

108
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,450
China suspended direct diplomatic contact

109
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,970
with Taiwan.

110
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,560
But not only does Lee’s case

111
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,380
further strain relations,

112
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,440
it also raises the much bigger question

113
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,910
of what will happen if mainland China

114
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,090
and Taiwan are ever unified—

115
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,690
the way the CCP insists they must be

116
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,340
in the future.

117
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,700
Even people in Hong Kong are concerned.

118
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,610
They held a protest on Monday.

119
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,790
I’ll let former Hong Kong legislator

120
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,420
and democracy activist Lee Cheuk-yan explain.

121
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,140
“It’s a warning from the Chinese Communist
Party,

122
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,430
anyone outside China including Taiwan

123
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,420
or even Hong Kong or elsewhere.

124
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,320
If you want to,

125
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,710
what their words are, interfere,

126
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,650
in Chinese internal affairs,

127
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,190
supporting human rights,

128
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,050
then you will be arrested.”

129
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,970
So essentially, Lee Ming-che’s case

130
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,720
represents the larger issue of how the CCP

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,290
treats people who’ve committed

132
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,160
so-called crimes that,

133
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,330
in democratic countries,

134
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,680
would be considered free speech.

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,710
As for Lee Ming-che,

136
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,520
he’s still awaiting the sentence in his
case.

137
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,860
The Taiwanese government has pledged

138
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,970
to do whatever they can

139
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,550
to ensure his safe return.

140
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,270
The Communist Party still has a chance

141
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,620
to soften the impact—

142
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,220
for example, by deporting Lee back to Taiwan

143
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,310
instead of throwing him in prison.

144
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,770
But no matter what they do now,

145
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,100
they’re not going to convince

146
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,260
the people of Taiwan

147
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,040
that reuniting with the mainland

148
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
is going to be all sunshine and rainbows.

149
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,340
And coming up after the break,

150
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,380
the Chinese Communist Party

151
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,790
is losing my religion.

152
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,010
Where did they put it?!

153
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,230
You know, you could have

154
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,660
seen this segment a week earlier

155
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,590
