00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,520
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,540
It’s a bus!

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,200
It’s a train!

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,410
No, it’s...actually,

5
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,600
I’m still trying to figure that out.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,080
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,640
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,180
Chinese state-run media has unveiled this:

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,770
A driverless train

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,880
that runs on city roads without tracks.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,120
They call it the Autonomous Rapid Rail Transit.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,600
And oh man,

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,820
is this going to be one heck

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,180
of a Communist Party train.

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,540
Just check out this video from Xinhua News!

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,300
And yes,

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,380
this is the original music.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,040
This train is gonna party non stop.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,680
If you’re still confused about what this

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,170
thing is,

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,220
state-run CGTN also made a promo video.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,940
I guess they used the elevator music remix.

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,510
The train was unveiled in Zhuzhou city

24
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,510
in Hunan province.

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,540
In many urban areas in China,

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,340
traffic congestion is a major problem.

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,540
The train can hold up to 307 passengers,

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,120
and can reach top speeds of just over

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,950
40 miles per hour.

30
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,510
Which is faster than it will ever need to
go

31
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,320
in Zhuzhou’s traffic.

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,640
The train is also cheaper to build

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,270
than subways or conventional light rails.

34
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,520
So it's a driverless,

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,340
environmentally-friendly electric train

36
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,979
that runs on virtual tracks

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,130
and can carry hundreds of people.

38
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,080
Ok, that actually sounds pretty good.

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,619
But I am pretty confused

40
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:34,840
by the promotional videos.

41
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,700
Because they seem to say one thing

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,759
and show the opposite.

43
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,340
First, they call it a train.

44
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,340
But it drives on roads,

45
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,759
not on tracks.

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,299
So, I’m pretty sure that makes it

47
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,560
just a bus.

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,759
I mean, yes it will be guided with sensors

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,060
along what Xinhua calls a

50
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,810
“virtual track.”

51
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,029
But it’s still driving on a road.

52
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,189
Isn't that a bus?

53
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:59,090
People’s Daily reports it

54
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,230
“uses rubber wheels on a plastic core

55
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,159
instead of steel wheels.”

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,079
Yes, that sounds like a bus.

57
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,039
Second, “It’s also equipped with the company’s

58
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,560
copyrighted technology

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
to automatically guide the vehicles.”

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Well apparently it still needs a driver

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,950
and a steering wheel.

62
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,590
So what’s up with that?

63
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,379
Third, it’s environmentally friendly...

64
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,040
because it’s powered by electricity,

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,400
but two-thirds of China’s electricity

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,630
is generated by coal-fired power plants.

67
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,980
So unless they can guarantee that this electricity

68
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,010
is coming from clean sources—

69
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,620
which they can’t—

70
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,930
it's still going to generate a lot of pollution.

71
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,930
And fourth,

72
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,849
in the Xinhua video it says the individual
sections

73
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,590
aren’t physically connected,

74
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,959
but just seconds earlier

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,409
it showed them physically connected.

76
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:50,890
I don't know what's real anymore!

77
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,490
Now this isn’t the first time China has

78
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,490
made headlines

79
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,640
for some revolutionary new public transit
system.

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,700
You may remember seeing headlines

81
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,130
about this last year,

82
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,720
the Transit Elevated Bus.

83
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,739
And everyone was all like,

84
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,900
wow, the future of transit.

85
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,940
Now, there were the obvious questions left

86
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
unanswered,

87
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
such as,

88
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,330
will it block street signs?

89
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,580
What happens if you need to make a turn

90
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,540
while that thing is over you?

91
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,500
What if you’re a truck?

92
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,510
But the more important question

93
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,140
everyone should have been asking was—

94
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,930
is this a scam?

95
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,321
Well, spoiler alert:

96
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,719
Yes, it was.

97
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,800
Apparently, the company behind it

98
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,560
raised hundreds of millions of dollars for
it,

99
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,180
but only spent about 3 million.

100
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,159
Where did the rest of the money go?

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,760
Who knows?!

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
The Transit Elevated Bus prototype

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,620
now sits abandoned.

104
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,660
But the worst insult of all—

105
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,470
as Wired points out—

106
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,860
since it runs on tracks,

107
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,390
it’s a train,

108
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,970
not a bus.

109
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,150
So how about China’s new train-thing?

110
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,440
The coal-powered, environmentally friendly,

111
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,300
human-piloted, autonomous,

112
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,019
rubber-wheel-based train

113
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,760
that doesn’t need a track?

114
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,470
Well, the track will be finished in 2018.

115
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,740
So we'll have to wait and see

116
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,110
if the train that's really a bus

117
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,410
does better than the bus that was really a
train.

118
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,410
The good news is that,

119
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,879
according to People's Daily,

120
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,610
once the four-mile-long Autonomous Rail Rapid
Transit

121
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,079
is completed,

122
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,289
it will link to the Zhuzhou's maglev train.

123
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,020
Which hasn't been built yet.

124
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,309
So what do you think?

125
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:26,809
Will this new vehicle be a blunder-bus?

126
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:27,809
Leave your comments below.

127
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,960
Thanks for watching this episode

128
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,050
of China Uncensored.

129
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,639
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

130
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,860
See you next time.

131
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,560
Good news, everyone!

132
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,339
Today we’re launching the China Uncensored

133
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,999
Mystery Crate!

134
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,969
Subscribe, and every month you’ll receive

135
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:44,690
a mystery box that contains

136
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,749
an assortment of items related to topics

137
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,759
we've talked about on the show,

138
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,960
personally curated by me!

139
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,760
Let’s see what’s in this month’s box.

140
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh, a bottle of China’s sacred territorial waters!

141
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,140
A facemask designed to protect against Beijing smog.

142
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,550
A slightly used suicide net from Shenzhen—

143
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,460
Don’t ask.

144
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,180
A handwritten note.

145
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,920
"Help, I'm stuck in a labor camp

146
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,839
making cardboard boxes."

147
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,030
Hmm, wonder how that got in there.

148
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,599
And finally,

149
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,840
powdered rhino horn

150
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,199
from the extremely rare silverback rhino,

151
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,870
the last of which was killed to make

152
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,880
this potent male vitality powder.

153
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,120
What’s that Shelley?

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,419
Ok, the powdered rhino horn

155
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,509
is extremely illegal.

156
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,150
The box was made by Chinese slave labor.

157
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,740
And no one wants a used suicide net.

158
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,120
What do you mean,

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm terrible at picking things to go in boxes?

160
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,980
Fine.

161
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,319
You know what?

162
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,319
It's time for Plan B.

163
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,419
I’m going to leave this mystery box stuff

164
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,729
to the professionals,

165
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,580
by partnering with Loot Crate!

166
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,340
It is also a monthly mystery box,

167
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,949
but it will contain actually cool

168
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,389
and totally legal stuff like collectibles,

169
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:05,370
apparel, gadgets, art,

170
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,820
and epic gear.

171
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,779
It’s basically Comic-Con in a box.

172
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,830
And they’ve agreed to give China Uncensored
fans

173
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,940

And I'll throw in some powdered rhino horn.

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,400
Just kidding.

179
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,140
Because that would be illegal.
