1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,440
Chinese New Year is a time of feasting.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,980
And purging.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,040
At least for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,580
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,029
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,770
Well, it’s that time of year again:

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,030
Chinese New Year!

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,540
The largest annual mass migration,

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,300
where millions of Chinese people

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,000
travel back home to the countryside

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,360
for the holidays.

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,000
And to celebrate the New Year,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,499
a city in Northern China has made this statue

15
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,649
of US President Donald Trump.

16
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,450
Trust me, it’s a compliment.

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,930
No seriously.

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,569
2018 is the Year of the Dog.

19
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:43,940
Last year, another mall did one

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,269
for the Year of the Rooster.

21
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,859
Are they going to do this every year?

22
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,140
Because it gets a lot less flattering.

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,979
2019 is the Year of the Pig.

24
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,300
And 2020 is the Year of the Rat.

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,719
I guess it depends how the bromance is going
by then.

26
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,769
Speaking of Chinese leader Xi Jinping,

27
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:04,710
Xi has his own way of celebrating the New
Year—

28
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,470
besides of course watching the very entertaining

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,890
state-run CCTV spring gala.

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,910
CCTV gala

31
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,910
or bad acid trip?

32
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,540
We report, you decide.

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,050
Now I know what you’re thinking.

34
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,120
Could Xi Jinping possibly have a better way

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,730
of celebrating the new year

36
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,550
than watching a girl in a dog costume jump
rope

37
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,970
with an actual dog?

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,310
Yes.

39
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,110
Xi Jinping is starting the new year off right,

40
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,680
by purging his political enemies.

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,570
First up, this shameless,

42
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,440
two-faced king of the internet has finally
gotten

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,710
what he deserves.

44
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,490
No, not Mark Zuckerberg,

45
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,560
this other guy, Lu Wei.

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,520
Zuckerberg still hasn’t gotten what he deserves.

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,620
Which of course is the entry of Facebook

48
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,140
into the Chinese market

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,150
followed immediately by the

50
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,700
wholesale destruction of Facebook.

51
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,940
Lu Wei was once the powerful head

52
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,860
of China’s Cyberspace Administration.

53
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,320
Basically he was the king of China’s Internet.

54
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,770
But his kingdom was not a very free kingdom.

55
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,200
Lu Wei is the guy responsible

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,810
for China’s heavy handed internet censorship.

57
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,319
He’s also the guy who drafted cyber security
laws

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,350
that put foreign companies’ intellectual
property at risk

59
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,070
by forcing them to store their data inside
of China.

60
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,880
But, he won’t be getting on a train back
home

61
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,060
with millions of ordinary Chinese citizens
this year.

62
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,830
Unless it’s a one-way train to prison.

63
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,050
We reported back in November that Lu Wei

64
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,360
had been put under investigation,

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,530
which meant, sooner or later

66
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,100
he’d get purged.

67
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,890
Well, “sooner or later” is now.

68
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,520
The Internet King—or czar—

69
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,810
has been expelled from the Communist Party,

70
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,120
and charged with bribery

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,030
and sexual misconduct.

72
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,330
I know I know, you don’t usually hear “Internet,”

73
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,480
and “sexual misconduct,” in the same sentence.

74
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,770
But if you’re a powerful official in China,

75
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,630
you’ve probably done something illegal

76
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,470
at least two or three...hundred times.

77
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,349
So it’s easy for Xi Jinping’s crew to
find

78
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,420
something to charge you with.

79
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,620
But in a lot of cases,

80
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,040
the people being purged are not necessarily

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,910
more corrupt than everyone else;

82
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,790
they’re just one of Xi Jinping’s political
enemies.

83
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,730
They’re often part of the faction

84
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,410
of former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

85
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,500
Sorry, wrong Internet toad.

86
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,220
There we go.

87
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,319
But what makes Internet King Lu Wei’s story

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,360
a little unusual is not just how

89
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,960
high ranking he was before the purge,

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,750
but the vitriol being used against him now.

91
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,230
China’s anti-corruption watchdog—

92
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,760
in an official statement—

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,489
called Lu Wei “shameless,”

94
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,180
“tyrannical,” and “two-faced.”

95
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,800
Nooooo, the guy who said there’s

96
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,880
no internet censorship in China, “two-faced”?!

97
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,150
And as for shameless,

98
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,380
well, he is the guy who hired a famous songwriter

99
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,980
to write that jazzy, Soviet style anthem,

100
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,250
“Cyberspace Spirit.”

101
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,250
“Powerful Internet country!

102
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:05,239
The Web is where glorious dreams are!”

103
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,340
Throw the book at him.

104
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,730
But Internet King Lu Wei isn’t the only
one

105
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,650
to take a fall this Chinese New Year.

106
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,090
Former CCP “Rising Star” Sun Zhengcai

107
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,790
has also been indicted.

108
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,720
Okay, unless you have a scorecard next to
you

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,130
with all the names of your favorite purged
officials,

110
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,740
you probably don’t know who Sun Zhengcai
is.

111
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,270
Well, according to a well-connected Beijing
Source,

112
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,480
“Sun Zhengcai was basically Jiang Zemin’s

113
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,380
designated, cross-generational successor...

114
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,240
Sun Zhengcai’s fall cuts the Jiang faction
off

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,250
from their escape route.”

116
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,820
I believe we have footage of that.

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,340
So what do you think of the holiday purging?

118
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,240
Leave your comments below.

119
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,510
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

120
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,250
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

121
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,520
See you next time.

122
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,840
Wait, before you go,

123
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,940
I have something important to tell you.

124
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,330
You know, not many companies are brave enough

125
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,800
to advertise on China Uncensored.

126
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,340
But there is one I want you to know about.

127
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,160
They sell amazing food:

128
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,520
Thrive Life.

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,740
And unlike a lot of other meal delivery food,

130
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,410
they’ve got GMO Free,

131
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,410
Gluten Free,

132
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,600
and organic options.

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,630
And unlike Blue Apron,

134
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,840
Thrive Life meal packs won’t go rotten

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,520
in you fridge after a couple days.

136
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,950
Thrive food is freeze dried,

137
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,620
so it lasts several months,

138
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,950
even years.

139
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,470
I know what you’re thinking.

140
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,470
Freeze dried food?

141
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,320
Are you sure about this?

142
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,830
I was skeptical too...

143
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,040
until they sent me a box of samples.

144
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,680
And I can honestly tell you,

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,320
it’s delicious.

146
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,810
They sent me this whole box.

147
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,139
There’s a ton of amazing food in here.

148
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,960
Everything from snacks to meals.

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,919
My personal favorite,

150
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,550
South Pacific-Style Stir Fry with Pulled Pork.

151
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,550
Now I know,

152
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,550
it comes in a box,

153
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,770
but this is what it looks like cooked

154
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,040
and it only took me a few minutes to make.

155
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,350
And they sell hundreds of other foods.

156
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,360
Uncensoring China takes a lot of energy.

157
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,919
And I don’t always have time to plan meals.

158
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,270
I can’t tell you how many times food in
my fridge

159
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,370
has gone bad because I couldn’t cook for
a few days.

160
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,670
Thrive Life basically solved this for me.

161
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,670
It’s super convenient,

162
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,670
tastes great,

163
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,580
and I don’t have to worry about it going
bad.

164
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,300
It’s also more affordable the Blue Apron.

165
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I’ve provided a link below to order.

166
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,850
Just try one or two meals.

167
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,270
You’re gonna love it.

168
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,040
And China Uncensored gets a commission

169
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,900
on any purchase you make.

170
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,479
So this is a great way to help the show,

171
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,150
and get some tasty food out of it.

172
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,759
Plus, if Kim Jong-un ever does launch a nuke,

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,410
you’ll have all the food you need

174
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,010
in the post-apocalyptic future.

175
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,199
So help out the show,

176
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,830
and buy yourselves some treats from Thrive
Life.
