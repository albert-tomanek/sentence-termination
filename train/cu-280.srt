1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,740
Being a lawyer in China just got easier—

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,509
if you’re loyal.

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,600
Apple created a delightful “feature”

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,060
to stop a dangerous emoji.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,060
And finally,

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,460
just because a Chinese telecommunications
company

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,580
works with the Chinese military,

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,279
doesn’t mean it shouldn’t build

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,160
Australia’s 4G network!

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,800
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,230
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,220
Being a lawyer in China isn’t easy.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,870
Just ask Gao Zhisheng.

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,430
I’m kidding.

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,430
You can’t ask him.

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,390
He’s in police custody...

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,570
somewhere in China.

20
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,830
But it’s not all bad news for lawyers inside
China.

21
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,230
The All China Lawyers Association,

22
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,920
the only official organization for lawyers

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,580
approved by the Chinese Communist Party,

24
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,250
has revised its charter

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,080
to help lawyers throughout China do better.

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,570
According to Party mouthpiece the People’s
Daily,

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,370
China’s Minister of Justice—

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,079
who’s also a high ranking Party official—

29
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,399
has laid out some new requirements:

30
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:10,049
“Lawyers must make the work of developing
the Party

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,979
their top political task.”

32
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,100
And “Lawyers must follow the Party no matter
what happens.”

33
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,909
Okay, those technically aren’t new requirements.

34
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,640
But isn’t it also the Communist Party’s
way of saying,

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,420
hey, we don’t want what happened to Gao
Zhisheng

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,840
to happen to any other lawyers.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,630
Such compassion.

38
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,340
Speaking of compassion,

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,340
according to the Epoch Times,

40
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,310
“The Chinese Embassy in the US issued a
notice on its website

41
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,840
stating that the US is not safe and that there
is

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,960
a high occurrence of gun violence, robbery,
and theft.”

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,329
The Chinese Embassy’s warning about

44
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,859
the so-called dangers of traveling to America

45
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:52,630
came just a few days before US-China trade
tariffs

46
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,920
went into effect.

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,950
I’m sure that’s totally a coincidence
though.

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,920
Unfortunately, the warning didn’t come soon
enough

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,500
for one Zhang Xiaolang.

50
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,880
Just as he was about to board a flight returning
him

51
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,069
to the safety of the motherland,

52
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,720
he was arrested by US authorities.

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,640
Zhang worked for Apple in 2015.

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,900
Specifically in the autonomous car division.

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,950
And he may have been spying.

56
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,220
Zhang, “was accused of downloading files

57
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,810
that included engineering schematics and technical
reports

58
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,470
before leaving to work for Xiaopeng Motors.”

59
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,560
I mean, what evidence do they have?

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,430
“Records and closed-circuit TV footage also
showed Zhang

61
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,000
entering the autonomous car software and hardware
labs

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,810
on April 28...

63
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,670
He was seen leaving less than an hour later
carrying

64
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,360
a computer keyboard, some cables and a large
box.”

65
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,840
Ok, so...a lot of evidence.

66
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:52,849
In hindsight,

67
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,680
considering Apple convinced the entire world

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,920
to put a surveillance device in their pockets,

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,290
Zhang maybe should have assumed Apple

70
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,459
would also have security cameras

71
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,319
in its top secret research lab.

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,180
But despite the spying,

73
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,410
Apple is still an eager player in the China
market.

74
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,579
Apparently, even to the extent that they’d
rather have iPhones

75
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,189
crash than stand up to Chinese censorship.

76
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,829
Apple has built in a censorship feature

77
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,750
on every iPhone in the world.

78
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,540
And it’s all for the benefit of the Chinese
Communist Party.

79
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,110
It was discovered that “Apple added some
code to iOS

80
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,710
with the goal that phones in China

81
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,159
wouldn’t display a Taiwanese flag.”

82
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,549
Except that introduced a bug.

83
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:40,569
If someone sent a Taiwanese flag emoji

84
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,060
to your iPhone while you were in China,

85
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,390
it would crash.

86
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,250
And yes, this has been a feature of iOS since
early 2017.

87
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,959
If you switch your iPhone location to China,

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,640
the Taiwanese flag emoji option disappears.

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,499
But for reasons that are unclear right now,

90
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,780
some phones would crash if they received

91
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,650
the Taiwanese flag emoji from a user outside
China.

92
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,040
Apple says they have now fixed the glitch.

93
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,420
Don’t worry.

94
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
They haven’t changed the censorship part.

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,170
That’s still in there.

96
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,310
Last week we covered the shady investments
China

97
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,199
made in Malaysia's development company 1MDB.

98
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,280
Well, there’s a juicy update.

99
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,069
The Malaysia businessman behind it has fled
to China.

100
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,360
Before fleeing to the mainland, he had been
in Macau—

101
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,270
China’s hub for gambling and money laundering.

102
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,410
It gives you an idea of what kind of businessman
he is.

103
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,060
The kind of businessman who parties with Leonardo
DiCaprio!

104
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,660
Currently, Interpol has a warrant out for
his arrest.

105
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,090
The Malaysian guy, not Leo.

106
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,780
But we’ll see if Chinese authorities are
eager

107
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,540
to actually help Interpol.

108
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,650
Speaking of totally aboveboard business dealings,

109
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,180
it’s a breakthrough for Chinese telecommunications
giant Huawei!

110
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,870
They won a 100 million dollar deal

111
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,330
to build 4G networks in Western Australia.

112
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,570
Wait, there were security concerns?

113
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,680
Well that doesn’t make any sense.

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,240
Just because Huawei has close ties to the
Chinese military

115
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,410
and has been banned by some US government
agencies,

116
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,960
that means Huawei is a security threat?!

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,780
I mean, they even said they wouldn’t

118
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,400
give Australian user data to China.

119
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,310
Obviously, cooler heads prevailed,

120
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,590
and gave Huawei the contract.

121
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,729
And in an unrelated story,

122
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,940
it turns out that in 2015,

123
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,410
Huawei took several Western Australian government
officials

124
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,720
on a paid tour of China.

125
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,250
So what do you think?

126
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,830
Leave your comments below.

127
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,830
And before you go,

128
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,880
it’s that time when we answer questions

129
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,039
from fans who support China Uncensored

130
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,319
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

131
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,349
Carlos A Carreno asks

132
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,430
“Should I be afraid of all Chinese electronic
software?

133
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,810
You know because the cyber espionage and stuff.”

134
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,229
Well, since iPhones are glitching because
Apple

135
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,560
programmed in Chinese censorship in every
iPhone,

136
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,479
it might not just be Chinese electronic software.

137
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,550
But I would say,

138
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,669
definitely don’t use the app WeChat.

139
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,520
In a 2016 report,

140
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,850
Amnesty International noted that WeChat

141
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,410
did not provide end-to-end encryption,

142
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,349
which means its messaging system

143
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,250
can be accessed via a ‘back door.’

144
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,629
Like, you know,

145
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,080
by the Chinese government.

146
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
Doesn’t stop there.

147
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,220
Chinese phones, like Huawei or ZTE,

148
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,199
are banned on security grounds

149
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,639
by organizations like the Pentagon.

150
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,540
So maybe you shouldn’t have one of those
either.

151
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,419
Thanks for sending your question.

152
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,419

See you next time.

160
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,780
Did you know China Uncensored

161
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,780
doesn’t show up on YouTube autocomplete?

162
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
Try it.

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,139
Pretty strange, huh?

164
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,000
That’s why you should turn on your notification
bell

165
