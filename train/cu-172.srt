00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,879
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,380
is it really a lie if you're just not telling
the truth?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,330
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:19,250
You know it's a bad sign when the guy in charge
of your country's statistics gets arrested

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,640
for corruption.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Especially when one of the last things he
says in public is this.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,800
"We should say that we are full of confidence

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,100
for the growth and operation of China's stock market."

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,040
Hmmm, that's funny.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,850
Because on Tuesday, Chinese stocks fell to
their lowest level in 13 months.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,050
Anyway, that was Wang Baoan,

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,710
the I guess now former head of China's National
Bureau of Statistics.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,630
He was arrested just hours after giving that
speech.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,850
Talk about a tough crowd!

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Oops, did I say "arrested"?

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,780
Because that's not what happens in the Communist
Party!

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,539
You get "put under investigation."

19
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,880
In Wang's case, for "severe disciplinary violations."

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,340
If you're not familiar with this type of Communist
Party Newspeak,

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,170
"under investigation" is what they usually
say about officials being taken down in Xi

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,380
Jinping's so-called "anti-corruption campaign."

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,119
That's another Newspeak phrase that means
you may have done something corrupt,

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,020
but you're actually being taken down for,
most likely, political reasons.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,189
So far, tens of thousands of Communist Party
members have been put under investigation.

26
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,570
This kind of political takedown happens a
lot in China.

27
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,689
And it's not very transparent because the
Communist Party is not actually a legal entity

28
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:40,970
in China.

29
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,390
It's an extralegal entity!

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,670
Not extra in a good way,

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,850
like getting that server at Chipotle who gives
you extra guacamole.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,700
Extralegal like "it exists outside the law."

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,280
So if a member of the Communist Party does
something wrong,

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,399
it's up to his communist comrades

35
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:58,700
--not the court system--

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,660
to find the best way to "reform" him.

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,420
This usually involves getting sacked,

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,259
put in detention with no lawyer or judicial
oversight,

39
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,369
followed by...

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,060
show trial!

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,719
And of course, the worst punishment,

42
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,930
denying the technically un-accused of their
black hair dye.

43
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,109
Now so far, there haven't been any specific
charges leveled against Wang.

44
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:28,019
In fact, it's not even clear whether the investigation
is related to his role as head of the National

45
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,749
Bureau of Statistics

46
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,510
because before that, he was China's vice minister
of finance.

47
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,859
But the fact that Wang's most recent role
is the guy in charge of reporting China's

48
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,189
GDP figures...

49
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,870
well, if you're thinking what I'm thinking,

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,840
that's what everyone else in the world is
thinking.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,249
It's a bit sensitive.

52
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:52,010
And that's a problem because people already
think China makes up its economic data.

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,109
Officially, China's GDP is growing at 6.9%,
the slowest pace in 25 years.

54
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:01,969
But a lot of experts think it's actually much
lower,

55
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,629
despite what Wang claimed last week

56
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,559
you know, before he got put under investigation.

57
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,969
But you got to feel sorry for Wang.

58
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:14,669
He had a tough job: give the Communist Party
frank, steely assessments of China's actual

59
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,620
economic strengthens and weakness.

60
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,449
And then tell the public that everything's
fine.

61
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,309
Of course I suppose he didn't have to take
that job.

62
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:23,719
Anyway, what do you think that the arrest

63
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,809
--er, investigation of Wang says about China's
economy?

64
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:31,139
Make up your wildest guess, since we really
have no way to know.
