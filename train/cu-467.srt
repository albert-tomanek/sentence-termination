00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
On this episode of China Uncensored, you called
the Chinese police…

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
…and won!

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,940
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,240
So, you know who's incredibly awesome?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,340
You!

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,420
Now there are some people out there who think,

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,519
"Oh, what can I do? I can't make a difference
in this world."

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,449
Not my viewers!

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,320
Last week, when I found out that police in
China abducted my friend Ben Hedges' mother-in-law,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,220
I asked you to take action.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,590
"So get out your phones my precious 50-Cent
Army, and give police chief Yu Changjun a

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,610
call, and tell him to release Sheng Xiaoyun."

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,390
Oh, and call you did. Many of you emailed
me your stories.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,140
Here's just a taste.

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,010
This one comes from viewer Sasha Ganapolsky.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,620
Yesterday I gave the officer a call which
he answered a few seconds later.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,879
My friend Lily speaks Mandarin so I asked
her to say "Release Sheng Xiaoyun."

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,910
He then said, "Who are all of these people?"
with a voice like he's tired of it.

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,369
Lily then said, "People who want justice in
China."

20
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,159
He then said, "Ugh stop calling me!" And hung
up.

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,560
Beautiful. Well done.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,590
Very well done, in fact,

23
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,500
because I just got word from Ben that his
mother-in-law was released yesterday.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,920
And one of the police officers in the detention
center apparently told her they got a lot

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,960
of calls demanding they let her go.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,900
Well done, my 50-Cent Army!

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,810
And although that warm, squishy feeling you
have inside right now is probably enough,

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,850
I've also sent each of you who called the
police and emailed me about it a special gift.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,270
So check your email.

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,240
And to everyone who called, or gave their
support in other ways, congratulations and

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,040
thank you.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,259
Together, we made things better in China.

33
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,649
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, and this is
China Uncensored.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,020
Hi everyone, I’m Ben Hedges.

35
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,060
And I’d just like to say a really big thank
you to everyone who called into the police

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,960
and helped to get my mother-in-law released.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,119
It means a lot to me and my wife and our family.

38
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,439
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,350
This is the episode we recorded last week,
but I just want to remind you that now that

40
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,950
she’s been released, you don’t need to
call the police station anymore. Thanks.
