00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,170
it turns out that lending money

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,110
to strangers on the internet

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,420
can be kind of risky.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,260
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,820
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,520
It’s scarier than Jurassic Park.

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:18,740
More terrifying than Jaws.

9
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,560
And way more...serious than The MEG.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,660
It’s the peer-to-peer loan crisis in China.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,550
And it’s worse than Jason Statham

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,830
trying to stretch his acting range.

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,180
P2P lending is also called crowdlending.

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,350
It’s one part of China’s shadow banking
industry—

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,520
a kind of parallel dimension of debt financing

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,330
that conjures up images of back alley loan
sharks.

17
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,530
Shadow banking is all the lending and borrowing

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,290
that’s done outside the highly regulated
banking industry.

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,520
And in China, shadow banking is big business.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,950
It includes includes everything

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,780
from high-risk exotic investment products,

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,520
to pawnshop and loan shark operations,

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,370
to online peer-to-peer loans.

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,610
Shadow banking has been crucial to China’s
economy

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,820
because it provides much-needed loans to small
businesses

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,010
and individuals that might not qualify for
regular bank loans.

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,460
Local governments have even used shadow banking
loans

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,530
to make up shortfalls.

29
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,550
Shadow banking in China is a 10 trillion dollar
a year industry.

30
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,250
This slice—about 9%—is the crowdlending
sector.

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,130
The P2P lending may seem like a small slice,

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,120
but there’s more P2P lending in China

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,580
than everywhere else in the world combined.

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,850
It’s got 50 million registered users,

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,520
and outstanding loans of around $200 billion
dollars.

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,570
P2P lending is a bit like like Tinder.

37
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,210
But instead of going on a date with a stranger,

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,049
you enter into a financial partnership with
a stranger.

39
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,300
In both cases,

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,590
if the person has face tattoos,

41
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,720
swipe left.

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,460
Okay, seriously P2P lending is less like Tinder

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,460
and more like Kickstarter.

44
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,920
Only instead of funding a company

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,650
and getting an underwater drone,

46
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,100
or a high-tech watergun, or a....

47
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,799
giant Lionel Richie head...ok,

48
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,190
instead of a product,

49
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,310
you fund a company and earn interest from
your loan

50
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,499
after a certain period of time.

51
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,810
By cutting out the bank as a middleman,

52
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,569
crowdlending platforms promise high returns
to lenders,

53
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,549
and cheaper loans to borrowers.

54
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,719
Some platforms promised as much as a 12% return,

55
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,690
which is way higher than you could get from
anywhere else.

56
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,690


57
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,690
Win win, it would seem.

58
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,659
Except that these platforms have spread like
wildfire

59
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,650
pretty much without any regulatory oversight,

60
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,209
and a lot of times the loans are risky.

61
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,750
Like, you might think you’re funding the
underwater drone,

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,939
when it turns out you’ve actually funded

63
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:44,189
the giant Lionel Richie head.

64
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,709
And there’s no way to pull your money out.

65
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,349
And a lot of times, lenders don’t get paid
back.

66
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,599
Also, the lack of oversight means that

67
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,879
even P2P companies themselves

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,629
can cheat investors over a long period of
time.

69
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,879
For example eZuBao.

70
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,140
It was once the golden child of P2P lending
in China.

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,950
But it was shut down in 2016 after cheating
investors

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,340
out of $7.6 billion dollars in an elaborate
Ponzi scheme.

73
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
How elaborate?

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,309
Well, according to the New York Times,

75
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:18,810
eZuBao duped about a million investors

76
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,760
by offering fake investment products.

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
And to hide their trail,

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,870
the bosses buried 1200 documents

79
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,889
in 80 bags 20 feet underground that took police

80
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,499
a whole day to dig up with two excavators.

81
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,590
That’s crazy!

82
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,809
Did no one tell them about paper shredders?

83
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,639
Or a bonfire?

84
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,230
And it goes way beyond just peer-to-peer lending.

85
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,730
The entire shadow banking sector in China

86
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,779
has been gripped by a regulatory shakedown

87
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:51,629
in order to reduce leverage, curb crazy levels
of risk,

88
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:54,999
and hopefully prevent a financial meltdown.

89
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,400
Since regulators took P2P lending into their
crosshairs,

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,900
these platforms have started dropping like
flies.

91
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,689
According to the South China Morning Post,

92
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,029
the total number of P2P lending platforms

93
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:09,640
that have failed is over 4 and a half thousand,

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,269
with more than 200 in July alone.

95
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,569
Yes, there are more than four thousand lending
companies

96
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:16,570
that have failed,

97
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,220
taking people’s money down with them.

98
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,880
The head of the Shenzhen Internet Financial
Association

99
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,440
warns that “The industry might enter a great
recession.”

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,629
Everybody’s on edge, he says, as some companies
shut down

101
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:32,759
because of bad loans, fraud, or asset freezes
by inspectors.

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,780
A total of 165 lending platforms

103
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,090
stopped allowing investor withdrawals in July,

104
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,039
locking up tens of billions of dollars in
capital.

105
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,419
On top of that, hundreds of P2P lending platform
owners

106
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,190
have simply run away with investors’ money!

107
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,620
So obviously, a lot of people are upset.

108
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,910
They want the government to bail them out.

109
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,310
Or to hold the companies accountable.

110
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,669
But in the government’s view, it’s the
investors’ own fault.

111
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,210
People knew it was risky, and invested their
money anyway.

112
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,189
Besides, government bailouts are only for

113
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,240
rich corporations that are too big to fail.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,910
So a lot of angry people decided to undermine

115
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,560
China’s harmonious society by traveling
to Beijing

116
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,180
to petition the appropriate government office.

117
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,310
Don’t see any protesters?

118
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,310
That’s because no protest took place.

119
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,900
“Last Monday,

120
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,229
many wanted to demand a P2P bailout from the
government,

121
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,100
and organized themselves online.

122
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,360
However, any challenge to stability is sensitive
in China

123
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
and those who managed to make it to the protest
area were detained.

124
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,680
An investor told Reuters this video shows
they were forced

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,400
onto buses and carted away to a holding center.”

126
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,410
Some petitioners didn’t even make it all
the way to Beijing.

127
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,199
According to Reuters, many would-be protesters
were removed

128
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,090
from Beijing-bound trains ahead of the protests,

129
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,830
forced to give fingerprints and even blood
samples.

130
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,270
Turns out it’s not just banks

131
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,660
that are the bloodsuckers in this story.

132
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,759
Now to be fair,

133
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,690
Chinese authorities didn’t only crack down
on

134
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,250
investors who lost their life savings.

135
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,850
They also cracked down on people who borrowed
money,

136
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,810
and had trouble paying back their P2P loans.

137
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,469
Authorities put them on a social credit rating
blacklist.

138
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,030
It’s just one of the 10 delightful new measures

139
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,130
China’s regulators have come up with to
minimize risk.

140
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,599
And to make sure that no one goes unpunished.

141
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,919
Others measures include “strictly banning”
local authorities

142
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,409
from allowing any new P2P lending platforms
to be set up,

143
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,879
and setting up so-called “communication
windows”

144
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,919
where people who’ve lost money can vent
their grievances

145
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,500
outside the public eye,

146
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,879
where someone no power to help them,

147
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,849
can pretend to listen.

148
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,410
Now it’s good that the Chinese government

149
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,199
is finally trying to regulate this P2P lending
industry.

150
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,220
But as for the individual investors

151
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,849
who have already lost their life savings?

152
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,219
They now understand just how

153
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,849
the Chinese Communist Party maintains stability:

154
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,879
There’s a serious financial problem that
threatens

155
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,919
the livelihoods of millions of people.

156
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,749
But instead of allowing protests,

157
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,999
they figure out a way to keep protesters quiet,

158
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,419
and sweep the whole thing under the rug.

159
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,569
Or under a giant Lionel Richie head.

160
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,340
So what do you think China should bail out
P2P lenders?

161
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,620
And what do you think about China

162
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,719
clamping down on protesters?

163
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,950
And what’s the weirdest kickstarter you’ve
ever funded?

164
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,780
Leave your comments below.

165
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
And before we go,

166
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,669
it’s time for a question from one of our
fans

167
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:28,439
who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

168
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,729
James Kelton asks:

169
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,479
“Is there anything happening in China at
the moment

170
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,620
that isn't a prelude to the Apocalypse?

171
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,169
It all seems rather gloomy of late...”

172
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,169
Nope!

173
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,530
It’s all gloom and doom.

174
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,530
Sorry, James.

175
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,879
I’m just kidding.

176
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,699
There are good things happening in China.

177
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,639
For example, in northern China,

178
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,970
there’s a project underway

179
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,879
to turn desert into arable farmland.

180
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,460
Although, the part they leave out is

181
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,199
how seven decades of bad environmental policy

182
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,370
resulted in massive desertification.

183
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,129
So yes there are good things.

184
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,259
But I generally don’t tell you

185
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,970
about them on China Uncensored,

186
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,710
since Chinese state-run media is doing

187
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,229
a perfectly good job of that.

188
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,279
China Uncensored is here to tell you about
the things

189
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,730
state-run media keeps censored.

190
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,340
And those are not the positive things.

191
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,250
Thanks for your question, James.

192
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,599
And for everyone else watching,

193
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,439
