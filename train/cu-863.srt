00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:03,340
China is known for all sorts of knockoffs.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,280
But this one will blow your mind.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,660
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,070
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,330
The Eiffel Tower.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,179
The architectural marvel that made this city
famous.

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,250
I’m talking, of course, about the city of....

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,769
...Hangzhou, China!

9
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,369
Yes, Hangzhou, known in ancient times for
its divine pagodas,

10
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:28,519
grand canal,

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,939
and peerless beauty.

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,180
Now, it’s also known for its large-scale
knockoff of Paris.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,400
Back in 2007,

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,050
ambitious developers began building

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,480
what they call the “Tianducheng Resort”,

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,620
on the outskirts of the city.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,870
And for millions of Chinese citizens who may
never get

18
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,800
a chance to leave the country,

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,040
it gives them an opportunity to at least get
a glimpse of bon Paris...

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,650
even if it’s a knockoff.

21
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,810
And really, who can tell the difference?

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,760
Seriously, do you think you can?

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,829
I’m going to show you 20 side-by-side images

24
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,080
from French photographer François Prost.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,760
In each slide,

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,650
one photo was taken in Paris and the other
in Tianducheng.

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,130
Which one is the real Paris?

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,690
Grab a pen and keep track of how many you
can guess correctly.

29
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,860
Ready...

30
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,300
Set...

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,040
Go!

32
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,940
How many did you get right?

33
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,680
And have you been to Tianducheng,

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,470
or its knockoff version in France?

35
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,150
Leave your comments below.

36
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,910
And I want to give a special thanks

37
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,349
to photographer François Prost

38
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,590
for sharing his great photos with us.

39
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,120
Follow him out on Instragram: @francoisprost.

40
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,310
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

41
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,990
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell...

42
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,980
Or are you a knockoff?
