1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,810
A new challenge in the South China Sea—

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,930
as more US allies move through the region.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,820
What could this mean for China’s territorial
claims?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,059
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,440
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,430
If you want to understand China’s military
ambitions,

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,899
look no further than the South China Sea,

11
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,270
“The South China Sea is one of the busiest

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,340
and most militarized shipping routes in the
world.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,930
Experts also believe a wealth of oil and gas

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,570
is lying below the surface.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,640
China claims almost all of this body of water
for itself.”

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,400
Now obviously most countries along the South
China Sea

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,390
don’t agree with that claim.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,290
But they’re not the ones who built

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,610
artificial islands in the middle of it.

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,590
Or put rocket launchers on them.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,200
And if you thought that was scary,

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,380
you haven’t seen China’s new artificial
island theme park.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,040
For years, the US has been challenging

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,119
the Chinese Communist Party’s claims—

25
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:06,470
by sending in warships to disputed waters.

26
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,930
They’re called freedom of navigation operations,

27
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,170
or FONOPS.

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,530
There’s already been two FONOPS this year.

29
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,240
The most recent one was just this past week.

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,260
Two US warships sailed within

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,070
12 nautical miles of the Mischief Reef,

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,360
part of the Spratly Islands,

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,420
which Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines,

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,049
Vietnam, and of course China claim.

35
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,420
12 nautical miles off the coast is important,

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,420
because that’s the edge of what China calls

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,390
its rightful territorial waters—

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,960
and the other countries call “nuh uh!”

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,290
Obviously China was not happy with the move.

40
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,220
"The U.S. insisted on stirring up trouble
in the South China Sea,

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,700
creating tension to harm peace and security
in the South China Sea,

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,700
which is unpopular.”

43
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,690
Yes, it was unpopular.

44
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,220
With the Chinese leadership.

45
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,650
But for other countries, it *is* pretty popular.

46
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,540
And now US allies are getting in on the FONOPS
fun.

47
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,430
The UK is sending its newest aircraft carrier
to the Pacific.

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,909
The UK Defence Secretary also floated the
idea

49
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,260
of its own military bases in Southeast Asia.

50
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,970
And it’s not just the UK.

51
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,689
Australia has sent its warships

52
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,090
through the South China Sea, too.

53
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,090
Even Canada has.

54
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,389
I have to admit,

55
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,060
I didn’t even know that Canada had warships.

56
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,730
I just assumed that anytime Canada

57
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,139
faced a conflict at sea,

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,400
they just apologized and offered everyone

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,950
maple syrup and poutine.

60
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,260
But seriously,

61
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,370
battle lines are being drawn in the South
China Sea.

62
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,909
The top U.S. commander in the Indo-Pacific,

63
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,260
Admiral Philip Davidson, recently said

64
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,249
in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing

65
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:43,829
that China is the “greatest long-term strategic
threat”

66
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,480
to a free and open Indo-Pacific—

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,349
and to the United States.

68
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,889
And he said it’s not just a matter of

69
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:52,840
the US competing with a rising China.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Davidson said,

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
“I believe we are facing something even
more serious:

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,189
a fundamental divergence in values

73
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,180
that leads to two incompatible visions of
the future."

74
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,849
That’s pretty bleak.

75
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:07,069
But there is another option—

76
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:11,120
a future that’s not dominated by the US
or China.

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,590
The answer, of course, is Cthulhu.

78
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,549
And for all you fans of non-Euclidean geometry,

79
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,099
now is the time when I answer a question

80
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,079
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

81
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,159
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

82
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,779
Venomous422 asks,

83
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:27,779
“Do you think the US-Chinese relations

84
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,230
will have a chance to improve during

85
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,489
the current Chinese presidents life

86
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,469
or is he against the US completely?”

87
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:35,489
That’s an interesting question,

88
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:37,120
especially as the US and China

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,709
are knee-deep in trade talks.

90
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,449
When you say during the current Chinese president’s
life—

91
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,760
you’re probably referring to how Xi Jinping
removed term limits,

92
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,269
so he could continue to be president indefinitely.

93
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,510
He’s only 65 years old now,

94
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,189
so let’s say he’s got another 20 years.

95
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:55,189
In that time,

96
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:56,969
we’ll have at least two more US presidents,

97
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,299
after Trump,

98
00:03:58,299 --> 00:03:59,849
that will have to deal with Xi Jinping.

99
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,079
We don’t know what those US presidents will
be like,

100
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,760
so it’s hard to predict how they’ll deal
with him or with China.

101
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,639
It’s also possible that Xi Jinping will
get ousted

102
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,650
because of internal political infighting.

103
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,010
It’s hard to say what Xi Jinping personally
thinks about the US.

104
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,560
The Chinese Communist Party as a whole definitely

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
sees the US as an adversary,

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,920
and their current trajectory

107
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,450
to gaining more power internationally

108
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,780
depends on subverting the US and other Western
democracies.

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,150
But that’s kind of backfiring,

110
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,270
because now there’s a fundamental shift

111
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,850
going on in how many Western democracies

112
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,090
are viewing the Chinese Communist Party.

113
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,370
I think overall US-China relations will improve

114
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,840
only if Xi Jinping can start making

115
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,720
the fundamental systemic changes the US wants.

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,500
But that’s the kind of change that’s hard

117
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,280
for an authoritarian regime to make.

118
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,140
So as long as the Chinese Communist Party
stays in power,

119
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,660
I think a fundamental improvement in US-China
relations

120
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,580
is not going to happen.

121
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,140
Thanks for your question, Venomous422.

122
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,710
So why am I answering questions on the show?

123
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,840
It’s because a lot of advertisers

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,110
don’t dare to work with a show

125
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,890
that criticizes the Chinese Communist Party.

126
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,700
So we rely on support from viewers like you

127
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,410
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

128
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,410
Answering your questions on the show

129
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,820
is one of my ways of saying thank you.

130
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,660
So head over to patreon.com/chinaucnensored

131
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,700
to find out how you can keep China, uncensored.

132
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Thanks for watching.

133
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,140
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

134
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,200
See you next time.
