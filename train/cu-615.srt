00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,480
A War for Taiwan is brewing

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
As China’s military ambitions surge

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Can the world turn back the tide?

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,040
This episode is sponsored by Daily\h
Pnut. The news can be a tough pill to\h\h

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
swallow—especially when it’s about war.\h
But that’s why you’ll love Daily Pnut,\h\h

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,720
which gives you the news each day in\h
small doses—part humor, part substance.

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,880
So, Taiwan is preparing for war\h
against China. I mean, it should.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
The Chinese Communist Party\h
has vowed to conquer Taiwan.

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
And Chinese jets have been\h
harrassing Taiwan constantly.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
In mid June, China sent a record\h
28 fighter jets toward Taiwan.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
And recently China deployed stealth fighter jets\h\h

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,160
to their military units that\h
monitor the Taiwan Strait.

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,200
That deployment was announced\h
on Chinese state-run media.\h\h

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,880
Which seems kind of counterproductive,\h
since they’re supposed to be stealth jets.\h\h

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,240
“Look at how stealthy our jets are!\h
Here’s exactly where we’re sending them!”\h

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,640
But the Chinese military’s increasing\h
incursions on Taiwan’s airspace\h\h

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,360
have put a tremendous strain on the Taiwanese\h
military, as well as the Taiwanese people.

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,720
Now, in an interview with CNN,\h
Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu\h\h

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,200
says Taiwan is preparing for war.

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,680
(We need to prepare ourselves\h
for a possible conflict…\h

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
We hope it doesn't happen. War between\h
Taiwan and China is in nobody's interest…\h

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,720
At a time when China is trying to\h
expand its authoritarian influence\h\h

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
Taiwan is on the front line.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,520
China’s expanding authoritarian influence is\h
exactly why the US has been increasing support for\h\h

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,880
Taiwan. That’s true of both the Trump and Biden\h
administrations. And that tells you something.

27
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
Recently, “The U.S. and Taiwan\h
agreed to hold regular talks\h\h

28
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,160
on issues ranging from technology supply\h
chains to meat imports following their\h\h

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,880
first Trade and Investment Framework\h
Agreement meeting in five years.”

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,480
And Taiwan is pushing for a\h
free trade deal with the US.

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
Obviously the Chinese Communist\h
Party is not happy about any of this.\h\h

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,760
It interferes with their plan to make Taiwan\h
completely dependent on China economically.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,280
Actually, that’s pretty much their\h
plan for the rest of the world, too.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,560
Anyway, the Communist Party has particularly been\h
targeting Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu .

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Party member Zhu Fenglian, who’s a spokeswoman\h
for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said “Joseph Wu\h\h

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,320
has repeatedly and arrogantly\h
provoked ‘Taiwan independence.’”

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,160
“We will take all necessary\h
measures to severely punish\h\h

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,360
such ‘Taiwan independence’ diehards\h
for life in accordance with the law.”

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Taiwan independence? Taiwan *is* independent.\h
That’s why it’s not under Communist control.\h\h

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,360
As for the threats, Minister Wu has this to say.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,720
They cannot tolerate Truth. And\h
if they keep saying they want to\h\h

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,120
pursue me for the rest of my life, I'm not\h
really concerned about that. So for that,\h\h

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
I think it's an honor to be\h
targeted by the Chinese government.

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,520
I like this guy.

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,760
A Chinese Communist occupation of Taiwan\h
would be a disaster for the Taiwanese people.\h\h

46
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,880
Look at what’s happened to Hong Kongers.
And Hong Kong was never even a fully independent\h\h

47
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:56,480
democracy. To transform the democratic Taiwan into\h
a part of the authoritarian PRC would be brutal.

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
Which is why many countries\h
are concerned about Taiwan.

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Japan’s deputy defense minister says Taiwan\h
must be protected as a democratic country.

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
And yes, he called Taiwan the c-word. Country.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,320
He also said the world needs to “wake\h
up” to China’s threat to Taiwan.

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,400
China responded by saying his comments were\h
“highly sinister, dangerous and irresponsible”.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,760
What’s really sinister and dangerous is\h
the Communist Party’s military ambitions\h\h

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,840
in the South China Sea. All of\h
China’s neighbors are worried.

55
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Chinese warplanes have skirted\h
Malaysia, aimed at showing dominance.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
Indonesia and the US are\h
building a multimillion dollar\h\h

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
maritime training center\h
together to counter China.

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,480
And the US State Department just\h
approved a multibillion dollar arms\h\h

59
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,760
deal with the Philippines, the biggest one yet.

60
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,880
And that’s specifically to “enhance the\h
Philippines’ ‘minimum deterrence’ capability\h\h

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,520
as it grapples with an ever-more\h
assertive China in its adjacent waters”.

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,720
Meanwhile, the USS Ronald Reagan\h\h

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,120
has entered the South China Sea for\h
routine freedom of navigation operations.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,480
This does not necessarily mean war will happen.\h\h

65
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,120
If a strong deterrence can be maintained, that’s\h
actually the best hope we have of preventing the\h\h

66
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,960
Chinese regime from starting a war against\h
Taiwan or in the South China Sea. But that\h\h

67
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
all depends on whether the world truly wakes up\h
to the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,760
