1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,009
China’s economy *was* slowing down.

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,250
But now it’s getting back on track.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,069
How does it do that?

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,200
And what does it mean for the US trade war?

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,760
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,330
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,330
Good news everyone:

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,710
China’s economy seems to be stabilizing.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,410
That’s based on official economic data

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,550
from the first quarter of this year.

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,710
“More now on those growth numbers out of
China overnight,

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,359
which seem to signal stabilization

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,440
in the world’s second largest economy.”

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,910
But wait, you say,

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,530
good news about China’s economy

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,980
from China Uncensored?!

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,399
Aren’t you a CIA-backed anti-China propaganda
outfit

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,040
whose goal is to hurt the feelings of the
Chinese people?

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,629
Well, don’t worry!

20
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,040
Because none of those things are true.

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,280
Including China’s economic rebound.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,039
“It comes after that country

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,989
flooded its economy with stimulus money.”

24
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,989
That is to say,

25
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,100
the reason China’s economy seems to have
stabilized

26
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,040
is that the central government has been

27
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,879
pumping billions of dollars into it.

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,609
“Beijing flooded the financial system with
money

29
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,539
in a whatever-it-takes approach to arrest
a slowdown.”

30
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,539
Because in China,

31
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,719
they don’t just deal with slowdowns.

32
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,639
They arrest slowdowns.

33
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,590
And throw them in labor camps.

34
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,670
Anyway, the Chinese Communist Party

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,409
is deeply concerned about economic slowdowns.

36
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,399
Its political model for the past 40 years
has been:

37
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:29,499
We’ll let people make money,

38
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:30,569
so they don’t complain about

39
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,779
our authoritarian system.

40
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:34,429
But as soon as people can no longer

41
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,249
make as much money,

42
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:37,599
they might start to question

43
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,479
the Communist Party’s rule.

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,459
I mean, who would go for a communist party

45
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,310
that doesn’t help you make money?

46
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,020
So what have Chinese central authorities

47
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,429
been doing to pump up the economy?

48
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:53,009
They’ve been pushing banks to make more
loans.

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,009
Last month,

50
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,369
Premier Li Keqiang called on China’s state-owned

51
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,459
commercial banks to ramp up their loans,

52
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,849
especially to MSEs—

53
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,539
that is, micro and small enterprises.

54
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:05,849
Chinese banks have already issued

55
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,599
a record number of loans this year.

56
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,780
New bank loans totalled 865 billion dollars

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,849
between January and March.

58
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,140
That’s 20 percent more than a year ago.

59
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,930
On top of that, the central government

60
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,629
has been encouraging local governments to
issue bonds,

61
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,620
which means they’re borrowing more money.

62
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,480
Local governments have raised $100 billion
dollars

63
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,489
in new bonds in the first quarter.

64
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:35,859
That’s *700 percent* more than a year ago.

65
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,379
Which is crazy,

66
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,540
because just last year,

67
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,909
“the same local governments were scolded

68
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,769
for borrowing too much and hiding their debts.”

69
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,670
But for now, all this economic stimulus is
working.

70
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,959
The Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing.

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,109
And this is important for Chinese leaders.

72
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,079
Because they don’t want to “appear weak

73
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,980
while the trade negotiations [with the US]
continue.”

74
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,469
Originally, Trump wanted to have

75
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,269
a new trade deal with China by March 1—

76
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,840
otherwise he promised to increase tariffs
on Chinese goods.

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,890
That would hurt China’s economy a lot.

78
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,629
But the whole trade deal thing is complicated.

79
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,890
The US has been pushing the Chinese Communist
Party

80
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,390
to make real structural reforms

81
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,930
in how the Chinese economy operates.

82
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,989
And those are no fun.

83
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,749
So China has been procrastinating.

84
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,400
It’s like when your mom

85
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,799
wants you to clean your room,

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,090
and not just shove everything into the closet

87
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,889
like you usually do.

88
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,330
The US wants China to declutter their economy,

89
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,420
Marie Kondo style.

90
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,110
Do those state-backed export subsidies really
spark joy?

91
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,110
Lucky for China,

92
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,900
Trump knows how hard it is to let go.

93
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,810
So he delayed the March 1 deadline for the
tariffs—

94
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,870
at least until he could meet with Chinese
leader Xi Jinping in April.

95
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,300
But then that April meeting never happened.

96
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,560
And now it looks like it could be pushed back
to June.

97
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,989
Like I said, procrastinating.

98
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:02,989
And by June,

99
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,180
it’ll be summer,

100
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,459
and do you really want to put spend your summer

101
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,450
doing trade negotiations?

102
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,870
Wouldn’t you rather be at the beach?

103
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,870
Never mind.

104
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,239
The beach is terrible.

105
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,959
Wait...that must be Trump’s strategy!

106
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,890
He wants to make sitting in an office

107
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,440
and doing paperwork all day seem appealing!

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,900
But in order to get there,

109
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,050
Chinese leaders have to offer

110
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,750
the kind of free market reforms the US wants.

111
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,069
So the US may not be happy about the fact
that

112
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,910
Chinese state-owned enterprises

113
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,949
are the ones picking up a lot of the slack

114
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,750
in this recent economic activity.

115
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,710
Plus there’s the whole issue of needing

116
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,090
an enforcement mechanism to stop anyone

117
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,960
from cheating on the trade deal.

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,050
Which won’t be easy.

119
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,930
And what if the Chinese Communist Party

120
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,960
decides that the trade deal doesn’t spark
joy?

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,680
So will US trade negotiators look at China’s
recent stimulus

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,810
as a sign that China’s economy is strong
again?

123
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,819
Or will the US see this stimulus as a weakness,

124
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:08,400
and use it as leverage to force the Chinese
regime

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,030
to make more concessions?

126
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,210
That’s unclear.

127
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,379
But regardless,

128
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,990
“the [Chinese] government simply cannot
afford

129
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,180
to think about the medium term

130
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,950
and must focus on short-term continuation
of the credit bubble.”

131
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,479
Yes, short-term thinking is the way to go.

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,479
So for now,

133
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,820
China’s economy is stabilizing.

134
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,000
But eventually,

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,830
the long term will come.

136
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,050
And in the meantime,

137
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,330
all the debt they’re creating is a ticking
debt bomb.

138
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,819
And time bombs tend to explode at some point.

139
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,229
Unless you’re MacGyver.

140
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,320
But hey, that’s a future problem, right?

141
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
So what do you think?

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,770
Leave your comments below.

143
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,010
And now it’s time for me to answer

144
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,060
a question from one of you—

I appreciate that you guys would like to maintain

149
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,040
a semblance of privacy in your personal lives,

150
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,659
hence the fact that you don't talk over much
about yourselves

151
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,139
(except for Chris and his student debt).

152

153
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,020
But Matt is so low key that I've become curious
about him.

154
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,280
I think the most significant personal facts

155
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,020
he's revealed are that he is a blond and has
a living room.

156
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,569
Care to elaborate?

157
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:17,919
Nope, that’s pretty much all there is to
Matt.

158
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,290
He’s blond and has a living room.

159
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,290
Really Chris?

160
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,290
That’s it?

161
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,810
I’m a complex human being.

162
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,120
Ok, fine...tell me one interesting thing about
yourself.

163
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,500
I...I like alpacas.

164
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,599
