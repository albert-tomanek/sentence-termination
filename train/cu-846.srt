00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,540
China's most dangerous roads.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,219
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:16,240
You know, China may have a Stairway to Heaven…

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,640
but that doesn't mean you won't find yourself
on…

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,039
Well let's just say China also has a lot of
really unsafe highways.

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,230
And I'm not talking about all the bridges
that collapse from poor quality construction

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,170
and lax safety standards.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,289
Like this one, which collapsed in 2011 because
a large truck drove on it.

10
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:45,149
I'm talking about roads that were practically
designed to be unsafe.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,920
Because safety standards are really just suggestions,
right?

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,140
So here are the 10 most dangerous roads in
China.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,629
Number 10 The Qinglong Road

14
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,469
This road is called the 24 Bends.

15
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,989
Can you guess why?

16
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,449
The steep grade and sharp turn make it extremely
dangerous.

17
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,489
And also, this is true, the perfect spot for
racing!

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,939
Number 9 Old Kunyi Road

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,720
Well, if 24 bends sounded scary,

20
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,079
check out Old Kunyi Road.

21
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,139
It has 68 bends in just over 4 miles.

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,750
Number 8 Tianmen Mountain Road

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,970
Want to get to that "stairway to heaven"?

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,659
Then you'll have to drive up this road.

25
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,280
With 99 bends a drop of over 3,500 feet, you'll
be getting to heaven

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,310
one way or the other.

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,090
Number 7 Friendship Highway

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,130
This is the road that connects China with
its BFF, Pakistan.

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,509
This 800-mile road took 20 years to build,

30
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,350
and more than 1,000 workers died during construction.

31
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,180
The border point, Khunjerab Pass, is nearly
3 miles above sea level.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,789
So if you don't get sick from the altitude,

33
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,709
watch out for: Mudslides. Landslides. Giant
pot holes. Flash floods... border

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,840
And Chinese police.

35
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,210
Number 6 The Beijing to Hong Kong Expressway

36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,460
Now you might have heard of this from the
massive 50 lane traffic jams that happen routinely

37
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,660
around Chinese New Year.

38
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,490
But a part of it running through northern
Guangdong, the Beijing-Zhuhai expressway,

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,110
has been given the comforting nickname "Vehicle
Killer."

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,630
It's famous for accidents

41
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,720
because overloaded trucks, steep mountainous
roads, and extreme winter cold apparently

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,860
don't mix.

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,050
Number 5 Badaling Expressway Valley of Death

44
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,700
Yae, though I walk in the valley of the shadow
of death, I fear no evil.

45
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Except for the Badaling Expressway Valley
of Death.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,240
It takes you from Beijing to the Badaling
section of the Great Wall of China.

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,300
But when you see this sign,

48
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,880
you know you've reached the Valley of Death.

49
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,810
I mean, it says it’s a black spot, doesn't
it?

50
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,330
It's a little steep.

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,610
And if you're not careful…

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,920
Number 4 Taike Road

53
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,710
But nothing can compare to what's expected
of you on Taike Road.

54
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,490
One wrong move and...

55
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,750
Accidents happen nearly every week. So why
would you drive here?

56
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,100
Number 3 The 213 National Highway

57
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,330
This highway connects Gansu and Yunnan provinces.

58
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,270
It's got everything.

59
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,650
Windy roads, steep cliffs, landslides, and
it sometimes

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,580
simply gets washed out by the river.

61
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,270
Number 2 The Sichuan-Tibet Highway

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,700
Well, maybe calling this a road is giving
it too much credit.

63
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,420
Not only is this one of the longest roads
in China

64
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,500
—15 days to drive the whole length—

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,800
but it's also considered one of the most dangerous.

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You know, steep cliffs and landslides.

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,650
Of course, maybe this is intentional,

68
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,180
to discourage people from visiting Tibet.

69
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,500
Or to keep Tibetans in.

70
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,000
And Finally Number 1 The Guoliang Tunnel

71
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,100
The village of Guoliang in central China used
to be so isolated that the only way in or

72
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,900
out was this staircase.

73
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,070
So in the 1970s, they decided to build a slightly
less dangerous path.

74
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,910
13 villagers literally dug this tunnel by
hand.

75
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,890
One died during construction.

76
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,690
It's now become a tourist attraction

77
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,960
for those brave enough to drive it.

78
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,190
And it's become a testament to the ability
of Chinese people to make impossible things

79
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,250
possible.

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,480
So what do you think?

81
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,580
And if you've been to China/live there now
and are illegally using a VPN to watch my show

82
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,140
what's your most dangerous Chinese road experience?

83
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,510
Leave your comments below.

84
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,830
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

85
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,400
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. See you next time.
