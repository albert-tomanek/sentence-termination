1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,800
China is waging a genocide on Muslims

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,080
So why has Turkey Abandoned the Uyghurs?

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,920
It could be big investments from China

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,040
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
The Chinese Communist Party\h
is waging a brutal genocide\h\h

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,240
against the Uyghur ethnic minoirity in Xinjiang.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,440
Uyghurs are shaved bald, chained,\h
and sent to concentration camps.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,560
Rape is a common form of\h
torture, for men and women.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Now the strange thing is,\h\h

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,840
even though the Uyghurs are Muslim, most Muslim\h
countries have been silent about this genocide.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,240
That includes Turkey. The Uyghurs\h
are an ethnically turkic people,\h\h

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,040
but the Turkish government has said\h
very little about the genocide. In fact,\h\h

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,560
they’ve cracked down on Uyghur protesters\h
inside Turkey because China asked them to.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,480
I wonder why?

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,080
Joining me today is Cem Toker. He's\h
the former president of the Liberal\h\h

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,840
Democratic Party in Turkey.\h
Thanks for joining me today.

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,040
Thank you.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
So the Turkish government is eager\h
to support Muslims in Palestine,\h\h

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,240
but has seldom raised the issue of Muslims\h
in China? Why do you think that is?

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:50,480
I think economic interests these days outweigh\h
the political issues. So they've been kind of\h\h

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,640
quiet about the alleged violations\h
in China, human rights violations.\h\h

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,600
I think they want to maintain great\h
economic relations with China.\h\h

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,320
So that's why they keeping quiet,\h
then they're not making it an issue.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:18,320
Even though the opposition is trying to bring\h
it to the political agenda. The suppression\h\h

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,160
in the press in Turkey is preventing\h
this. So the government has its own way.

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
How do the people feel?

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
Well, people aren't fully aware of the issue\h
because like I said, you can't speak of a\h\h

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,120
free press in Turkey. So there are some\h
efforts from the opposition. For example,\h\h

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:50,880
they brought the issue to the parliament for\h
investigative resolution as to what's going on in\h\h

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,480
to the Uyghurs, but it was rejected by\h
the so-called Nationalist Coalition. But\h\h

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,160
the public opinion paid very little attention\h
to it because they're not aware of this,\h\h

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
and it doesn't stay on the agenda too long.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,880
Well, in 2017, Turkey's foreign minister said,\h\h

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,440
"We see China's security equivalent\h
to our own country's security,"\h\h

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,720
and prompts to crack down on activities in Turkey\h
that could harm China. What kind of action has\h\h

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,920
the Turkish government taken domestically\h
to crush anti-China descent in Turkey?

37
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:40,720
I think symbolic, they have been extraditing some\h
dissidents to third countries, as far as I know,\h\h

38
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,120
rather than directly extradite them to China.\h
Also they have prevented some opposition\h\h

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:00,960
demonstrations when the Chinese officials visit\h
Turkey. So it's been just lip service locally,\h\h

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,960
but to maintain good relations and they\h
just received about $400 million of credit\h\h

41
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,120
from a Chinese bank. That is more important\h
than keeping the human rights issue\h\h

42
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,160
on the agenda of the people. As you\h
know, 39 nations signed the declaration\h\h

43
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,720
condemning Chinese actions in Xinjiang,\h
but Turkey wasn't one of them.\h\h

44
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Even though it was many Muslim nations\h
signed the declaration in the United Nations.

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,920
Yeah, that seemed strange to me because\h
of the Uyghurs are a Turkic people.

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:54,800
True. If Turkey was at least a halfway democratic\h
country, the opposition would make this an issue,\h\h

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:09,680
but opposition's power is limited also to bring\h
issues to the agenda. So it's open field for the\h\h

48
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:17,440
government, what to bring to the agenda, what to\h
avoid, and what to bring to people's attention. So\h\h

49
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,600
they dictate what's going to be\h
on the agenda, not the opposition.

50
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,080
So the Chinese Communist Party is\h
obviously putting a lot of money\h\h

51
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,960
into Turkey's economy. What kind of\h
political influence does that buy?

52
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,560
So far, I don't see any, but the political\h
influence of China will depend on the relations\h\h

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,720
with Turkey and NATO, Turkey and\h
the United States. The upcoming\h\h

54
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:58,400
rulings on the sanctions on Turkey due\h
to S400 missiles or the banking scandal,\h\h

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:07,280
the trial that's still going on in New York.\h
So the outcome of those issues would kind of\h\h

56
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,080
determine the political relations, which\h
way they will go between China and Turkey.

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,160
Is that why Turkey seems to be shifting\h
alliances from the US to China?

58
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,880
I don't know if Turkey is shifting alliances or\h
just seems to be shifting alliances of just a\h\h

59
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
bluff. Like I said, they're\h
waiting for the outcome\h\h

60
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,816
of those issues. Also, the President Erdoğan\h
will meet with Biden, if they do meet at all,\h\h

61
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:41,360
in Brussels next month. And Erdoğan was making\h
statements, very positive statements regarding\h\h

62
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,520
the relations with Turkey and the United States.\h
In the next few months, we will know which way the\h\h

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:58,400
Turkish US relations are headed, and we can take\h
a more clear look on Turkish Chinese relations.\h

64
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,760
Well, how have Turkey China\h
relations changed since COVID-19?

65
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, regarding COVID-19, the issue was all\h
around the vaccines, and there are rumors in\h\h

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,680
the public and in the press that China did not\h
keep its promise to deliver as many vaccines as\h\h

67
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:33,440
they would have due to the extradition of\h
some proponents and an extradition agreement,\h\h

68
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,600
and that hasn't been ratified\h
by the Turkish Parliament yet.\h\h

69
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,840
So I think it has to become a political\h
game rather than a public health issue.\h\h

70
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,360
So then Turkey shifted to the west\h
to other alternative vaccination\h\h

71
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:01,520
sources. So, Turkish government is between a\h
rock and a hard place regarding how to handle\h\h

72
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,240
human rights violations in China, against\h
the Turkic minority, Muslim minority.

73
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,400
And so China withholding access\h
to vaccines or protective gear\h\h

74
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,280
for COVID-19 could be part of how they're\h
manipulating [inaudible 00:07:28] politics.

75
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,600
That is what we've been told here in Turkey,\h
and that's what the press coverage says. Yes.

76
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,680
So where do you see the future of\h
Turkey's relationship with China going?

77
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,120
Like I said, it will all depend on the\h
relations with Turkey and the United States,\h\h

78
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:48,480
and Turkey and NATO. It is a historic alliance.\h
It has decades of history. So it's not going to\h\h

79
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,240
be an overnight shift, but if there's a shift\h
that all, political, military, economic shift,\h\h

80
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,240
that's going to take some time, but it will\h
all depend on Turkish American relations, and\h\h

81
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,160
Turkish NATO, and Turkish EU relations. Turkish\h
is one of the five countries in the world that is\h\h

82
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,600
subject to possible sanctions by\h
the EU and by the United States.\h\h

83
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,760
So of course, Turkish government is looking at\h
different alternatives, but it's going to take\h\h

84
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,280
some time if there's going to be a real\h
shift in policy or international ties. Maybe\h\h

85
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,360
cooperation in Africa, there's a\h
lot of Chinese investment in Africa,\h\h

86
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,560
and there's also a relatively large Turkish\h
investment in Africa. Maybe they will begin\h\h

87
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,280
by cooperating with the Chinese in Africa,\h
and then that will lead to a more political\h\h

88
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,920
and economic tie between china and Turkey, but\h
it will all depend on relations with the west.

89
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,840
Very interesting. I could also see the\h
Chinese Communist Party in Turkey coming to\h\h

90
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
butt heads over competing interests in Africa.

91
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,440
Yes, that is a possibility too,\h
but I think China would rather\h\h

92
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,080
become adversaries economically\h
adversaries in Africa, they would try to\h\h

93
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:32,320
cooperate with Turkey so that they can make\h
some headway in Africa, economic investments.

94
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,080
Well, thanks so much for joining us\h
today and sharing the information.

95
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
All right, you're welcome. Have a great day.

96
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,520
You too.

97
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
And thank you for watching.

98
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,840
And I also want to announce, we have a\h
new China Uncensored channel in Turkish.\h\h

99
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,440
So if you or people you know speak Turkish,\h
subscribe to that channel. The link is below.

100
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
