1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,210
When are you going to take it?

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,059
Sometimes I don't.

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,240
If I like a moment.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,270
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,240
This is incredible.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,689
Almost majestic.

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,640
What am I looking at?

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,070
Show 'em, Shelley.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,090
No, no, no, not that.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,310
This is something even rarer than a dumb old
cat.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,690
Shhh.

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,070
Look!

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,470
The first ever meeting of a Chinese and a
Taiwanese leader.

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:52,149
But unlike all those unenlightened news photographers
with their flashes going off

16
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,489
I'm not going to take the photo

17
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:02,730
I have video from Reuters.

18
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,600
You know, this was a pretty historic moment
though.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,150
On Saturday in Singapore,

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,750
Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with Ma Ying-jeou,

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,940
the president of Taiwan.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,880
It's the first time this has happened since
the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,380
That's when the Communist Party seized control
of Mainland China and the Republic of China

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,720
government fled to Taiwan.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,990
Now under what's known as the 1992 Consensus,

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,530
Taiwan and Mainland China agree that there
is only One China…

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,070
to rule them all, one China to find them,
one China to bring them all and in the darkness

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,390
bind them.

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,400
Uh, I mean, there is officially only one nation
called China,

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,970
and Taiwan is a part of that.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,810
It's just both sides say they're the legitimate
government of the whole thing.

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,290
This has caused some tensions in the past.

33
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,450
Made worse by the Communist Party's threats
to invade,

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,970
if Taiwan ever tries to declare that it's
an independent country.

35
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,310
In fact, China's People's Liberation Army
reportedly has thousands of missiles pointed

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,150
at Taiwan.

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,310
And earlier this year,

38
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,950
the People's Liberation Army even staged a
mock invasion of the Taiwan presidential palace.

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,000
And that's why it's so incredible to see Xi
Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou shaking hands on

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,970
the same stage.

41
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,150
Even though they share the same language,
history, and culture

42
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,980
Taiwan and Mainland China couldn't be more
different.

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,810
Like they were from different planets.

44
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,610
Deep in space lies an imperfect duplicate
of earth known as the bizarro world.

45
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,379
On this topsy turvy world lies weird duplicates
of the citizens of metropolis,

46
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,400
including the city's most famous super hero.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,700
Yes, it me.

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,200
Bizarro Number 1.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,830
Taiwan and China are basically like Superman
and Bizarro Superman.

50
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,940
Taiwan has beautiful, clear waters.

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,450
Mainland China has filthy, toxic sludge.

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,740
Taiwan has freedom of the press.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,170
Mainland China has the freedom to be oppressed.

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,300
Taiwan has a president, and, wait,

55
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,780
so does Mainland China!

56
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,910
Only the people didn't vote for this president.

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,510
Doesn't stop there either.

58
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,920
After the meeting, both Xi and Ma held press
conferences.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,290
But one was not like the other.

60
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,180
Reporters asked Ma the tough questions,

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,650
and he responded the way a democratically
elected leader typically responds

62
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,319
with bold-faced lies.

63
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,349
Xi Jinping, however, didn't even show up at
the mainland China press conference.

64
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,239
Instead, China's minister of Taiwan Affairs
Office went up against,

65
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,700
softball questions from Chinese state-run
media.

66
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,599
Of course if you live in Mainland China,

67
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,430
you wouldn't have see how a democratically
elected Mandarin speaking president deals

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,900
with tough questions from a free press,

69
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,900
because state-run television didn't show it.

70
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,310
So what did this meeting accomplish?

71
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,610
Well, there were no joint statements given,

72
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,569
and no agreements made.

73
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,260
So you might be asking yourself,

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,260
why did it even happen?

75
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,930
That's a good question.

76
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,650
Since Ma Ying-jeou became president in 2008,

77
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,629
he's helped bring the two nations closer together
than ever before.

78
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:29,900
This has not been too popular inside of Taiwan,

79
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,740
where some view him as basically cozying up
with the enemy,

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,199
that, you know, has thousands of missiles
aimed at Taiwan…or at the general direction

81
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,520
of Taiwan.

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,530
But tourism, trade, and economic exchange
have risen dramatically.

83
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,610
The up side of this is that people from Mainland
China have a chance to see the non-Bizzaro

84
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,590
version of their country.

85
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,110
The down side is that some in Taiwan see the
economic ties as simply another form of invasion

86
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,220
by the Mainland, just without the bullets.

87
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,990
That's one of the reasons why it looks like
Taiwan's opposition party, the DPP,

88
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,550
is poised to defeat Ma Ying-jeou's KMT party
in the upcoming January elections.

89
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,009
The DPP has always taken a harder line with
Beijing.

90
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,599
Xi's meeting with Ma probably won't change
the likelihood of the DPP's candidate getting

91
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,599
elected.

92
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,759
But having good relations with the Taiwan
government will probably help the Chinese

93
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,969
Communist Party as it alienates basically
every other one of its other neighbors over

94
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,789
territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

95
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,839
Because, since there's only "One China,"

96
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,930
Mainland China and Taiwan by definition make
the same outlandish territorial claims.

97
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,229
As for Ma, well,

98
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,669
he's the first president of Taiwan to ever
meet with his bizarro counterpart.

99
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,220
Place in history books secured.

100
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,469
So what do you think of the meeting?

101
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,369
Leave your comments below and be sure too...

102
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,330
Who are you?!

103
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,300
Me Bizzaro Chris.

104
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:32,969
Bizarro Number 1.
