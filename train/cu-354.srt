00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,750
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,900
China’s secret plan to take over the world!

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,040
What’s that Shelley?

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,860
It’s not a secret?

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,700
They just held a huge conference about it
in Beijing?

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,500
Dozens of world leaders were there?

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,400
And we have footage?

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,520
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,140
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,510
It’s the biggest global economic investment project

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,120
in modern times.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,130
Bigger even than Newt Gingrich's

13
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,180
proposed moon colony.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,860
Yeah, remember when that was the weirdest
thing

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,480
that happened in a presidential election?

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,420
Anyway, this global economic investment project

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,340
involves more than 60 countries

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,500
and one trillion dollars.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,430
Which is more than the combined GDP

20
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,329
of the smallest 97 nations.

21
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,600
Or the price of 28 moon colonies.

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
And the whole thing is being led

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,940
by the benevolent leadership

24
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,670
of the Chinese Communist Party.

25
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,280
It’s called “One Belt, One Road.”

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,910
Or for short,

27
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,220
OBOR.

28
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,220
On Sunday,

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,250
heads of state from 29 countries

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,500
gathered at Beijing’s Great Hall of the
People

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,580
for the “Belt and Road Forum.”

32
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,220
Or for short, BARF.

33
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,780
Which is how I feel right now.

34
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,570
Especially because all of China’s favorite

35
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,780
political strongmen were there!

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,880
Turkish president-for-life with sweeping new
powers,

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,780
Recep Erdoğan.

38
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,640
Filipino president and proud killer of drug
suspects,

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,900
Rodrigo Duterte.

40
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,460
And Russian president and former KGB agent,

41
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,350
Vladmir Putin.

42
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,990
Just look at that swagger.

43
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,990
“Jinping,

44
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,119
I could take you in fight.

45
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,900
Maybe not wife.”

46
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,180
So why is China trying to gather

47
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,740
all these nations together?

48
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,990
Well, as Xi Jinping explained on Monday,

49
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,560
countries need to stick together

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,310
like swan geese.

51
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,610
Because, quote,

52
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,080
“Swan geese are able to fly far and safely

53
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,950
through winds and storms

54
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,549
because they move in flocks

55
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,680
and help each other as a team.”

56
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,680
Yes!

57
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,299
Swan geese fly together!

58
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,600
Swan geese fly together!

59
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,000
Quack, quack, uh, I mean,

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,200
honk, honk, honk!

61
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,210
The point is,

62
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,849
Xi is clearly expecting winds and storms

63
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,620
and is looking for strength in numbers.

64
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,349
So what is this trillion-dollar

65
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,980
flying V-shaped globalization initiative,

66
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,440
with China at the helm?

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,920
I’ll let China’s state-run English TV
network,

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,340
CGTN explain.

69
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,420
“China states that the Belt and Road Initiative

70
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,560
is a systematic project,

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,200
which should be built upon the principle

72
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,760
of ‘extensive consultation,

73
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,540
joint contribution,

74
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,220
and shared benefits.’”

75
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,290
Could we go back to the swan geese part,

76
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,319
because that was easier to understand.

77
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,520
If only someone could explain One Belt, One
Road

78
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,770
in a simple way.

79
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,520
Like for children.

80
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,300
The Belt connects the land

81
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,450
The Road moves on the sea

82
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,270
The promise that they hold

83
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,160
Is joint prosperity”

84
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,620
Ok, I get the belt part.

85
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,569
It’s a metaphor for how Xi Jinping

86
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,900
keeps his pants so high.

87
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,500
But a road that moves on the sea?

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,540
Wait a minute,

89
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,019
is this about those artificial islands

90
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,790
in the South China Sea?

91
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,200
Are they building moving roads now

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
to connect all of them?

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,290
Anyway, state-run New China TV,

94
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,820
please continue.

95
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,080
“With our lines and our cables

96
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,720
Diplomacy tables

97
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,160
We’ll share in a world of prosperity!

98
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,780
OH~

99
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,940
The future’s coming now

100
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,160
OH~OH~OH~OH~

101
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,040
The Belt and Road is How

102
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,000
OH~OH~OH~OH~”

103
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,940
The Belt and Road is Hao?

104
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,200
As in, the Chinese word for “good”?

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,260
Oh oh oh oh oh.

106
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
Oh.

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,599
Congratulations to Chinese state-run media

108
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,880
for really upping their propaganda game.

109
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,190
But maybe you’re still not clear

110
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,730
what One Belt, One Road actually is.

111
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,989
Maybe one of the other children’s videos

112
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,940
by Chinese state-run media can explain.

113
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,480
“Once upon a time,

114
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,239
several routes led from China

115
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,500
to Central Asia to Europe

116
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,040
It was called the Silk Road.

117
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,630
Well, a few years ago,

118
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,920
China's president Xi Jinping proposed

119
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,000
making new routes like the old routes.

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,560
But even bigger.”

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,989
That’s pretty much the gist of it.

122
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,409
China wants to be the new world leader.

123
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,109
Not through actually colonizing the world

124
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:22,479
with military force—

125
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,539
which frankly never turns out well;

126
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:25,970
ask the British.

127
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,770
No, China wants to rule with economic force.

128
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,550
One Belt, One Road is about building

129
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,000
giant infrastructure projects in Asia,

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,460
Europe, and Africa.

131
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,029
Mainly things like roads,

132
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,319
rail lines, tunnels, bridges,

133
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,379
seaports, and power plants.

134
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,839
In theory, this will bring

135
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,189
resources and power to China,

136
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,580
and money and goods to everyone.

137
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,050
You know, “joint prosperity.”

138
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,589
China is pledging around a trillion dollars,

139
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:54,259
with tens of of billions spent so far.

140
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,220
According to China’s Caixing Magazine,

141
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,029
50 Chinese state-owned enterprises

142
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:00,909
have invested in nearly 1,700 projects

143
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,849
since Xi Jinping first announced the initiative

144
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,740
in 2013.

145
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,649
Those include 60 energy-related projects,

146
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,839
like gas pipelines from Russia and Kazakhstan

147
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,259
to China.

148
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,419
They also include high-speed train routes,

149
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,119
like the 4-billion-dollar rail line

150
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,560
that will send trains from Ethiopia into Djibouti.

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,800
Now in theory,

152
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,830
China spending billions of dollars to invest in,

153
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,820
you know,

154
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,449
the “joint prosperity” of dozens of nations

155
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,560
is in theory a good thing.

156
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,919
If countries have real economic needs,

157
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,620
and China helps fulfill them,

158
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,940
then China will be doing a great thing.

159
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,240
But there are serious concerns

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,729
that that's not how it’s going to turn out.

161
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,729
Let's take Laos for example.

162
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,849
Laos is a poor southeast Asian country

163
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:44,870
with a GDP of less than 14 billion.

164
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,369
A Chinese joint venture is building

165
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,680
a 6-billion-dollar railway project there.

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,379
How can Laos afford such a huge investment,

167
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:54,339
one that’s projected to lose money

168
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,509
for the first eleven years?

169
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:58,400
No problem!

170
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,429
Chinese banks will loan them the money!

171
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:02,129
And if they can’t pay it back...

172
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,779
I guess Laos will just owe the Chinese Communist
Party

173
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,779
some favors.

174
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:07,779
Political favors,

175
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,370
like supporting China in the UN.

176
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,770
Or economic favors,

177
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,619
like signing away their mineral rights to
China.

178
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:16,400
Or the Chinese Communist Party could just

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,869
break their kneecaps.

180
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,999
And Laos is just one example

181
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:22,379
of how China’s skein of geese

182
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,969
might turn out to be more like a kettle of
vultures.

183
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,819
A lot of poor countries are concerned

184
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,119
that the Chinese Communist Party

185
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,749
wants to use these infrastructure projects

186
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:34,080
to make it easier for Chinese companies

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,550
to extract their natural resources—

188
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,740
and get rich at the expense of the locals.

189
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,499
I mean, in theory this whole “joint prosperity”
slogan

190
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,240
is supposed to mean a win-win for everyone.

191
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,960
At least that’s what the happy,

192
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,360
multi-ethnic children would have you believe.

193
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,050
But a lot of the infrastructure is designed

194
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,869
to exploit oil and minerals,

195
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,300
or move goods—

196
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,749
and not to create housing, schools,

197
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:01,249
or access to clean drinking water.

198
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,919
And that’s especially an issue

199
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,259
in poor African countries

200
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,580
like Ethiopia and Djibouti.

201
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,959
Corrupt local officials might get rich,

202
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,959
but the general public?

203
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,469
Probably not.

204
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,809
And there’s another problem.

205
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:18,439
China doesn’t exactly have a great track
record

206
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,529
of successful infrastructure projects

207
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,340
to begin with.

208
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,419
This Oxford Review of Economic Policy paper,

209
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,200
analyzes three decades of Chinese investment data.

210
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
It says,

211
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,699
“Far from being an engine of economic growth,

212
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,749
a typical infrastructure investment

213
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:37,619
has destroyed economic value in China

214
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:40,399
due to poor management of risks.”

215
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,589
So basically,

216
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,430
extensive, long-term data

217
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,879
shows that the majority

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,089
of Chinese infrastructure investments

219
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:48,860
actually lose money.

220
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,459
So ten years from now,

221
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,260
we might see a lot of busted kneecaps.

222
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,460
There are other concerns

223
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,879
that affect wealthier regions, too.

224
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,470
Like the European Union.

225
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,729
According to this article in the Guardian,

226
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,629
the 28 member states of the EU

227
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,219
decided not to support Beijing’s draft statement

228
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,020
about trade issued at the end

229
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,610
of this past weekend’s...BARF summit.

230
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,439
They really have to work on those acronyms.

231
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,439
The problem?

232
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,569
“Members wanted guarantees that projects

233
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,959
would be economically and environmentally
sustainable

234
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,371
and subject to fair tendering processes.”

235
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,669
Well, I believe that Chinese leaders

236
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,550
have pledged to treat these projects

237
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,449
like they’re in China’s own backyard,

238
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,960
so I’m sure they’ll be environmentally
sustainable.

239
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,159
As for fair tendering processes...

240
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,370
yeah, you’re on your own.

241
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,570
Look, I’m not saying it’s wrong for China

242
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,759
to look out for its own interests.

243
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,610
Of course every country wants to make sure

244
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,430
they get an advantage out of working

245
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,820
or investing in other countries.

246
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,139
But One Belt One Road

247
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,819
is a way that the Communist Party

248
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,860
can exploit poorer countries for China’s

249
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,209
economic and political gain,

250
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:54,810
all disguised under the idea of

251
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,970
“shared benefits” and “joint prosperity.”

252
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,589
It sounds good on paper,

253
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:00,589
or in a song,

254
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,319
or a bedtime story,

255
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,430
but it’s not so clear

256
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,950
whether all of these swan geese

257
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,680
are really going to get off the ground.

258
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,840
So what do you think about One Belt, One Road?
