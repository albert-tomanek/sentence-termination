1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,890
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey Malaysia, that’s some nice

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,140
Chinese investment you got there.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,999
It’d be a shame if it led to

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,180
massive government corruption.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,620
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,240
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,640
The Chinese Communist Party has a plan for
world domination.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,279
And no, it’s not mass yoga sessions.

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,589
Hmm, although I think state-run media knows
how to sell it.

11
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,119
What’s that Shelley?

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,580
Oh, right, the topic.

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,410
What was I talking about?

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,930
Ah, right.

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,060
The Communist Party’s plan for world domination.

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,640
And how are they going to carry this plan
out?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,230
“The Belt and Road is how, oh oh oh oh”

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,200
Yes, nothing says “innocent, peaceful development”

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,460
like children singing.

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,770
The Communist Party claims the Belt and Road
Initiative,

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,110
also known as One Belt, One Road,

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,580
is a recreation of the global trade route,

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,580
the Silk Road.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,440
What it means on the ground is that Chinese
companies

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,350
will come into a small country

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,450
to build things like roads, bridges, or ports.

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,930
The Chinese companies are providing this “service”

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,909
in dozens of countries—to a tune of more
than a trillion dollars.

29
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,340
Most of the investment is in less-developed
countries

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,130
that can’t afford to build the roads,

31
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,170
bridges, or ports on their own—

32
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,820
so they take out a loan to pay the Chinese
companies.

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,759
And that loan usually comes from a Chinese
state-owned bank.

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,649
But unfortunately, it’s not all sunshine
and catchy songs.

35
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,210
Because when you take out a loan, you have
to pay it back.

36
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,990
And a lot of countries have been ending up

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,490
deeply in debt to Chinese banks,

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,770
while Chinese companies suck out the juicy
resources

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,789
those countries have to offer.

40
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,069
For example, Malaysia.

41
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:49,069
For many years,

42
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,310
Malaysia was going all in

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,789
on Belt and Road investment from China.

44
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:55,030
That’s thanks to Najib Razak,

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,250
who was Malaysia’s prime minister for nearly
a decade.

46
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,009
“Malaysia's prime minister has made a habit

47
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,700
of attending announcements of new Chinese
investments

48
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,750
in his country.

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,510
And he’s had plenty of events to attend
lately.”

50
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,369
Wait, did you hear that?

51
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,910
Was that just...a glitch in the matrix?

52
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,830
But Chinese state-run media were right—

53
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,930
Najib Razak had a lot of Chinese events to
attend.

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,260
Over the past several years, Malaysia secured

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,410
$34 billion dollars worth of

56
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,570
Belt and Road infrastructure projects.

57
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,890
So why was Najib so into Chinese investment?

58
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,240
You’ll find out in a bit.

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,650
But to the Malaysian public,

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,870
it eventually seemed like the Belt and Road

61
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,420
was turning into a noose.

62
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,670
But then, during Malaysia’s elections this
past May,

63
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,420
Najib was kicked out of office, and replaced

64
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,880
by 92-year-old former prime minister Mahathir
Mohamad.

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,210
That ended six decades of one-party rule in
Malaysia.

66
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,370
And Mahathir didn’t feel the same way

67
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,510
about the Belt and Road Initiative.

68
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,950
“None of our people are employed as workers.

69
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,570
None of our companies are used for designing

70
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,920
and planning and supervising, et cetera.

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,930
We gain nothing.”

72
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,010
His criticism of investment from the Chinese
Communist Party—

73
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,230
and his promise to halt or review Chinese
investments—

74
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,620
was one of the factors that helped him

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,370
win his surprise election victory.

76
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,150
But there was another surprise:

77
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,290
A politician actually made good on his word.

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,570
Last week, Mahathir suspended four Chinese
linked projects

79
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,570
worth about a total of 23 billion dollars.

80
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,760
That’s already more than two-thirds

81
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,670
of all the current Belt and Road projects.

82
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,150
Now, Mahatir’s government will be reviewing

83
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,900
each of these contracts,

84
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,690
which the new finance minister has called

85
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,560
“completely lopsided.”

86
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,260
They’ll be either canceling them

87
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,100
or re-negotiating those contracts.

88
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,650
Among the projects suspended

89
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,820
are several oil and gas pipelines

90
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,840
built by the state-backed China Petroleum
Pipeline Bureau.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,870
But the biggest project that’s been suspended

92
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,350
is the East Coast Rail Link.

93
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,100
The construction was being handled by China’s
state-owned

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,920
China Communication Construction Company.

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,100
And “85% of the financing was provided

96
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,320
by the Export Import Bank of China.”

97
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,530
The 430-mile rail line would connect

98
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,459
a northeastern port on the South China Sea

99
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,860
with strategic shipping ports on Malaysia’s
west coast.

100
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,729
This is a key route linking the Belt and Road

101
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,870
through Southeast Asia.

102
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,520
At least until the project got suspended.

103
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,979
One of the reasons Mahathir's government suspended
it

104
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,509
is that the ministry of finance

105
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,080
calculated the true cost of the project

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,090
to be 20 billion dollars,

107
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,300
which is 3.5 billion more

108
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,169
than the previous government’s estimates.”

109
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,210
And that’s just too much money for Malaysia—

110
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,930
a country that already has a problem with
national debt.

111
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,210
Also, corruption.

112
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,419
Remember how I said Najib was super into Chinese
investment?

113
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,800
Well that’s because he was able to use it
to finance

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,979
his massively corrupt projects.

115
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,100
You know those oil and gas pipeline projects

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,889
that got shut down?

117
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,130
They had links to a Malaysian development
company

118
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,870
called 1Malaysia Development Berhad,

119
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,370
or 1MDB for short.

120
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,310
That company is owned entirely

121
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,460
by the Malaysian Finance Ministry.

122
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,070
And guess what?

123
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,110
Under Najib, 4.5 billion dollars went missing.

124
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,130
And 700 million of that money flowed directly

125
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,759
into Najib’s personal bank accounts.

126
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,580
Huge mistake.

127
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,379
If you’re going to steal public money,

128
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,500
at least do a better job of hiding it!

129
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,930
Using your own personal bank accounts?

130
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,969
Rookie move, Najib.

131
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:44,639
Anyway, the new finance minister has been
looking into that.

132
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,270
And what he thinks happened is that Najib’s
government

133
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,169
used money from the Export-Import Bank of
China

134
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,009
to buy land owned by its own 1MDB company,

135
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,110
so it could pay off its debts.

136
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,409
And that’s not the only Chinese company
that was a little shady.

137
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,560
China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau that was building

138
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,749
those oil and gas pipelines I talked about
earlier

139
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,270
also got a little perk.

140
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,740
Najib’s government was paying them for construction

141
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,349
that didn’t actually take place.

142
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:16,770
“Only an average of 13 per cent of the pipelines’
construction

143
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,320
has been completed,

144
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,309
while almost 90 per cent of the projects’
value

145
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:23,460
has been paid to CPPB.”

146
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,759
Hmm, very interesting.

147
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,270
Najib, by the way, was arrested last Wednesday.

148
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,090
He’s been charged with “criminal breach
of trust and corruption.”

149
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,259
He pled not guilty.

150
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,409
So Mahathir goes after Najib for corruption

151
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,029
and hits the Chinese investments

152
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,740
that may have played a big old role in it.

153
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
But this isn’t just a problem for Najib.

154
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,520
It’s also a problem for the Chinese Communist
Party.

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,660
The current Malaysian government

156
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,210
wants to dramatically reduce construction
costs.

157
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,270
And they want to renegotiate or cancel

158
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,139
a lot of their contracts with Chinese companies.

159
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,139
Mahathir has said that he’s not against

160
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,839
the Belt and Road Initiative,

161
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,919
but that he wants to renegotiate some of the
terms.

162
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,099
And he’s headed to China next month to do
that.

163
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,629
This has become a big test of Beijing’s
flexibility.

164
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,159
The Chinese Communist Party has always tried

165
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:15,949
to leverage the size of China and its economy

166
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,059
to “help” it’s smaller neighbors in
Southeast Asia.

167
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,199
And by “help,” I mean help them go into
debt

168
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,189
so they become dependent on Chinese money,

169
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:28,610
while building infrastructure with Chinese
companies

170
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,150
that shut out local workers.

171
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,259
But now, that pesky new Malaysian government
is saying,

172
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,069
wait a minute, not so fast.

173
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,889
And the Communist Party may be finding out

174
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,610
it’s not quite as powerful as all the bluster.

175
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,639
And what’s “Worse for China,

176
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,930
other governments along its lengthy trade
passages

177
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,240
may get similar ideas.

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Some might push to use more domestic contractors

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,059
or seek better debt terms.

180
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,800
A combative Malaysia could easily be

181
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,039
just one of many bumps to come.”

182
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,409
Of course, my favorite Chinese state-run media,

183
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,619
the Global Times, is very concerned

184
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,389
that this move to suspend Chinese investment

185
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,719
could be very tough... for Malaysia.

186
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:13,849
Particularly “the inconsistency and capriciousness”

187
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,749
of the Malaysian government.

188
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:16,770
But just when you think you’ve got

189
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,770
Chinese state-run media figured out,

190
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,499
they throw you a curveball—

191
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,439
and actually tell the truth.

192
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,050
Like when they said that “Malaysia is a
key point

193
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,569
along the routes of the Belt and Road initiative.”

194
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,340
Yes, it sure is.

195
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,329
And I think the Chinese Communist Party

196
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:34,300
has just figured that out.

197
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,180
So what do you think about how Chinese investment

198
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,779
may or may not have played a role in corruption
in Malaysia?

199
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,959
And is this a turning point

200
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,130
in the Party’s quest for world domination?

201

from fans

203

who support China Uncensored

204
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,170
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

205
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,620
Wesley Brewer asks,

206
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,040
“What is your opinion on how China (PRC)

207
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,870
and China (ROC) [meaning Taiwan]

208
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,130
should be recognized in global politics?

209
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,160
Two China Policy?

210
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,240
One?”

211
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,420
Good question.

212
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,759
Once upon a time,

213
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,680
most countries recognized Taiwan,

214
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,060
the Republic of China, or ROC,

215
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,370
as the legitimate government of China.

216
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,839
It wasn’t until 1971 that the UN

217
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,310
switched to the People’s Republic of China,

218
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,029
which is run by the Chinese Communist Party.

219
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,480
The US made the switch in 1979,

220
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,670
and 90% of other countries have followed suit.

221
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,320
The Chinese Communist Party has basically

222
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,150
made the entire world pick:

223
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,300
“You can only recognize one China,

224
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,769
so will it be us,

225
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:41,110
the big China with a billion people?

226
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,310
Or will it be the puny island of Taiwan?”

227
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,079
But I believe that’s a false choice.

228
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,550
More and more, in Taiwan,

229
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,780
the people see themselves as a completely
separate nation,

230
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,360
an already independent country

231
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,230
with their own identity that should be recognized

232
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,210
by the international community.

233
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,040
It’s just that other countries

234
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,170
have all agreed to the false choice,

235
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,850
that there can only be one China.

236
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,880
So they’ve all picked only one China

237
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,079
to have diplomatic relations with.

238
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,180
In theory, the United States could officially
recognize

239
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,540
both the PRC and Taiwan as individual countries.

240
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,750
And if they did that,

241
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,740
then other countries would probably do that
too.

242
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,560
But that would be a dramatic change in US
foreign policy,

243
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,340
and it would anger the Communist Party

244
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,240
to an extraordinary degree.

245
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,180
The alternative is to continue pretending

246
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,930
that Taiwan isn’t really a country,

247
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,320
but that’s also...

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,269
not a great long-term solution,

249
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:39,980
since it means constantly pretending

250
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,080
something isn’t the way it really is.

251
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,660
I don’t have the answer here.

252
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,380
But there’s another possible scenario, too.

253
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,450
If the Chinese Communist Party collapses someday,

254
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,889
there might be a new government

255
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,930
that doesn’t care so much about claiming

256
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,690
Taiwan as a province of China.

257
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,170
And then the situation would resolve itself.

258
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,759
Wait...if the Chinese Communist Party collapses,

259
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,210
then what would I be uncensoring on this show?

260
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,820
I’d be out of a job!

261
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,480
I guess there’s always Russia Uncensored.

262
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,079

00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,079
