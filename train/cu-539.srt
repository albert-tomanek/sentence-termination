00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,109
the Chinese regime is hacking US defense contractors.

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:07,160
Look guys,

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,180
password1 is a bad password.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,720
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,380
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,670
The Chinese Communist Party has hacked the
US...

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,880
again.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,439
And this time, they’ve stolen military secrets.

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,039
I’m sure everything is fine.

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,599
This particular hack happened in January and
February 2018.

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,649
The Washington Post reports the Chinese Communist
Party

13
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,690
was able to get its hands on hundreds of gigabytes
of data,

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,480
on everything from strategic submarine warfare
data,

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,680
to a secretive project known as Sea Dragon.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,289
Well I guess it might as well be a Sea Monkey
now.

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,530
The program began in 2012.

18
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,390
It was supposed to “adapt existing U.S.
military technologies

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,379
to new applications,” into a “disruptive
offensive capability.”

20
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,039
And the Pentagon has spent about 300 million
dollars

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,300
on Sea Dragon since 2015.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,840
Good to know.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,450
The Chinese hack also stole

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,800
“secret plans to develop a supersonic anti-ship
missile

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,440
for use on U.S. submarines by 2020.”

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,940
It’s unclear from the original report in
the Washington Post

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,310
if the supersonic missile is part of the Sea
Dragon,

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,520
or something else.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
Either way,

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,990
the Chinese regime has it now.

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,780
I’m sure they’ll put it to good use.

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,690
Now there’s good news and bad news to this.

33
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,850
The good news is,

34
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,990
everything that was hacked was technically
unclassified.

35
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,090
The bad news is that the Chinese authorities
got so much

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,350
interrelated sensitive data that they could
still put it together

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,990
to paint an overall picture of US submarine
warfare

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,590
that could be considered classified.

39
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,240
For example, the Chinese Communist Party

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,460
could now know how close a Chinese sub

41
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,970
can get to the US navy before it’s detected.

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,240
Whereas before, they had to rely on tactical
dolphins.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,590
Now it’s not really surprising that the
Chinese regime

44
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,170
hacked the US military.

45
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,650
Remember, Chinese hackers stole the designs
for the F-35,

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,659
which the US spent $400 billion dollars to
develop.

47
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,299
Chinese hackers also stole designs

48
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:23,269
for the Patriot PAC-3 missile system.

49
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,709
And they tried to steal plans

50
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,040
for the THAAD missile defense system

51
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,549
the US installed in South Korea.

52
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,609
They also got plans for, “the Black Hawk
helicopter

53
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,790
and the Navy’s new Littoral Combat Ship.”

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,560
You know what, this is not looking good for
the US military.

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,489
But I’m sure this is happening because Chinese
military hackers

56
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,860
are just so advanced, right?

57
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,930
What’s that, Shelley?

58
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,689
This stuff happens because defense contractors

59
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:51,499
forget to use passwords?!

60
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:53,629
I mean, come on!

61
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:56,430
Even my grandmother knows how to use passwords.

62
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,650
Ok, her password is “grandma’s password”

63
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,999
but that’s better than nothing.

64
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,609
Now the name of the contractor that was hacked
earlier this year

65
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:06,659
for the information on submarine warfare

66
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,810
was not released to the public.

67
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,999
And we don’t know how they were hacked in
this case.

68
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,079
But the good news is...this is something the
US military

69
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,280
is actively concerned about.

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,170
Here’s Admiral Philip Davidson talking about
Chinese hacking

71
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,079
at a recent Senate Armed Services Committee.

72
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,650
“I believe they are stealing technology

73
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,799
in just about every domain,

74
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,340
and trying to use it to their advantage.”

75
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,129
“And what's the means they use to steal
that technology?”

76
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,999
“One of the main concerns that we have,
sir,

77
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:43,620
is ­cyber and penetration of the dot-com
networks,

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,230
exploiting technology from our defense contractors,

79
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,299
in some instances.”

80
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,769
In this report from February, it says,

81
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,849
“Most detected Chinese cyber operations
are focused

82
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,319
on defense contractors or IT and communications
firms.”

83
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,279
And yet, despite being targets of Chinese
hacking,

84
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:09,090
these defense contractors aren’t always
great about...defense.

85
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,640
I guess that’s...ironic?

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,959
Of course it doesn’t help when the Pentagon
itself screws up.

87
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,540
Fortunately, in response to all this coming
to light,

88
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,280
“the Pentagon inspector general’s office
said that

89
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,770
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had asked it
to review

90
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,160
contractor cybersecurity issues.”

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,690
Hey, I have an idea for how to protect

92
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,700
top secret military files from Chinese hackers.

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,890
Since, you know, using passwords doesn’t
work for us.

94
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,280
We can just rename our top secret military
files

95
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
so they sound really boring.

96
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,620
Like, instead of calling this

97
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,160
strategic submarine warfare program

98
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Sea Dragon,

99
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,510
let’s call it Sea Cucumber.

100
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,260
It’s just like how if you have top secret
files

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,450
on your computer,

102
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,571
like photos of your embarrassingly extensive

103
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,280
beanie baby collection,

104
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,640
not that I have one,

105
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,690
you should put them in a folder

106
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,080
called Family Vacation Photos.

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,310
No one will ever open it.

108
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,020
Plus, imagine the Chinese hacker who has to
brag about

109
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,040
stealing the operation Sea Cucumber files.

110
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,500
The other Chinese hackers will laugh at him
forever.

111
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,630
Which is why this plan is foolproof.

112
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,680
And before we go,

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,530
it’s time for me to answer another fan question.

114
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,890
Evan B asks,

115
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,060
“Chris, how do you think China’s military
would fare

116
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,750
in a full-scale war against another western
nation?”

117
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,490
Well, you might think that will all the hacking,

118
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,870
the Chinese military could be an equal match
someday.

119
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,920
But I doubt it.

120
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,310
If it ever came down to a boots-on-the-ground

121
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,700
World War II style conflict between China
and,

122
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,270
let’s say, the US...

123
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,470
with equipment and troop size being roughly
equal,

124
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,780
the US would for sure win.

125
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,190
That’s because the US military

126
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,590
has extensive combat experience,

127
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,970
and hardly anyone in the Chinese military
does.

128
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,760
But that’s not how the Chinese military
thinks about warfare.

129
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,010
They look at it as asymmetrical warfare.

130
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,770
So instead of going toe to toe with guns and
airplanes,

131
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,750
the Chinese military would do things like:

132
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,590
disrupt the power grid in American cities,

133
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,270
disrupt our financial system,

134
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,870
or even poison our drinking water—

135
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,170
which is actually something we know the Soviets

136
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,310
once had a plan for.

137
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,600
The Communist Party would have zero qualms
about

138
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,130
killing American civilians.

139
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,820
I mean, look how they treat Chinese civilians.

140
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,140
So a war with communist China would be very
problematic.

141
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,530
It’s just not the knockoff F-35s I’d be
worried about.

142
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,530
I’d like to think, though, that the US would
still win—

143
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,530
not just with better firepower,

144
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,530
but by the sheer willpower of its citizens.

145
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,530
I’m thinking Red Dawn here.

146
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,530
I just hope we never find out.

147
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,530
And on that delightful note,

148
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,530
what do you think about the Chinese hacking
of

149
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,530
US defense contractors?

150
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,530
And what should the US Navy

151
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,720
name its next secret project?
