00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,940
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,480
who wins Brexit?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,820
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m host
Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,249
You know, I’m a busy man.

5
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:15,940
That’s why I like portmanteaus.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,870
Things are so much easier to understand when
they’re one word.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,800
Like brunch.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,770
Or sharknado.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,910
And most recently, Brexit.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,500
Yes, the UK narrowly voted in a nationwide
surveymonkey poll

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,800
to leave the European Union, which,

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,249
to use the traditional English vernacular,

13
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,989
“didn't quite go as planned.”

14
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,800
So yes, Brexit may have cost us all,

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,239
“a bit of pocket change.”

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,600
But really, who’s the br’inner in all
this?

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,539
And who’s the br’oser?

18
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,429
Bresides Britain of course?

19
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,709
China.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,180
China just hit the propaganda jackpot.

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,519
As Quartz puts it,

22
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,469
“Brexit gives China’s Communist Party
concrete evidence

23
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,829
that democracy can be catastrophic.”

24
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,870
Chinese state-run media is eating it up.

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,380
The UK leaving the EU is like a bomb;

26
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,440
The ground is moving and the mountains are
shaking.”

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,660
One professor at Renmin University of China
said democracy is “a game,”

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,640
that was “kidnapped by populism,”

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,950
and resulted in “tragedy.”

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,470
And can you imagine what “tragedies” would
befall China

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,170
if people there got to vote?

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,440
And it’s a good thing for the Chinese regime
that Brexit

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,390
has become such a propaganda boom

34
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,640
because in every other respect,

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,210
Brexit is a disaster for China.

36
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,620
Well, maybe not the Chinese stock market.

37
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,430
That’s actually gone up since Brexit.

38
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,770
But that’s only because China’s central
bank

39
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,660
poured billions of yuan into the market since
the vote.

40
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,230
And that kind of top-down benevolence just
doesn’t happen in a democracy.

41
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,920
But unfortunately for the Chinese regime,

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,659
Brexit has foiled their long term plans for
infiltrating Europe.

43
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,610
China has invested heavily in the United Kingdom.

44
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,670
Britain is currently China’s top destination
when it comes

45
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,300
to investing in Europe.

46
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,630
20% of all Chinese direct foreign investment
in Europe goes to the UK.

47
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,520
And the British government knew which side
its biscuits were buttered on.

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,260
The United Kingdom has made no secret of the fact

49
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,600
that it wants to strengthen ties with China.”

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,350
And that’s thanks largely to soon-to-be-former-Prime
Minister David Cameron.

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,190
He was the first head of state in the European
Union

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,520
to publicly push for a free trade deal between
the EU and China.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,940
Yeah, the Chinese regime got in good with
Cameron.

54
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,500
They even made plans to build a bunch of nuclear
reactors in England.

55
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
It was part of the so-called Golden Era China-UK
relations.

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,030
“I think this is going to be a very important
moment for British-Chinese relations which

57
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,860
are in a very good state,

58
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,600
something of a golden era in our relationship.”

59
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,680
I mean, it can really only go up since the
Opium Wars.

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,900
But anyway, under Prime Minister Cameron,

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,740
the UK was the first EU member that wanted
to give China

62
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,400
Full Market Economy status.

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,480
That would have made it it harder for the
EU to impose tariffs

64
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,270
on cheap Chinese goods that flood the European
market.

65
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,390
But that’s all likely to change thanks to
Brexit.

66
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,490
That’s partly because other powerful members
of the EU

67
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,310
don’t have such a cozy relationship with
China.

68
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,459
Germany’s Economy Minister recently said
Germany needs to

69
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,739
take “an aggressive position against China.”

70
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,020
China is already in an economic slump,

71
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,680
with growth at a record low of

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,080
“no one really believes their GDP data anymore.”

73
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,800
So anything that could slow China’s trade
with Europe

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
can now do real damage to China’s economy.

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,599
Even China’s relationship with the UK itself
may get a bit icy.

76
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,489
This recent report to Westminster by activists
and conservative MPs,

77
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:56,470
called the Darkest Moment,

78
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,739
says the UK should distance itself from China.

79
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,709
One of the report’s authors, Dr. Christopher
Hancock,

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,940
said in a statement that

81
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,459
“British citizens can, and must,

82
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,690
attempt to change their government’s hitherto
misguided response to [China].”

83
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,190
So as David Cameron steps aside,

84
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,780
it might be the “hitherto” Golden Era
that takes a Brexit.

85
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,690
Or is it a Chexit?

86
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,720
So what do you think about the impact of Brexit
on China?

87
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,930
Leave your comments below.

88
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,810
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

89
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,400
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
