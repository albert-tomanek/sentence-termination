00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Today's show is sponsored by
Arnold Schwarzenegger's One-Sided Chess Set.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,600
'I'll be black.'

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,540
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,760
I have an almost-randomly selected article

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,220
from everybody's favourite
reliable source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,200
and these folks can't see it.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,620
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,120
and there's a special prize
for particularly good answers, which is...

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,140
And today we have an article with 'multiple issues'.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,020
ALL: Oooo.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,060
It needs additional citations;

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,200
it may need to be rewritten entirely...

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,180
But nevertheless, we are talking about the flag of Mars.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,660
Right.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,000
So this is a question about the people
who make Galaxy chocolate, yes?

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,280
Yes, totally, yes.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,580
It's a bit like a Japanese flag,
only it's a big Malteser in the middle.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,340
Surely that's the Maltese flag?

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,580
Ohhh, you!

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,680
Oh, he's got you there!

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,340
He got me bang to rights!

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,280
Meanwhile, across the river...
there is the flag of Cadbury's.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,180
Yes.
[Laughter]

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,580
'We march beneath our purple banner to GLORY!'

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,120
Just loading cannons, again with Maltesers.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,220
Just as grapeshot.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,680
'This is the most delicious battle ev —
AAUGH!'

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,760
Aaah!

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,340
'Still pretty good...'

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,980
Honeycomb and chocolate in the eye at velocity!

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,980
So goggles, obviously, is the first consideration,
I think we can all agree.

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,660
Hershey's won't join until 1941.

33
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,540
ALL: Ohhh!
[Laughter]

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,400
Yes!

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
And it'll just be terrible anyway.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,320
That's more of a comment on their chocolate.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,280
Cadbury's sending in the 1st Mounted Freddos,
as the first....

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,820
No, they'd send in Taz's!
Could you imagine the devastation?

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,240
That's why Freddos went up to 20p.
There was a shortage after the battle.

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,520
Right. Massacred. Massacred.

41
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,460
Caramel guts sprayed all over the place!

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,000
'Leave me! Leave me! Go on yourself!'

43
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,120
'Aaargh!'

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,940
I've just got the thought of Mars...

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,160
like they were multiple rocket-launchers in World War II,

46
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,560
a Mars bar, like that.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,360
Thump! Thump! Thump!

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,880
I've just got the idea that Swiss chocolate
is sitting in the middle.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,800
— 'Not happening!'
— Nope, nope.

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,220
Curly Wurlys used as trenching ladders.

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,300
[Laughter]

52
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,860
Using Revels as grenades.

53
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,700
Do you remember the Cadbury's Caramel rabbit?

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,860
— Yes I do.
— She'd be Florence Nightingale.

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
I was thinking she was the cheesecake for the troops.

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,140
— Oh crikey. Steady lad!
— And the old ENSA shows.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,440
Be still!

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,080
[Husky voice]
'Hi boys... I'll just undo the wrapper slightly...'

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,540
[Cheers]

60
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,780
'Show us your gooey centre!'

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
[Laughter]
[Groans]

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,800
That's the greatest laugh I've ever heard!

63
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,140
Don't make him self-conscious of his laugh.
He's got to keep it going.

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,960
No! That would be even worse.

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
It was actually — you know what...

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,580
Horribly, I was laughing over the thought
of one-legged Freddos...

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,960
'Yeah, lost the leg back in '15 in the Chocolate Wars.'

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,300
'They did melt a new one onto me, but it's not the same.'

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
It's a leg from a Santa.

70
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,740
I just got the thought of Taz's
riding those Lindt rabbits.

71
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,380
No, Lindt... Oh, no, Lindt's German, isn't it.

72
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,920
It's not Swiss. I thought, yeah, Swiss neutrality, but yeah.

73
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
'Chaaarge!'

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,240
Christ, have I told you about this,
when I went to the Lindt factory...

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
— Hello!
— ...in Germany.

76
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,560
Did you find the weapons stockpile or something?

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,940
No, sadly it's even better than that.

78
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,120
Because... you know, you go to the Cadbury's thing,

79
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,420
and it's pretty much on the site of the real factory...

80
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,380
— Yeah.
— You're just one room over.

81
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,020
Well, Lindt have got this little one
that's on an island in one of the rivers...

82
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,300
I forget which German city it is, I do apologize.

83
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,760
And so you go on through,
and they've got the fake little factory bit,

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,160
and then there's this big display board about Mr Lindt.

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,060
Okay.

86
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,480
Saying, 'da da da... Mr Lindt started this company
in blah blah blah blah in da da da...'

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,460
Then the war starts: 'Sadly, Mr Lindt was tragically killed in 1918.'

88
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,100
So it's like, oh, so he went to war, you know...
it was a bombing raid or whatever...

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,460
No! Mr Lindt died when one of his own
fondant boilers exploded.

90
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,600
Ohhh!

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,580
And covered him in delicious goo!

92
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,680
— If you're gonna go...!
— Death by chocolate!

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
[Laughter]

94
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,380
And if someone didn't say that at the time...
[Laughter]

95
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,840
'Eh? I know it's a little bit soon but, er...'

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,760
[Together]  'Death by chocolate? Eh?'

97
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,420
I can hear the damn muted trombone...

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,360
ALL: Womp womp womp...

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,300
'No, it was horrifically heated caramel, Vicar.'

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
[Laughter]

101
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
'There's a reason the casket is closed.'

102
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,640
'But, er...
Still good!'

103
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,840
'In death, as in life... Mr Lindt was delicious.'

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,520
[Laughter]

105
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,860
'All right [??], he may now be just
the human equivalent of a Daim bar...'

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,240
Oh! Bad time to take a sip of water, Matt.

107
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,980
'Soft on the outside, crunchy on the inside — Mr Lindt!'

108
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,460
I almost feel sorry for a man who's been dead
nearly a hundred years now.

109
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,420
A long time ago...

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
ALL: In a galaxy far, far away...

111
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,620
Galaxy!

112
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,520
ALL: Heyyy!

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
We were talking about the flag of Mars.

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,620
Yes.
Is it red?

115
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,500
Only in part.

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Is the red bit red?

117
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,520
— Yes.
— Ah, there we go.

118
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,980
— Point. [DING]
— Yaaay!

119
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,060
Not sure why.

120
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,400
Is the red bit Mars-shaped, i.e. a circle?

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
No, not at all. It's very much symbolic, and...

122
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,700
Is it a red horizon and then
sort of a black upper band or something?

123
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,300
Ooh, close to that.

124
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,200
— Blue upper band?
— Oh, with two stars, the Earth and the Moon?

125
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,980
— And the sun?
— No...

126
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
I'm going to give you a point for blue band as well. [DING]

127
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,480
You've got a red band and a blue band...

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,280
Oh, okay.

129
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,140
It's a tricolor, like the French flag or the German flag.

130
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,560
Right, okay — what, sideways?

131
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,660
Sideways.

132
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,260
Red, blue...

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,180
Red, blue and green,
after Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Trilogy.

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,000
[DING]
No way!

135
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,740
No way!

136
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,220
Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars, in that order,

137
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,700
representing past and possible futures of Mars.

138
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Oh, right, green being when we astroturf it.

139
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
...manage to terraform it.

140
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
And blue when it has water. Yes.

141
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,040
Right. So the green is the bit where we turf it over

142
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,400
and have a country park or something like that —
a picnic area...

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,880
Just —
that's where we're going to send all the football.

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,620
Because we don't need it here on Earth.

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,260
I would disagree.

146
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,960
That is a great, great idea.

147
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,660
...No.

148
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
You don't have to agree.
You're welcome to go to Mars too!

149
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,600
No, no, I will be on the supporters' bus
to Mars and back on a Saturday.

150
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I just like the idea of low-gravity football now.

151
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,240
Mmm, that's got a certain charm to it, hasn't it.

152
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,720
It'd be a sod to control.

153
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,600
You hoof it, and it comes back and hits you in the head.

154
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,900
Well, did you ever play Brazilian football at school,

155
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,920
where you're in the hall,
and off the walls is perfectly valid?

156
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,620
— Yes, I did, yes, yes...
— I never played that!

157
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,240
Ah, it's great. It's a game of football
I can actually get behind.

158
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,620
Imagine that — if we could get one of these floaty...

159
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,620
You know the big fan chambers
where you pretend you're skydiving?

160
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,560
[Gasps]

161
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
— Ohhh!
— Oh no, you see, I've been to one of them.

162
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,860
You can't control anything in it.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Your bladder?

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes. You have to wear a diaper before you go in...

165
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Tom Scott's Anti-Gravity S***ting.

166
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,840
Nappy, surely.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,620
Tom Scott: Pissing In The Wind.

168
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,640
'Aaaaah!'

169
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,580
[Together]  'I'm singing in the rain...'

170
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,000
Ohh! You horrible human beings.

171
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,940
So what's relative gravity on Mars?

172
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,560
— Er...
— Give me a moment...

173
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,580
— More than the Moon.
— More than a six. It's nearly one-to-one, isn't it?

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,420
It's actually about a third of gravity — 0.37.

175
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,260
— Really?
— Yeah.

176
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,640
What, less — is it a third...?

177
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,740
Okay. So I'm going to grasp sketchily here
with my poor knowledge of physics...

178
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,340
but are we now talking about a pitch
that's three times the size

179
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,580
for the ball to come down?

180
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,780
Or do we just make the ball three times heavier?

181
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,160
I just think you ask players
to control themselves, quite frankly.

182
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,560
Oh, you make it a game of subtlety and finesse

183
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Yes, and learn the Martian game.

184
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,340
— Oooh.
— Oooh!

185
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,120
You can tell who actually bothered by football, here.

186
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,120
Because you'd be able to jump higher...

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,320
— Ohhh!
— So, theoretically...

188
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Headers'd be marvelous!

189
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,100
— I think...
— It's not...

190
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,380
I think with a third gravity you could expect someone

191
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,160
to be able to jump over someone else.

192
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,320
— Yeah.
— I don't think that's an unreasonable...

193
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,480
It'd be like Quidditch!

194
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,940
I'm just thinking, actually,
we take it back to the futsal thing,

195
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,200
and off the ceiling is perfectly valid.

196
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,300
Oh, you would have to have a ceiling, you're right.

197
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,440
You would have to have a roof, you would.

198
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,660
That solves it, yeah.

199
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
It would have to be indoors, and therefore...

200
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,240
Because otherwise you're going to be running for miles
to get the damn ball back.

201
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
Yeah. And a third gravity...

202
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,900
Potentially, I mean, how long could you do
the halfway wall-running thing?

203
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
— Ohhh.
— Under those auspices?

204
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,300
'I'm just gonna dribble it three feet up
on the wall here past you...' You know.

205
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,060
I wouldn't, no. I wouldn't allow that.
I think you'd... no.

206
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,720
I wouldn't be fine with running up the walls.

207
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
— Well, you're not, you're running along the wall.
— What if you had, like, curved...

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,460
Oh, yeah!

209
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
Like a velodrome.

210
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,900
Like a half-pipe. A big half-pipe.

211
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,840
Because you'd be able to get enough speed up
to do these curving runs...

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,100
Nah, it's not the spirit.
I think people would just have to accept that...

213
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,600
— Oh, yeah! Because the spirit of the game...
— Not in the spirit of the game!

214
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,200
The spirit of the game is on Mars.

215
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,620
Is on Mars. Yes.

216
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,040
Well, I think that Mars City,
as they will undoubtedly be known...

217
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,260
or United, there may be two teams.
It may be able to support two teams, I don't know...

218
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
would inevitably have a home advantage.

219
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,240
The Mars Derby!

220
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,720
The Mars Derby would be the...

221
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,140
No, they wouldn't have home advantage.

222
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,900
Don't forget that the original premise is,

223
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,380
we're shipping every one of the buggers up there!

224
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,160
Oh no, I was just thinking of starting a...
of having a team up there and...

225
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,260
Nope! Ship 'em all off. Goodbye!

226
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,700
One hell of an away trip.

227
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,220
It'd be a bit like when QPR had astroturfed the pitch,

228
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,460
everyone said they had an unfair advantage.

229
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,100
I think it'd be the same with Mars United.

230
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,680
I think they would have an unfair advantage.

231
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,300
Because they'd have all the breathing apparatus.

232
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,720
GARY: They would. They would.

233
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Like Arnie in Total Recall.

234
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,680
I tell you what, the away attendances
would be shocking, wouldn't they.

235
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,840
When you're a few years...

236
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,980
'And it's a very lifeless crowd here today...'
[Laughter]

237
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,740
When you're a few years down the line, though,
we'd have people who'd grown up on Mars,

238
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,440
who are presumably taller, more adapted to gravity.

239
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,500
— Like, at that point...
— They couldn't transfer to the Earth game, could they.

240
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,700
— They wouldn't have the muscle tone.
— No.

241
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,840
They'd look at us as a race of
semi-evolved dwarfs, wouldn't they?

242
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Which is why I think we should just nuke Mars now.

243
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,380
And just nip this in the bud.

244
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,840
Get the first dibs in.

245
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,360
What you're saying is, we should just
fire a Mars at Mars now.

246
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,440
Yes. I think we really should.

247
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
And leave the Freddos where they are.

248
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
They've suffered enough.

249
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,060
'Eat nougaty death, ye Martian bastards!'

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm just thinking...
because there's the idea of 'Rods from God'...

251
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,680
Yes! Hyper-accelerated Mars bar.

252
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,180
— Boomf.
— Yeah! Whoomp!

253
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,620
Rods from God — do you know the concept?

254
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,040
The idea that the only space weapon you really need

255
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,760
is a big titanium rod just sitting on a satellite,

256
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,980
and then when you're over the city you want,
you just drop it.

257
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,300
Poor Titanium Rod, sat up there on his own.

258
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,360
I'd like to see if you could get, like,
Rod Stewart and drop him on...

259
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,240
— Yes.
— Ha!

260
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,080
[Sings]  'Baaaby Jane...'

261
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,260
No, that's more...

262
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,820
That's more psychological warfare.
You parachute him in, still alive.

263
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,440
'My name is Titanium Rod.'

264
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,600
'And I, ironically, am the man
who's in charge of the titanium rods.'

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,260
When it arrives it has as much kinetic energy
as an atomic bomb would.

266
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
And it levels the city.

267
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,620
And all you need to do is
get the thing up there in the first place.

268
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,940
— How would you do that?
— 'All you need to do,' yeah.

269
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,560
*Someone* will drop one, won't they,
while they're up there.

270
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,620
'Ooop! Bugger.'

271
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,120
— Ohhh...
— 'Oh, there she goes...'

272
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,020
'Oh, s***.'

273
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,840
'Hello? Is this Chicago?
I've, er, got some bad news...'

274
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,780
There's actually a thing that would prevent both...

275
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, a legal thing that prevents both
the development of weapons like that,

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
*and* it's the reason the flag of Mars isn't official.

277
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,900
Does anyone know what it is?

278
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,360
Who owns Mars?

279
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,640
Bet they've sold off plots of it
like they have on the Moon.

280
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,500
Yeah.

281
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,560
They absolutely have, but again,
this is the thing that prevents it.

282
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
— Does anyone know what the...?
— No.

283
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,160
The International Treaty on
Not Being a Dick About Mars.

284
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm going to give you a point.
It's the Outer Space Treaty.

285
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,800
Yeah, Interstellar Treaty...

286
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,720
[DING]
Yeah.

287
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,040
The Outer Space Treaty
bans weapons of mass destruction

288
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,320
in orbit, or on the Moon, or anywhere else.

289
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,900
And it also means that all the celestial bodies
are open to mankind.

290
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,320
Did anyone tell China about that?

291
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,220
Yeah, it'll presumably last
until someone actually lands there.

292
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,140
— Yeah. 'Now it's ours.'
— At which point... yes.

293
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,580
Could you take a medical titanium rod
into space under that pretense?

294
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,540
That's what happened with the supergun, isn't it?

295
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,060
— Yeah, it was.
— The supergun?

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,780
After the ban on NBC for Iraq...

297
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,720
Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, yeah.

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,120
After the ban for that in Iraq,
he started building an enormous...

299
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,780
Er, 'he'..

300
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,860
Saddam commissioned
an enormous conventional gun,

301
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,100
with a bore of about a metre, I think.

302
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I think the basic thought was,
'If I can't have biological and chemical weapons,

303
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,440
'I'll make the biggest, f***-off-est gun I can...'

304
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,220
Yeah. They've got a piece in...

305
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,180
Project Babylon.

306
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,880
— Oh cool!
— Heya.

307
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
[Matt] It fires gardens!
[Laughter]

308
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,380
The whole thing sort of fell apart, and whatever else,

309
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,220
but they've got a section of the barrel
in Duxford Air Museum.

310
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,320
I think it was Duxford — anyway...

311
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
'...barrel length of 46 metres'.

312
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,840
— Aww yeah.
— And that was the baby one, the first one.

313
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm looking around, looking at it...
'Made in Sheffield'.

314
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah.

315
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,600
No way!
[Laughter]

316
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,860
It was a company called Forgemasters, if I don't forget...

317
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,840
— Yeah.
— If I remember rightly, that were...

318
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,300
It does say here, 'The metal tubes...
were purchased from firms in the United Kingdom,

319
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,660
'...including Sheffield Forgemasters.'

320
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,780
That's it. And if you're going to have a steel company,

321
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,560
you call it something like that.

322
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,640
— Sheffield Forgemasters, yeah.
— Forgemasters!

323
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,360
Well, basically, they were told it was drainage pipe

324
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,680
that they were making,
*with a bore on it* in the middle.

325
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,140
'Yeah, we like to rifle our s***
so it gets away from the cities faster.'

326
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,500
[Laughter]

327
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,860
Just get right in the groove there!
Ptoom... Whoof!

328
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
'Were there any bullets left in the gun?'

329
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,940
'No, sir. By the time we got there, they'd been rifled.'

330
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
[Laughter and groans]

331
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,680
Yeah, Big Babylon was meant to be a one...

332
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Ha! Sorry — 'Big Babylon'!

333
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
...a one-metre-bore supergun.

334
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,720
A space gun. It would shoot into...

335
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,700
Oh, low orbit and then drop back down, yeah.

336
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,220
I seem to remember they got...

337
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,780
It was an MP or someone,
the guy that basically rumbled the whole thing.

338
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,580
Yeah.

339
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,520
Didn't he come up with the great phrase of,

340
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,380
'They said it was a sewage pipe, but how come it had
a thumping great muzzle on the end?'

341
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Well, there's some lovely commentary here, that...

342
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,640
'Neither of these devices could be elevated or trained,
making them useless for direct military purposes.'

343
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,060
You couldn't aim them.

344
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,960
— You just shot at *something*.
— Yes.

345
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
I think you vaguely aim at something in the distance,

346
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,540
and whatever it hits on, you go,
'See? We could move it...'

347
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
And it's also immobile,

348
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,260
which means it had the same
problem as Germany's V-3:

349
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,040
You can bomb it.

350
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,440
It's there.

351
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
It's five hundred feet long.

352
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,020
You're not going to miss that, are you?

353
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,160
You're not going to miss that.

354
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,500
You can see it from Mars.

355
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
I'll just fill the barrel with chocolate and watch it explode.

356
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
'Right, we've filled it with fondant, lads...'

357
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,080
'Next time it goes off,
it's Mr Lindt all over again!'

358
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,720
There is somewhere on Earth
where the Mars flag is flying right now.

359
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Kim Stanley Robinson's back yard.

360
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,780
Somewhere it's officially flying, by governmental decree.

361
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,600
Is it the same as another country's flag?

362
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,220
— No, not at all.
— Okay.

363
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm going to get bone obvious.

364
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,920
Are we saying something like Nasa

365
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
or the European Space Agency or something like that?

366
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,420
It's one of their facilities, yes.

367
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,660
The Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station —
which is a great name.

368
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,840
— Yes!
— Oh, okay.

369
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Does anyone want to take a guess where that is?

370
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,460
— In the Arctic.
— Is it in the Arctic?

371
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,440
Point. [DING] Absolutely.

372
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,540
[Laughter]
It's not a guess. You told us the answer.

373
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,360
Oh.
It's in the name!

374
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,460
Is the Flashline Arctic Research Station in the Arctic?

375
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,380
No! It's in Venezuela.

376
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
I just read the name!

377
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
I just... I read the name. I didn't...
[Laughter]

378
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,340
...didn't notice...

379
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,800
I thought that was intentional!

380
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,220
Keeping the point though!

381
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,400
There have been a couple of other fictional Mars flags.

382
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,620
This is the one that's sort of vaguely acceptable

383
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,600
Does anyone want to take a guess
what they might have been,

384
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,420
and where they might have been?

385
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Red background and blue letters: 'Mars'.

386
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
You know what, you are so close.

387
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
[Laughter]
Oh, okay.

388
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,840
— No way.
— It's not actually...

389
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,720
It's red lettering... it's red on a white background.

390
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,500
Yeah?

391
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,100
And it's not quite 'Mars' but it's something very similar.

392
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
This is from Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land.

393
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,640
I've not read that one.
I've read some Heinlein but not that one.

394
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,700
It was simply the symbol for Mars:

395
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
the male symbol, the circle with an arrow.

396
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,340
— Ahhh.
— Ohh.

397
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,260
The side effect of that being, you are essentially
just planting a sign that says, 'MEN!'

398
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,400
What a surprise! From Heinlein!

399
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,060
Er, yes, good point.

400
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,940
Basically you'd be planting a flag that's got
Austin Powers' medallion on it.

401
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
Yes. Mojo symbol.

402
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,620
And meanwhile on Venus,

403
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,200
there is a flag that is just literally...

404
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,060
There's a flag that's on fire.

405
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Briefly, before it's destroyed.

406
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,700
Well, you say that...
There was a plan that someone came up with

407
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,960
to colonize the upper atmosphere of Venus.

408
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,360
So what, fully orbital?

409
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,860
Everyone just has to tread water.

410
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,820
No, because the upper atmosphere
is about atmospheric pressure.

411
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,480
It's toxic air, but if it's at atmospheric pressure
and you get a leak,

412
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,120
'Oh. I will walk up and I will seal the leak.'

413
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,500
Put some Blu-Tack in it.

414
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,740
The temperature's about habitable,
the pressure's about habitable.

415
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,460
So if you can keep a giant balloon up there,

416
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,760
and the atmosphere is dense enough
that you could do that,

417
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,460
because our air is lighter,

418
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,880
you could theoretically have a bubble, just sitting...

419
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,580
Just a bubble city...

420
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah.

421
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,520
Cool!

422
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,880
Mind you, that titanium rod program
is coming on a treat.

423
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,440
Actually, going back to the earlier part of this conversation,

424
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,580
could you get a chocolate bar that could do that?

425
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,280
I think reentry might pose a problem for a Mars bar.

426
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,420
What if it were in a wrapper?

427
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,160
— What, like Eminem?
— Yeah. [Laughs]

428
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,060
So what you're espousing is,

429
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,900
putting a Mars bar in like, a round
that will burn up perfectly through reentry...

430
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,180
GARY: Yeeeup.

431
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,060
Leaving you with a solid Mars bar,
which will then refreeze in the upper atmosphere...

432
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,940
Correct.

433
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,620
Slowly defrost slightly, and then...

434
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,180
Well, it's not going to be as damaging,
but I like the way you're thinking.

435
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah.

436
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
That's the ultimate middle finger, isn't it?

437
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,900
[American accent] 'Well, I do believe we are
gonna attack you with nuclear weapons.'

438
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,420
'Ooh! Mars bar!'

439
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,740
'Nuclear weapons? F*** that.
We can take you down with a Mars bar.'

440
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,200
'Gentlemen, I have an announcement...

441
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,680
'I have a Yorkie strategically positioned

442
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,780
'over the major centres of the world.'

443
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Actually, yeah, that is your weapon of choice.

444
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,500
Unless you can afford some of that posh dark chocolate.

445
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,920
But I don't think the Swiss'd sell it to you.

446
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,740
I don't think they'd do it. So yeah, basically the...

447
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,600
The weapon of choice for Britain
in the space chocolate arms race

448
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,620
— ...has to be the Yorkie.
— Has to be the Yorkie, yeah.

449
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,000
I know the Swiss'd be wheeling out
the Toblerone and all that,

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,880
but if you've got to keep up with the arms race,

451
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,420
we'd just put up a fruit and nut one.

452
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
[Laughter]

453
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,400
Also I'm now just —
with you saying the fruit and nut,

454
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm now channeling the start of Flash Gordon.

455
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,100
[Laughter]
TOM: Oh yeah.

456
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
'Hot sultanas! Hot hazelnuts!'

457
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
'Most effective, Your Majesty.'

458
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,580
'Fudge sauce.'

459
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Just going around trying to catch it all with ice cream.

460
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,660
[Laughter]

461
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,420
'Sir, are you destroying the Earth or making a dessert?'

462
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,460
Both.

463
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,680
Little from Column A, little from Column B.

464
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,540
'But how many will die as a result of this attack?'

465
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
'Hundreds-and-thousands.'

466
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes! You win!

467
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,180
Tom, he wins!

468
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,980
I feel we've been building towards that moment
for the whole episode.

469
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Cut. Print. Let's go home.

470
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,880
At the end of the show, Gary — congratulations, you win.

471
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,660
Er, you've won...

472
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
You've won a holiday to a French resort

473
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,680
with Sulu from Star Trek
and the director of Transformers.

474
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,360
It's George Takei and Michael Bay's
Week Away in Saint-Tropez.

475
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,860
[Takei voice] 'Oh my.'

476
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
Enjoy that!

477
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,560
— That's been Matt Gray...
— Bye-bye!

478
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,760
That's been Gary Brannan...

479
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,020
That's been Chris Joel...

480
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,860
I've been Tom Scott, and we'll see you next time.

481
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,120
That was our show!
