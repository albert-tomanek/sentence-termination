00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,650
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,920
10 things people get wrong about Taiwan.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,640
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,860
I’m in Taipei,

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,880
the capital of a country that most countries

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,640
don’t even recognize as a country.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,800
Why not?

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,780
Because...well, it’s complicated.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,060
And “complicated” is why so many people
get things about it wrong.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,970
Here are 10 common misconceptions people have
about Taiwan.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,970
Misconception #10

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,000
It’s officially called Taiwan.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,180
No.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,210
Most people *call* this place Taiwan.

16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,730
But its official name is the Republic of China.

17
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,190
That’s different from the People’s Republic
of China.

18
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,530
Taiwan is technically the name of a land mass,
not a country.

19
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,750
Taiwan is the main island,

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,710
this big one that’s shaped like a sweet
potato.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,850
But the Republic of China government actually
has domain

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,530
over an archipelago of 166 islands.

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,670
Most of them are really small and no one lives
there.

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,040
But for simplicity, most people still call
the country “Taiwan.”

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,479
And honestly, that’s less confusing than
calling it the Republic of China.

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,890
It’s a bit like calling The Netherlands
“Holland.”

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,520
It’s...good enough.

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,320
And that’s what I’m going to mostly use
in this episode for simplicity.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Personally, I think we should go back to calling
Taiwan

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
the Republic of Formosa.

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,119
I mean, look at this flag.

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,659
It’s so cool!

33
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,500
What’s that, Shelley?

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,560
It only lasted five months?

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,520
Fine.

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,710
Misconception #9

37
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,049
Taiwan wants to declare independence from
China.

38
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,479
Any way you measure it, Taiwan is a sovereign
state.

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,610
Taiwan has its own government, passports,

40
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,270
currency, trade agreements, and so on.

41
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,130
But the People’s Republic of China,

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,200
this one, claims Taiwan is just a province
of China--

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,650
even though that is objectively not true.

44
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,829
In reality, Taiwan is independent.

45
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,560
But the People’s Republic of China has said

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,409
it would invade Taiwan if it *declares* independence.

47
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,320
The solution?

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,420
The current Taiwan government’s position
is that

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,090
they already *are* an independent country,

50
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,150
so there’s no need to *declare independence.*

51
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,400
Problem solved.

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,450
Misconception #8

53
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,480
There is a One China Policy,

54
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,060
which most of the world, including the US
agrees with.

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,130
No.

56
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,480
There is no single One China Policy.

57
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,180
The common explanation for the One China Policy

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,180
is that both the Republic of China and the
People’s Republic of China

59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,550
claim to be the legitimate ruler of both Chinas--

60
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,110
but they just disagree about which of them
is that legitimate ruler.

61
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,160
This is sometimes referred to as the 1992
consensus.

62
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,550
But people also disagree about what the 1992
consensus is

63
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,989
or if it even exists in the first place.

64
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,849
Just like Pluto.

65
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,920
So what are the different One China policies?

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
The People’s Republic of China has what
it calls the One China Principle,

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,620
which is that there is only one legitimate
China,

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,989
and the People’s Republic of China is it.

69
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,580
And that Taiwan is a province of the PRC.

70
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,510
But their One China Principle doesn’t recognize
that Taiwan

71
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,540
or other countries might have a different
view.

72
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,010
Decades ago under the KMT Party,

73
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,530
Taiwan had a similar view,

74
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,620
except saying that *they* were the single
legitimate China.

75
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,900
But now it’s 2020.

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,280
And more and more people in Taiwan don’t
view themselves as Chinese.

77
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,580
They have their own identity as Taiwanese,

78
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,110
and they no longer have any illusions

79
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,470
that one day they’ll retake the mainland.

80
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,730
Sometimes you’ll see media reports

81
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,599
that mention America’s One China Policy.

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,290
And sometimes those media reports will say
that America

83
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,130
agrees with the PRC’s One China Policy.

84
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,410
These media reports are wrong.

85
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,020
The US does have its own One China Policy.

86
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,040
It comes from the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué,
which says, essentially,

87
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,049
that the US acknowledges that China and Taiwan

88
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,269
both view themselves as the legitimate China.

89
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,110
But the US’s policy doesn’t take sides

90
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,250
on which one is the legitimate China.

91
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,879
It also doesn’t explicitly state the sovereign
status of Taiwan.

92
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,940
Diplomacy: the art of making things so confusing

93
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,719
that everyone stops trying to figure them
out.

94
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,189
Misconception #7

95
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:23,509
Taiwan is a renegade province of China.

96
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,599
Or a “breakaway” province of China.

97
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,629
No, that’s pure communist propaganda.

98
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:32,020
At no point in history was the island of Taiwan

99
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,310
a province of the People’s Republic of China.

100
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,229
In fact, there were only two brief points
in history--

101
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,339
both less than 10 years long--

102
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:45,009
where Taiwan was actually ruled as a province
of China.

103
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,939
And those were during previous eras--

104
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:50,400
before the People’s Republic took over China.

105
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,870
During Taiwan’s history,

106
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,520
it has also been ruled independently,

107
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,419
as well as by the Dutch, Spanish, and Japanese.

108
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,889
Calling Taiwan a “renegade province”

109
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,629
or a “breakaway province” of China

110
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,879
is just buying into the propaganda.

111
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,029
Misconception #6

112
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:09,710
The PRC wants “re-unification.”

113
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,919
Well, they say they do.

114
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,279
But built into that phrase is more propaganda.

115
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,270
Taiwan can’t *re* unify with the People’s
Republic of China,

116
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,669
since as I mentioned,

117
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,960
it was never unified in the first place.

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,449
Chinese speaking people aren’t so easily
fooled.

119
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:26,589
So in Chinese,

120
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,339
the People’s Republic of China just calls
it “unification.”

121
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,759
Misconception #5

122
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,289
Taiwan is culturally Chinese.

123
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:38,360
In Taiwan, the most common language is Mandarin.

124
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,629
But it’s not strictly Chinese culture.

125
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,819
During most of the last millennium,

126
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,160
the island of Taiwan was ruled by various
aboriginal people,

127
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,539
who spoke their own languages and had their
own customs.

128
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,430
In the mid-1600s,

129
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,069
Taiwan was occupied by the Dutch and the Spanish.

130
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,539
And from 1895 through 1945, it was ruled by
Japan.

131
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,619
Sure, Taiwan had Chinese immigrants,

132
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,839
but it was not mainly a Chinese place.

133
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,240
After World War II,

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
the winners--i.e.

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,360
America--

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,809
made Japan leave Taiwan.

137
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,830
The US gave the island to their ally,

138
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,529
the Republic of China government,

139
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,649
which at the time ruled all of China.

140
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,189
But that rule only lasted a few more years.

141
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,889
The communists started a civil war, and won.

142
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,849
In 1949, the Republic of China government
fled to the island of Taiwan,

143
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:31,779
where they re-established their government
along with military rule,

144
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,810
and enforced the Mandarin language and Chinese
culture.

145
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,810
Misconception #4

146
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,379
Taiwan’s national day celebrates the founding
of their country.

147
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,379
No.

148
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,229
Taiwan’s national day is not an independence
day.

149
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,369
It actually celebrates October 10, 1911--

150
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:48,969
the start of the Wuchang uprising

151
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,129
that eventually overthrew the Qing Dynasty.

152
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,029
That uprising eventually led to the founding
of the Republic of China.

153
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,830
It can be confusing, because the People’s
Republic of China

154
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,419
has their own national day.

155
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,770
And theirs does celebrate their founding.

156
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,969
Misconception #3

157
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,869
Most people in Taiwan want unification with
mainland China.

158
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:12,569
No, that’s pure communist propaganda.

159
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,509
But the opposite isn’t quite true either.

160
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,020
There’s a wide variety of views.

161
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,409
“Unification” is a spectrum.

162
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,419
After seeing what happened in Hong Kong,

163
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,509
most people in Taiwan don’t want unification
under that system,

164
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,719
although there’s a minority of stupid people

165
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,189
who somehow think it wouldn’t be so bad.

166
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,669
But some people in Taiwan would be happy to
unify,

167
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,229
*if* China becomes a democracy.

168
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,249
Especially if the Chinese Communist Party
is completely gone first.

169
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,669
And then there are some people in Taiwan

170
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,759
who want complete independence,

171
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,090
no matter what.

172
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,139
But it seems that most people in Taiwan--

173
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,349
including both major political parties--

174
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:52,399
want to keep the status quo of not being unified,

175
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,369
and waiting to see what happens.

176
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,259
The political parties mainly disagree over

177
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,129
how much to engage with China economically,

178
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:03,099
but both want to maintain Taiwan’s sovereignty.

179
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,300
Misconception #2

180
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,080
Political interference in the election was
not effective

181
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,169
because Tsai Ing-wen won the election.

182
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:11,169
No.

183
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,119
Tsai *did* win the election on January 11.

184
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,330
If you saw our previous video,

185
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,379
you know that Hong Kong was a big factor in
Tsai’s win.

186
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,050
As well as her campaign’s anime adventure
game called

187
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,050
“What?!

188
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,449
I, a Taiwanese third-year high schooler from
Class 2,

189
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,139
suddenly fell into a different world and met
the president?!”

190
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,949
I’m never going to get tired of saying that.

191
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,599
But the Chinese Communist Party had tried
really,

192
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,469
really hard to stop Tsai from winning.

193
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,519
They interfered with the elections in a variety
of ways,

194
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,159
including supporting her opponents’ campaigns,

195
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,230
spreading fake news on social media,

196
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,600
and even buying up Taiwanese media,

197
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,220
and having them run anti-Tsai propaganda.

198
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,330
That actually influenced a lot of people.

199
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,610
It just wasn’t enough to stop Tsai from
being elected.

200
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,620
And the Communist Party’s political interference

201
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,079
is not going away, either.

202
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,769
And Misconception #1

203
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,040
The US president can’t meet with Taiwan’s
president

204
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,370
because we don’t have formal diplomatic
ties.

205
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:15,640
The last time a sitting US president visited
Taiwan was 1960.

206
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,199
After the US switched diplomatic alliances
to China in 1979,

207
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,949
US presidents have avoided

208
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,980
all direct communication with Taiwan’s presidents,

209
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,930
so as to not anger the Chinese regime.

210
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,290
Except that one phone call 3 years ago.

211
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,930
But you know, Trump will do Trump.

212
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,720
But there’s no law actually stopping the
US and Taiwan presidents

213
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
from having phone chats, or even a face-to-face
meeting.

214
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,220
All it takes is a Taiwan president who has
a strong mandate from the people.

215
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,310
...and a US president who isn’t afraid of
pissing off communist China.

216
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,860
I mean, the US doesn’t have official diplomatic
relations with North Korea,

217
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,090
but that didn’t stop *this* meeting from
happening.

218
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,330
Or this meeting.

219
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,649
Or this meeting.

220
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,649
So there’s no reason Trump can’t meet
with

221
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,360
a democratically elected leader and ally.

222
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,620
I guess we’ll have to wait and see what
happens.

223
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
So what do you think?
