00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,069
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,960
China just landed a military plane

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,770
on one of those islands it created in the
South China Sea.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,090
You know, the islands that are for peaceful
purposes only.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,540
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,330
Ah, the South China Sea:

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,750
what my favorite Chinese state-run media Global
Times calls

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,660
“a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation.”

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,570
Which is exactly why China landed a military
aircraft on Fiery Cross Reef on Monday

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,770
as shown here on Chinese state-run television.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,890
Fiery Cross Reef is one of those disputed
islands China has been building up in the

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,200
South China Sea.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,000
It’s also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,750
But China is the one who’s built a 1.8-mile
long runway there

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,399
long enough to land military planes.

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,510
But don’t worry, Monday’s landing was
for a rescue mission

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,540
to airlift three sick civilians to a hospital.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,160
That’s according to Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Lu Kang.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,449
Sorry, this Lu Kang.

20
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,579
He told reporters on Monday that:

21
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:12,259
“On Chinese territory, something like this
is not out of the ordinary.”

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,940
Right. It is totally normal to land a military
plane on Chinese territory.

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,600
But I think the rest of the world’s concern
is that this island is maybe not Chinese territory.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,899
It’s just being occupied by Chinese facilities,

25
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:30,159
including a runway long enough to land military
planes.

26
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,209
But if you think that China landing a military
plane on a disputed island,

27
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:37,130
then broadcasting it prominently on state-run
television,

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,779
is a signal that China intends to aggressively
fight for its territorial claims there,

29
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,159
you’d be wrong.

30
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,509
The real threat to peace and stability is
America—and the Philippines.

31
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,329
They just completed two weeks of annual joint
military exercises.

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,940
“These activities from the Philippines and
America

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,539
are poisoning regional and inter-country relations,

34
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,770
and are exacerbating regional conflicts

35
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,079
and are increasing tensions in the region,

36
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,699
damaging the peace and stability of the South
China Sea.”

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,740
Yes, the ones damaging peace and stability

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,550
are the countries that are not building permanent
military facilities there.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,300
Alright Lu Kang, Finish Him!

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,000
“This also exactly proves who was the real
promoter of the militarization of the South China Sea."

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,440
Because while the Philippines calls for international
court arbitration over the disputed territory,

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,480
China just stations its military there.

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,220
With tensions so high in the region,

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,510
it’s unclear what’s going to happen.

45
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,630
But one thing’s for sure:

46
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,450
China’s not going to win a Flawless Victory.

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,780
