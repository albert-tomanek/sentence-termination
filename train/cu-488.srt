00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,840
On this episode of China Uncensored, Top 5
Hilariously Bad Chinese Theme Parks

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,590
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,140
Winter's icy grip is almost at our throats,
which is why I'm already planning my summer

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,660
vacation to the happiest place on earth: China.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,530
But, gosh darn it, I'm having a hard time
deciding between these five fun-filled theme

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,530
parks!

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,020
Won't you help me decide?

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,810
Number 5
Party at the Communist Party Theme Park!

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,040
You know nothing spells a good time quite
like learning core Socialist values, and what

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,290
socialism with Chinese characteristics looks
like!

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,320
And it looks like this.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,010
park-
Aren't' they cute?

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,480
I mean, more so than the actual Red Guards.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,370
This one just opened in Wuhan at the end of
September.

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,960
Visitors get the "red benefit," as state-run
Xinhua calls, it by learning about 29 "excellent

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,230
party figures."

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:09,430
I mean, I know the only reason people go to
Disney World is for the Hall of Presidents,

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,210
so why not have a park that does away with
all those superfluous rides, and focuses just

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,700
on historical figures?!

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,020
Just you know, with bronze plaques and no
animatronics.

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,620
There's even a square where students and youths
can swear their allegiance to the Party.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,390
It's way better than that other square students
used to visit.

23
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,810
And who would want to miss the tribute to
the 2008 Beijing Olympics?

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,990
But who's the gold medal winner?!

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,840
Why you are of course.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,760
Number 4
No Monkeying Around at this Guerrilla Warfare

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Theme Park

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,890
You know I've always felt I was born into
the wrong times.

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,970
Haven't you ever wished you could run around
in the filth and mud of the trenches of World

30
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,970
War 2?

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,190
I mean the War of Resistance Against Japanese
Aggression?

32
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,299
Well now you can!

33
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,430
But hold on Chris, do I get to shoot at the
Japanese devils?

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,090
Of course you do!

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,759
And then you can enjoy one of the thrilling
performances of people waving red flags.

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,569
Historically speaking I don't believe that
was the preferred strategy for trench warfare,

37
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,569
though.

38
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,430
Number 3
World of Intellectual Property Violations

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,430
Land

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,239
Technically, it's called "World of Joyland"
But is it a world?

41
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,470
Or is it a land?

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,010
Scientists may never know the answer, but
there's one thing I'm pretty sure of: It looks

43
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,790
suspiciously like World of Warcraft.

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,650
You can go on the Splash of Monster Blood
log ride, or head over to the Universe of

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,249
Starship, not at all to be confused with derivative
Western properties like Starcraft.

46
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:46,540
And these ride descriptions really do have
something you can't get anywhere else.

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,069
I just hope "Journey of Dangers" doesn't describe
the safety standards.

48
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,269
Number 2 The Lyin' King

49
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,870
I had to spell that one out.

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,290
Ah, here we go!

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,140
The happiest place on…

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,989
Wait a minute, something doesn't look right
here.

53
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:11,150
Hey, this isn't a Chinese Disneyland…this
is a…Chinese Disneyland!

54
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,239
It's called the Beijing Shijingshan Amusement
Park.

55
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,450
They even have a fake Epcot Center, and more
world of Warcraft stuff.

56
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,089
Now please don't confuse this with Wonderland,
the other Disneyland knock off that was eventually

57
00:03:25,089 --> 00:03:26,620
closed down.

58
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:36,059
This is a whole new world, with unbelievable
sites, like this Wild West exhibit, or crushed

59
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,059
characters.

60
00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:42,169
And you know it's high quality because their
official slogan is "Disney is too far to go,

61
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,810
please come to Shijingshan!"

62
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,169
And finally, Number 1!

63
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,980
Let's just saying you'll be dying to go to
this one.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh gosh no, not like that!

65
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,029
Like this.

66
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:58,390
Haven't you always wondered what it would
be like to be cremated?

67
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,670
Well now you can find out and live to tell
the tale!

68
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,080
This is 'the Cremator' at the Window to the
World amusement park.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,579
And what could be more amusing than crawling
into a fake coffin, that takes you down a

70
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:15,729
conveyor belt, into a room that blasts you
with hot air and light, simulating flames?

71
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:21,350
Of course, if pretending you're dying isn't
your idea of a good time, you can always check

72
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,790
out the park's 130 models of world famous
landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower and Coliseum,

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,760
the Louvre and Statue of David, and Mt. Rushmore,
the Capitol, and the Washington Monument.

74
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,390
So which theme park do you think I should
visit on my next summer vacation to China?
