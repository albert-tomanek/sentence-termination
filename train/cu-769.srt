1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,729
Cambodia signs a secret deal with China

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,259
It gives China’s navy exclusive rights to
a naval base

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,870
That could help the Chinese military control

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,080
a critical shipping lane in Southeast Asia.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,880
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,250
China has signed a secret deal for exclusive
rights

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,120
to use part of a Cambodian naval base called
Ream.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
Cambodia is here.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,610
Ream is here.

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,310
Now if the Chinese Communist Party’s military,

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,750
the People’s Liberation Army,

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,809
was really building a navy base in Cambodia—

14
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,109
that would be a big deal.

15
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,949
But don’t worry!

16
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:40,079
Because last November,

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen totally
denied it!

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,260
Of course, it would be super embarrassing
if, say,

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,569
foreign media found out about it.

20
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:52,429
Wait... technically, it’s not a *Chinese*
military base.

21
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:59,379
The pact simply gives China *exclusive rights*
to part of a *Cambodian* naval base.

22
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:00,569
Still embarrassing, though.

23
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:03,690
That’s why Cambodia’s prime minister is
doubling down,

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,570
and denying that report,

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,049
calling it “the worst fake news against
Cambodia.”

26
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,020
Which is yet another lie, because the worst
fake news against Cambodia

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,680
is that the prime minister actually “won”
the last election.

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,660
It’s so much easier to win after you’ve
thrown out all of your opposition.

29
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,009
Also, the naval base thing happens to be true.

30
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,840
Unlike free and fair elections in Cambodia.

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,329
So what’s the big deal about a Chinese navy
presence in Cambodia?

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,950
Well, as I mentioned, that navy base is here.

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,090
It’s on the Gulf of Thailand.

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,649
And that means easy access to the Strait of
Malacca.

35
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,679
And that’s the most important shipping lane

36
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,890
between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,461
The Pentagon believes it's part of Chinese
regime’s plan

38
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:52,179
to boost its ability to project military power
around the globe.

39
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,829
And the US is “‘concerned that any steps
by the Cambodian government

40
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,939
to invite a foreign military presence in Cambodia’

41
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,749
would disturb regional peace and stability.”

42
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,899
Although I’m sure if that “foreign military
presence” were the US,

43
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,430
the US might reconsider its concerns.

44
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,500
Not that that the Chinese military being there
is really equivalent.

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,610
Especially considering that the Chinese military
is run by the Communist Party,

46
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,480
which supported the previous Cambodian Khmer
Rouge regime—

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,390
even as it murdered one quarter of Cambodia’s
population in the 1970s.

48
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,050
Anyway, the base would be Beijing's first
dedicated facility

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,220
on the Southeast Asian mainland for naval
staging.

50
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,940
In the navy!

51
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,380
You can sail the seven seas...

52
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,110
In the navy!

53
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,320
That is not naval staging.

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,150
That is what happens when our graphics guy
spends too much time on YouTube.

55
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,390
“Naval staging” is where you put navy
units,

56
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,520
aircraft and warships some place where they
can be prepared

57
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,680
for attacking or invading people.

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,780
A former U.S. State Department official says
having a naval base in Cambodia

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,110
gives the People’s Liberation Army Navy
a leg up in all of Southeast Asia.

60
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,460
Because “You have all of a sudden mainland
Southeast Asia

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,740
potentially sitting behind a defensive Chinese
military perimeter.”

62
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,300
And another U.S. official told the Wall Street
Journal

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,130
that a Chinese presence at Ream would “greatly
complicate”

64
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,280
the ability of the U.S. to help Taiwan if
Beijing decides to attack.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,420
The Chinese Communist Party opened its first
official military outpost overseas

66
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,680
in the African nation of Djibouti just two
years ago.

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,740
That made Djibouti “the linchpin in China’s
belt and road plan."

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,971
The Belt and Road is the Chinese Communist
Party’s plan

69
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:39,340
to build a sprawling network of land and sea
links throughout Asia,

70
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,910
the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

71
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,580
For trade.

72
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,640
And as a way for the Party to project power
and influence across the world.

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,630
The Chinese navy’s exclusive use of the
naval base in Ream,

74
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,290
Cambodia is part of what the Pentagon sees
as the Chinese regime’s quest

75
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,270
for a global network of military and dual-use
sites.

76
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,860
Djibouti was the blueprint for "mixing commercial
and military interests."

77
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,890
And it just so happens that the Chinese navy

78
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,730
is also allegedly building a navy base in
Pakistan,

79
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,580
although they deny it.

80
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,620
Where have I heard that before?

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,570
Chinese state-backed companies also lease
deep water ports

82
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,390
in Sri Lanka and Myanmar-slash-Burma,

83
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,570
but the Chinese regime also denies those will
ever be naval bases.

84
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,730
Well, as an Australian intelligence official
said,

85
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,480
“We have some concern that China is using
the same playbook [in Cambodia they]

86
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,440
used in the South China Sea,

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,700
creating facts on the ground until such time
that it is too late for anyone to object.”

88
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,250
Like when the Chinese regime built those fake
islands,

89
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,550
but then denied they would be used for the
military.

90
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,870
Then they surprised everyone with landing
strips

91
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,670
missile batteries

92
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,590
and long-range nuclear bombers.

93
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,340
I’m sure those are just civilian landing
strips,

94
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,520
civilian missile batteries,

95
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,860
and civilian long-range nuclear bombers.

96
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,300
And if you think the naval base is Ream is
a problem,

97
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,570
it might be only the beginning.

98
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,720
The U.S. and its allies are also lobbying
Cambodia not to let China’s military

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,190
use a new airport being built just 40 miles
away.

100
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,430
An airport being built by a Chinese company
on a 99-year lease.

101
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,370
Don’t worry, though—the company denies
it’ll be used by China’s military.

102
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,110
But if the rest of the world believes that,

103
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,430
after all the denials about the Cambodian
naval base,

104
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,180
then we’re the ones who are really in denial.

105
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,820
So what do you think about the Chinese regime
establishing

106
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,680
its first military outpost in Southeast Asia?

107
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,530
Leave your comments below.

108
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,530
And before we go,

109
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,270
I’ll answer a question from one of our supporters
on Patreon:

110
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,389
Robert W Eischen asks:

111
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,270
“Has China become a fascist and imperialistic
Nation?”

112
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,670
Whaaat, that’s crazy!

113
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,370
If you accuse the Chinese Communist Party

114
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,340
of being fascist and imperialistic,

115
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,640
they’ll totally deny it.

116
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,110
Thanks for your question, Robert.

117
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,800
