1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,729
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:03,400
the world’s biggest company

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,059
tries to bully the world’s most popular
comedy show...

4
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:10,040
about China...

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
based in New York...

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,200
starring Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,820
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,120
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,740
I have a big announcement to make today.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,720
The good news is that thanks largely

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,000
to the financial support of our viewers,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,550
who contribute via Patreon...

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,440
...and thanks to YouTube

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,030
for constantly demonitizing our videos—

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,160
we’re taking China Uncensored to a new platform.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,470
Television!

17
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,129
Digital television.

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,240
As of today,

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,480
you can download the free China Uncensored app

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,199
for Roku, Amazon Fire TV,

21
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,199
and Apple TV.

22
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,789
You do need the newest versions of each, though,

23
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,149
from mid-2016 or later—

24
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,420
because only the new ones let you download
apps.

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,199
You can search for China Uncensored,

26
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,840
or the technical name of the app, “China
Unsnsrd”

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,680
because you can only have up to 13 characters.

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,100
Anyway, this means you can sit on your couch

29
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,310
with a cup of tea,

30
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,460
and stream my face

31
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,440
directly through your television.

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,020
And even though that’s weird for me personally,

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,450
it’s good for the show.

34
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,060
The app is free for you,

35
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,780
and supported by ads that support us.

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,060
And since it’s not YouTube,

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,460
we’ll get better ads and our videos won’t
be demonitized

38
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,980
just because I talk about North Korea or whatever.

39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Don’t worry,

40
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,780
we’ll also keep putting videos on YouTube
too.

41
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,500
But I also have some bad news.

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,790
Remember how I said we’re on Apple TV?

43
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,280
Well, Apple did approve our app,

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,720
but then they sent us this notice:

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,310
It basically says, our app has been removed

46
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,430
from the China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan App
Stores.

47
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,950
I mean, I’m not really that surprised

48
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,030
Apple blocked us from mainland China.

49
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,650
After all, I do undermine China’s social
stability

50
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,410
every time I tell the truth.

51
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,410
And I’m sure Apple doesn’t want

52
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,780
to get in trouble in China,

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,130
since China is now the world’s largest market

54
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,060
for iPhones.

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,390
But blocking us from Hong Kong and Taiwan?

56
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,750
C’mon!

57
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,420
Is Apple so scared of the Chinese Communist
Party

58
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,450
that they’ve blocked us there too,

59
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,260
just in case?

60
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,780
Or did they somehow not realize

61
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,480
that Hong Kong and Taiwan

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,050
are independent regions?

63
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,880
I mean, Apple is the biggest company in the
world.

64
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,730
Don’t they have lawyers that could tell
them

65
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,310
that China Uncensored is legal in Hong Kong
and Taiwan?

66
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,230
I’ve definitely interviewed government officials
in both regions

67
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,490
and I distinctly recall not getting arrested
for it.

68
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,670
So I’ve retained my own public interest
lawyer.

69
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,670
And yesterday morning,

70
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,890
I express mailed a letter to Apple’s CEO
Tim Cook.

71
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,560
But I think Apple is going to need a bit more
of a push.

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
And they’re where you come in,

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,030
my 50-Cent Army!

74
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,900
Together, let’s put pressure Apple to stop
censoring

75
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,400
China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,950
Go to my website—

77
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,069
which I guess I’m also officially launching
today.

78
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,660
The link is below.

79
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,670
And sign this petition.

80
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,330
Every signature counts.

81
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,800
Be sure to share it with your friends, too.

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,110
And if you live in Hong Kong or Taiwan,

83
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,610
there’s one more thing you can do.

84
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,950
At the bottom of that petition website,

85
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,100
you can download and print out a paper petition,

86
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,470
and take it around in your city to collect
signatures.

87
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,810
And then email me a good-quality scan of each
page

88
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,860
to ChinaUncensored@gmail.com.

89
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,819
Don’t let the world’s biggest company

90
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,290
bully China Uncensored.

91
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,870
Click the link below and sign the petition.

92
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,410
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell,

93
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,600
and you are the best viewers in the world.
