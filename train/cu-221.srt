1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,620
when North Korea is your good neighbor,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,100
you know it’s a bad neighborhood.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,660
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,349
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,070
North Korea has sent a message to China!

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,730
Won’t you be my neighbor?

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,470
Things have gotten a little tense lately on
the Korean peninsula.

9
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,759
But North Korea wants to remind China

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:29,530
that it’s always been China’s good neighbor.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,699
So is it really a problem if every so often

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:37,010
it stops by to ask for a cup of Uranium-235?

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,899
China and North Korea have had a bit of

14
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,120
an on-again-off-again relationship.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,399
Back In the 90s, they were close.

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,030
A little too close.

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,469
And according to one expert,

18
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,530
that decrepit wart-frog even gave

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,180
nuclear materials and technology to North
Korea—

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,770
which is partially how we got into our current
mess in the first place.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,480
And so North Korea wants to join the nuclear
family,

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,120
what’s the big deal?

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,609
But recently,

24
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,270
China has chosen to side with the American
imperialists,

25
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,540
condemning North Korea’s nuclear tests,

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,260
in what is a total jerk move.

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,260
And of course,

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,690
the North Korean regime has reacted to this

29
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,230
in an incredibly calm and restrained manner.

30
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,940
By accusing China of being a total backstabber.

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,350
A recent scathing commentary

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,660
in North Korean state-run media

33
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,990
reminded China that back in 1964,

34
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,300
when China conducted its first nuclear test,

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,740
and all the countries in the world denounced
China,

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,580
North Korea had China’s back.

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,640
They wrote that, quote,

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,650
“It was only the DPRK,

39
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,810
the good neighbor,

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,220
which actively supported it and encouraged
it

41
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,440
through government statements.”

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,860
And North Korea is trying to wreck the big
party

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,660
China is throwing this month—

44
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,170
the National People’s Congress.

45
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,780
It’s a big once every five year meeting

46
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,580
of the Chinese Communist Party,

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,630
and every detail is carefully scripted,

48
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,910
because it has to be perfect.

49
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,280
North Korea is questioning

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,680
whether the Chinese Communist Party

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,810
“Can be entitled to enter the coming Party
Conference hall

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,970
only when they register the dirty reptile
records

53
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,360
of betraying the peoples of the two countries.”

54
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Reptile records?

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,830
I think North Korea is confused.

56
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,750
The CCP leaders aren’t Reptilians.

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,730
They’re Amphibians!

58
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,730
But anyway,

59
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,550
after some pretty intense pressure from the
United Stated,

60
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,100
China has agreed to put in place

61
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,390
yet another round of UN sanctions

62
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,030
in response to North Korea’s nuclear test
last month.

63
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,260
Overall, these sanctions have “now banned

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,160
90 percent of the North’s $2.7 billion

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,180
of publicly reported exports.”

66
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,500
As for North Korea’s not publically reported
exports,

67
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,600
well…there’s always forcing diplomats
to sell meth.

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,100
That’s a real thing that’s been going
on for years.

69
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
But anyway,

70
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,210
those UN sanctions also ban all joint business
ventures

71
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,290
with North Korea and the use of North Korean
workers.

72
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,270
This mostly affects China,

73
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,440
as one of the only countries

74
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,140
with any kind of meaningful relationship with
the Kim regime.

75
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,710
Thousands of mostly female North Korean workers
in China

76
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,490
have been forced to leave.

77
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,620
Sorry, no more awkward dancing

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,840
with your mediocre North Korean food.

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
These overseas workers

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,700
were one of the last lifelines to North Korea.

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,600
About 100,000 North Koreans work overseas,

82
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,700
including at restaurants.

83
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,290
They’re essentially slaves,

84
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,710
because they have to send their salaries

85
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,590
to the North Korean regime.

86
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,580
About half a billion dollars a year worth.

87
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,100
But now, China has taken away

88
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,690
North Korea’s slave money.

89
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,690
And that’s why North Korea

90
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,580
says China is a bad neighbor.

91
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,600
But the response from China has been,

92
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
whoa whoa whoa,

93
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,319
you’re calling us a bad neighbor?

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,240
We’re the good neighbor.

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,220
You guys wouldn’t even exist today

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,900
if we hadn’t saved your butts during the
Korean War.

97
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,090
And if we didn’t send food to your starving
citizens

98
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,160
during that famine in the 90s,

99
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
you wouldn’t have anyone left

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,810
to force into slave labor.

101
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,349
Plus, we’ve been the ones trying to talk
down Donald Trump

102
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,790
from launching nukes at you guys.

103
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,600
Just listen to our foreign ministry!

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,950
“We have always believed that military means

105
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,579
should not be an option to resolve the nuclear
issue

106
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,900
on the peninsula,

107
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,510
because arms cannot resolve the differences.”

108
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,460
Unless those arms are giving bear hugs!

109
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,910
Come here, who’s the good neighbor?

110
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,620
But really,

111
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,230
North Korea’s kind of the bad neighbor here.

112
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,389
I mean, what kind of neighbor tests nuclear
weapons

113
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,669
near your property line

114
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,270
without even discussing it with you first?

115
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,330
Plus, North Korean state-run media

116
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,390
just has not been friendly.

117
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,870
But the ups and downs between China and North
Korea

118
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,820
actually go back decades,

119
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,710
to the founder of North Korea’s communist
regime.

120
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,310
Kim Il-sung grew up in northeast China

121
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,210
and fought alongside the Chinese communists

122
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,020
against the Japanese.

123
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,900
But eventually the Chinese Communists

124
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,000
turned on the Korean Communists in a racist
purge

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,210
and tortured and killed hundreds of them.

126
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,460
Kim was lucky to survive.

127
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,320
Mao Zedong later called Kim Il-sung

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,710
“a number-one pain in the butt.”

129
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,460
And Mao had a big butt.

130
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,570
And in 1980,

131
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,030
when Kim Il-sung named his son

132
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,080
Kim Jong-Il to be his successor,

133
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,020
“China openly denounced hereditary succession

134
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,700
as a vestige of feudalism.”

135
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,990
Actually, it was mainly the Amphibian Jiang
Zemin

136
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,120
who wanted good relations.

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,699
So even though China provides 90% of North
Korean trade,

138
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,170
and was most likely responsible

139
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,010
for giving the technology it needed

140
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,360
to start its nuclear program,

141
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,520
the relationship between the two

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,180
has not always been neighborly.

143
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
What do you think?

144
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,340

to know your alive.

150
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,320

I’m of course talking to Kim Jong-un.

158
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,370
