1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,990
5 countries that have faced the wrath

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,980
of the Chinese Communist Party.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,160
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,990
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,000
You don’t want to get on China’s bad side.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,300
That’s the message to nations that dare

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,779
to cross the Chinese Communist Party’s red
lines.

9
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,279
Sometimes it’s over major policy stuff,

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,480
like challenging their territorial claims

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,800
in the South China Sea.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,569
Other times it seems trivial,

13
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:32,910
like when Chinese tourists got

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,180
kicked out of a hotel for misbehaving.

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,280
“This is killing.

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
This is killing.”

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,980
But regardless of whether the problem is big
or small,

18
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,940
the Chinese Communist Party wants to make
sure

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,800
other countries feel the pain.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,340
That way they’ll be less likely

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,310
to stand up against the Party in the future.

22
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,530
Here are 5 countries that have paid the price

23
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,900
for crossing the Chinese regime.

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,550
Number 5

25
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,000
Norway.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,120
A country in northern Europe famous for vikings,

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,750
the midnight sun, and trolls.

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,570
And while I’ve always been a big fan of
Norwegian trolls,

29
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,940
no one likes to get trolled.

30
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,640
But that’s what happened in 2010,

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,150
after the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,400
the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese writer

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,960
and dissident Liu Xiaobo.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,640
Then Norway experienced what it’s like to
get

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,380
trolled by the Chinese Communist Party.

36
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,740
China’s foreign ministry fumed about the
award,

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,500
and said that giving Liu the prize

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,760
“runs completely counter to the principle
of the prize

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,830
and is also a blasphemy to the peace prize.”

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,030
And to show Norway that nothing quite rankles
the CCP

41
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,780
like the suggestion that people should have
a say

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,860
about who gets to run China,

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,490
they pretty much froze diplomatic ties for
six years.

44
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,330
And even worse, they cancelled

45
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,760
a concert by a Norwegian Eurovision winner.

46
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,490
Look, I don’t understand Eurovision, but
I respect it.

47
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,110
Another one of the casualties?

48
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,350
Norway’s second biggest export after oil
and gas—fish.

49
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,200
Norway used to be the biggest exporter of
salmon to China.

50
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,819
But after Liu got the Nobel prize,

51
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,800
China took its revenge and cut salmon imports
by over 60%.

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
All of this is even more ridiculous

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,860
because the Nobel Prize Committee is completely
separate

54
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,110
from the Norwegian government.

55
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,970
So it’s not like the government had any
control

56
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,160
over who gets the Nobel Peace Prize.

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,970
That seems to be something that the Chinese
authorities

58
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,190
couldn’t quite grasp though,

59
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,650
as they apparently offered to unfreeze diplomatic
ties

60
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,630
if the Norwegian government promised that
the Nobel Peace Prize

61
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,370
would never go to a Chinese dissident ever
again.

62
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,740
But then Liu Xiaobo died of liver cancer last
year

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
while still in Chinese custody.

64
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,630
And just a few months later,

65
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,590
China moved to restore relations with Norway.

66
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,709
The Norwegian prime minister

67
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,440
visited the e-commerce giant Alibaba,

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,970
and soon after a seafood trade agreement

69
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:11,280
was signed to export $1.5 billion worth of
salmon to China by 2025.

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,800
Which led to uncomfortable headlines like

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,180
“Norway wants China to forget about the
human rights thing

72
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,170
and eat salmon instead”

73
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,170
Number 4

74
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,660
South Korea

75
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,319
Back in 2016, South Korea deployed an American-made

76
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,920
anti-missile defense system known as THAAD.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,890
It’s officially designed to intercept missiles
from North Korea,

78
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,490
but it could also stop missiles from, really,

79
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,099
any aggressive communist neighbor.

80
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:42,350
And this was not lost on Chinese leaders,

81
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,300
who hated THAAD from the get-go.

82
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,220
Within a month of deployment,

83
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,540
tour groups from China to South Korea dropped
to nearly zero,

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,230
as this graph shows.

85
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,160
And individual tourism from China fell by
about half.

86
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,180
Cuts to tourism cost South Korea more than
15 billion dollars

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,330
and four hundred thousand jobs.

88
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,620
But to make things weirder,

89
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,720
China also took out its anger over the missile
defense system

90
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,709
on Korean pop culture.

91
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,239
I guess once the Chinese Communist Party decided

92
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,269
to target Eurovision, K-Pop is fair game.

93
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,790
Korean pop and drama stars started having

94
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,160
their appearances in China cancelled.

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,110
And remember K-pop star Psy and his video
Gangnam Style,

96
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,710
which got so many views it ‘broke’

97
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:39,199
YouTube’s view limit of 2,147,483,647?

98
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,729
Well China decided it wasn’t gonna help
bring Psy’s view count

99
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:47,449
any closer to YouTube’s new limit of 9.22
quintillion

100
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,930
and banned his music videos from streaming
into China.

101
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,940
It wasn’t until last year,

102
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,490
when the new Korean president Moon Jae-in

103
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,630
took a softer line on THAAD that we saw reports

104
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,970
about Psy’s sudden return to China’s charts,

105
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,639
which was touted as “the surest sign yet

106
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,040
of a thaw between Seoul and Beijing”

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,960
Oh, and make sure you share this China Uncensored
video…

108
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,520
9.22 quintillion views, here we come!

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,650
Number 3

110
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,650
The Philippines

111
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,250
Back in 2012, when Chinese and Filipino ships

112
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,020
first clashed over disputed waters in the
South China Sea,

113
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,910
Chinese authorities retaliated with the fury

114
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,180
of what’s been called the China-Philippine
Banana War.

115
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,000
First the Chinese regime drastically

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,880
reduced banana imports from the Philippines,

117
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,639
claiming they were infested by pests.

118
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,000
Later they put the squeeze on other fruits,

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,160
including papayas, mangoes, coconuts, and
pineapples.

120
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,960
I guess Chinese authorities don’t like Pina
Coladas,

121
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,120
or getting caught in the rain.

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,930
Especially if it’s Filipino rain.

123
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,789
Chinese authorities issued travel warnings

124
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,630
to discourage Chinese tourists from visiting
the Philippines.

125
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,680
And it had a huge impact in some parts of
the country.

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,810
But after Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte

127
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,960
decided to get all buddy-buddy with Chinese
leader Xi Jinping...

128
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,100
...the tourism floodgates have opened again.

129
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,130
And don’t worry, the Chinese regime lifted

130
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,070
the import ban on Philippine bananas, too.

131
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,340
Duterte has achieved this partly by backing
down

132
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,700
over claims in the South China Sea,

133
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,440
and making *hilarious* jokes like,

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,860
the Philippines ought to just be a province
of China.

135
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Ha.

136
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Ha.

137
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,960
And presto!

138
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,060
Within a few months,

139
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,789
the number of Chinese tourists grew by

140
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,830
40 percent and China announced plans

141
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,300
to increase imports of mangoes, coconut and
dragonfruit.

142
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,940
But the Philippines isn’t the only country

143
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,710
with competing claims in the South China Sea.

144
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,560
For example, there’s Vietnam, Malaysia,
Taiwan, and Brunei.

145
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,440
There’s an old Chinese saying called

146
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,970
"kill the chicken to scare the monkeys",

147
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,530
which refers to making an example out of someone

148
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,860
in order to scare monkeys.

149
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,490
And with the Philippines,

150
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,090
China is sending a message...

151
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,310
if you don’t monkey around, we’ll buy
your bananas.

152
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,759
Number 2

153
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,860
Sweden

154
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,270
When a Swedish hotel refused to let a Chinese
family

155
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,020
spend the night in the lobby for free and
called the police,

156
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,610
the Chinese regime called bloody murder.

157
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,789
“This is killing.

158
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,980
This is killing.”

159
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,280
That was actually Mr. Zeng, the son,

160
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,410
accusing Swedish police,

161
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,080
who appear to gingerly place him on the sidewalk
outside the hotel,

162
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,800
of trying to murder his parents.

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,210
A passerby filmed the scene and told Sweden’s
biggest newspaper

164
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,110
that the police tried to calm the situation

165
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,160
while the Chinese family just ”shouted and
screamed”

166
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,440
and the son basically ”threw himself flat
on the ground.”

167
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,849
But the family complained to the Chinese ambassador,

168
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,160
who seemed pretty willing to elevate this

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,039
into a major diplomatic incident between Sweden
and China.

170
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,419
Ambassador Gui Congyou complained to Swedish
newspapers

171
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,210
that Chinese citizens were treated brutally

172
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,750
by a country that supposedly cares about human
rights.

173
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,930
“We find it shocking and hard to understand

174
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,610
that the three Chinese tourists

175
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,889
were treated in such a brutal manner

176
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,770
in a country that always talks about

177
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,970
human rights and justice.”

178
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,199
Chinese state-run media repeated the same
message

179
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,330
suggesting that Sweden was a human rights
hypocrite.

180
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,081
Now if you think the Chinese authorities

181
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:33,689
and state media are making a big deal about
nothing,

182
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:36,560
there’s just one more piece of the puzzle.

183
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,659
That’s right, the Dalai Lama visited Sweden

184
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,540
just one week before the Zeng family got kicked
out of their hotel.

185
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,910
Maybe the Chinese regime decided to channel

186
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,540
their usual outrage about the Dalai Lama

187
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,619
into outrage about these mistreated Chinese
tourists.

188
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:56,589
This whole story blew up in China where the
search term

189
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,779
“Chinese tourists mistreated by Swedish
police”

190
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,360
received more than 130 million views on Weibo.

191
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,939
But not everybody was sympathetic to the tourists.

192
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,029
In fact, some found them,

193
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,420
and the reaction from the Chinese authorities...embarrassing.

194
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,290
But just as the controversy was dying down,

195
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,509
a Swedish satire showed released this helpful

196
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,379
how-to video for Chinese tourists.

197
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:27,839
“For example, we do not poop outside historic
buildings.”

198
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,290
Now at first glance, this seems extremely
racist.

199
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,290
But when you watch the entire episode

200
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,079
hosted by the Swedish version of me,

201
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,069
it’s clear that the satire was actually
mocking Swedish people

202
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,740
for being ignorant and racist about Chinese
people.

203
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,630
As well as the Swedish government for hypocritically
caring

204
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,910
more about doing business with China than
human rights.

205
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,059
“But we allow this to continue because we
need the money.

206
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,269
And it will be so hard to get the money

207
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,550
if there is a lot of fighting

208
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,500
about Chinese authorities having Swedes imprisoned

209
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,779
and violating human rights and so on.

210
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,439
But that didn’t stop the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs

211
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,059
from calling the show “a gross insult to

212
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,809
and vicious attack on China

213
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,610
and the Chinese people.”

214
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,170
Satire is hard, I know.

215
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,620
Number 1

216
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Taiwan

217
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,670
Finally, it’s everyone’s favorite China--Taiwan.

218
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,149
Also officially known as the Republic of China.

219
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,480
Also officially not known as a country, even
though it is.

220
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,269
Taiwan’s previous president Ma Ying-jeou

221
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,470
really focused on increasing Taiwan’s ties
with mainland China.

222
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,170
Which led to this beautiful meeting

223
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,959
between the two leaders of China..ish.

224
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,230
Under President Ma, Taiwan went from having

225
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,699
no Chinese tourists to having more than 4
million of them.

226
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:52,989
But that changed after Taiwan’s current
president,

227
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:55,579
Tsai Ing-wen took office.

228
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:56,579


229
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,239
Tourism from mainland China dropped 36 percent

230
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:01,249
within the first 7 months of her term,

231
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,629
as the Chinese Communist Party restricted

232
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,149
the number of Chinese tour groups.

233
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,819
But it turns out that tourism from China

234
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,079
could be the least of Taiwan’s worries.

235
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,610
Over the last two years,

236
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,879
the Chinese Communist Party has made a push

237
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,889
to isolate Taiwan internationally.

238
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,389
Five different countries have switched from
recognizing Taiwan

239
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,889
to recognizing mainland China instead.

240
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,899
And the Chinese regime even pressured international
airlines

241
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,009
to not list Taiwan as a country on their websites.

242
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,009
Because everyone knows,

243
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:37,480
if it’s not on the internet, it doesn’t
exist.

244
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,240
But there is some good news for Taiwan!

245
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,510
It looks like the Chinese Communist Party’s
attempts

246
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,249
to punish Taiwan economically through restricting
tourism is...

247
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,439
backfiring.

248
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,339
Although tourism from mainland China is down,

249
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,829
international tourism in Taiwan is way up,

250
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,279
thanks to more tourists from Japan, Korea,

251
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,589
India, and Southeast Asia.

252
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:02,440
And it’s actually better for Taiwan’s
economy,

253
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,920
since these tourists spend

254
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,769
more than mainland Chinese tour groups,

255
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,839
and the money goes to Taiwanese

256
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,649
and not mainland Chinese owned businesses.

257
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,929
It looks like the Chinese Communist Party
may have to

258
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:18,569
look for different ways to punish Taiwan in
the future.

259
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:19,839
So what do you think about the countries

260
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,369
that got punished for angering the Chinese
Communist Party?

261
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:25,059
Leave your comments below.

262
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,120
And now is the moment you’ve all been waiting
for!

263
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,589
When I answer questions from a member

264
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,050
of the China Uncensored 50 cent army—

265
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,029
the fans who make this show possible

266
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,100
by contributing through the crowd funding
website Patreon.

267
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,790
Brian Caylor asks,

268
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,170
What was the subject of your first episode?

269
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,310
I would like to watch it.

270
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,220
Oh Brian, you’ve opened Pandora’s box!

271
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,350
The very first episode of China Uncensored

272
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,799
was actually not even called China Uncensored.

273
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,670
It was called China Unscripted.

274
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,420
Here’s a quick clip.

275
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,809
Hi, welcome to China Unscripted.

276
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,629
I’m Chris Chappell.

277
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:09,629
Fun times.

278
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:12,239
I eventually realized since there was a script,

279
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:15,829
calling it China Unscripted made no sense.

280
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,489
Fortunately we ended up reusing that name
years later

281
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:21,499
for our new Podcast, China Unscripted.

282
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,119
By the way, subscribe on iTunes.

283
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,550
The biggest difference, besides the name,

284
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,829
was I covered three topics in a single episode.

285
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,759
The first was a Canadian journalist named
Mark Bourrie,

286
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,389
who was working for Chinese state-run media,
Xinhua.

287
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:41,079
He accused them of asking him to spy on the
Dalai Lama.

288
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,790
That lead into a story about state-run media

289
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,879
paying Western media companies, like the Washington
Post,

290
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,419
to publish Chinese propaganda.

291
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:52,240
And then, in a tradition apparently going
all the way back

292
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,410
to the beginning of the show,

293
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,470
I complain about my student loan debt

294
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,440
and ask Chinese state run media to make me
an offer as well.

295
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,060
Hey, I can relate to what it’s like to need
money.

296
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,180
I got my Master's at NYU, I have crippling student loan debt.

297
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,420
So what I’m saying is, Xinhua, make me an
offer.

298
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,620
Welcome, comrades.

299
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,200
You know, that was before Shelley joined on
the show,

300
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,699
and can I just say,

301
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:25,379
I think it had a little something to it.

302
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:27,379
What’s that Shelley?

303
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,489
Okay, no it didn’t.

304
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:31,050
Thanks for your question Brian.

305
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,619
And remember, China Uncensored is only possible

306
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:35,910
because of viewers like you who contribute

307
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,529
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

308
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,230
Even a dollar an episode makes a huge difference.

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,610
So head over to Patreon.com/chinauncensored

Thanks for watching this episode of China
Unscripted.

311
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,800
I mean Uncensored.

312
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,559
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

313
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
See you next time.
