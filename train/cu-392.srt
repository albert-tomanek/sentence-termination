1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,020
If you think what the Chinese regime is doing
to Uighurs

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,440
in Xinjiang is bad...

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,520
wait till you hear what they’ve done to
prepare for it.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:11,920
Hi,

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,950
welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,810
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,630
They say history repeats itself.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,609
But that’s not entirely true.

9
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,359
At least not in China.

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,689
Because for history to repeat itself,

11
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,939
that implies that whatever horrible thing
you’re talking about stopped,

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,730
and then started anew.

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,199
But under the Chinese Communist Party,

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,430
horrible things have pretty much never stopped
happening.

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,660
I mean, if it’s working for you,

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,219
why change?

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,510
Take for instance the persecution of the Uighurs,

18
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,980
the ethnic minority who live in the

19
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,440
Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Yes, I know,

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,230
it’s called an autonomous region,

22
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,379
not a province.

23
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,289
But believe it or not,

24
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,620
the people there are about as autonomous

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,890
as people in the Tibet Autonomous Region.

26
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,890
Which is

27
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,890
not...autonomous.

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,879
I think it might have something to do with

29
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,089
all of Xinjiang’s facial-recognition surveillance,

30
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,980
...police stations on every corner…

31
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,580
and the political reeducation camps.

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,510
And let’s not forget the torture that makes
death seem like a release!

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,640
You know, I do love the Rockettes,

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,590
but that may have been some unfortunately
placed advertising.

35
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,970
And while it’s great that the rest of the
world

36
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,040
is finally beginning to take notice,

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,430
this extreme form of monitoring and persecution

38
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,910
in Xinjiang is not really new.

39
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,400
It’s just much more visible.

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,300
Because the persecution of the Uighurs

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,180
is not just similar to what’s happened in
Tibet,

42
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,560
it’s also shockingly similar to what the
Chinese Communist Party

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,020
did to another group—Falun Gong.

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,630
In fact, many of the tactics the Party is
now using against Uighurs

45
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,030
were perfected under the Party’s mass campaign
to eradicate Falun Gong.

46
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,900
That campaign started nearly 20 years ago,
in 1999.

47
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,600
Of course, Falun Gong is completely different
from Islam.

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,120
But the Communist Party doesn’t care what
your beliefs are.

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,070
As long as you believe in something that’s
not Party ideology,

50
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,410
you’re a threat.

51
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,490
And Falun Gong’s principles are

52
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,740
Truth, Compassion, and Tolerance.

53
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,820
You can see why that’s a threat to the Party’s
ideology.

54
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,470
Falun Gong is a spiritual practice that has
similarities to Buddhism and Daoism.

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,820
It became hugely popular in China during the
90s.

56
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,730
At its peak, the Chinese government estimated

57
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,280
there were 70 to 100 million people practicing
it.

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,630
And then they realized,

59
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,490
“Wait, that means more people are practicing
Falun Gong

60
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,790
than are members of the Chinese Communist
Party!”

61
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,790
I mean,

62
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,800
it doesn’t have to be a popularity contest.

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,760
But if you’re an authoritarian party-state

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,420
that’s spent decades suppressing and controlling
any religion

65
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,230
so that you, and only you,

66
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,560
can control people’s hearts and minds

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
you feel a little differently about these
things.

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,319
Especially since many Party members

69
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,970
were also practicing Falun Gong.

70
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,230
And so the Chinese Communist Party leadership

71
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,290
thought about why

72
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,540
truth and compassion and tolerance were so
popular,

73
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,330
did some deep soul searching,

74
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,330
and decided to change their ways.

75
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,720
I’m just kidding.

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,370
They launched a bloody crackdown.

77
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,720
In this episode,

78
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,890
I can’t really get into all the details
of why

79
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,930
Falun Gong was persecuted.

80
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,130
So if you’d like to learn more,

81
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,459
check out my episode What is Falun Gong

82
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,160
and Why Is it Persecuted;

83
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,680
the link is below.

84
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,410
But there are a lot of similarities to

85
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,410
what the Communist Party

86
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,650
did to Falun Gong practitioners starting 20
years ago,

87
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,860
and what they’re doing to Uighurs in Xinjiang
now.

88
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,180
As award-winning China researcher Matthew
Robertson says,

89
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,020
“This campaign [against Falun Gong]

90
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,150
may have very well have been the training
model

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,150
for what is now taking place in Xinjiang.”

92
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,240
Here are 5 ways the persecution of Falun Gong

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,650
became the template for what the Communist
Party

94
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,780
is doing to Uighurs today.

95
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,040
Number 5:

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,790
Propaganda

97
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,270
How do you convince a nation

98
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,730
that torturing and detaining innocent people

99
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,930
is a good idea?

100
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,420
Propaganda!

101
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,010
The first step in these mass campaigns is
obviously

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,010
to convince other Chinese citizens

103
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,599
that the group being targeted

104
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,709
is a dangerous threat to society.

105
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:06,709
In the 90s,

106
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,710
Chinese state-run media had been promoting
Falun Gong,

107
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,160
saying it provided health and mental benefits
for millions.

108
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,430
But in 1999,

109
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,769
they quickly gave Falun Gong a new name:

110
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,430
“evil cult.”

111
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,489
And here’s a website belonging to Xinhua,

112
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:22,460
the official mouthpiece of the Party.

113
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,900
It’s their landing page for

114
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,889
Falun Gong related articles.

115
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,699
The skull really is a nice touch.

116
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,419
Along with the Microsoft Word “Chiller”
font.

117
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,400
That makes it seem really scary.

118
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,009
I guess Xinhua editors

119
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,889
read a lot of R. L. Stine.

120
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,860
Most of the anti-Falun Gong propaganda was

121
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,639
more sophisticated than that, though.

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,360
Chinese state-run media spent millions

123
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,439
to create media articles and fake events

124
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,710
to make Falun Gong look dangerous and stupid.

125
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,539
And also to erase all those older state-run
news reports

126
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,309
about Falun Gong’s health benefits

127
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,439
and how intellectuals practiced it.

128
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,439
Oops!

129
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,759
The Party is using similar propaganda tactics
now

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,449
against the Uighurs.

131
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,839
Uighurs went from being

132
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,919
one of the 56 happy ethnic minorities,

133
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,689
to being “separatists”,

134
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:10,939
and then after 9/11,

135
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,830
the most effective label:

136
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,979
“Muslim terrorists.”

137
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,860
Those reeducation camps where Uighurs are
being tortured?

138
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Why, they’re just reforming religious extremists.

139
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,650
This article from Xinjiang Daily is called

140
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,660
Extremist Religion is Not Religion.

141
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
And of course,

142
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,300
the Chinese Communist Party always thinks
of the children.

143
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,509
Like in this school play

144
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,669
where an evil Uighur is being arrested.

145
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,680
And here’s a dance number called uphold
science;

146
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,220
deal with evil religions according to the
law.

147
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,800
Hey, why are you leaving in the middle?

148
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,309
Do you not want to learn how to deal with
evil religions

149
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,050
according to the law?

150
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,610
That guy is definitely getting arrested.

151
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,729
Number 4:

152
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,520
Weaponizing Your Beliefs

153
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,169
The Communist Party uses people’s

154
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,529
deeply held spiritual beliefs as a weapon
against them.

155
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,869
For Falun Gong practitioners,

156
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,469
here’s a good example.

157
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:05,289
As the persecution intensified,

158
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:07,610
Falun Gong practitioners went underground.

159
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,439
And since all sorts of people practice Falun
Gong

160
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,850
from factory workers to lawyers to even Party
members

161
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,759
well, the Communist Party struggled to identify

162
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,400
who still secretly practiced.

163
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,840
As a way to root them out,

164
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,169
they had major subway stations plaster pictures

165
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,379
of the founder of Falun Gong on the ground.

166
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:28,169
In Chinese culture,

167
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,740
stepping on a picture of someone’s face

168
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,249
is extremely disrespectful.

169
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,080
So if you stepped on the picture,

170
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,380
you were allowed through.

171
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
If you refused,

172
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,100
you’d be put in jail.

173
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,910
They’ve used similar tactics against Uighurs,

174
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,110
who are Muslim.

175
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
For example,

176
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,919
the Communist Party has banned beards and
veils,

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,379
and restricted fasting during Ramadan.

178
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,669
And shopkeepers are now required

179
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,999
to stock cigarettes and alcohol.

180
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:52,999
Although that last one

181
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,930
is not so much to make Muslims violate their
beliefs.

182
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,499
You see, persecuting people is hard work,

183
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,159
and sometimes the Chinese police

184
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,539
just need a cigarette and a stiff drink.

185
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,069
Number 3:

186
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:05,999
Blame Hostile Foreign Forces

187
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,439
The Chinese Communist Party wants you to know

188
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,090
that Falun Gong practitioners,

189
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,090
or Muslims,

190
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,560
or whoever the victim du jour is,

191
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,770
well, they’re extremely dangerous.

192
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,770
But also,

193
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,620
they’re definitely not more powerful than
the Party.

194
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,620
So remember kids,

195
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,509
if there’s some group undermining

196
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,939
China’s social harmony,

197
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,460
you can bet there are hostile foreign forces

198
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,419
at work behind the scenes.

199
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:29,610
For example,

200
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,819
there’s this article in the totally-trustworthy-sounding

201
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,580
Facts.org.CN

202
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,800
that suggests Falun Gong

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,020
is secretly funded by the CIA.

204
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
Yes,

205
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,020
the CIA has decided

206
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,210
to stop running guns to Latin American rebels,

207
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,349
and start funding the world’s most boring,

208
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,110
nonviolent protests that attract

209
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,469
almost no media attention.

210
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,689
The Party uses the same line about Uighurs.

211
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,770
Here’s a People’s Daily article saying,

212
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,090
“We must be vigilant of foreign forces

213
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,749
using religion to infiltrate and conspire

214
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:03,599
to carry out the ‘four transformations’
and ‘splittism.’”

215
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,599
And obviously,

216
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,309
any claims that the Party is mistreating the
Uighurs

217
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:10,039
are also coming from anti-china forces.

218
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,509
For good measure,

219
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:12,879
any Tibetan protesters are

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,900
funded by hostile foreign forces, too.

221
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,889
Because there’s no way Tibetans could be
genuinely upset

222
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,259
about how they’re treated by the Communist
Party.

223
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,259
And we’ll be right back

224
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,319
to show you how the Party manipulates the
law,

225
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,439
right after this quick commercial break.

226
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,479
We’re back,

227
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:30,699
and it’s time for...

228
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,250
Number 2:

229
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,039
Manipulating the Law

230
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,419
Even though these persecutions are done

231
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,039
outside of any form of rule of law,

232
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,070
in recent years,

233
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,880
the Party has been creating legal justifications.

234
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,209
And nothing says rule of law,

235
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,190
like a giant ax chopping Uighurs into mincemeat.

236
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,420
Who says reeducation camps have to be illegal?

237
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,740
I mean, if you control the government,

238
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,519
you can make anything legal.

239
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,029
Like medieval torture.

240
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,110
Now I’m not going to detail all the insane
methods

241
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,760
the Communist Party has invented

242
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,040
to torture Falun Gong practitioners.

243
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,329
Because YouTube would probably demonetize
this video.

244
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,560
But they’re bad.

245
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,190
The stories of torture from Xinjiang

246
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,850
are only just beginning to come out.

247
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,959
But I’m betting they will be very similar

248
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,699
to what Falun Gong practitioners went through.

249
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,380
And there’s a reason for that.

250
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,209
As Robertson says,

251
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,610
“The need to hit transformation rate targets

252
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,709
set by higher-ups

253
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,970
likely contributed to the level of brutality

254
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,990
used against Falun Gong,

255
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,330
and given that similar quotas are being dictated

256
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,290
in Uighur transformation work,

257
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,250
security cadres may find that more violent
methods

258
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,100
are required to achieve their ends.”

259
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,410
And finally...

260
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,130
Number 1:

261
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,389
Re-Education Makes You Less Dumb

262
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,529
It’s very important for everyone to remember,

263
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,279
if you believe in anything besides communism,

264
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
it’s because you’re dumb.

265
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,290
See, according to state-run media,

266
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,430
Chinese people who believe in Falun Gong,

267
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,769
or Christianity,

268
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:57,769
or Buddhism,

269
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:58,870
or Islam,

270
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,699
well, they’re all a bunch of uneducated
simpletons.

271
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:05,230
Hence the need for re-education!

272
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,230
And it’s all about learning

273
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,940
to love the Chinese Communist Party.

274
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,079
Ideological education is a major part of it.

275
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,459
Reading Communist doctrine and singing patriotic
songs

276
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:18,089
all to help these misguided souls join

277
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,990
“the big socialist family.”

278
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,519
It’s such a loving family...

279
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,240
that has killed 100 million people over 100
years.

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,709
Which, in their defense,

281
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,080
is only an average of one million people a
year.

282
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,260
Now comparing the persecution

283
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,230
of the Uighurs and Falun Gong practitioners

284
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,870
isn’t to diminish the suffering of either
group.

285
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,279
But there’s a common misconception floating
around

286
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,029
in response to the situation in Xinjiang

287
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,920
that this shows how things in China are getting
worse.

288
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,990
Yes, it’s absolutely bad now.

289
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,329
But it’s also been bad since the Communist
Party’s early days

290
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,750
from thought rectification in Yan’an,

291
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,540
to “liberating” Tibet,

292
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,589
to the Cultural Revolution,

293
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,340
to the Tiananmen massacre,

294
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,210
to killing Falun Gong practitioners,

295
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,250
to now also oppressing Uighurs.

296
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,060
And that’s still leaving out a lot.

297
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,970
We could do an entire series on

298
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,649
all the different groups of people the Chinese
Communist Party

299
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,470
has persecuted over the years.

300
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,970
Wouldn’t that be fun to watch?

301
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,069
The Communist Party has never stopped persecuting
people.

302
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,860
They’ve just been refining their craft.

303
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,930
The problem is systemic.

304
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,460
We can’t expect the Communist Party to fundamentally
reform

305
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,399
and become good.

306
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,910
As long as it’s around,

307
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,269
there’s always going to be another group
that needs to be persecuted

308
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,410
I mean, re-educated

309
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,410
for a better,

310
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,200
more harmonious society that loves the Party.

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,889
Gotta say that it’s not looking too great

312
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:44,019
for the Christians right now, either.

313
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,570
But the more people who are aware of what

314
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,160
the Chinese Communist Party has been doing
over the years,

315
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,379
the more likely it is that someday,

316
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,690
all of the rightists,

317
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,690
splittists,

318
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,690
counterrevolutionaries,

319
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,690
intellectuals,

320
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,690
running dogs,

321
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,690
separatists,

322
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,690
religious extremists,

323
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,300
and puppets of hostile foreign forces

324
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,569
will see justice in China.

325
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:02,569
So what do you think?

326
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:04,110
Leave your comments below.

327
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,069
And now I want to take a moment to answer
a question

328
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:08,120
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

329
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,449
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

330
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:12,560
Wesley Tucker asks,

331
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,420
“What can you offer in the way of hopeful
insight

332
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,329
that can assure your audience that we are

333
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,040
not going to be living under a CCP world order

334
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,329
in matter of decades from now?”

335
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:27,699
Well, Wesley, I wish I could promise that.

336
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:30,280
The Chinese Communist Party is doing everything
it can

337
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,600
to make a CCP world order happen.

338
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,709
Like by asserting its views at the United
Nations.

339
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,980
And waging a brazen and aggressive campaign

340
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,850
of influence in Western democracies.

341
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,339
That could be a very grim future.

342
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,160
The good news is that people around the world
like you

343
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,329
are beginning to wake up and take action.

344
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,959
US officials have been speaking out about
it

345
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,689
more directly than ever.

346
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,629
Australia has banned foreign campaign contributions

347
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:57,880
because of concerns about

348
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,980
Chinese Communist Party influence.

349
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,040
And Canada...

350
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,839
well, the Prime Minister is still hugging
pandas,

351
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,100
so there’s some work to do.

352
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,230
So stay educated by watching China Uncensored

353
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,939
and share what you learn with your friends
and family.

354
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:12,730
Especially if you live in Canada.

355
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,689
Thanks for your question, Wesley.

356
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,129
And if you want a shot at having

357
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,840
your question answered on the show,

358
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,820
contribute a dollar or more per episode

359
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,449

Once again,

362
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,580
I’m Chris Chappell.

363
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,880
