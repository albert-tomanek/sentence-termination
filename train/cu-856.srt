1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:05,450
you know, they say, “money can’t buy you
love.”

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,680
Which is why love should be forcibly seized
by the state

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,920
and redistributed to the masses.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,980
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,680
You know, the Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,910
is a lot like a not very good dad.

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,980
Works long hours,

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,470
never comes home for dinner,

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,420
doesn't provide a social safety net,

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,660
beats up human rights defenders,

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,260
you know, the usual.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,470
The thing about a dad like that,

15
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,820
is he tries to make up for never being there

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,720
by buying you cool stuff,

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
when all you really wanted

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,670
was for him to go to your little league game!

19
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,280
Just one game!

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,370
Yes...that’s...just what the Communist Party
is like,

21
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,480
which is what I am talking about.

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,830
The Chinese Communist Party—

23
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,410
the CCP—wants you to love it.

24
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,410
The problem is, t

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,220
hey've done some...unloveable stuff.

26
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,220
But they figured out a way around that.

27
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,890
If they can’t get you to love the the Party,

28
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,350
they can get you to love China.

29
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,490
And what’s not to love!

30
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,260
A rich cultural legacy of 5,000 years of history,

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,840
give or take the last couple of decades.

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,359
Yeah, those last couple of decades

33
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,039
did leave kind of a mark.

34
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,130
Now, they say any publicity is good publicity,

35
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,560
but whoever “they” are,

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,749
I don't think they had

37
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:18,359
the Tiananmen Square Massacre in mind.

38
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,450
It was a PR nightmare!

39
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,799
So the Communist Party needed a way

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,289
to change China's image.

41
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:28,549
And the answer was soft power.

42
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,619
Soft power is the kind of cultural influence

43
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:31,859
that makes people like you

44
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,009
and want to be like you.

45
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,329
Like the popular kids at school.

46
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,130
But after the Tiananmen Square massacre,

47
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,730
no one wanted to sit next to China

48
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,360
at the lunch table.

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,479
Except for like, North Korea,

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,399
who was deeply uncool.

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,490
So, like in every teen movie,

52
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,220
China got a makeover.

53
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,560
A little less tanks,

54
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,680
and a little more...

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,249
whatever these are supposed to be.

56
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,520
So ignore that cyber espionage

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,090
and rapid military build up.

58
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,399
Here are five ways China

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,729
is trying to buy your love.

60
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:02,749
Number 5

61
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:03,990
Chinese National Day.

62
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,039
October 1st.

63
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,649
It’s kind of like Chinese Independence Day.

64
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,880
Except instead of celebrating liberation

65
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,970
from a foreign colonial power,

66
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,140
it celebrates the day the Communist Party
rebels

67
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,099
“liberated” China from...

68
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,000
the Chinese government that was already there.

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,019
The Communist Party took over the nation

70
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:22,500
and quickly launched campaigns

71
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,470
to take money from the wealthy,

72
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,819
kill landowners,

73
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,330
imprison intellectuals,

74
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,640
and generally ensure “harmonious society.”

75
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,730
Cause for celebration!

76
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,060
Seriously, the CCP actually exports its National
Day celebrations

77
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,469
all over the world

78
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,560
as part of its soft power push.

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,319
For example, in Vancouver,

80
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,379
Chinese officials somehow convinced the mayor

81
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,739
and another official to wear red scarves—

82
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:47,739
because they thought it was part

83
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,489
of traditional Chinese culture.

84
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,860
Yes, the same red scarves that the Communist
Youth League

85
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,300
wore when the CCP made them destroy

86
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,379
Chinese traditional culture in the 1960s.

87
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,300
You know it was successful propaganda

88
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,890
because Chinese state media featured it.

89
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,640
Number 4

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,480
Rather than sending an army to invade your
country,

91
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,250
China is sending an army to invade your heart—

92
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,340
an army of pandas!

93
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,209
Just look at their cute ferocity.

94
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,549
People love pandas.

95
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:19,549
They work hard everyday

96
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,239
to bring you uncensored news and information

97
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,530
about China and, oh no wait I’m sorry,

98
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,530
that’s me.

99
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,999
I don’t really know what pandas do.

100
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,180
But everyone still loves them,

101
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,450
for some reason.

102
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,620
Yes, pandas are adorable!

103
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,829
And most importantly,

104
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,819
any government represented by a panda

105
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,090
must be equally cute and cuddly.

106
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,739
Who’s a cute panda bear?

107
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,020
You’re a cute panda bear.

108
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,269
Yes you are.

109
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,439
Yes you are!

110
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,690
Number 3

111
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,780
Somewhere on the cuddle spectrum

112
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,819
between panda bears and Xi Jinping,

113
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,470
there’s Confucius.

114
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,810
The guy from 500 BC

115
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,730
who arguably had a bigger influence on Chinese
culture

116
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,180
than anyone in history.

117
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,410
Mao Zedong called him a peddler

118
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,540
of feudal superstition.

119
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,719
But eventually the Communist Party

120
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,540
realized Mao’s mistake,

121
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,730
and transformed Confucius

122
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,970
into a peddler of propaganda!

123
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,030
Since 2004,

124
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,590
the Chinese regime has set up 500 Confucius
Institutes

125
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,060
in 140 countries,

126
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,320
plus 1,000 Confucius classrooms.

127
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,160
This is a very tempting offer to schools around
the world

128
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
short on cash—

129
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
the Chinese Communist Party

130
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,100
provides free Mandarin language classes,

131
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,350
as well as cultural programs

132
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,600
like Chinese dance and cooking.

133
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,470
Not at the same time.

134
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,280
Or maybe at the same time.

135
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
The point is,

136
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,340
the Party’s former propaganda chief Li Changchun
said

137
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,670
that the Confucius Institute is “an important part

138
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,860
of China's overseas propaganda set-up.”

139
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,690
Students will learn how great China’s

140
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,200
economic development is,

141
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,710
but they won’t be learning about,

142
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,990
oh I don’t know,

143
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,760
certain massacres that totally never happened.

144
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,620
Or a certain country that’s actually not
a country at all

145
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,630
and just a normal province of China.

146
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,120
Ever wonder how to say “Tibet” in Chinese?

147
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,030
You might not want to ask.

148
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,030
Number 2

149
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,440
You say you want to be in pictures?

150
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,460
Well, don’t say anything critical about
China,

151
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,550
or else you might end up like Richard Gere.

152
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,840
China is the world’s second largest movie
market,

153
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,550
but only allows 34 foreign titles a year.

154
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,630
That means movies critical of China,

155
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,660
or even overly positive towards to the US
government,

156
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,020
won’t be shown in China.

157
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,540
So the Chinese Communist Party incentivizes
Hollywood

158
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,960
to self-censor—

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,280
or lose a huge chunk

160
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,750
of potential box office money.

161
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,910
On top of that,

162
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,360
Chinese tycoons with shady Party ties

163
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,990
are buying up Hollywood.

164
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,990
Chinese co-productions

165
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,570
are becoming increasingly common, too.

166
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,070
It won’t be long before we start seeing
movies like

167
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,180
Little Big Xi or Jerry Mao-guire.

168
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,980
And finally Number 1

169
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,470
From schools to movies to even the zoos,

170
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,030
it seems Chinese propaganda is everywhere.

171
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,310
What’s left?

172
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,870
Why, the media of course!

173
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,720
While many media organizations around the
world

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,550
have struggled to survive,

175
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,120
the Chinese government has been pumping

176
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,610
huge sums of money into expanding

177
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,940
state-run media to a global platform.

178
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,300
In just a few years,

179
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,080
Party mouthpiece Xinhua opened

180
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,410
nearly fifty new foreign bureaus,

181
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,500
and doubled its number of overseas correspondents.

182
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,770
A few years ago,

183
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,110
China Central Television set up

184
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,270
its US headquarters just a few blocks

185
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,720
from the White House.

186
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
And last December,

187
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,270
they rebranded their international propaganda
outlets

188
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,080
as the friendlier-sounding, China Global Television
Network

189
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,500
so we wouldn’t know.

190
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,100
Xi Jinping told them to

191
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,690
“spread China’s voice well...

192
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,990
and showcase China’s role

193
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,930
as a builder of world peace.”

194
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,500
But why just stick to their own media?

195
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,860
State-run China Daily also pays struggling
Western media

196
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,330
like the Wall Street Journal and the New York
Times

197
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,770
to put their content in their papers and on
their websites.

198
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,770
And eventually,

199
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,300
without most of us realizing it,

200
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,020
the Chinese regime’s limitless spending

201
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,900
has wormed its way into our hearts.

202
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,270
The public relations firm Portland Communications

203
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,080
surveys the public on their opinion

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,490
of 30 different countries.

205
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,930
China used to be dead last.

206
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,850
And now they’re, well...

207
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,580
at least they beat out the Czech Republic.

208
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,770
And Argentina.

209
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,880
And that is money well spent.

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
It seems money can buy you love.

211
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,340
Sorry John, Paul, George, and What's-His-Face.

212
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,020
But here’s the thing:

213
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,720
No matter how much the Chinese Communist Party

214
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,280
spends to make people love China,

215
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
and by extension,

216
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,900
hopefully the Chinese Communist Party—

217
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,340
it’s not going to work as well

218
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,690
as good old-fashioned freedom of expression.

219
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,250
Look at South Korea.

220
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,060
It has one twentieth the population of China.

221
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,870
But Korean Dramas and Korean Pop music

222
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,180
are wildly popular all over the world.

223
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,720
In 2014, at a leadership meeting in Beijing,

224
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,090
Chinese officials lamented how China

225
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,470
can’t seem to make television

226
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,490
as popular as Korean dramas.

227
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,350
Some of the officials blamed it on the CCP’s

228
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,560
“examination and approval system”—

229
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
i.e. censorship system—

230
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,960
that encourages conformity

231
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,150
rather than creativity.

232
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,150
But somehow, I don’t think

233
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,300
pouring billions of dollars into propaganda

234
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,660
is the solution to that problem.

235
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,060
So what do you think about China’s efforts

236
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,870
to buy your love?

237
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,110
Has it bought your love?
