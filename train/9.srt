1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,140
Joining me in the studio today:
he reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,340
He gets another shot!

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,140
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,040
Three! Four! Nine!
All of these are numbers.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,760
And the bounciest man on the internet — Matt Gray!

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,640
Welcome YouTube!

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,560
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can't see it.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,100
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,320
and there's a special prize for
particularly good answers, which is:

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,340
Today's article is: A Message From Earth.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,340
A message from Eeearth.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
What, like from Flash Gordon?

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
That's how you pronounced 'Eeearth'.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,440
That's how it should be pronounced!

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,380
I've got the horrible feeling that
in millions of years to come,

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,260
we'll work out we've been saying it wrong
all this time and it should be pronounced:

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,700
Eeearth.

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,140
Is it anything to do with Voyager?

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,560
Well... it's the same kind of thing.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,980
Is it 'Your call is important to us...'?

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,920
[Laughter]

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,620
'If you are a hostile alien species, please press 2
to be reacted to with nuclear missiles.'

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,660
'Please note that Earth is only open between 9 and 5.'

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,220
'Nine to five what? I have been travelling for parsecs!'

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Obscure Star Wars reference! Nice.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,160
GARY: It's truth though, innit.

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,800
Anyway, we've got an alien death fleet
round the back that's on hold.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,200
Is it something to do with a probe we've sent out?

30
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,420
Not particularly a probe.

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,500
Is it fictional?

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,960
No, it's entirely real.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,180
It's about... let's see.

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,640
Can I have a punt at this?

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,640
TOM: Yeah. I'll tell you it's about
six light-years away right now.

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,920
Oh s***, I'm wrong then.

37
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,100
Why, what were you going for?

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,900
I was going to say it's the tune that Blur did
that landed on the Moon... on, erm...

39
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,660
Beagle 2.

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,580
GARY: ...on Mars with Beagle 2.

41
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,140
It didn't land — well, it did land!

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,140
GARY and MATT: It landed!

43
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,100
It landed at high velocity!

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,320
[Laughter]
Downwards.

45
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,820
I know there's a thin line
between 'landing' and 'impact', but...

46
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,960
I tell that to the wife all the time.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,160
But it's somewhere on Mars, regrettably, is a Blur CD.

48
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,280
In many different pieces.

49
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,040
MATT: I might have a go at the answer.
TOM: Yeah, go for it.

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,840
Is it about how far our earliest radio
transmissions have got out to space?

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,280
Not at six light-years, it's not.

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,020
Just spare a thought for that.

53
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,240
They're going to get all the crap
early stuff first, aren't they?

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,280
As we did.

55
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,440
It's a bit further back from earliest messages,

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,100
and it's certainly a bit too far for a probe to have got.

57
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,140
This is a transmission?

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,660
It's a transmission. [DING]

59
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,040
And did someone just broadcast,
'Hey, is anyone listening?'

60
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,940
Not entirely. I'll give you the point, it's a transmission...

61
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,040
specifically one transmitted from an Earth station

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,620
belonging to the Ukraine national space agency,

63
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,300
which I can only assume has had
some budget cuts recently.

64
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,300
[Laughter]

65
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,080
Ooo.

66
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,520
But yes, it was transmitted on October 2008.

67
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,320
Oh really?

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
Hence the reason it is about six light-years away.

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,720
Please tell me it is just someone tapping a microphone
and going, 'Is this thing on?'

70
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,460
Well, it sort of is.

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
It's meant to go about twenty light-years in total.

72
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,540
Have they found somewhere specific
that they're sending it?

73
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,160
Yes. Any ideas what that might be?

74
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,820
An M-class planet!

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,300
Ooh, you know what, you can have a point. [DING]

76
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,740
It's not M-class, we haven't found one of those yet,

77
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,900
but it is a good candidate for being a close thing
for where there might be life.

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,000
Gliese 581 c.

79
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,800
It's what I was just going to say.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,680
Yeaaah, beaten to it again.

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,360
And it's all said because they're expecting
everyone there to be completely gleeful.

82
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,900
GARY: Aww. Wouldn't that be nice?

83
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,940
If some alien death battlefleet turned up,

84
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,140
but it had a really nice name, it'd put you off, wouldn't it?

85
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,480
Put you off what? Dying?

86
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,380
No, how you would react.

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,400
You know, if they were like the Third Warfleet
of the K'Flaarghs, you would step back a bit.

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,260
GARY: But if they were...
TOM: The Gleezins.

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,460
'We are the Glee People!'

90
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,160
'Ah! That's nice.'

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
'In our world, this is bad!'

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm just thinking of militarized Powerpuff Girls right now.

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,300
It will reach there in about 2029.

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,960
If we hear anything back, it'll presumably be about 2050.

95
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,560
After they've had time to work out
what on earth we've sent them.

96
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
Do you know what I really want the message to be?

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Comes back 2050 — the little printer or whatever
that's there to record this for posterity...

98
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,460
Yeah, you know, because it's that sort of thing,

99
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,520
it's going to be a sci-fi film,
it's still going to be a dot-matrix printer.

100
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,460
Yeah. It's printing it off bit by bit,
and they pick it up, they tear it off...

101
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,540
And they hold it up, and it just says,
"WHAT?"

102
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,180
That would be an entirely perfect response for this.

103
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,960
Because 501 messages were actually included.

104
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,660
How did they pick which ones to send?

105
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,940
Well, the one we sent had a rickroll in it.

106
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,160
Oh. You know what...

107
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,020
I was just going to say, YouTube views.

108
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,900
I'm going to give Gary the point...

109
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
Oh shut up!

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
Because it was the internet. [DING]

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,700
We sent them the internet?

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,240
No, we sent them 501 messages
selected by popular vote from the internet.

113
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,280
Porn, porn, porn, kittens, 'Good afternoon Sir/Madam,
I have a fantastic opportunity for you.'

114
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,900
Not at random. There was a public vote,
so I can only assume...

115
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,120
...it was fixed by 4chan and Reddit.

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
Yeah.

117
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,040
Not 4chan, not Reddit... Which social network
did they use to put the time capsule together?

118
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Oh, please not Twitter.

119
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,540
Google+. There was one vote in total.

120
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,600
Not quite, but you're close.

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,620
MATT: Orkut.

122
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,620
Oh... not quite that obscure.

123
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,360
Tinder.

124
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,100
Tinder wasn't around then.

125
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,720
Tinder: 'No... No... No... No...'

126
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,820
Then a picture of a lizard comes up.
'Swipe left...'

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,480
You know how Tinder works?

128
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,560
CHRIS: That's very interesting!
GARY: Everyone knows how...!

129
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,000
That's a point... You're married, Brannan.

130
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,080
How do I know how Tinder works? I live in
the same world you do and I read newspapers.

131
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,400
TOM: Yes, that's fair.
MATT: I don't know how Tinder works.

132
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,600
I don't know how Tinder works!

133
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,340
Just aware, boys. I've not used it.

134
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,380
This is one of these things where you try and
defend yourself and it just sounds worse, doesn't it.

135
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,220
ALL: Yep.
CHRIS: Stop digging, old boy.

136
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,280
Anyway, yes. What did we use?

137
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,300
Bebo.

138
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
Whoa!

139
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,100
I have never even heard of this thing.

140
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,280
Does someone want to explain Bebo to Chris?

141
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,500
Hard, really, but...

142
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,900
You know MySpace?

143
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,820
Faintly, yeah.

144
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,860
It's what the people that were younger than us
used when MySpace wasn't cool enough.

145
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,180
But it's worse.

146
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,060
Okay.

147
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm trying to think who the popular
boy band of the day would be.

148
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,400
Because we're just sending all that, aren't we.

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,780
I can tell you, because they were involved in the project.

150
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,640
Oh s***. Jonas Brothers or One Direction?

151
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,880
MATT: No, that was a bit before.

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,220
TOM: No, no. You're too early for that.

153
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
What date are we saying again?

154
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,640
TOM: 2008.
GARY: 8? Oh God, I've no idea.

155
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,240
I'll tell you, they're still going.

156
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
British or elsewhere?

157
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,440
British. It was Bebo. Bebo's a British network.

158
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
McFly.

159
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,600
GARY: Ohhh.
MATT: Really!

160
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,500
McFly were involved. Along with
Deborah Meaden from Dragons' Den...

161
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,840
Off of Dragons' Den.

162
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,780
And Gillian Anderson off of The X-Files.
Because presumably...

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,060
Space!

164
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,680
We are sending mixed messages here, people.

165
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,300
We have this much publicity budget...
this is who we can get.

166
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,700
Ha! That's what came first is the money, isn't it.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,200
Who would we put up front now?
I mean, Hawking obviously...

168
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,260
Yeah, if we need an ambassador... ungh!

169
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,280
Brian f***ing Cox.

170
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,880
Oh no... I'd hope they *were* the angry ones,
just because they'd fire at him first.

171
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,580
What's the dislike for Brian Cox?

172
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,500
It's not a dislike, it's just the use
 of him for anything scientific.

173
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,420
CHRIS: That's true, yeah.
TOM: That's fair.

174
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm being controversial,
I'm putting Noel Edmonds up there.

175
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,440
What! Why?

176
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,680
Consistent master of ceremonies.

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,120
He can anchor any show, no matter what's going wrong.

178
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,860
In the old days, I'd have stuck Monkhouse in.

179
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,860
Did you ever *hear* of Noel's HQ?

180
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,220
Yeah... this is true.

181
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,080
The man believes in cosmic ordering.

182
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,160
I'm not putting him out as ambassador for Earth.

183
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,920
You're making some good points here, yeah...

184
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,420
I was thinking from the consistent
broadcasting point of view,

185
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,080
that if anything went wrong,
he'd probably be able to keep a show going.

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,880
Oh no, if you're doing that — Davina McCall.

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,460
Ohhh.

188
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,840
Davina McCall can hold a show down,
no matter what's going wrong around her.

189
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,080
You're forgetting something here.
This isn't television, this is meeting an alien death fleet.

190
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,480
TOM: Ah. Fair.

191
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm assuming telly's going to be there.

192
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,940
Oh! Then Morgan Freeman, obviously.

193
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,700
Ahh! Well yeah, of course.

194
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,040
There's one for the Americans to know what we're
talking about. You've heard of Morgan Freeman.

195
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,360
Morgan Freeman.
We're sending him and Stephen Hawking in.

196
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,740
TOM: Yeah.
CHRIS: Yeah, all right.

197
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,780
[Laughter]

198
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,540
It's sending God and science, isn't it?

199
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah! That's all it is... we've got both bases covered!

200
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,900
Alien death fleet's going to negotiate with them!

201
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,180
Morgan Freeman could come up with
some kind of homespun philosophy

202
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,280
when things are getting quite tense.

203
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,160
Please invade. Take me away from all this.

204
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,120
[Laughter]

205
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,660
Anyway, the Message From Earth
has got the McFlies on it?

206
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,360
Yes, it has, erm...

207
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,580
The McFlies!

208
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,620
As I believe they're called.

209
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,840
Oh dear.

210
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,400
We've got the McFlies.

211
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,420
501 messages included.
One was chosen to illustrate evil.

212
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,400
'This is a party political broadcast
by the Conservative Party.'

213
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,060
Oh, you know what — you are so close.

214
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,280
F*** off!

215
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,760
2008, who would you pick to be the epitome of evil?

216
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,940
GARY: Oh! Dubya!
TOM: Dubya. [DING]

217
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,300
Nooo!
[Laughter]

218
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,220
So it's now out of date even though it's within...

219
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,160
It is entirely out of date,
despite the fact it is currently about...

220
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,520
About a third of the way to a planet
about twenty light-years away.

221
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,380
'We have come to rid of your great evil, Dubya Bush.'

222
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,020
Yep.

223
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,440
I've just thought. The best thing is,
when the response comes back,

224
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,300
no one's going to know what they're responding to,
because everyone will have forgotten it happened.

225
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,420
One message says that the best thing
about Earth is George Sampson.

226
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,300
Who no one will remember even in Britain...

227
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,680
Oh hang on, let me have a go...

228
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,040
CHRIS: I remember the name...
MATT: I know that name.

229
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,080
George Sampson. Was he on... a talent show?

230
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,160
He was on Britain's Got Talent. He was the kid dancer.

231
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,780
He was a dancer, wasn't he?

232
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,520
Yeah. That message is going through
interstellar space right now, aimed at a planet.

233
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,220
D'you know, all that philosophy and engineering
and writing and discovery...

234
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,580
F*** it.
Dancing eight-year-old.

235
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,360
Yeah.

236
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
But the best thing is, he was probably cool with that,

237
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,260
because he knows if a message
comes back in the affirmative,

238
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,660
saying, 'Tell us more of these George Sampsons!'
He's like: 'Career's back.'

239
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,980
TOM: Yeah, that's true.

240
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,580
It's better than what I thought you said.
I thought you said Daz Sampson.

241
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,800
Ohhh.

242
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,880
Ooo.

243
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,700
Oooo.

244
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,780
That's a reference that Americans shouldn't Google.

245
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
Don't. Do.
Depends what you like, really.

246
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,480
Yeah.

247
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,860
I'm certainly not going to.
I don't know what they're on about.

248
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,480
I mean... this is blatantly a publicity stunt.

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,220
What we have essentially done is spammed a planet
twenty light-years away with an ad for Bebo.

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,220
We haven't spammed a planet. We have
spammed an entire section of space.

251
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,920
A swath of space that the radio...

252
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,740
You can't pinpoint this s***.

253
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,300
No, you can't. Even a laser beam
pointed at a planet would be so wide...

254
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,100
Oh yeah. Vast diffusion by the time you... yeah.

255
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,180
What if — can you imagine the opposite?

256
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,280
That we receive a message that
we can't decode or understand,

257
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,100
because it's come from the depths of space.

258
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,440
We would go absolutely apes*** for something like that.

259
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
We would.

260
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,900
They're going to be doing something similar,
you know, and we get it...

261
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,200
Finally, whatever-the-race-is finally lands and goes,

262
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,300
'Ah, yes. He won one of our
talent shows seventy years ago.'

263
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,340
[Laughter]

264
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,700
I mean, we'd treat it as...

265
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,840
Imagine if some alien culture
sent a similar message to us.

266
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,160
We couldn't decode it.

267
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,420
We would have our best cryptographers
trying to work out...

268
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,440
We really would! We'd be trying to point out,

269
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,240
It's directions, or it's scientific information or something.

270
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,740
And all we've done is sent
bloody McFly's friggin' shoe size.

271
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,140
Not their shoe size...
Does anyone want to say what they were...?

272
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,460
Greatest fears and times they were out of the house.

273
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,800
Did it list the five colours of her hair?

274
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,780
It was in praise of someone else. Another woman.

275
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,400
Oh, that song about the teacher?

276
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
No... that was Busted.

277
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,700
They sent a message in praise of Cheryl Cole.

278
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,380
F***.

279
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
In praise of a woman who punched a toilet attendant.

280
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,680
Yup. The transmission took
four and a half hours, by the way.

281
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,920
We used a radio telescope, one of the
greatest scientific achievements in the world,

282
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,440
for four and a half hours, to send this thing.

283
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,960
Yeah, again... planet in the
distance is sending a message:

284
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,340
'We shall do this! We have locked onto a signal!'

285
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,580
'Transmit the message!'

286
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,060
I can see him there in his big cape and everything,
in his gigantic space palace...

287
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,780
Yeah. Again, you're on Ming the Merciless here.

288
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
Well, everyone in space looks like that.
That's been well established.

289
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,680
Obviously, yeah.

290
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,200
'Transmit the message!'

291
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,100
Doot... doot...
coming up 'Engaged'.

292
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,200
There is another message about a year after it,

293
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,940
sent by a completely different group.

294
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,120
They targeted this message
at literally the same solar system.

295
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,720
'Please delete your voice mails,
don't listen to any more, just delete it!'

296
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,540
Essentially, yes.

297
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,860
Was it UKIP?

298
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,620
Oh, God!
Nigel Farage in space...

299
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,300
'No, no. Let me speak!'

300
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,520
[Laughter]
Just without a suit. Just Nigel Farage in space.

301
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,220
No spacesuit, no nothing...

302
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,920
I've got him in a tweed spacesuit...

303
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,460
Oh God, the UKIP Space Agency...

304
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,700
He's got a special kind of space agency-designed glass

305
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,140
that's still got a pint in that he can still suck in.

306
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
And a hole for a fag.

307
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,140
And this one was 2.8 megabytes of messages,

308
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,200
which they just accepted everything
sent in to their website.

309
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,380
GARY: Uh-oh...

310
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,260
MATT: Text?

311
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Text, yes.

312
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,660
Have we just intergalactically potentially sexted?

313
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,480
Ooo. Ooh, I don't know.

314
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
'What do they mean, what am I wearing?'
[Laughter]

315
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,900
'The same thing I always wear! A cape!'

316
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,980
'A giant cape! And a long, swishy set of gloves!

317
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,260
'And a very neatly trimmed beard!'

318
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,780
TOM: What I love is that the... the...

319
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,820
CHRIS: 'I am Ming the Merciless!'

320
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,880
GARY: 'And my hands are wet!'

321
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,540
'Why does no one have a towel on Mongo?!'

322
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,900
MATT: 'This one is wet...'
GARY: 'This one is wet.'

323
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,280
Other messages, then.
We have loads of them.

324
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,500
It turns out, having looked through the wider articles,

325
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,220
there are quite a lot of messages we've sent
to various places over the years.

326
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,080
One of the earliest messages that went out was the Teen Age Message, which was from Russia in 2001.

327
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,220
It included a live performance of music.

328
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,660
And they just plugged the instrument 
effectively straight into the radio telescope.

329
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,120
What instrument did they plug in
that could send coherent sound?

330
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
Melodion.

331
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
A zither.

332
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,580
Theremin.

333
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,840
TOM: Yes! [DING]
GARY: Nooo!

334
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,820
And in fact...

335
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,300
Can you get a more mysterious space music than that?

336
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,220
Making space noises into space.

337
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,580
[Theremin sounds]  Wooooo...

338
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,160
Yep. First theremin concert for extraterrestrials.

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,500
Can we just end it on 'first theremin concert'?

340
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,100
'Man Found To Own Theremin.'

341
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,340
I got to play a theremin a little while ago.

342
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,380
It's really difficult!

343
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,460
Bloody difficult, yeah.

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,920
Even if you forget the whole volume thing,
the trying to find a note is just...

345
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,280
Why a theremin?

346
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,160
Well, it just f***ing sounds like space, doesn't it?

347
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,040
GARY: Yeah!

348
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,940
It's a constant sine wave.

349
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,660
Like, it sounds like a coherent message,
rather than noise...

350
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,280
Again, someone outside the Earth is doing this to us,
and we're trying to decode it here...

351
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,120
'What could this mysterious message mean?'
Not realizing it's f***in'...

352
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,640
Woooo...
'Oh God, Doctor Who's coming.'

353
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,280
It's the opening bars to, I don't know,
McFly, played on a friggin' theremin.

354
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,180
They actually did go for Russian folk songs
and classical music there, so...

355
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,420
Have we Trololo-led the universe on a theremin?

356
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,060
Yes we have. Yep.

357
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,980
['Trololo' melody]
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo... woo-oo-oo...

358
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,540
So you know all those arguments about how
we shouldn't send signals out there,

359
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,960
in case a hostile civilisation detects us...

360
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,700
Yeah.

361
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah, too late. Bebo got there first.

362
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,440
Oh, bollocks.

363
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,360
Well, hopefully they'll just pass us by,
based on what we've sent out.

364
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,560
'They are not worth the trouble!
They cannot dry my flappy gloves!'

365
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,500
[Laughter]

366
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,880
'And our lack of towels!'

367
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,220
There is one other thing — one other message,
sent in 2012, that I want to talk about...

368
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,960
which was three transmissions
to three stars in a very specific bit of space.

369
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,740
'Oh, he said you...'

370
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,900
[Laughter]

371
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
'You and you, fight!' Yeah.

372
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,460
No... which was a reply.

373
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
What was it a reply to?

374
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Is it one of these mysterious sort of
'thunks' that comes from space or...

375
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,100
Yep. [DING] Have a point.

376
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,820
Anyone remember the name of it? The really big signal...

377
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
'Wow!'

378
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,620
[DING] Point. The 'Wow!' signal.

379
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,000
The guy circled it in red pen
and put 'Wow!' next to it, and that's it.

380
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah. It matches the expected signature
of an interstellar signal perfectly.

381
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,440
Never been seen again.

382
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,420
Could have been a freak event.

383
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,520
Did they decode it to 'Air Hostess' by McFly?

384
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,000
Again — Busted.
But we'll let you have it.

385
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,660
McFly / Busted. Yeah.

386
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,880
What we need is a loud noise that
goes into space, that's recognizable...

387
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,840
That just picks up that 'Wow!' spike...

388
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,600
So I am up for sticking Brian Blessed
on top of Everest, with an alphorn.

389
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,040
Yep. Okay, good.

390
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,960
Why are we not just sending
big old spikes of solid pitch?

391
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,080
Because if they're looking in the same way we are,
and all they're getting is a spike...

392
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,840
What we need to send is:

393
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,980
['Shave and a haircut' rhythm]
Boop boop-boop boop boop...

394
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,040
Yes! Absolutely!

395
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,340
That has got to be universal — yeah, absolutely.

396
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,800
That is universal! If nothing else,
the 'shave and a haircut' knock up there...

397
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,300
'Shave and a haircut —
shave and a haircut — shave and a haircut —'

398
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,640
'Bomp bomp.'
'Bomp bomp!'

399
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,080
'Holy f***!'

400
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,900
Both ends simultaneously realize we've been working
together, it's the grounds for peace, it's fine...

401
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,240
everybody sits down, watches Roger Rabbit, hates
Christopher Lloyd's character, it's fine. Galactic peace.

402
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,220
That's it. We've solved the world's problems.

403
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,380
That's it. Intergalactic peace is inevitable.

404
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,760
Right! Curry then, chaps.

405
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Yep! We're all done. At the end of that show, congratulations Chris, you win this one.

406
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,760
You win a year's supply of AA batteries,
courtesy of He-Man's new company.

407
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,640
The Power of Grayskull.

408
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,260
Cool!

409
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,780
Best one yet.

410
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,240
Thank you very much to Chris Joel!

411
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,440
Winning!

412
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,760
TOM: To Gary Brannan...
GARY: Felicitations.

413
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,220
TOM: To Matt Gray...
MATT: Bye-bye.

414
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,100
I've been Tom Scott, and we'll see you next time.

415
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,180
What, has Ming the Merciless
got designs on Scarborough as well?

416
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,300
Some hot hail would tidy the place right up.

417
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,420
ALL: Oooo.

418
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,720
GARY: That sounds highbrow and commemorative.

419
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,060
As opposed to lowbrow and commemorative.

420
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,820
Lowbrow commemoration!

421
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
'Dave's dead!'
[Laughter]

422
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,140
'Back down t' pit!'

423
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
'We're commemorating this with a giant brass arse!'

424
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,300
Is this something like Fish-Slapping Dance?

425
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,700
ALL: Ohh...

426
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
With a side o' bacon...

427
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,520
Bacon beating!

428
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,060
Brannan, if you'd care to mime with me...

429
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,120
Go on.

430
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,740
Comme ça?
