1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,299
China’s coming to Broadway!

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,609
And by Broadway,

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,749
I mean Bǎilǎohuì.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,320
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,140
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,879
Have you heard of CCTV?

8
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm flattered, but no,

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,539
that’s not Chris Chappell Television.

10
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,769
It’s China Central Television,

11
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,890
the mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,210
Now you might think it’s all boring,

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,859
hamfisted dissemination of Party propaganda
and brainwashing.

14
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,950
You would be wrong.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,610
It also has entertaining,

16
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,540
hamfisted dissemination of Party propaganda
and brainwashing.

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,300
And I’m not just talking about the annual
Spring Festival Gala,

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,730
with comedy sketches about Xi Jinping’s
anti-corruption campaign.

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,760
Haha, gets me every time.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,710
Just like he’ll get you.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,410
CCTV's Spring Festival Gala is a throwback

22
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,370
to the good old days when the whole family
would pool together

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,430
their ration coupons for a New Year's feast

24
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,480
and gather around the village TV.

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,020
Nowadays,

26
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,340
younger Chinese have complained

27
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,880
about the show being hokey propaganda

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,170
that's out of touch with modern China.

29
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,530
I'm not sure what they mean.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,560
What’s more festive than opening your five-and-a-half-hour
show

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,369
with the nation's armed forces

32
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:25,490
yelling New Year's greetings in your face?

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,609
Anyway, in recent years,

34
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,300
CCTV has tried to mix it up,

35
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,759
like with this talent show called

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,490
"I Want to go to the Spring Gala."

37
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,350
Where the lucky winners get to...

38
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,579
go to the Spring Gala.

39
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,880
And perform, I'm assuming.

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,100
Frankly, their version of Simon Cowell looks
much scarier.

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,560
Let's take a look at what this show has to
offer.

42
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,460
Ah, yes.

43
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,670
Nothing says fun like a state-run power company

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,079
singing a song about the great electrical
production capacity

45
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,179
in the remote western regions of Tibet

46
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:01,539
brought to the people by the careful guidance
and oversight

47
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,829
of the Chinese Communist Party

48
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,409
in order to help China's rise in the world!

49
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,940
Yes...clap, for you must.

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,750
The song is called Electricity is Coming.

51
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,250
This is my favorite lyric:

52
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,470
Electricity is coming.

53
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,360
You can turn on the lights now.

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,780
You can turn on the TV

55
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,470
to see what is happening in the outside world.

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,160
Riiiight.

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,430
Classic edu-tainment.

58
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,430
Of course in China,

59
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,780
they call it re-edu-tainment!

60
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,920
And guess what?

61
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,580
The State Grid Sichuan Electric Power Corporation
did so well,

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,210
they won the prize for most innovative performance.

63
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,530
And the prize is a millio...wait.

64
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,280
It appears to be laundry detergent.

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,920
Almost as good a prize as what the

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,930
Shiqiaotou Town Middle School in Zhejiang
Province

67
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,050
gave its top 45 students: bags of pork.

68
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,350
Way to bring home the bacon, kids.

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,660
But back to the State Grid Sichuan Electric
Power Corporation.

70
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,080
I mean, where do they get the inspiration

71
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,160
to come up with such an innovative song and dance?

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,140
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

73
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,860
Yes, I know you’ve taped every Tony Award
since 1997.

74
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,140
The one from 2012?

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,060
Ok, let’s take a look.

76
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,720
Hello! Hello! My name is Elder Smith!

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,220
And can I leave this book with you

78
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,140
for you to just peruse?

79
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,540
Hello! Hello! Hello!

80
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,080
Oh my gosh!

81
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,900
The Book of Mormon totally ripped off

82
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,920
State Grid Sichuan Electric Power Corporation!

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,360
What? It’s the other way around?

84
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,710
That makes more sense, actually.

85
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,270
So a song that was about religious believers

86
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,970
bringing light to the masses in the form of
Jesus Christ

87
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,750
is now about the state bringing light to the
masses

88
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,510
in the form of China's rise.

89
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,250
I feel like there's a comparative literature
thesis

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,210
in there somewhere.

91
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,010
When Chinese netizens spotted them uh, homage

92
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,180
to Book of Mormon,

93
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,710
there was a bit of a kerfluffle.

94
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,570
Including mysterious busy signals.

95
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,040
And an internal investigation within the power
company

96
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,190
that found that they should have called the
"composer" of the piece,

97
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,520
just the "arranger" instead.

98
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,960
Oops.

99
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,040
We reached out to Trey Parker and Matt Stone,

100
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,900
the creators of the Book of Mormon,

101
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,340
for their reaction.

102
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,560
Their spokesman had this to say:

103
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,699
Screw you guys, I’m going home.

104
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,830
That's a good attitude to have.

105
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,330
You know,

106
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,820
a lot of countries make knockoffs.

107
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,830
But in China,

108
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,289
it’s more than just the occasional Borio
cookie

109
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,090
or fishy t-shirt sold at a night market.

110
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,319
The Chinese Communist Party is actually supporting

111
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,689
the culture of knockoffs—

112
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,210
including when it hurts Americans.

113
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,680
Like in 2015,

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,759
when China’s highest court ruled against
Michael Jordan,

115
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,250
in favor of the homegrown company Qiaodan
that,

116
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,379
legally speaking,

117
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:55,090
did not rip off his logo.

118
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,219
But maybe we shouldn’t get too upset.

119
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:58,219
After all,

120
00:04:58,219 --> 00:05:01,600
copyright infringement is the sincerest form
of flattery.

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
With that in mind,

122
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,830
I'm working on a series of new acts

123
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,669
that are sure to make it into next year's
CCTV Spring Festival Gala.

124
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,539
Like this ode to the PLA called

125
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:15,020
"I'm not throwing away my shot."

126
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,780
And my own arrangement of

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,419
"I dreamed a China dream."

128
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,930
I knew I'd get to use my Master's degree for something.

129
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,020
But maybe CCTV is going at this all wrong.

130
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,360
Instead of ripping off degenerate American
culture,

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,569
maybe it's time to go back to their roots—

132
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,620
what made the Spring Festival Gala beloved
in the first place.

133
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,960
Like this gem from 1987:

134
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,939
Now that's some all-original,

135
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,090
homegrown talent.

136
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,580
What's that, Shelley?

137
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,199
This guy is Taiwanese-American?!

138
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,039
So what do you think of the Chinese knock
off

139
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,650
of the Book of Mormon by the State Grid Sichuan

140
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,930
Electric Power Corporation?

141
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,889
Leave your comments below.

142
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,090
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

143
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,370
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

144
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,370
See you next time!

145
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,240
Wait a minute.

146
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,380
Book of Mormon and State Grid Sichuan Electric
Power Corporation

147
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,540
they were both just ripping off Go West!
