1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,500
For 20 long years.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,720
It’s changed China in unexpected ways.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,000
What is the true impact...

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,220
Of the Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown
on Falun Gong?

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,540
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,740
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,380
July 20, 2019 will mark the 20th anniversary
of the Chinese Communist Party’s

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,180
brutal and deadly persecution of Falun Gong.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,079
And if you’re shopping for a gift, the traditional
20th anniversary present is...China.

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,850
Which is perfect, because the Communist Party
has just about broken their China.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,920
In 1999, the Communist Party declared it illegal
to practice Falun Gong.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,969
Falun Gong is a spiritual discipline that
draws on traditional Chinese values

13
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,109
and teaches people to be tolerant, honest,
and compassionate.

14
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:55,089
But if you’re a *certain type* of Chinese
leader,

15
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,299
you see everything as a threat to your power.

16
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,440
Even compassion.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Especially compassion.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,549
That’s why in the 1990s,

19
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,869
Chinese leader and hypnotoad Jiang Zemin

20
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,979
set in motion a terrifying campaign of persecution
that

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:14,610
has directly victimized tens of millions of
Falun Gong practitioners in China.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,289
That campaign includes mass incarceration
without trial,

23
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:21,310
torture, and state-sanctioned killing.

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,759
But even for people who don’t practice Falun
Gong,

25
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,920
or don’t particularly care about Falun Gong,

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,460
or can’t imagine why someone would just
sit there with their eyes closed for like

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,719
two hours—

28
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,049
the *persecution* of Falun Gong matters.

29
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,520
Over the last 20 years, it’s had a profound
impact on many other things in China—

30
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,229
from the way policing is done,

31
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,680
to how other citizens are treated under the
law,

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,890
to the mass surveillance and labor camp system.

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,310
It indirectly affects all people in China.

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,329
So to really understand what China is like
today under Communist Party rule,

35
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,400
you need to understand what they did to Falun
Gong.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,280
That’s why in today's episode,

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,259
we look at 5 ways the persecution of Falun
Gong changed China—

38
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,490
for the worse.

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,030
Number 5: Strengthening the Tools of Repression

40
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,099
You know, it’s not easy persecuting 100
million people.

41
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:18,360
To carry it out, Jiang Zemin had to drastically
beef up China’s domestic security apparatus.

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,480
In addition to the normal police force,

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,379
he set up a Gestapo-like secret police called
the 610 Office.

44
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,120
According to the Congressional-Executive Commission
on China,

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,040
The 610 Office “was charged with the mission
of enforcing a ban on Falun Gong

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,180
and carrying out a crackdown against its practitioners.”

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,120
The 610 Office did everything:

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,159
From the boring things, like mass surveillance;

49
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,730
to the exciting things, like rounding up elderly
people

50
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,360
and torturing them to death in reeducation
camps.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,860
That’s a job where you really don’t want
to bring work home with you.

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,390
And the budget for these actions grew and
grew.

53
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,909
Along with the 610 Office,

54
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:00,870
the Communist Party also expanded the police
and other types of internal security.

55
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,819
After all, it takes a lot of teamwork to crush
the spirit of the people.

56
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,260
From almost nothing in the 1990s—

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:14,019
by 2017, the Chinese regime was spending $180
billion US dollars on internal security.

58
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,769
Which is a lot—especially considering they
only spent $152 billion on external defense,

59
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,329
including the army, navy, etc.

60
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,709
It’s almost as if the Party thinks the real
enemy isn’t the United States,

61
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,719
but a billion angry Chinese citizens.

62
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,470
But the Party didn’t just expand domestic
security.

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,530
No, if you’re going to persecute 100 million
people,

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,280
all of the worst parts of the Communist Party
system need to be involved.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,230
“The persecution of Falun Gong had a profound
effect on the party apparatus.

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,650
It really strengthened the parts of the party
apparatus that were more aggressive,

67
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,650
more repressive.

68
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,439
It expanded the labor camp system.

69
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,090
It created more pressure on judges from party
committees behind the scenes.

70
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,060
It strengthened the propaganda dimensions
of Chinese state media

71
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,060
and it gave a set of resources and money to,
again,

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,719
the most repressive parts of the party apparatus.

73
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,349
And this was at a time that a lot of people

74
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,489
thought that maybe the party was shifting
gears,

75
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:14,680
that there was a loosening.

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,050
There was talk about closing the labor camp
system and things like that.

77
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,950
Launching the campaign against Falun Gong
really reversed that.

78
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,950
”

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,110
The 610 Office was technically disbanded last
year,

80
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,970
but that doesn’t mean it’s over.

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,240
The 610 Office’s functions were merged into
other domestic security forces—

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,850
including ones now used in Tibet and Xinjiang.

83
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,480
Bringing their years of expertise to persecuting
even more people.

84
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,050
Number 4: Fueling an Ongoing Power Struggle

85
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,950
You may recall that in 2018, the National
People's Congress

86
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,090
removed the two-term limit for the presidency,

87
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,260
effectively allowing Xi Jinping to remain
president for life.

88
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,840
Or as I call him, presitator.

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,220
Because he’s not quite a president,

90
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,610
but not quite a dictator.

91
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,030
Instead, he’s the best of both worlds.

92
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,460
According to the BBC,

93
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,720
now Xi "has amassed power the likes of which
has not been seen

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,990
since Chairman Mao Zedong."

95
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,220
But Xi’s dictatorial maneuverings have their
roots

96
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,680
partly in the persecution of Falun Gong.

97
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,930
That's because the president for life ploy
is tied to the power struggle

98
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,130
between Xi Jinping and former leader Jiang
Zemin,

99
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,170
the one who really hates Falun Gong.

100
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,570
Jiang had formally relinquished all his titles
by 2005,

101
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,380
but he’s remained at the helm of the so-called
“Shanghai clique”.

102
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,220
That’s one of the two major competing factions
within the Chinese Communist Party.

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,480
The other being Xi Jinping’s faction.

104
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,090
Jiang was initially a weak leader.

105
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,720
He amassed power through the Party apparatuses

106
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,990
he built up through persecuting Falun Gong.

107
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,690
Then, he promoted all his cronies to run them.

108
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,950
So his people were in charge of the military,

109
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,170
domestic security, propaganda, and more.

110
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,700
Even when Jiang retired, his successor Hu
Jintao was almost powerless.

111
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,350
Which is why he always looked like this.

112
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,180
But when Xi Jinping came around,

113
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,540
Jiang’s people weren’t happy.

114
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,550
They don’t dare let all their crimes come
to light:

115
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,520
torture, murder, and worse—yes, it gets
worse.

116
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,620
So their struggle against Xi Jinping is aimed
at protecting that.

117
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,160
“Since taking office in 2012,

118
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,480
Xi has been engaging in a life-and-death contest

119
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,080
with Jiang Zemin's influential political faction.”

120
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,020
Part of that contest were Xi’s so-called
“revenge purges.”

121
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,210
Also known as his anti-corruption campaign.

122
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,810
These involved taking charge of the military,

123
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,810
disbanding the 610 Office,

124
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,660
and arresting Jiang Zemin’s closest associates

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,210
and locking them up for a long long time.

126
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,610
But to do those things, Xi Jinping had to
first amass power for himself.

127
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,360
That’s the only way to undo Jiang’s death
grip on the system.

128
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,820
Or maybe he would have done it anyway.

129
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,850
President for life does have a nice ring to
it.

130
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,020
Number 3: Setting the Stage Persecuting Uighurs

131
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,160
The persecution of Falun Gong primed the Chinese
regime

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,590
for its persecution of the Uighurs in China's
northern Xinjiang region.

133
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,720
Not to say that Uighurs weren’t targeted
before.

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,110
But after 20 years’ experience going after
Falun Gong—

135
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,110
mass surveillance,

136
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,110
locking people up,

137
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,780
throwing them in political reeducation camps—

138
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,530
the Communist Party got really good at persecuting
people.

139
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,990
Practice makes perfect.

140
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,870
The UN estimates that around one million Muslims

141
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,030
have been detained in re-education camps in
Xinjiang.

142
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,520
The anti-Falun Gong crackdown

143
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,850
“may have very well been the training model

144
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,900
for what is now taking place in Xinjiang,

145
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,870
where the Party has designated the practice
of Islam by Uighurs

146
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,210
as an extremist threat to regime

147
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,160
that must be extinguished by the forcible
reform

148
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,780
of the thinking of each individual Uighur.”

149
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,210
Falun Gong’s belief system, of course, is
completely different from Islam.

150
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,300
But the Communist Party’s “solution”
is the same:

151
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,810
Torture and brainwash people,

152
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,020
until they see how great the Communist Party
is.

153
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,330
The persecution against Falun Gong is two-pronged.

154
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,430
First, vilify the practice ideologically,

155
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,720
then destroy its practitioners physically.

156
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,940
That's exactly the same pattern taking place
right now in Xinjiang:

157
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,850
“The legitimacy of their beliefs are both
ridiculed and denigrated,

158
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,410
and the population is attacked as a dangerous
threat to society in need of harsh reform.”

159
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,650
And not only are the methods the same,

160
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,050
some of the same Party officials are in charge.

161
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,779
And the fact that they have 20 years of experience

162
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,469
“helps explain how they have managed to
launch

163
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,279
and implement such a massive campaign

164
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,680
within such a short time frame.”

165
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,310
Gotta learn from the best...at being the worst.

166
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,920
Number 2: Starting a Global Hacking Campaign

167
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
China's state-backed hacking of other countries
cyber-infrastructure

168
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
is a well-documented threat.

169
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,661
“As evidenced by this investigation,

170
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:58,839
the threats we face have never been more severe

171
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,980
or more pervasive or more potentially damaging
to our national security,

172
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,600
and no country poses a broader, more severe,

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,290
long term threat to our nation’s economy
and cyber infrastructure than China.”

174
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,970
But what's less well known is that China's
hacking program

175
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,880
got off the ground targeting overseas Falun
Gong websites.

176
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,110
See, one of the challenges with persecuting
millions of innocent people

177
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,120
is that you also have to keep them quiet.

178
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,100
But Falun Gong practitioners in the US, Canada,

179
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,620
and other free countries began to set up websites
like Minghui.org.

180
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,529
They publicly exposed as much of the torture
and killing as they could document.

181
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:43,149
It was a serious PR problem for the Communist
Party!

182
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,870
According to this report by the RAND corporation,

183
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,670
when the Communist Party started going after
Falun Gong in 1999,

184
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,810
and Falun Gong practitioners tried to peacefully
appeal,

185
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,660
the Party attacked pro-Falun Gong websites
around the world.

186
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,730
“Party bosses responded..by ordering the
arrest

187
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,860
and prosecution of Falungong leaders and members

188
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,230
and the blocking of access to the group’s
international constellation of web sites.”

189
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,570
Think about it.

190
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,649
If you’re trying to slander a group through
lies and propaganda,

191
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,009
and that group publishes information that
tears apart your lies,

192
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,689
you really have no choice but to silence them.

193
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:20,339
The RAND report documents a whole bunch of
these cyber attacks

194
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,819
in the early years of the persecution.

195
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:26,779
Attacks that were directly traced back to
the address of the Public Security Bureau

196
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,370
in Beijing.

197
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,100
Fast forward a few years,

198
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,699
and all thanks to all those years of practice
hacking dissidents,

199
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,189
China's hackers have been able to take the
training wheels off.

200
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:43,269
Now they’re pulling off “mass-scale espionage”
attacks on global cellular networks.

201
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:48,199
Chinese hackers hit 27 universities to steal
military secrets.

202
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:52,899
And Chinese hackers even hacked the NSA and
stole their hacking tools,

203
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:55,680
and used them for...more hacking!

204
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
And finally...

205
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,870
Number 1: Killing People for Their Organs

206
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,279
The Chinese Communist Party’s persecution
of Falun Gong made widespread

207
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,430
the heinous practice of killing prisoners
of conscience for their organs.

208
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,660
Recently, an international tribunal found
there was clear evidence

209
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,550
that it’s been taking place for decades.

210
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,810
“We the tribunal members are all certain,

211
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,720
unanimously and sure beyond reasonable doubt

212
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,370
that in China forced organ harvesting from
prisoners of conscience

213
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,850
has been practiced for a substantial period
of time

214
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,470
involving a very substantial number of victims.”

215
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,480
Falun Gong practitioners are not the first
victims of forced organ harvesting,

216
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,579
but they are “probably the principal source”.

217
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:49,410
Over the last 20 years, millions of Falun
Gong practitioners

218
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,009
in the vast network of detention centers across
China

219
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:57,199
have served as a kind of living storage bank
for organs.

220
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,889
And that’s allowed Chinese state-run hospitals

221
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,170
to improve their transplant skills and technology.

222
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,709
Currently, an estimated 60,000 or more illegal
organ transplants

223
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,399
are carried out each year.

224
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,199
I mean, sometimes rich Party cadres just need
a new heart.

225
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,199
Or liver.

226
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,420
Or kidneys.

227
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,309
And with forced organ harvesting,

228
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:19,930
the persecution of Falun Gong seems to be
a blueprint

229
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,010
for the treatment of other dissidents.

230
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,740
“When you look at what's happening in Xinjiang
on that background

231
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,089
and some of those circumstances it's really
scary.

232
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,089
It's really scary.

233
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:31,350
Because they’ve got a massive bio data.

234
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,100
Basically what they do in China is they reverse
match organ transplants.

235
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,680
People get organ transplants within a week,
within a month.

236
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,899
They reverse match them to people in custody
and that they otherwise have access to.

237
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,120
I think it breaks down across a variety of
different populations.

238
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,130
I think from that perspective,

239
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,540
it's maybe a genocide, it's maybe pre-genocidal.”

240
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,500
So those are just some of the ways that the
Chinese Communist Party’s

241
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,080
persecution of Falun Gong has changed China
over the last 20 years.

242
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,610
Which makes it incredible that so few people
pay attention to it.

243
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,809
I mean, I get it.

244
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,360
20 years is a long time.

245
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,569
20 years ago, there was no YouTube.

246
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:05,120
20 years ago you could rent the Matrix on
a VHS tape from Blockbuster Video.

247
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,350
Hold on, my youth is flashing before my eyes.

248
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,079
The point is, whether it’s the persecution
of the Uighurs,

249
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,399
or Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign,

250
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,850
or a whole slew of other things—

251
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,180
there’s a lot that’s happening in China
right now

252
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,360
that you can’t really understand if you
don’t look at

253
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
the Communist Party’s treatment of Falun
Gong.

254
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,449
And it may have started 20 years ago,

255
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:27,379
but it’s still going on now.

256
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,360
So what do you think about all the ways

257
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,709
the persecution of Falun Gong has changed
China?

258
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,720
Leave your comments below.

259
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,490
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from you,

260
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,110
one of my loyal members of the 50-Cent Army.

261
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,110
Sell asks:

262
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,589
“At what point would the U.S./U.N. get involved

263
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,769
to help protect the 1 party 2 systems?

264
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,920
With the tensions surrounding the trade war
and North Korea,

265
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,060
what responses could be on the table if China
continues to press the issue?”

266
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,800
Good question, Sell.

267
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,999
At what point would the US or UN get involved
if the Chinese Communist Party

268
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,360
erodes Hong Kong’s One Country, Two Systems?

269
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,999
That sad answer is: at no point.

270
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,240
Since Hong Kong is officially part of the
People’s Republic of China,

271
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,509
that makes it China’s internal affair.

272
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,319
There’s nothing the United Nations has the
power to do—

273
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,939
especially since China sits on the UN Security
Council

274
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:22,589
and can veto pretty much anything.

275
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,059
Likewise, the US would not go to war to protect
Hong Kong,

276
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,819
since the US has no defense treaty with Hong
Kong.

277
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:33,850
Hong Kong’s best foreign ally *should* be
the UK,

278
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,970
since the UK signed the Sino-British Joint
Declaration,

279
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,089
which is an official treaty—

280
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,100
except the UK has shown it won’t do anything
beyond issuing

281
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,630
toothless statements condemning the erosion
of freedoms, yada yada yada.

282
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,930
The best hope for Hong Kong is...

283
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,889
the people of Hong Kong.

284
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,809
And boy, do they know how to protest!

285
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,620
