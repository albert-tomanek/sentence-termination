1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,170
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,460
now you can watch Chinese propaganda

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,140
from the comfort of your living room.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,920
Hi welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,849
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,029
If I say, “In West Philadelphia,”

7
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,249
♫ ♫

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,220
and you just thought “born and raised,”

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,420
then you’re old enough to have watched,

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,520
and loved,

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,180
broadcast television.

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,390
Now maybe these days you get your favorite
shows on Netflix.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,810
Or YouTube.

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,480
But you still rely on cable TV in a lot of
ways.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,820
Cable gives you live sports,

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,159
like LeBron James crying on the floor of the
Oakland arena.

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,339
Live events,

18
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:44,179
like Leo pretending not to cry at the Oscars.

19
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,159
And, let's not forget, Saturday afternoon
marathons

20
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,480
of '80s classic Teen Witch,

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,899
which made us all cry

22
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,019
with embarrassment.

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,460
"Look at how FUNKY he is!"

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,560
"I'm hot!

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,711
And you're not!

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,340
But if you want to hang with me,

27
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,900
I'll give it one shot.

28
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,780
Top that!

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,160
Top that!"

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,200
Top that, indeed.

31
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,620
And of course,

32
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,600
your internet is probably part of your cable
TV package

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,360
with a company like Comcast, Time Warner Cable,

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,220
Charter, Cox, Optimum, and so on.

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,560
Millions of Americans still get most of their

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,390
news and information from cable TV.

37
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,200
Which can be great or terrifying,

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,430
depending on what they’re watching.

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,970
And this is amplified for the 4 to 8 million
Chinese people in the US.

40
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,359
Because most of the Chinese language TV channels

41
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,670
they get on cable are controlled by the Chinese
Communist Party.

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,979
Every major cable company in America

43
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,180
carries China Central Television, or CCTV.

44
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,000
That’s the Communist Party’s main television
mouthpiece.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
With news stories like this:

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,760
“Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang
said at today's press conference that

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,640
the United States' human rights report about
China is absurd and laughable.

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,980
He urges the US to stop becoming the savior
of other countries' human rights.”

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,620
Right, because any criticism of China is inherently
wrong.

50
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,060
And as I’ve told you before,

51
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,979
"The Chinese Communist Party is investing
$8.9 billion

52
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,170
into spreading their censorship overseas."

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,459
Anyway, turn on your cable box right now,

54
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,140
and you’ll see China’s state-run propaganda
on your television.

55
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,370
And CCTV isn’t the only channel with Chinese
propaganda.

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,680
Time Warner Cable is the second-largest cable
provider in the United States.

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,620
Here in New York,

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,890
Time Warner Cable has 17 Chinese language
channels in its lineup.

59
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,440
16 of them are either directly run by the
Chinese Communist Party,

60
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,860
or run by someone with strong ties to the
Party,

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,530
or whose programming is influenced by the
Party in various ways.

62
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,050
And only 1 of them is totally independent.

63
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,270
That independent network is New Tang Dynasty
Television, or NTD.

64
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,099
NTD has a 24-hour channel.

65
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,510
It’s number 1414 in New York.

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,959
NTD is extremely dangerous…

67
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,129
in part because of its support for subversive
programming,

68
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,180
like China Uncensored.

69
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
As I’ve told you before,

70
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,769
my show is sponsored in part by NTD, and I
use their studio.

71
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,869
Of course, the vast majority of NTD’s programs
are in Chinese.

72
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:20,570
And who’s behind this dangerous nonprofit
organization?

73
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,140
Chinese Americans—who want to provide truthful
news.

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,080
Most of NTD’s founders were Tiananmen Square
survivors,

75
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,260
Falun Gong practitioners, or others who felt
that

76
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,840
maybe the Chinese Communist Party isn’t
the most reliable source for information.

77
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,160
Some people have called NTD the “Freedom
Channel.”

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,671
Others have called it “undermining China.”

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,970
In the sense that freedom undermines China,

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,530
they’re both right.

81
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,549
That’s especially the case because,

82
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,890
in addition to being on cable in the US,

83
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,079
NTD also broadcasts directly into China via
satellite,

84
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,280
where millions of people

85
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
including Chinese officials

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,180
have to pretend they don’t watch it.

87
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,740
Because—like Twitter, Facebook, and Björk—

88
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,060
NTD is banned in China.

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,820
But of course, the opposite is true in
the US.

90
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,180
Because while of course an American TV network
like NTD

91
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,829
is free to broadcast here,

92
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,301
state-run propaganda outlets like CCTV are,
too.

93
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,730
This is America.

94
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,790
Freedom of the Press.

95
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,700
And that’s why I don’t want to criticize
Time Warner Cable

96
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,580
for including CCTV in its lineup.

97
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,200
Allowing for alternative views is part of
what America is all about.

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,580
It just might be healthier if there were more
options than CCTV's alternative view.

99
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,830
For example, after the September 11 terrorist
attacks,

100
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,010
CCTV and Beijing Television broadcast a documentary
called “Attack America.”

101
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,290
It said, “This is the America the whole
world has wanted to see.

102
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,330
Blood debts have been repaid in blood.”

103
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,740
And that’s why we should all be concerned
that Time Warner Cable

104
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,460
is considering dropping the independent New
Tang Dynasty Television

105
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,419
from its channel lineup.

106
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,800
Time Warner has carried NTD in New York City
for more than 10 years.

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,139
But the current contract expires on June 30
(2016).

108
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,060
NTD wants a new contract,

109
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,120
but the leaders of Time Warner haven’t agreed
yet.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
If they drop NTD,

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,509
they would be dropping the only free voice
of the Chinese people,

112
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,699
and it will disappear from 3 million homes

113
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,750
in New York, Los Angeles and Hawaii.

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,020
And that’s why NTD needs your help.

115
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,180
That’s right, you, my 50-Cent Army!

116
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,500
I want you to call Time Warner Cable

117
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,449
at this number on screen (212-364-8300).

118
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,039
Actually call them.

119
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,449
You should be able to connect to a human within
a few minutes,

120
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,389
at least during business hours.

121
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,909
Tell them that you heard Time Warner

122
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,130
wants to drop New Tang Dynasty TV in New York,

123
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,290
which is channel 1414.

124
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,109
Tell them it’s an important channel, and
to keep it.

125
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:51,971
And make sure they pass the message on to
management.

126
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,780
If you can’t call for any reason,

127
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,990
you can fill out the "Request a Channel" form
online.

128
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,130
The link is in the Description below.

129
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,789
Enter your name, email, and phone number.

130
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,830
For “Enter Channel” put “New Tang Dynasty
TV.”

131
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,250
Then leave your request.

132
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,490
Write it in your own words,

133
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,330
or modify the sample text in the Description
below.

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,310
Do it right now if you can.

135
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,889
The sooner the better.

136
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,989
You can feel good about calling a cable company
for once.

137
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,599
And you won't even have to wait at home

138
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,130
between the hours of 10 am and 2 pm.

139
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,979
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

140
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,119
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time.

141
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,200
Why are you still watching?

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,640

Check the Description below.

144
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,330
