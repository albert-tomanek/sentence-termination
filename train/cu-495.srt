00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,500
Chris Chappell here.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,030
On this episode of China Uncensored,

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,380
I thought I'd get out of New York City.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,860
Come down to Washington DC, the nation's capitol,

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,600
For one.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,900
Very.

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,200
Important reason.

8
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,640
Another thing happening in DC today:

9
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,460
A rally marking 17 years since the Chinese
Communist Party

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,490
began its brutal persecution of the Falun
Gong

11
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,409
a popular meditation practice.

12
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,380
But like most people in the country right now,

13
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,920
I’m finding it hard to stay focused when...

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,630
OH MAN IS THAT A PIKACHU?!

15
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,659
But 20 minutes later,

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,600
my phone was almost out of battery,

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,460
so I decided to do the next best thing

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,039
check out this rally.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,260
The house of representatives has formally
recognized

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:36,420
the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners
by the Communist Chinese regime.

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,319
We have sent a message loud and clear

22
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,619
to the Chinese Communist Party

23
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,649
that we call on China to immediately stop

24
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:55,369
its inhumane and unethical practice of organ
harvesting.

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,979
So, it’s been a big year for Falun Gong.

26
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,999
After a decade knowing that practitioners
in China

27
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:04,850
were being killed en masse for their organs,

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,950
people are finally talking about it.

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,400
What do you think of the organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners?

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,560
I had no idea until I talked to one of the gentlemen with it earlier.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,900
I had never heard of Falun Dafa in my life.

32
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,820
I didn't know this was going on in China.

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,480
So this has been like a real education thing, so I want to check out.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,040
This is what happens when people aren’t
watching enough China Uncensored.

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,010
But even if it isn’t common knowledge,

36
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,879
the tide is changing.

37
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,780
Earlier this year,

38
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,040
a documentary about organ harvesting, Human
Harvest,

39
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,390
wins a prestigious Peabody Award.

40
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,010
Then, The US House of Representatives

41
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,349
passes a resolution condemning organ harvesting.

42
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,220
Then, this report comes out.

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,000
It contains 680 pages of evidence that the
Chinese regime

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,930
has been murdering prisoners of conscience
for their organs.

45
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,180
Maybe even more than a million.

46
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,360
And inside China,

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,400
things have been changing as well.

48
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,750
Because with all this international attention,

49
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,670
guess who doesn’t wanted to be blamed for
persecuting Falun Gong?

50
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,189
Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

51
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,629
And Xi’s whole anti-corruption campaign
right now

52
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,909
just happens to be targeting his political
rivals,

53
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:14,909
who just happen to be the people

54
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,439
who followed former Chinese leader and mummified
toad,

55
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,519
Jiang Zemin to persecute Falun Gong.

56
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,530
So it’s convenient that China’s organ
transplant official

57
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,329
called out Jiang’s former right hand man,

58
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:30,780
and live-action Thwomp, Zhou Yongkang,

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,030
as the “big tiger” responsible for organ
harvesting from prisoners.

60
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,209
Which of course makes Xi’s people look blameless.

61
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,030
And Xi’s anti-corruption campaign

62
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,060
has already arrested a huge number of officials,

63
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,390
including more than 150 with the rank of vice-minister
or higher,

64
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,420
many with ties to Jiang Zemin.

65
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,400
Most recently, reports say that Jiang’s
son has been put under house arrest.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,900
And it looks like China’s propaganda chief,

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,079
who is Jiang’s highest ally still in power,

68
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,939
may be targeted next.

69
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,930
And Xi’s anti-corruption investigators just
announced

70
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,590
they were looking into the 610 Office,

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,090
the organization that Jiang created to persecute
Falun Gong.

72
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,449
It seems like Xi Jinping is truly out, to
catch ‘em all.

73
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,369
Do you think if you made,

74
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:24,589
held this rally at a Pokemon gym,

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,860
that a lot of people would show up.

76
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,240
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,600
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you next time.
