1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,330
Pepe the Frog in Hong Kong?

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,299
The chosen one appears

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,610
And Social Media actually stands up to China

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,380
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,240
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,409
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:24,689
Hong Kong has been in the midst of two months
of nonstop protests.

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,779
1.7 million people took the streets last Sunday.

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,561
They’ve been protesting an extradition bill
that would allow

11
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:34,500
Hong Kong authorities to send people to mainland
China for trial.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,930
The people of Hong Kong say they’re fighting
for their freedom.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,830
China calls it a color revolution backed by
the US.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,300
The truth?

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,850
Hong Kong protesters are a bunch of white
supremacists!

16
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,320
Yes, that’s Pepe the Frog.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,910
As the New York Times says,

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,850
“Pepe the Frog is a hate symbol,

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,690
a cheerleader of racism and anti-Semitism,

20
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,930
a friend of alt-right extremists.”

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,850
Yes...clearly that describes the Hong Kong
protesters

22
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,739
that have adopted him.

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,160
Some even spray painting him around the city.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,760
There’s even a Hong Kong Pepe themed sticker
pack for Whatsapp.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,070
So are the Hong Kong protesters a bunch of
Nazi white supremicists?

26
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,310
Um...no.

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,190
It turns out that Pepe symbolizes

28
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,260
something else to Hong Kongers.

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,400
One protester said,

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,479
“It just looks funny and captures the hearts
of so many youngsters.

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,870
It is a symbol of youth participation in this
movement.”

32
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,299
Or my personal favorite,

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,710
the protester who said,

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,340
“To me, Pepe is just a Hello Kitty-like
character,”

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Hello Pepe!

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,450
Yes, that image will haunt your dreams.

37
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,430
Just like Pepe the Pooh.

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,030
You’re welcome.

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,840
But in some ways, perhaps Hong Kongers

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,021
have the purest understanding of Pepe.

41
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:50,479
Pepe was created more than a decade ago—

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,020
long before he was adopted by the alt-right
on 4chan.

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,920
And as Pepe’s creator says,

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,500
“In the end, Pepe is whatever you say he
is,

45
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,330
and I, the creator, say that Pepe is love.”

46
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,840
Pepe is love.

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,331
An employee of the British consulate in Hong
Kong

48
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:11,170
has been detained in mainland China.

49
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,140
Simon Cheng traveled to Shenzhen on business
for the consulate

50
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,830
where he was picked up for...well,

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,020
at first no one knew,

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,900
because the police refused to say why Cheng
was in detention.

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,920
But then they told my favorite state-run media
the Global Times

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,300
that they detained Cheng for soliciting a
prostitute in Shenzhen.

55
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,380
To which everyone said, suuuuuuure.

56
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,610
Yeeeeaaaaah.

57
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,590
Especially concerning was that fact that Cheng

58
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,410
was apparently detained after he already left
Shenzhen

59
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,150
and was on his way back to Hong Kong on the
high-speed rail.

60
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,069
That means he was most likely detained by
Chinese police

61
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,310
while he was already in Hong Kong at the West
Kowloon Rail Station.

62
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,580
Last year, Hong Kong and mainland Chinese
authorities

63
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,920
struck a deal to put part of the train station
under Chinese law,

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,739
instead of Hong Kong law.

65
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,880
At the time, people were worried about Chinese
law

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,190
being implemented on Hong Kong soil,

67
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,930
but as this case clearly shows,

68
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,870
they had absolutely nothing to worry about,

69
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,020
everything’s fine.

70
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,860
In fact, Cheng’s mysterious detention

71
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,420
will probably make Hongkongers even more enthusiastic

72
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,270
and reassured about the extradition bill to
China.

73
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,900
Everything is fine.

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,470
And since Simon Cheng was an employee of the
UK consulate,

75
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,790
obviously the UK is up in arms.

76
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,790
And by that, I mean

77
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,420
they apologized profusely to the Chinese government

78
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,709
for the inconvenience,

79
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,300
before retiring for afternoon tea.

80
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,239
Meanwhile, US Vice President Mike Pence

81
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,820
says Beijing needs to honor the treaty they
made with the UK r

82
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,180
egarding Hong Kong,

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,340
or else people might think China won’t honor
any deal.

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,360
Well, someone who worked on that deal for
China

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,270
had this to say on the UK’s Channel 4 news.

86
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,860
“Let me get this clear then,

87
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,560
the joint declaration is dead.

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Correct?”

89
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,459
“No the joint declaration terminated

90
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:06,860
when the British government handed sovereignty
back to China

91
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,090
midnight June 30th, 1997.”

92
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,840
Which shows you just how difficult

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,040
a lasting trade deal with China will be.

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,760
Only a very special person would be able to
do it.

95
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,590
Well, here’s US President Donald Trump talking
to reporters

96
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,370
about the Trade War and standing up to the
Chinese regime.

97
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,750
“Somebody had to do it, I am the chosen
one.”

98
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,750
Surprised?

99
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,120
Well actually, this was prophesied back in
2014.

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,000
“You are the most talented,

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,040
most interesting and extraordinary person
in the universe.

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,720
And you are capable of amazing things,

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,139
because you are the Special.”

104
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,340
Yes, I’m saying that Donald Trump is President
Business.

105
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,620
Think about it.

106
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,700
“We got a hugger.”

107
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,500
Maybe.

108
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,650
In China’s often-forgotten special administrative
region—

109
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,650
Macau—

110
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,979
things aren’t going so well.

111
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,660
It’s time to vote for a new leader!

112
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,770
But don’t worry;

113
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,130
you won’t have to sit through endless campaigning

114
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,320
that drags on for two years.

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Because in Macau,

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,169
there is only one candidate: Ho Iat Seng.

117
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,290
He’s the only person the Communist Party
approved to run.

118
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,790
He’s “a Beijing-backed former legislator

119
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,000
who is expected to cement China’s control

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,870
over the special administrative region

121
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,800
and distance it from escalating protests in
neighboring Hong Kong.”

122
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,139
Democracy in Macau is so much more harmonious
than in Hong Kong.

123
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:48,700
But some people are still standing up to the
Chinese Communist Party.

124
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,210
Like the mayor of Prague.

125
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,600
He’s been fighting against Beijing’s influence
in his city.

126
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,449
“He reinstituted the practice of flying

127
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:57,259
the Tibetan flag from city hall.”

128
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,300
“He allowed an exhibition on city property

129
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,510
commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.”

130
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,380
“He hosted the leader of Tibet’s exiled
government

131
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,810
and made an official visit to the Taiwanese
capital, Taipei.”

132
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,080
“And he has called for Prague to renegotiate

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,979
its 2016 sister-city agreement with Beijing,

134
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,039
removing the acknowledgment of the one-China
principle,

135
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,320
which states that China, Taiwan and Tibet
are a single country

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,460
that should be ruled from Beijing.”

137
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,669
FYI, he’s a member of the Czech Pirate Party.

138
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,509
And speaking of, and I can’t believe I’m
saying this,

139
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,040
Twitter and Facebook have also

140
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,570
stood up to the Chinese Communist Party.

141
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,520
Both social media giants said they discovered
fake accounts

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,539
spreading disinformation about Hong Kong.

143
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,509
Those accounts have been deleted.

144
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,949
YouTube also disabled a bunch of channels

145
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,630
for spreading fake Hong Kong news.

146
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,139
Twitter also said it would block state-controlled
media outlets

147
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,120
from advertising on its site.

148
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,759
If only the New York Times and the Washington
Post

149
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,070
and the Wall Street Journal could hold themselves

150
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,810
to the same journalistic standards as Twitter.

151
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,509
But no, they’re very happy to have Chinese
state-run media

152
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,000
advertise in *their* publications.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,010
The Chinese regime was quick to condemn

154
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,080
Facebook’s and Twitter’s actions,

155
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,660
saying that overseas Chinese have the right
to express their opinions.

156
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,690
And the irony caused the internet to explode.

157
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,569
15 papers from Chinese scientists have been
retracted

158
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,440
because they may have involved involuntary
organ donation.

159
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,120
That is, killing innocent people and harvesting
their organs.

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,450
The Chinese Communist Party was quick to defend
them,

161
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,300
saying it’s fine to murder Chinese people
as long as it’s for science...

162
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,740
or politics, or any other reason.

163
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,830
And then remembered they had meant to

164
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,669
cover the whole thing up.

165
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:45,740
Oops.

166
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,190
What China should defend is the rail lines

167
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,590
of the Belt and Road Initiative.

168
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,729
That’s Chinese leader Xi Jinping's trillion
dollar infrastructure plan

169
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,370
to bring the world a little closer to China.

170
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,530
A big part of that was a massive rail line
connecting China and Europe.

171
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,509
Well, China’s state-run China Railway has
now admitted

172
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,430
that most of the train cars have been empty.

173
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,420
“In one extreme case only one of 41 containers

174
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,180
on a particular train actually carried goods.”

175
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,080
Widespread waste and fraud in a state owned
enterprise

176
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,910
of a communist nation?

177
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,850
I’m shocked.

178
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,850
Shocked!

179
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,710
And finally, in China, love is not always
love.

180
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,479
“China ruled out legalizing same-sex marriage
on Wednesday.

181
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,750
A parliament spokesman said China’s legal
position on marriage

182
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,630
will remain between a man and a woman.”

183
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,659
That is so incredibly hypocritical.

184
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,319
Because the Communist Party once allowed

185
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,800
a human woman to marry a toad.

186
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,910
And remember, Pepe is a frog, not a toad,

187
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,569
so Pepe still gets to be love.

188
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,740
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

189
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,939
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

190
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,620
a fan who support China Uncensored

191
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,620
with a dollar or more per episode,

192
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,999
by contributing through Patreon.

193
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,369
Daniel Ortman asks,

194
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:03,550
“Could [the Trade War] break the CCP?

195
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,989
If so, why didn't we do it before?

196
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:10,119
Well, obviously, we didn’t have the chosen
one before!

197
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:12,019
Or as President Business would put it,

198
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,759
“I do blame past administrations for allowing

199
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:21,600
this out-of-control trade deficit to take
place and to grow.”

200
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,029
But it’s not just “past administrations.”

201
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,119
Because those presidents felt pressure from
the big US companies

202
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,670
that funded their political campaigns.

203
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,709
The China market seemed big and full of gold

204
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:36,329
and a lot of people and businesses thought
they could get a piece of it.

205
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,619
And so for many years, the US leadership

206
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,449
turned a blind eye to all the Chinese intellectual
property theft,

207
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,910
WTO violations,

208
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,069
and currency manipulation.

209
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:47,370
In fact, companies would sometimes

210
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,290
complain to US officials about China,

211
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,630
but then ask them to not say anything,

212
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,029
because they still wanted to do business there.

213
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,620
It eventually got so bad, though,

214
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,339
it couldn’t be ignored.

215
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,769
But even today, companies like Google and
Microsoft

216
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,519
partner with Chinese military universities
on research

217
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,699
that may be used in persecuting Chinese citizens.

218
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,790
Thanks for your question, Daniel.

219
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,920
And if you have a question for me

220
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,899
you want to hear answered on the show,

221
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,439
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

222
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:19,120
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

223
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,089
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

224
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,369
we would have to shut down the show

225
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,399
if it weren’t for your support.

226
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,420
And to everyone,

227
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,579
thanks for watching!

228
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,399
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

229
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,620
See you next time.
