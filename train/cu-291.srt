Thousand of Dead Pigs Found in Shanghai s

Drinking Water Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,
I m your host Chris Chappell. Some people

3
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:17,440
think, China will be free when pigs fly? Well,
how about when 6000 dead pigs go floating

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,140
down the river? Yes, take a look at one of
the biggest cities in the world s second largest

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,320
economy. Thousands of dead pigs have been
washing up along the Huangpu River outside

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,420
of Shanghai. Huangpu is of course Chinese
for yellow poo. Waves of pig corpses have

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,530
been washing up on the waves since late last
week. Okay, sure, it looks like some kind

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,370
of biblical plague. But I mean, it s not like
the rivers of China are turning red, right?

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,370
Now I know what you re thinking, looking at
all this water is sure making me thirsty!

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,940
Can I get a drink of that? Well you can. Since
this is one of Shanghai s major water sources

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,499
of drinking water, some people were a little
concerned. Needless so. Authorities say the

12
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:05,370
water is perfectly safe to drink. Sure it
contains a type of pig virus that Purdue University

13
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,830
researchers discovered has been mutating into
more deadly forms, but it doesn t affect humans.

14
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,820
So it s perfectly fine to drink the water
that 6000 dead pigs have been floating in.

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,230
And they say you can t trust Chinese media.
So where did all these pigs come from? Well,

16
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,640
no one is one hundred percent sure, but they
think that pig farms upstream in Zhejiang's

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,840
Jiaxing City were dumping the corpses of pigs
that died of disease after they were told

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,930
they couldn t sell that meat to the public.
That ll teach authorities not to tell people

19
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,660
what they can and can t sell. So needless
to say, the bloated, diseased, decomposing

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,630
corpses of 6000 pigs is not lending Shanghai
a particularly pleasing smell. But let me

21
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,500
again remind you this is perfectly safe to
drink. You know, I hear there s a new children

22
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,110
s rhyme going around Shanghai these days.
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream,

23
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:03,140
merrily, merrily, merrily, did you hear a
pig scream? So would you ever drink water

24
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,229
that had 6000 dead pigs in it? Email me at
china uncensored at ntdtv dot com and tell

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,360
me what you think. Personally, I would only
drink water that had 100 dead pigs in it,

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,280
