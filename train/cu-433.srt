1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,730
Is China Becoming More Communist?

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,170
Xi Jinping is pushing Marxism

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,620
And all levels of Chinese society have to
follow.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,499
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:16,900
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,090
Have you ever looked at yourself

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,230
in the mirror and thought,

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,800
“Am I really the best Communist I can be?”

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,830
Trick question,

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,839
the great proletarian revolution

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,619
doesn’t need your bourgeois mirrors.

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,589
But that is the question Chinese leader

13
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,829
Xi Jinping is asking.

14
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:33,870
The Chinese Communist Party

15
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,570
is the largest Communist Party in the world,

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,760
with 90 million members.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,070
But every now and then you need

18
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,550
a reminder of what got you there.

19
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,670
Of how incredible Communism is.

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,550
I mean, 100 million people dead in 100 years,

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,040
that’s quite an accomplishment.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
But today in China,

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,500
people just don't seem to have

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,660
the devotion to Marx and Communism

25
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,620
the way they once did.

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,620
For example,

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,080
97 percent of Chinese companies are privately
owned.

28
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,100
China has a third of the world’s billionaires.

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,070
And China’s official state-run trade union

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,150
is set up specifically to make sure workers

31
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,170
don’t collectively bargain.

32
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,900
So it looks like China got a little off the
Marx.

33
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,810
That’s why over the past several years,

34
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,800
Xi Jinping has made a push to get everyone

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
excited about Communism again.

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,700
Assuming they were in the first place.

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,280
Ok, there were definitely times when people

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,750
were a little *too* excited about Communism.

39
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,780
Now, I’m not saying that Xi Jinping

40
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,430
wants another Cultural Revolution.

41
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,790
But it’s hard to be the head of the Communist
Party

42
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,310
when it seems like most people in China

43
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,560
don’t really believe in Communism anymore.

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,900
And what better way to get people back on
your side

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,660
than with a big top-down state directive!

46
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,760
Xi Jinping has been pushing all levels

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,720
of Chinese society to study Marxism.

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,770
Or more specifically,

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,760
socialism with Chinese characteristics.

50
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,799
In a speech marking the Chinese Communist
Party’s

51
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,500
95th anniversary, Xi Jinping said,

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,119
“History tells us the Chinese people’s
choice of

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,060
the Communist Party to lead them

54
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,109
toward the civilization’s great rejuvenation

55
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:15,739
has been correct,

56
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,579
and that the party’s path of socialism

57
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,569
with Chinese characteristics is also correct.”

58
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,569
He also said that

59
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,510
“Marxism must be the basic,

60
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,219
fundamental, guiding principle

61
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,739
or the Party would lose its soul and direction.”

62
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,820
I mean we wouldn’t want

63
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,769
the officially atheist Communist Party

64
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,709
to lose its soul, now would we?

65
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,099
And Xi Jinping is leading by example.

66
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,180
In 2017, a few days after“winning” a second
term

67
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,529
as the General Secretary of the Communist
Party,

68
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,629
Xi and other top Party leaders

69
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,560
headed to Shanghai,

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,169
raising their fists to honor the birthplace

71
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,400
of the Chinese Communist Party and its founders.

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,739
According to Willy Wo-Lap Lam,

73
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,749
an adjunct professor at the Chinese University
of Hong Kong,

74
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:05,959
it was “a reinstatement of the commitment
of the party

75
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,079
in this so-called ‘new era of socialism

76
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,819
with Chinese characteristics’

77
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,819
that they would stick to

78
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:13,799
original values of the founding fathers.

79
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,349
That means definitely no move away

80
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,900
from orthodox Marxism, orthodox Maoism.

81
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,280
No taking up of Western values.”

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,689
I mean, other than the fact that Communism

83
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,920
originally came from the West.

84
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,090
A few months later,

85
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,489
Xi Jinping made some major changes to the
constitution.

86
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,799
First, he added his very own

87
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,999
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism

88
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,819
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era

89
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,680
to both the Communist Party’s constitution,

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,529
and China’s state constitution.

91
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:46,669
Then, he added to the state constitution that

92
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:50,109
“The leadership of the Communist Party of
China

93
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,389
is the defining feature of socialism

94
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,620
with Chinese characteristics.”

95
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,889
This new clause officially gives the Communist
Party

96
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,049
direct control over the Chinese government.

97
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,909
Ok, it definitely already had control over
the government.

98
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,169
But now it’s in the constitution,

99
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,239
which makes it legal.

100
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,569
Think of it like,

101
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,760
China has a government system,

102
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,870
but the Chinese Communist Party’s own system

103
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,079
is a parasite that’s latched onto the government

104
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,590
and controls it from above.

105
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,990
Kind of like the Goa’uld from Stargate.

106
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,729
And now that’s written into law.

107
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,770
And since the Constitution also says

108
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,550
“The socialist system is the basic system

109
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,729
of the People’s Republic of China,”

110
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:34,370
What that really means is that

111
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,449
China is officially a one-party state

112
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,360
led by the Chinese Communist Party,

113
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,940
and anything else is illegal

114
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,509
according to the Constitution.

115
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,700
Glad we got that cleared up.

116
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,569
Xi Jinping is also putting more pressure

117
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:51,840
on China’s 90 million Communist Party members.

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,860
Besides requiring them to be atheists,

119
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,460
“Xi also ordered ‘the broad masses of
party members,

120
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,669
cadres and especially senior cadres to study
well

121
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,590
and apply well [the Communist Manifesto].’”

122
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,970
State-run media has also recently warned them

123
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,919
to stick with Marx and not ghosts and spirits.

124
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,150
“Resolutely prevent not believing in Marx
and Lenin

125
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,500
and believing in ghosts and spirits,

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,919
not believing in the truth and believing in
money.”

127
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,490
Wait. I have no idea what I’m supposed to
do.

128
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,069
Am I supposed to believe in money or not?

129
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:28,189
And does that mean money is a superstition,

130
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,659
like ghosts and spirits?

131
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,860
I’m so confused.

132
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,129
Anyway, it’s not just Party members.

133
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,370
They haven’t forgotten the children either.

134
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,360
“For China’s gen-Xers and millennials,

135
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,699
the Party is in danger of being written off

136
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,409
as just another corrupt old boys’ club.”

137
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,770
Which is why the Party has spared no effort

138
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,569
in trying to make Communism cool again.

139
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,759
Whether it’s a Karl Marx rap.

140
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,780
A Karl Marx talk show

141
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,840
Or a Karl Marx anime!

142
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,780
Yes, absolutely none of these things

143
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,090
are driven by market demand.

144
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,219
Just like Marx would have wanted.

145
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:11,110
Xi has also been stressing ideological education
in school.

146
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,530
“Xi highlighted the guiding position of
Marxism

147
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,120
in ideological and political classes,

148
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,919
saying China’s education should serve the
people,

149
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,439
the Party’s governance

150
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,820
and the development of socialism

151
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,110
with Chinese characteristics.”

152
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,780
And they start ’em young.

153
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,470
“Starting with toddlers,

154
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,020
Xi said China must ‘nurture generation after
generation

155
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,840
[of young people] who support Chinese Communist
Party rule

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,139
and China’s socialist system.’”

157
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,229
So it’s for these reasons you see headlines
like these—

158
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:44,069
suggesting that China’s thriving liberal
democracy

159
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:47,199
was somehow subverted by Xi Jinping.

160
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,099
Except—that’s not really what’s going
on.

161
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,310
Most of these changes are superficial.

162
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,139
Xi Jinping is pushing for people to study
Marxism-Leninism.

163
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,229
But it’s not that he actually wants to return

164
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:03,729
to the days of collective farming and killing
landlords.

165
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:04,729
Fun times—

166
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:06,050
but those days are over.

167
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,749
See, there’s a lot more to communism

168
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:11,030
than redistributing wealth.

169
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,909
The nature of a communist regime

170
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,180
is to control everything in society.

171
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,449
Ever since the Chinese Communist Party

172
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,389
took power in 1949...

173
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,860
...it has controlled every organization;

174
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,150
rewritten history;

175
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,800
manipulated the news;

176
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,460
monitored all levels of society;

177
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,639
stopped people from speaking out;

178
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,490
prevented people from believing in God or
Buddha;

179
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,270
and re-educated or killed people who don’t
agree.

180
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,569
Those things...have not actually changed

181
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,819
since the economic reforms of the late 1970s.

182
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,479
So China is still communist in pretty much
every sense.

183
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,789
What about the economy?

184
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,749
Sure, China no longer has collectivization,

185
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:56,090
where everyone works and lives on communes.

186
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,870
But the state still owns all the land in China,

187
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,979
state-run enterprises control all the major
industries,

188
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,499
and Chinese officials still intervene in the
economy

189
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,219
all the time.

190
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,990
All of these things mean that the state

191
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,690
pretty much still controls the means of production.

192
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,310
Chinese people are allowed to make money now,

193
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,900
but they can only get rich if their company

194
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,159
does what the Party wants.

195
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,159
And that’s why—

196
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,650
even with all the ideology that Xi Jinping
is pushing—

197
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,330
China is not actually becoming *more* communist.

198
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,330
If anything,

199
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,669
it’s just becoming more *visibly* communist,

200
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,800
especially to those of us outside China.

201
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,300
But even if it’s not making China more communist,

202
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,920
why is Xi Jinping pushing Marxist ideology,
anyway?

203
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,700
Well, there are a few possibilities.

204
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,080
One is that Xi is a true believer in communism.

205
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,420
That when he publishes articles

206
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,490
on dialectical materialism,

207
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,970
he actually means it.

208
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,920
Which, I don’t know.

209
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,740
This guy has the kind of poker face

210
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,830
that got him to the top of the Chinese leadership.

211
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,790
Who knows what he’s really thinking?

212
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,070
Maybe it’s “I heart dialectical materialism.”

213
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,150
Another possibility is that Xi’s push for
Marxism

214
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,620
is a way to silence his critics.

215
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,340
Xi has amassed tremendous personal power.

216
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,820
He’s the strongest Chinese leader in a generation.

217
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,910
But right now, if it looked like

218
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,380
he was going to abandon the Party

219
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,400
and really make himself Emperor,

220
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,140
or as I like to say, Presitator,

221
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,110
the Party would tear him apart.

222
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,980
So by cloaking everything he does to gain
power

223
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
in the language of the Party,

224
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,700
Xi makes it harder for other Party officials

225
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,620
to criticize what he’s doing.

226
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,290
“Do you have a problem

227
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,260
with dialectical materialism, Li Keqiang?

228
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,860
Didn’t think so.”

229
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,380
And a third possibility is that

230
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,510
Xi Jinping’s push for Marxism

231
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,590
is a compromise with hardliners in the Party.

232
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,600
Let’s not forget about the ongoing

233
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,070
internal power struggle in the Party,

234
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,090
featured in my favorite soap opera,

235
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,600
General Hostility.

236
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,170
Remember that trip to Shanghai I mentioned?

237
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,660
Shanghai is more than just where

238
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,520
the Chinese Communist Party was founded.

239
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,740
It’s also the power base of Xi’s biggest
political rival

240
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,170
Jiang Zemin.

241
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,480
Xi wanted to remove presidential terms limits

242
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,310
so he could stay in power forever.

243
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,750
Like Skeletor.

244
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,250
But it looks like in order to get that through,

245
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,430
he had to go to Jiang’s homebase

246
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,830
and publically reaffirm his faith in the Party.

247
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,030
In other words,

248
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,030
it’s Xi Jinping submitting himself to the
Party—

249
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,940
not him taking over the Party.

250
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,340
“Dialectical materialism is the best!

251
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,630
Because the Party says so.”

252
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,390
We’ll have to see how this all plays out.

253
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,390
But ultimately,

254
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,950
even though it might look like Xi Jinping

255
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,220
is pushing communist values—

256
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,040
China never really got less communist.

257
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,450
It’s been communist all along.

258
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,000
So what do you think?

And before you go,

261
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,340
I’m going to answer a question

262
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,500
from a fan of the show who supports China
Uncensored o

263
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,350
n the crowd funding website Patreon.

264
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,410
Ethan Fredsti asks,

265
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,170
“What would happen if Xi Jinping pulled
a Gorbachev?

266
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,940
Well that’s the million ruble question

267
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,820
everyone has been asking since Xi came to
power.

268
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,120
At the beginning,

269
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,200
some people hoped he would be a great reformer.

270
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,480
But I don’t think true reform is possible

271
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,380
with the Chinese Communist Party in charge.

272
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,000
The Party saw what happened to the Soviet
Union—

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,860
and they’re terrified of that happening
in China.

274
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,720
In fact, Xi made a speech back in 2013

275
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,100
where he blamed Gorbachev

276
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,190
for the fall of the Soviet Union,

277
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,360
and said that “nobody was a real man,

278
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,300
nobody came out to resist.”

279
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,440
So if Xi Jinping started acting like

280
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,890
he was setting himself up to be a Gorbachev

281
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,280
and dissolve the Party,

282
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,730
it’s very likely he’d be squashed

283
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,520
by the giant Party machine.

284
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,990
And not the good kind of Party machine—

285
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,220
like a disco ball or cotton candy machine.

286
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,860
The bad kind—

287
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,690
the kind that kills you if you don’t comply.

288
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,220
Like a very bad cotton candy machine.

289
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,520
As Forbes writes—

290
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
and I think this is pretty accurate—

291
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,110
“Xi isn't so much solidifying One Man Rule

292
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,910
as he is solidifying One Party Rule,

293
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,220
with himself at the head of the Party.”

294
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,270
And that’s an important distinction to make.

295
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,860
Thanks for your question, Ethan.

296
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,110
