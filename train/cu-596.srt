00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,800
China’s new digital yuan

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,480
Threatens US power

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,120
Could it kill the US dollar?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,680
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris\h
Chappell. China’s new digital currency\h\h

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
is a huge threat to the US.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,520
But first remember to like this episode\h
and subscribe to China Uncensored.\h\h

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,280
Our episodes also often get\h
demonetized. So if you can,\h\h

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,480
please support the show on the\h
crowdfunding website Patreon.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,000
And speaking of funding, China has\h
created its own digital currency.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,480
It’s known as the digital yuan, the digital RMB,\h\h

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,000
or sometimes the e-Chinese yuan, to make\h
it as awkward as possible to talk about.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,080
“China’s version of a digital\h
currency...is expected to give\h\h

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,240
China’s government vast new tools to\h
monitor both its economy and its people.”

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
But the digital yuan isn’t just about\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s ability\h\h

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,600
to control its own economy. It’s\h
also about the Chinese regime’s\h\h

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,560
increasing global power, and its\h
long-running battle with the US dollar.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,440
For more on that, we go to Shelley Zhang.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,320
Shelley?

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,320
Thanks, Chris.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,000
China’s digital yuan is the anti-Bitcoin.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
Bitcoin is not controlled\h
by any central authority,\h\h

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
and Bitcoin can offer almost\h
anonymous transactions.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
But China’s digital yuan is controlled\h
by the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
and the Party can see\h
everything you’re doing with it.

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,320
It’s kind of like Chinese leader Xi Jinping\h
is watching all of your Venmo transactions.\h\h

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,400
I have no idea what this is Chris, but\h
you spent almost 300 dollars on it,\h\h

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,120
so it’s probably embarrassing\h
enough for blackmail.

28
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,480
“Hey! How did you get that?”

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,040
Moving on.

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,400
Of course, China’s central bank\h
claims that it “will limit how\h\h

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,880
it tracks individuals,” with the digital\h
yuan, through “controllable anonymity.”

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
And if you believe that, I’ve got\h
an invisible bridge to sell you.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,840
But it’s not enough for the Chinese regime to\h
watch how its citizens use the digital yuan.\h\h

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,720
They also want to be able\h
to control when they use it.

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
“Beijing has tested expiration dates\h
to encourage users to spend it quickly,\h\h

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
for times when the economy needs a jump start.”

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
Forget giving people stimulus checks and\h
hoping they spend it to help the economy,\h\h

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,480
like the US government does. China can make people\h
spend their own money, or else they take it away.

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
Of course, there are some\h
caveats. If you’re Uyghur,\h\h

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
then the digital yuan expires twice as fast.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
And if you share a Winnie the Pooh meme,\h\h

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,160
the government just takes all\h
your digital yuan. Forever.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Ok, that’s not true. Yet. But the digital yuan\h
would give the Chinese Communist Party the ability\h\h

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,520
to do those things. They could use it to monitor,\h
control, and punish dissent more easily than ever.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,520
Chinese people have already been primed to use the\h
digital yuan from years of using mobile payment\h\h

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,760
apps like WeChat Pay and Alipay. Those apps have\h
turned China into an almost cashless society.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,440
We’ve talked before about how WeChat Pay\h
and Alipay are basically surveillance money.\h\h

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,320
And how sucking up all of this user data has\h
made the tech companies who own these apps\h\h

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,080
even more rich and powerful.

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
But now that the digital yuan is ready,\h\h

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,680
the Chinese Communist Party is starting\h
to crack down on WeChat Pay and Alipay.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,240
Why go through the hassle of having to get user\h
data from tech companies when the central bank\h\h

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,880
can just collect it directly with the digital\h
yuan? They’re just cutting out the middleman.

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,680
Of course, the central bank also\h
says that the digital yuan will\h\h

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
coexist in harmony with Alipay and WeChat Pay.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
But if you believe that’s the\h
long-term plan, I’m telling you,\h\h

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,240
that invisible bridge has some\h
stunning views. Really worth the money.

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
But the digital yuan isn’t just about\h
domestic control. It’s also about\h\h

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,960
international control. I’ll\h
tell you why after the break.

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,280
Welcome back.

61
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
The Chinese Communist Party\h
hates the fact that China,\h\h

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
like the rest of the world, is dependent on\h
the US dollar as the global reserve currency.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,120
“Nearly 90% of foreign-exchange transactions\h
involve dollars and...more than 60% of all\h\h

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
global central-bank reserves are\h
held in dollar-denominated assets.”

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,200
That gives the US a lot of power. For\h
example, the dollar’s dominance is a big\h\h

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,080
reason why US sanctions on countries\h
like Iran and China actually work.

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,400
Just ask Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam,\h\h

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,600
who literally has piles of cash at home,\h
and no bank account, due to US sanctions.

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
For more than a decade, the Chinese Communist\h
Party has tried to internationalize the yuan.\h\h

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,720
They want to position the yuan as the next\h
global reserve currency, challenging the dollar.

71
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
So far, it’s failing.

72
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,200
Here’s why people use the dollar as a global\h
currency: the US is a huge economy that people\h\h

73
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,040
do a lot of business with, it’s really easy\h
to use US dollars for trade and investment,\h\h

74
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,960
and dollar assets are a safe,\h
stable place to park your money.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,320
China is also a huge economy. But otherwise, the\h
dollar and the yuan are almost exact opposites.

76
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,320
The Chinese Communist Party has strict capital\h
controls on the yuan. That means they strictly\h\h

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,240
control how much yuan can leave China. Which makes\h
it hard to use the yuan for trade or investment.

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,120
And it’s also not a safe place to park your money,\h
because Chinese authorities use the yuan exchange\h\h

79
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,920
rate to control China’s domestic economy.
That means they will do things like suddenly\h\h

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,840
devalue the yuan when they\h
need to—like they did in 2015.

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,720
So if you owned yuan, it was suddenly worth\h
less. This makes the yuan less stable as a\h\h

82
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,920
store of value. But Chinese authorities were\h
more concerned with boosting China’s economy\h\h

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,000
than that fallout from devaluing the yuan.

84
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,520
So unless the Chinese Communist Party wants\h
to give up this level of control, the yuan is\h\h

85
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,880
not going to become a global reserve currency.\h
And they’re not going to give up that control.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,560
But the Chinese Communist Party is still using\h
the digital yuan to target the US dollar.\h\h

87
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
I’ll tell you how after the break.

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,960
Welcome back. So the Chinese Communist\h
Party failed at internationalizing the yuan.\h\h

89
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,040
Which is why they’re doing something\h
completely different with the digital yuan.

90
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,920
Instead of using the digital yuan to replace\h
the dollar in the global financial system,\h\h

91
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,120
they’re going to use the digital yuan to get\h
around the dollar and the global financial system.

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
China’s central bank has said that one\h
reason they’re developing the digital yuan is\h\h

93
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,680
“to protect [China’s] monetary sovereignty”\h
from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,680
But as the Chinese Communist\h
Party has said for years,\h\h

95
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,520
China’s monetary sovereignty isn’t just about\h
countering Bitcoin. It’s about countering the US.

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,000
Especially US sanctions.

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
“The chance to weaken the\h
power of American sanctions\h\h

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,080
is central to Beijing’s\h
marketing of the digital yuan.”

99
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
I’m sure Carrie Lam would rather be paid\h
in digital yuan than in piles of cash.

100
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,480
But it’s not just about protecting\h
Chinese officials from US sanctions.

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,760
I’ll let Chinese state-run CGTN explain.

102
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,320
“Currently, cross-border RMB settlement is\h
highly dependent on the US SWIFT system,\h\h

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,520
but these cross-border payment and banking\h
systems have been weaponized by the United States\h\h

104
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,320
to impose financial sanctions on multiple parties.\h\h

105
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,120
The digital RMB provides an independent\h
alternative for cross-border payments.”

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Chinese propaganda is truly an art.

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,640
But basically state-run media is spelling\h
it out for us. The digital yuan can help\h\h

108
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,200
countries evade US sanctions.
Yeah, I can think of a few\h\h

109
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,280
countries that might like to evade US\h
sanctions by using the digital yuan.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
In fact, two years ago, a\h
wargaming exercise showed how\h\h

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,760
North Korea could use the digital yuan to\h
neuter US sanctions and buy nuclear weapons.

112
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,640
We’re all going to sleep well tonight.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,360
But of course evading US sanctions is going to\h
take both a digital yuan and an alternative to\h\h

114
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,080
the SWIFT cross-border payment system. Which\h
the Chinese regime is already working on.

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,280
China’s central bank is separately\h
working on a joint venture with SWIFT,\h\h

116
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,840
because they still want the digital yuan to be\h
used by people who aren’t evading US sanctions.

117
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,960
In the end, the yuan might never\h
become the dominant global currency,\h\h

118
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,000
because the Chinese Communist\h
Party won’t give up its control.

119
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
But the digital yuan can become\h
a parallel global currency,\h\h

120
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,200
creating a parallel payments system to the US.

121
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,520
“The expansion of a Chinese\h
digital currency will ultimately\h\h

122
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,760
pry open the U.S. grip over global\h
payments, and therefore compromise\h\h

123
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,080
U.S. sanctions policy and a significant\h
measure of U.S. power in the world.”

124
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,240
The good news is that China is probably a year,\h
or maybe a few years, away from being able to\h\h

125
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,000
use the digital yuan to get around US sanctions.\h
But we should be paying attention to this now.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,320
Chris?

127
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,040
Thanks, Shelley. So I’m curious,\h
how is the US reacting to this?

128
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,280
Well, some experts have called\h
it a national security issue.

129
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah. It is. Good call.

130
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,840
But it’s not totally clear how the\h
Biden administration sees the issue.\h\h

131
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
According to anonymous officials\h
who talked to Bloomberg,\h\h

132
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,560
they’re “stepping up scrutiny” of the\h
digital yuan. Some officials are concerned.

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,840
But other officials don’t seem to get it.

134
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Bloomberg says that because China is working\h
with SWIFT, “U.S. officials are reassured\h\h

135
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,800
that China’s intentions aren’t to use the\h
digital yuan to evade American sanctions.”

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,320
WHAT? Are they even paying attention?\h\h

137
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,400
How can they think that China\h
*isn’t* going to evade US sanctions?

138
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,120
I don’t know, Chris. I guess they haven’t\h
watched that Chinese propaganda cartoon\h\h

139
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,840
where they specifically talk about using\h
the digital yuan to evade US sanctions.

140
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,560
Thanks Shelley. I’m definitely\h
going to sleep well tonight.

141
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,640
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

142
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,480
fans who support the show on Patreon.

143
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,800
Lunar Worx asks, “Hey Chris. Do you think you'd\h
be able to cover the Taiwanese game developers\h\h

144
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Red Candle Games? They made video\h
games like Detention and Devotion,\h\h

145
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,080
the later of which made them a\h
victim of the CCP's cancel culture.\h\h

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,160
And could we get someone on the China Uncensored\h
team to do a "Let's Play" of either game?”

147
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,400
You know I remember hearing\h
about those games As you said,\h\h

148
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,840
Devotion even got pulled from Steam for\h
hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.

149
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,840
That was a few years ago. But video games are\h
always an issue for the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,160
Like how Blizzard censored players\h
supporting Hong Kong democracy.

151
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,840
Video games very often seem\h
to become political news.\h\h

152
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,440
That’s one reason Matt, Shelley, and I have been\h
thinking of starting a video game channel. Not\h\h

153
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,320
only to play these politically sensitive games,\h
but also as a forum for other conversations about\h\h

154
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,800
politics. So now I’m going to ask a question. Is\h
that something you would watch? And do you have\h\h

155
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,520
any suggestions for what you’d like to see on a\h
show like that. Tell me in the comments below.

156
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,680
As for us playing Devotion, it’s a\h
horror game. Shelley scares easy.\h\h

157
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean, I would play it, but I\h
wouldn’t want Shelley to feel scared.

158
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
Thanks for your question Lunar Worx.

159
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,840
And thank you for watching. Once again\h
I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
