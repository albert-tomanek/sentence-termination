00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,850
the friendship between China and Pakistan
is

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,580
"higher than the mountains" and "deeper than
the oceans."

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,260
Especially when it comes to doing their best
to not fight terrorism, together.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I'm your
host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Pakistan. A beautiful country that borders
China and India,

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,240
and is unfortunately home to a lot of terrorists.

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,309
As you may know from reading the news, or
watching Zero Dark Thirty,

9
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:39,229
Osama Bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan until
his villa was raided by Navy SEALs.

10
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:45,899
So it's no surprise that another violent organization
with ties to Al-Qaeda is also based partly

11
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,079
in Pakistan:

12
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,839
Jaish-e-Mohammed, or JeM.

13
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:53,769
According to the US government's National
Counterterrorism Center,

14
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,979
JeM has openly declared war on the United
States.

15
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:03,440
A JeM member may have been involved in the
killing of an American journalist in 2002.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,450
And JeM is responsible for a number of deadly
attacks in India

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,369
including allegedly the recent attacks on
Pathankot Air Force station,

18
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,119
where seven Indian soldiers were killed.

19
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,770
Now you might think JeM should be labeled
a terrorist organization.

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,390
And in fact, the United Nations would agree.

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,820
"JeM is an organization that has been declared
a terrorist organization way back in 2001

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,329
by the United Nations."

23
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,619
But you know who's apparently not a terrorist?

24
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,619
The leader of JeM: Masood Azhar.

25
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,200
And that's because...China.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,780
In Washington, DC last week,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,499
Pakistan and China joined together in blocking

28
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:48,249
the United Nations from putting Azhar on the
UN terror blacklist.

29
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:52,569
China said he does not meet the UN's requirements
for being labeled a "terrorist."

30
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,569
They did not elaborate.

31
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,499
As you can imagine, this has caused a major
uproar in India

32
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:02,179
where a lot of innocent people have been killed
by Azhar's organization.

33
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:07,759
"The Indian establishment here was really
angry at the manner in which the designation

34
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
of Maulana Masood Azhar as a terrorist has
been blocked by China."

35
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,209
But since this happened on April 1,

36
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,760
at first I thought it was a joke.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,489
You know, that the leader and financier of
a terrorist organization would himself somehow

38
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,250
not be labeled a terrorist.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,820
But apparently China doesn't joke around.

40
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,210
But wait a second, doesn't Pakistan want to
get rid of terrorists, too?

41
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,520
Well, it's complicated.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Partly, it has to do with Kashmir.

43
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,229
Not this cashmere. This Kashmir.

44
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,879
Pakistan, India, and to some degree China
all have competing claims to this region.

45
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,599
Since the partition of India in 1947,

46
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,150
India and Pakistan have fought not one but
three wars over Kashmir.

47
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,110
And over the years Pakistan has trained militants
to fight on its behalf.

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,250
Like the ones who later formed JeM.

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,340
JeM's goal is to take back Indian-controlled
Kashmir.

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,600
They're, you know, "freedom fighters."

51
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,829
See? The Pakistani government doesn't support
terrorism.

52
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,909
It's just that not everyone agrees on who's
a terrorist.

53
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:17,250
I mean, China calls this guy a terrorist.

54
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,970
And because JeM is helping stake Pakistan's
claim in Kashmir,

55
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,219
the Pakistani government isn't really trying
too hard to get rid of them

56
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:29,469
even though many people in the government
don't like JeM's tactics.

57
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:34,390
So why would China support Pakistan on protecting
JeM's leader?

58
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,560
Because China and Pakistan are besties.

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,379
And by besties, I mean their friendship is,
and I quote,

60
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:42,849
"Higher than the mountains,

61
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,269
deeper than the oceans,

62
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,069
stronger than steel,

63
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,579
dearer than eyesight,

64
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,989
sweeter than honey, and so on."

65
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,929
And by "and so on" I assume the ambassador
meant "mightier than the threat of global terrorism."

66
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,290
So why are China and Pakistan so close?

67
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,340
Well, they've been friends for a long time.

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,599
In 1950, Pakistan was one of the first nations
to recognize the CCP's rule of China,

69
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,779
and to break ties with Taiwan.

70
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,579
And you know what else makes for great political
friendships?

71
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,350
Money.

72
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,410
“China is Pakistan’s second largest trade
partner,

73
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,030
and a huge investor in Pakistani infrastructure
and shipping routes.

74
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,800
The two countries trade roughly 10 to 12 billion
dollars a year as of 2013.”

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,950
And that trade includes things like nuclear
technology.

76
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,010
And also guns.

77
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:39,570
In fact, Pakistan is the world's biggest buyer
of Chinese weapons.

78
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,160
In their latest deal,

79
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,950
Pakistan bought eight Chinese submarines for
five billion dollars.

80
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,640
I assume they'd come in handy if Pakistan
ever got into a war with,

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
I don't know, India.

82
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
Again.

83
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,140
Now I'd like to believe China's Foreign Minister
Wang Yi when he said last year that,

84
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,830
“Fighting the scourge of terrorism is the
responsibility of every country.

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,780
China has always been an active participant
in international counter-terrorism cooperation.”

86
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,700
But I think this article in state-run Global
Times may be more revealing.

87
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,470
So what do you think about China's support
for Pakistan?
