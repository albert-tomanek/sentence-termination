1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,410
the Chinese regime promised the Philippines

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,240
that they’d totally give them billions of
dollars.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,580
How’d that turn out?

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,240
Hi, Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,200
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,770
Rodrigo Duterte.

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,390
President of the Philippines,

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,800
and Vladimir Putin wannabe.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,890
When he ran for office,

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,159
he was so outspoken against China’s

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,029
territorial claims in the South China Sea,

13
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,519
that he pledged to stop them with a move

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,250
even Putin would have admired:

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,950
He promised to ride a jetski to disputed islands

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,910
and plant the Philippines’ flag.

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,220
Of course it would have really impressed Putin
if Duterte

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,020
had pledged to ride the jetski while shirtless.

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,410
And on a horse.

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,970
But after taking office in mid-2016,

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,890
Duterte did a full 180, but not on a jetski.

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,190
In fact, he put that jetski back in the shed
to gather dust.

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,500
In Duterte’s first official meeting with
Chinese leader Xi Jinping,

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,280
he didn’t even bring up the territorial
disputes—

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,259
even though an international court had just
ruled in the Philippines’ favor.

26
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,130
Duterte even turned his back on long-time
ally the United States

27
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,070
as he jumped into Xi Jinping’s loving arms.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,920
“‘I announce my separation from the United
States,’

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,020
those are the words of Rodrigo Duterte in
Beijing on Thursday,

30
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,200
capping off a trip to China where he’s won
a whopping

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,579
13 billion dollars in business deals.”

32
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,439
Duterte saw Chinese investment as key

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,439
to his “Build, Build, Build” strategy.

34
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,539
He wants to usher in a golden age of infrastructure
development

35
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:44,009
through a six-year, 180 billion dollar spending
spree.

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,909
And when the dust settled from Duterte’s
charm offensive in Beijing,

37
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,310
China pledged to provide the Philippines with
24 billion dollars.

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,319
That would include 15 billion in foreign direct
investment,

39
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,829
plus 9 billion dollars in aid.

40
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,619
That aid alone would be 20 times more than
what

41
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,139
the Philippines got from the United States
in 2016.

42
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:09,659
So, sure the US has been an ally of the Philippines
for decades,

43
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:13,540
but, I mean...billions of dollars?

44
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,730
For billions of dollars,

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,620
who wouldn’t cuddle up with China?

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,810
But you know what?

47
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,019
Sometimes, China can be so forgetful!

48
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,860
See, when the South China Morning Post did
a spot check

49
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,970
on China’s investment commitments earlier
this month,

50
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,970
they asked,

51
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,790
“What happened to the billions China pledged
the Philippines?”

52
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,510
And it turns out the answer is…not a whole
lot.

53
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,870
Of its 24 billion dollar pledge, China so
far has made good on

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,860
only one billion worth of Foreign Direct Investment.

55
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,019
Add to that just a single finalized loan agreement
of $73 million dollars.

56
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,270
And China gave the Philippines 75 million
dollars in direct aid.

57
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,430
That was in the form of grants to build two
bridges in the capital of Manila.

58
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,840
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao
Jianhua

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,110
was at the groundbreaking ceremony last month,

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,069
holding a golden shovel alongside other men,

61
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,049
also dressed inappropriately for construction.

62
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,810
Ambassador Zhao said that “the bridge projects
will further add

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,189
strength to the ‘Build, Build, Build’
initiative of the Philippines.”

64
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:23,819
And he tried to assure everybody that “China’s
loans

65
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,750
to finance infrastructure projects will not
make the Philippines

66
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,909
fall into a debt trap.”

67
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:30,909
And you know what?

68
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:31,909
I believe him.

69
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,130
At least for now.

70
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,290
Because for the Philippines to fall into a
debt trap,

71
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,290
China would actually have to lend them lots
of money.

72
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,210
And so far, that tap’s been pretty dry.

73
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,090
They’ve only received less than 5% of what
China promised.

74
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,629
It’s like they ordered a hamburger,

75
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,129
and the waiter brought them a shriveled piece
of lettuce.

76
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,219
Now to be fair, the holdups on the money

77
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,090
weren’t all from the Chinese Communist Party.

78
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,610
As the South China Morning Post points out,

79
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,840
some projects were delayed by the Philippines
or cancelled.

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,620
And more may be coming soon.

81
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,819
Now on the one hand, the slowdown in investment

82
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,840
is actually good news for the Philippines.

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
It means they haven’t fallen into

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,620
the Chinese Communist Party’s debt trap.

85
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Like Sri Lanka, or Pakistan, or Djibouti,

86
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,850
or Laos, or Cambodia, or...

87
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,370
well, the list goes on.

88
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,920
But on the other hand, in order to get the
promise

89
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,800
of Chinese aid and investment—

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,169
even though it’s unfulfilled so far—

91
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,050
Duterte has already made a lot of concessions

92
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,539
that have angered Filipinos.

93
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,139
At a February meeting of the Chinese Business
Club,

94
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,639
Duterte complained that China was pinching
its pennies.

95
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,930
So to get China to loosen its purse strings,

96
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,121
he joked that China should just annex the
Philippines

97
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:46,699
and turn the country into a Chinese province.

98
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,640
“Why are you so sparing?

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,300
If you want, just make us a province, like
Fujian:

100
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,800
Province of Philippines, Republic of China.

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,240
Problem solved.

102
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,960
Everything will be for free.”

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,100
Everything will be free?

104
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,620
Maybe someone should tell Duterte

105
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,710
that’s not how communism actually works.

106
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,250
Now while Duterte’s joke seemed to make

107
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,460
the Chinese ambassador smile,

108
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,400
it didn’t go over so well with the citizens
of the Philippines.

109
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,389
A few months later, banners calling the Philippines

110
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,360
a “province of China” started popping
up on bridges in Manila.

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,759
And I’ve got to give them props.

112
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,630
No, I mean, Filipinos are using lots of props

113
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,130
to express their anger at Duterte.

114
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,069
The Philippines, province of China banners

115
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,539
are slightly more subtle

116
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,050
than the guy with the “China Out” hat.

117
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,120
Or this effigy of the president’s head tied
to a makeshift train.

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,419
Which was then set on fire.

119
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,110
That happened on the day of Duterte’s

120
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,050
state of the nation address in July,

121
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,910
when thousands took to the streets,

122
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,540
and not exactly to show their support.

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,280
Meanwhile, Duterte blamed bloodsucking bureaucrats

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,009
for the lack of money for his infrastructure
dream.

125
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:12,220
“Corruption is like a leech that bleeds
the government of funds,

126
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,050
programs and infrastructure and social development
projects.”

127
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,319
To be fair, people are angry at Duterte for
a lot of things.

128
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,720
But among those things,

129
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,110
he’s blamed for making one-sided concessions
to China on sovereignty,

130
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,670
with nothing to show for it in return.

131
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,910
And it’s not just Duterte’s refusal to
plant his flag in the South China Sea.

132
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,100
Which—let’s be honest—even I’ve done
that.

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,220
Duterte also proposed a highly controversial
sharing deal

134
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,430
with China on a planned joint exploration
of resources

135
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,020
in a part of the South China Sea that the
Philippines claims.

136
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Under the arrangement,

137
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,009
the Philippines would get 60% and China 40%.

138
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,569
But critics say this is a bad deal because

139
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,620
it solidifies China’s claim there.

140
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,919
But don’t worry!

141
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,229
Duterte isn’t giving up on enforcing

142
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,020
the Philippine’s claim to the South China
Sea.

143
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,099
He’s fully committed to imposing it...

144
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,379
in the year 4001.

145
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,919
When he’ll ride to the Scarborough Shoal

146
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,810
and plant the Philippines flag...

147
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,310
on a space jetski.

148
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,370
While shirtless.

149
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,380
And on a horse.

150
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,400
A space horse.

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
And before you go, it’s time for me to answer
another question

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,740
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

153
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,680
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

154
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,560
David Michael White asks,

155
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,330
“Among your many overseas adventures,

156
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,710
which hotel did you like the most?”

157
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,830
Why, it was the Jia Jia Hotel in Taiwan!

158
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,550
They were super friendly and had interesting
rooms,

159
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,580
and they were in good locations in Taipei
and Tainan.

160
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,250
Also, I can’t say no to free breakfast!

161
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,330
Now on one hand, I am saying that because
the Jia Jia hotel

162
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,720
was a sponsor of China Uncensored—

163
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,419
and I have a lot of love and respect for

164
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,509
the companies that support us.

165
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,569
But on the other hand, I don’t have much
to compare it to.

166
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:02,569
The truth is,

167
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,599
I don’t usually stay in hotels while traveling.

168
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,889
China Uncensored doesn’t exactly have a
big travel budget.

169
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,990
For most of our trips,

170
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,560
the crew and I save money by staying in people’s
homes,

171
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,300
or in AirBNBs.

172
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,000
But for all the hotel owners out there watching
this episode,

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,919
if you have a five-star hotel and want to
sponsor our crew

174
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,220
next time we travel,

175
