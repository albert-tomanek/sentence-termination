00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,500
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,420
China ends its one-child policy!

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,500
Sort of.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,019
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored, I'm
your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,000
Big news out of China last weekâ€”as explained
in this video by British state-run media BBC.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
(cheers)

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,699
Wow. I guess they're putting all their investigative
resources into Sherlock.

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,469
Well, ending an unpopular and draconian population
control policy is certainly cause for celebration.

9
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:41,620
"Now we have the introduction of a new policy:
One couple, two children."

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:49,010
Wait. So they're ending the one-child policy...by
making it a two-child policy instead?

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,480
You know, the one-child policy was never supposed
to be a permanent thing.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,649
It was established in 1979 after a huge population
boom in China.

13
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,780
After the Communist Party began its rule in
1949,

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,410
the population of China almost doubled in
30 years.

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,180
And this wasn't a coincidence.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,890
Mao Zedong encouraged people to have lots
of kids.

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,510
That's partially because he was concerned
about nuclear war.

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,340
He said in a 1957 speech that it didn't matter
if half of China's population was killed,

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,420
because there were so many people, they could
just repopulate.

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,240
At the time, the Communist Party even banned
birth control.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,520
But eventually, officials started worrying
about overpopulation.

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,160
So they created the one-child policy.

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,460
It was a massive social engineering project
designed to counter

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,870
the previous social engineering project that
got out of hand.

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,790
It's also not precisely a one-child policy.

26
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,290
There are so many exceptions that two thirds
of Chinese people are already allowed to have

27
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,380
a second child,

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,450
for example, farmers whose first child is
a girl.

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,550
So what's the big deal about changing the
one-child policy now?

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:06,680
For more on this, we go to former one-child
and copy editor Shelley Zhang.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,460
Chris.

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,500
Shelley, most people outside China have a
negative view of the one child policy,

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,640
but some people also think it was a "necessary
evil"

34
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,260
to stop overpopulation in China.

35
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,270
Was the policy a success?

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,940
The Chinese government says that the policy
prevented 400 million births,

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,630
but demographers are pretty skeptical.

38
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,890
In fact, it's looking more and more like the
one child policy was completely unnecessary.

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,069
Really. Completely unnecessary?

40
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,620
Well, the biggest drop in China's birth rate
happened before the one-child policy.

41
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,090
In 1970, the government started running a
propaganda campaign to encourage people to

42
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,510
get married later and have fewer children.

43
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,670
Family size dropped by half in just 10 years.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,560
Researchers now think that the birth rate
would have continued to drop naturally as

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,730
China's economy improved.

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,390
That was even confirmed by a secret government
experiment.

47
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,700
So are officials changing the one-child policy
now because it's clear it's not necessary?

48
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,810
Well, they're changing it because the one-child
policy caused a demographic disaster.

49
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,709
China is now dealing with not having enough
young workers to support the elderly.

50
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,990
This sounds like a huge amount of pressure
on the next generation.

51
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,970
Yeah, and because of the preference for boys
over girls,

52
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,650
there are now 30 million more men than women.

53
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,190
So how is the one-child policy enforced, anyway?

54
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,720
It's unevenly implemented through a massive
bureaucracy.

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,180
Quotas are set by the central government,
and enforced by local family planning commissions.

56
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,970
Wow. So what happens to people who violate
the policy?

57
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,290
So it varies pretty widely.

58
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,410
You can be fined anywhere from a few thousand
dollars to 6 to 8 times your annual income.

59
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,190
In some cases, if you can't pay, officials
will force you to have an abortion, or sterilize

60
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,690
you.

61
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,330
Remember Feng Jianmei?

62
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,970
In 2012, she was seven months pregnant with
her second child, and couldn't pay the fine.

63
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,690
Officials captured her and forced her to have
an abortion.

64
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,520
A photo of Feng with her stillborn baby went
viral on social media,

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,849
causing an outcry against family planning
enforcement.

66
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,739
From what I remember, Feng lived in a rural
area,

67
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,040
so she should have been able to have a second
child.

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,610
Oh, yeah, she was eligible.

69
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,349
But she hadn't applied for a birth permit
before getting pregnant.

70
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,710
So because she didn't have a birth permit,
she was fined,

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,059
and because she couldn't pay the fine, she
had a forced abortion?

72
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,009
Yes.

73
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:31,699
Under the one-child policy there have been
more than 330 million abortions and almost

74
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,259
200 million sterilizations.

75
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,620
And if Feng's daughter had been born, she
wouldn't be able to get a residence permit.

76
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,050
That means she couldn't go to school, couldn't
get a job, couldn't even go to the doctor.

77
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,279
There are 6.5 million "undocumented" Chinese
in that exact situation.

78
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,069
You know, I think about this sometimes because
after I was born in China, my mother got a

79
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:54,650
government-mandated IUD (intrauterine device).

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,999
Even though IUDs are supposed to have a 99%
effectiveness rate, she got pregnant.

81
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,300
So if we hadn't already moved to America by
then,

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,969
my sister probably wouldn't be alive today.

83
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:08,419
That's really heavy.

84
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,659
So it sounds like changing the one-child policy
will be a good thing?

85
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:17,699
Right now, it looks like family planning commissions
will still exist to enforce the two-child

86
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,939
policy.

87
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,460
And a big reason is money.

88
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,080
A lot of local governments make a substantial
part of their revenue from family planning

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,370
fines, especially in poorer areas.

90
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,289
There's even a saying that, for money,

91
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,849
"Big cities depend on land, small towns depend
on birth planning."

92
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:38,589
Some estimate that fines have made more than
300 billion dollars since the one-child policy

93
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,589
started.

94
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,439
Will the new two-child policy help the demographic
crisis the one-child policy caused?

95
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,270
It will take decades,

96
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,580
because the birth rate probably won't increase
fast enough.

97
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,879
When the two-child policy was piloted back
in 2013,

98
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,869
only 1 in 20 eligible couples applied to have
a second child.

99
00:05:56,869 --> 00:06:01,039
You know, in the end, stopping the one-child
policy is good PR.

100
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,159
Most people outside China will probably think that
it's a great thing.

101
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,139
But what they won't realize is that the underlying
system isn't changing.

102
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:08,759
Chris?

103
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,999
Thanks, Shelley.

104
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:14,169
So the Communist Party is swapping the one-child
policy for a two-child policy.

105
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:18,639
But that's not going to change the fact that
the Party is still telling people how many

106
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,180
children they are allowed to have.

107
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,680
So will this new social engineering project

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,589
designed to counter the previous social engineering
project

109
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:30,210
created to fix the first social engineering
project work?

110
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,969
What do you think? Leave your comments below.

111
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,869
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored
and check out our Facebook page.

112
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm Chris Chappell. See you next time.

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,849
Ai Weiwei is well known for criticizing Chinese
censorship through his art.

114
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,439
And now he is accusing LEGO of censoring him

115
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,000
because of alleged pressure from the Chinese
regime.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,800
So Ai Weiwei handled the rejection in the mature, adult manner that one would expect from the eccentric artist.

117
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,509
The US guided missile destroyer, the USS Lassen,

118
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,089
sailed within 12 nautical miles of Chinese
territory

119
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:14,669
â€”as long as you consider artificial islands
built on submerged reefs part of China's territory,

120
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,770
which no besides China does.
