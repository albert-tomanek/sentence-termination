1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:03,889
China launches a new assault on India

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,069
The Philippines warns off China in the South
China Sea

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,750
And your favorite Chinese restaurant might
be spying on you.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:18,670
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:23,170
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,619
A new variant of the coronavirus is spreading
like wildfire in India.

7
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:32,300
And the Chinese Communist Party is taking
full advantage of it.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,120
India is China’s largest regional rival.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,940
The CCP takes every opportunity it can to
undermine India’s influence in the region.

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,870
And this deadly new coronavirus surge is no
exception.

11
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:50,000
You see, as recently as last month, India
was the world’s largest producer of coronavirus

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
vaccines.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,010
Much to the chagrin of China.

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,399
Who is trying to woo the world with its vaccine
diplomacy.

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,219
You know, get people to see China as the one
who saved them from the coronavirus.

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,490
Rather than see China as the place the pandemic
started from.

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,230
The only fly in the ointment—Chinese vaccines
don't work so well.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,440
And that’s according to a top Chinese health
official.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,280
“But [India’s] second Covid-19 wave has
been so brutal that India has stopped almost

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,560
all vaccine exports.”

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,900
In fact India is now importing vaccines to
meet its needs.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,759
And this has given the Chinese Communist Party
an opportunity.

23
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,700
“China has moved swiftly to fill the void
as anxiety grows in countries that were dependent

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,840
on Indian-made shots.”

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,960
Even if Chinese vaccines aren’t very effective,
many see it as better than nothing.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,030
The CCP is using the current crisis in India
in more ways too.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,640
A major Chinese state-run airline suspended
cargo flights to India.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,420
Those flights were “needed to bring in medical
supplies, and Chinese manufacturers of medical

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,750
supplies have raised prices.”

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,799
Now, that Chinese state-run airline has just
retracted the ban.

31
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,159
But it sure sent a clear message to the Indian
government: You’re dependent on China.

32
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,660
The Chinese regime is also using the crisis
to try and drive a wedge between the US and

33
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,660
India.

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,659
“When India asked the United States this
month to lift a ban on exporting vaccine raw

35
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:29,000
materials...Washington appeared to drag its
feet, citing the need to ‘vaccinate the

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,079
American people’ first.”

37
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,260
As you can imagine, that really did not go
over well.

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,010
And the Chinese Communist Party saw an opportunity
to exploit a possible rift between India and

39
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,579
the US for its own gain.

40
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:48,420
Chinese state-run media were quick to attack
the US for selfishness and indifference.

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,329
Suggesting India should maybe rethink who
its allies are.

42
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:58,079
Meanwhile, “Chinese leaders have repeatedly
expressed a desire to help [India], pledging

43
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:04,099
to ‘offer support and assistance to the
best of our capability if the Indian side

44
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,010
informs us of its specific needs.’”

45
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,529
This of course comes as the US and India have
strengthened their alliance to counter China.

46
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:19,109
That’s part of the Quad, an alliance between
the US, India, Japan and Australia.

47
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,150
Which also has been working to counter China’s
vaccine diplomacy.

48
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,760
India, so far, hasn’t taken up Beijing’s
offer.

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,959
And the Biden Administration is now sending
vaccine materials to India.

50
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,579
As well as more than 100 million dollars in
Covid supplies.

51
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:42,029
But as humanity still struggles to end the
pandemic the Chinese Communist Party is responsible

52
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:48,989
for, the Party will still be here, trying
to turn the pandemic to its own advantage.

53
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,209
The Philippines is getting a little salty
over the Communist Party’s repeated incursions

54
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,819
into disputed waters in the South China Sea.

55
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,549
That’s why the Philippine Coast Guard is
holding maritime drills.

56
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,150
China of course is complaining about it.

57
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,489
But the Philippines’ Defense Minister is
telling China to mind its own business.

58
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,819
Philippines President Rodrigo Dutetere was
a little softer.

59
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,579
He said, “While the Philippines owed China
a ‘huge debt’ of gratitude for many things,

60
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,750
including free COVID-19 vaccines...he would
not compromise on his country's sovereignty

61
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,490
in the South China Sea.”

62
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,789
Yes, according to Duterte, part of their huge
debt to China is for China’s coronavirus

63
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:33,789
vaccines.

64
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:38,629
Like I said, the Communist Party is always
turning the coronavirus to its own advantage.

65
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:45,430
Meanwhile, hundreds of US-funded scientists
may be compromised by China.

66
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,389
These scientists at American universities
get US funding, while also setting up labs

67
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,180
in China and getting funded by China as well.

68
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,550
Michael Lauer, Deputy Director of the National
Institutes of Health, gave an example of a

69
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,180
US researcher who, “had a laboratory in
China and was basically being funded by the

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,930
Chinese government to do the exact same work”—despite
receiving an NIH research grant to do work

71
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,760
in the U.S.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,389
Speaking of, US scientists who said there’s
no way the coronavirus came from a Chinese

73
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,620
lab admit to being collaborators of that Chinese
lab.

74
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,849
For instance, NBC Science Contributor Dr.
Joseph Fair . He’s said the lab leak idea

75
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,340
was a conspiracy theory.

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:42,289
Incidentally, here he is in 2013 being given
an award from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

77
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,759
Another is Dr. Ian Lipkin . He also said in
numerous media reports the virus didn’t

78
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,889
come from a Chinese lab.

79
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,669
Here he is speaking at the Wuhan Institute
of Virology.

80
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,530
Now to be clear, these doctors specifically
said they didn’t believe the coronavirus

81
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,479
was engineered in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

82
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:09,110
But there is mounting evidence the coronavirus
may have *accidentally* leaked from the Wuhan

83
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,110
Institute of Virology.

84
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,539
So it’s probably a bad idea that so many
influential US doctors and scientists are

85
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,439
so closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

86
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:26,270
And speaking of close ties to the Chinese
Communist Party—your favorite Chinese restaurant!

87
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,130
Coming up after the break.

88
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,130
Welcome back.

89
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,009
If you’re like me, you love to eat Chinese
hotpot.

90
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:39,500
When Shelley, Matt, and I were in Hong Kong
in 2019, a friend took us to Haidilao, one

91
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,710
of the most famous hotpot restaurants from
mainland China.

92
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,900
The food was great.

93
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,220
That’s probably why Haidilao is so successful.

94
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,249
It has more than 900 restaurants around the
world.

95
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:54,020
Plus they give free manicures.

96
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,499
But it turns out, Haidilao is also successful
at spying on its customers and staff.

97
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,330
According to the Sunday Guardian, “A manager
with Haidilao Hot Pot in Vancouver confirmed

98
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,469
that over 60 surveillance cameras have been
installed in the restaurant at the request

99
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:17,949
of the [mainland China based] Haidilao corporation,
as part of the social credit system in China.”

100
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:23,580
That’s where Chinese authorities monitor
citizens to see if they’re politically correct.

101
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,879
The social credit system punishes or rewards
people according to how well they follow Party

102
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,479
directives.

103
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,410
And in case you think these cameras are just
for security, no, they’re not.

104
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,949
The manager at Haidilao admitted that “The
cameras were installed to ‘punish’ staff

105
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,969
if they didn’t adhere to corporate standards
and to ‘people track.’”

106
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:51,379
And he said the footage was sent back to China—but
he declined to say why.

107
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:54,080
Only that the reason was “secret”.

108
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,349
Further reporting from Hong Kong’s Apply
Daily suggests the surveillance is happening

109
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,650
in Taiwan, too.

110
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,840
And a closer review of our own photo from
Hong Kong shows...that we were absolutely

111
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,199
stupid for not noticing!

112
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,830
But I’m not too worried.

113
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,360
Because we can never go back to Hong Kong
anyway.

114
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,900
22 years ago this week, Falun Gong practitioners
went to Beijing to petition the government

115
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,400
for their right to practice their beliefs
freely.

116
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,309
State-run media had once promoted Falun Gong,
but by 1999 that had flipped.

117
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:34,010
Long story short, this guy was playing power
struggle games, and Falun Gong was a convenient

118
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,950
political victim.

119
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,940
And yet, more than two decades later, millions
of people inside China still practice Falun

120
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
Gong.

121
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,339
And it’s become China’s largest civil
disobedience movement.

122
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,560
They’re also still one of the biggest groups
outside China protesting the Communist Party.

123
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,600
For more, check out the recent interview we
did on the China Unscripted podcast with the

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,470
Executive Director of the Falun Dafa Information
Center.

125
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,760
John Kerry is President Biden’s climate
envoy to China.

126
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,470
And he has returned from China with great
news!

127
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,090
He says as far as climate change goes, we
can turn it around.

128
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,589
But of course, the only way to do that is
if we work with China.

129
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,760
John Kerry said “We have other differences
on human rights...but those differences do

130
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:31,260
not have to get in the way of something that
is as critical as dealing with climate.”

131
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,040
Well said!

132
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,350
For example, China makes most of the world’s
solar panels.

133
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,150
That’s because they stole the technology
from US companies, but that’s beside the

134
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,150
point.

135
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,430
We can’t let that get in the way of cooperating
on climate issues.

136
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,660
Solar panels can help us go green.

137
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,300
And we can’t let human rights concerns,
like that those solar panels are made by ethnic

138
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,310
slave labor, get in the way of dealing with
climate.

139
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:05,410
Now sure, the Chinese Communist Party has
a long history of lying about...everything.

140
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,060
And repeatedly violating international agreements.

141
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,950
But surely, when it comes to climate change,
we can trust the CCP this time for some reason.

142
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,350
As John Kerry said, “My sense is the Chinese
know that there is a benefit to both of us

143
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,870
being able to resolve the climate crisis because
our citizens are deeply affected by our failure

144
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,459
to do so.”

145
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:33,820
Because if there’s one authoritarian regime
that really cares about its citizens, it’s

146
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,300
the Chinese Communist Party.

147
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:43,339
I mean, surely the CCP recognizes the mutual
benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions...which

148
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:48,910
is why THEY’RE STILL BUILDING AN INSANE
NUMBER OF NEW COAL PLANTS!

149
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,100
Dear American officials: If you think you
can trust the Chinese Communist Party, because

150
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,510
this time it will be different—that is literally
the definition of insanity!

151
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,950
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

152
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,339
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party

153
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,870
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

154
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,220
Charlie Badge asks, “if china invades Taiwan,
what about the US military equipment sold

155
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
to them.

156
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,850
Does Taiwan have the F35 bomber?

157
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,360
Is American willing to protect this technology?”

158
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,009
Excellent question.

159
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:34,480
Obviously it is a concern to the US what happens
if US military equipment sold to Taiwan falls

160
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,620
into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.

161
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,570
It’s actually one of the reasons why Taiwan
doesn’t have the F35.

162
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,759
Even without an invasion, US military technology
in Taiwan is at risk.

163
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,740
According to one expert, “It would be very
hard for the Taiwanese to hold the secrets—not

164
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,149
because they would give them up willingly,
but because of the infiltration of the Chinese

165
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,149
into their system.”

166
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,870
Then there’s issues with money.

167
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,800
The F35 is a very expensive fighter jet.

168
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,430
Not just to buy, but to maintain.

169
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,190
Some think that money would be better spent
on other defense systems.

170
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,250
However there are arguments for selling Taiwan
the F-35.

171
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,230
“From a military perspective, experts say
the F-35 is perfectly suited for flying in

172
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,380
Taiwan.

173
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,510
The plane can take off from short runways
and land vertically like a helicopter.

174
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,100
That would be important in a war with China,
which would likely bomb Taiwan’s airfields

175
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,000
preventing traditional jets from taking off.”

176
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,640
But of course, such a move might—anger China.

177
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,670
And so, for a variety of reasons, US military
support of Taiwan remains limited.

178
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,440
Thanks for your question Charlie.

179
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,310
