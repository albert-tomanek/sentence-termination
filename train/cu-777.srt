00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,370
is it getting cold in here?

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,000
Or is it just your cold war mentality?

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,759
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,620
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,039
China reacts to “the biggest,

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,580
best State of the Union, ever.”

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,600
It was an hour and 20 minutes long,

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
way longer than a typical tweet.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,671
Of course, you’re just watching to see

11
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:27,890
if your name gets dropped.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,689
And China’s did.

13
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,590
Right alongside Russia.

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,920
And terrorist groups.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,730
“Around the world,

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,410
we face rogue regimes,

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,680
terrorist groups,

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,930
and rivals like China and Russia

19
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,710
that challenge our interests,

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,190
our economy,

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,430
and our values.”

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,580
Now why do you have to be like that?

23
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,860
China’s fine.

24
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,390
It won’t try to block America’s new moment,

25
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,680
as state-run Xinhua says.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
But also, if the US doesn’t stop

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,230
this kind of Cold War mentality,

28
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,570
there’s going to be problems.

29
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,000
“We hope the US can abandon Cold War mentality

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,830
and outdated zero-sum game ideas,

31
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,610
treat China and US-China relations properly.”

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes, treat US-China relations properly.

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,300
Like, stop talking about protecting

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,320
US intellectual property from theft.

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,920
“And we will protect American workers

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,960
and American intellectual property,

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,760
through strong enforcement of our trade rules.”

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,540
Because we all know who Trump’s talking
about—

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,930
without naming names.

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,150
It’s about stopping the Chinese Communist
Party

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,190
from stealing an estimated $5 trillion dollars
a year

42
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,680
in American innovation.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,580
That is such a Cold War mentality.

44
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,770
And of course,

45
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,790
no speech in front of a crowd by Trump would
be complete

46
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,360
without a reference to Rocket Man.

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,580
“We need only look at the depraved character

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,930
of the North Korean regime

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,640
to understand the nature of the nuclear threat

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,920
it could pose to America and to our allies.”

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,260
Of course the Chinese regime

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,730
might agree with President Trump

53
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,730
on that one.

54
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,830
Let’s just say China is not known

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,900
for its environment of open debate.

56
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,540
But academics have been given a free pass

57
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,920
to debate what to do about North Korea.

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,579
Of course that courtesy has not been

59
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,400
extended to the general public.

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,540
And its seems like President Trump

61
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,840
may have successfully driven a wedge between

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,579
the former best Communist neighbors.

63
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,260
According to this South Korean newspaper,

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,459
North Korea has banned Chinese retail products.

65
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,919
I guess beggars can be choosers.

66
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,279
So what’s your reaction to China’s reaction

67
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,930
to President Trump’s State of the Union
address?

68
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,279
Leave your comments below.

69
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,540

Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

72
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,280
See you next time.

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,960
