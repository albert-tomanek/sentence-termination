1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,320
The Coronavirus

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,460
A PR Disaster for China?

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,300
Or a Propaganda Victory?

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,380
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,440
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,940
You know, I criticize the Chinese Communist
Party.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,320
A lot.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,560
But as many commenters have reminded me,

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,130
it’s also important to praise the Party
when they do things well.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,650
So I will.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,160
The Chinese Communist Party is really, really
good...

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,730
at turning their terrible mistakes into propaganda
wins—

13
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,300
and convincing the rest of the world to agree.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,620
They’re doing it right now with the coronavirus.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,630
And they’ve done it before, too.

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,040
For example, after Mao Zedong took over in
1949

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,360
and enforced collective farming,

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,190
the Chinese Communist Party plunged the nation
into poverty and starvation.

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,640
Then, Deng Xiaoping made free market reforms,

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,650
and Chinese people were able to make a living
again.

21
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,460
But the Chinese Communist Party spun it

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,890
as if *they* lifted people out of poverty—

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,470
even though it was actually Chinese people
themselves

24
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,440
who worked their way out of poverty once the
Party

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,440
backed off a bit on those communist economic
policies.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,110
Here’s how Chinese Chinese state-run media
covers it:

27
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,060
China lifts millions of people out of poverty.

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,500
The Communist Party has gotten respected

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,900
global institutions like the World Bank

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,680
to carry that same line.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,060
Then Chinese state-run media repeat their
propaganda,

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,210
this time citing the World Bank to make it
sound legit.

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,030
Then Western media pick up the story because
the World Bank said it.

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,420
So all the credit for “lifting people out
of poverty” goes to “China”—

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,420
i.e.

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,150
The Chinese Communist Party.

37
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,560
And nowhere does that article mention how
the Chinese Communist Party

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,510
put all those people in poverty in the first
place!

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,670
It’s like you throw someone overboard,

40
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,740
watch them struggle to swim, and then eventually

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,319
you throw them a rope and watch them claw
their way back to the boat.

42
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,500
And now you’re the hero for saving them.

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,150
The Chinese Communist Party has repeated the
same playbook over and over—

44
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,100
like with faking GDP growth,

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,790
or covering up their shady organ transplant
business,

46
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,819
or hiding how they’re putting Uighurs in
concentration camps.

47
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,970
And now, we’re seeing that same propaganda
machine at work

48
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,760
with the deadly coronavirus disease.

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,810
It’s only been a few months,

50
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,120
and the virus is spreading globally.

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,209
And we’re seeing headlines like this in
Western media:

52
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,000
“The First Signs Are Emerging That China's
Coronavirus Containment

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,350
Could Be Working”.

54
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,580
And “Can China’s COVID-19 strategy work
elsewhere?”

55
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,590
Yes, says the Wall Street Journal!

56
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,610
“Drastic measures—similar to those deployed
by China

57
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,190
and imposed in parts of Italy—

58
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,390
to contain the epidemic are now overdue elsewhere.”

59
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,459
So let’s back up, and look at how the Communist
Party

60
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,580
went from massively screwing up the initial
response to the outbreak,

61
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,230
to convincing the world that they did everything
right all along.

62
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,270
Starting with...

63
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,900
Step 1: A Massive Coverup

64
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,250
As of now, the first case of the coronavirus
disease,

65
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,000
Covid-19, can be traced back to November 17,
2019.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,330
“By the final day of 2019, the number of
confirmed cases had risen to 266.”

67
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,790
But the Chinese Communist Party responded,

68
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,519
not by implementing health measures,

69
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,250
but by covering up what was happening.

70
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,150
They detained people who talked about it online.

71
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,379
They arrested the first doctors who reported
on it.

72
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,099
As an important political meeting took place
in Wuhan,

73
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:04,590
officials spent two weeks saying there were
“no new cases of infection,

74
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,750
no firm evidence of human transmission and
no infection of medical workers.”

75
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,640
Those were all lies.

76
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,510
In fact, the coronavirus was already spreading
outside China.

77
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,699
By mid-January, there were so many cases that
the Chinese Communist Party

78
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,300
realized they couldn’t continue to cover
it up.

79
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,110
It was time for...

80
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,260
Step 2: A Declaration of War

81
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,370
Haha, what cover up?!

82
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,220
We’re fighting a war against the coronavirus!

83
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,340
Communist Party leader Xi Jinping came out
and said

84
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,690
China will “resolutely curb” the outbreak
of the virus.

85
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,810
That’s right about when the number of reported
coronavirus cases tripled.

86
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,930
The coronavirus wasn’t actually spreading
faster.

87
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,370
It just got politically riskier for local
officials to cover it up.

88
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,030
Especially after central authorities announced
that

89
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,490
“lower-ranking officials who covered up
the spread of the virus would

90
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,210
‘be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.’”

91
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,620
Then the Communist Party pivoted to...

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,520
Step 3: Ruthless Authoritarianism

93
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,360
By the end of January,

94
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,560
China was reporting almost 12,000 cases of
infection and 259 deaths.

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,770
And those were just the official statistics,

96
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,570
so the real numbers were probably much higher.

97
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:32,350
Authorities put an entire province of 58 million
people under lockdown...

98
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,290
and restricted the movements of more than
half the country

99
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,080
in one way or another.

100
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,770
On the ground, local authorities rounded up
infected people

101
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,190
and put them into mass quarantine centers.

102
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,010
Even though the conditions were not the most
sanitary.

103
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,440
When people were caught outside without face
masks,

104
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,900
police savagely beat them...again and again.

105
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,729
Or in some cases, authorities even welded
sick people into their apartments.

106
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,729
And they made sure to censor “negative”
news about the coronavirus outbreak.

107
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,670
Including disappearing citizen journalists
into indefinite quarantines.

108
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,190
Did it work?

109
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,190
Well, I’ll tell you what didn’t work:

110
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,040
The people of China.

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,550
They were told not to go back to work.

112
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,880
And China’s manufacturing hit a record low.

113
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,320
But soon, the Chinese Communist Party saw
this as a huge problem—

114
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,780
because their political legitimacy is based
on

115
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,820
delivering continuous economic growth.

116
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,949
Clearly, it was time for...

117
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,050
Step 4: Announcing They’ve Won

118
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,750
The Communist Party has no choice politically

119
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,169
but to get people to go back to work and revive
the economy.

120
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,550
So that’s what they’ve told people to
do now.

121
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,919
First, state-run media started pushing the
narrative

122
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,160
that the number of coronavirus infections
was on the decline.

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,210
They started doing this back in mid-February.

124
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,790
Even though at the time they were

125
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,540
(a) only talking about areas outside the main
epicenter of Hubei province,

126
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,060
and (b) being misleading.

127
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,100
The total number of infections was not actually
declining.

128
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,320
There were still new infections every day,

129
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,729
but the number of *new* infections per day
was declining.

130
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:28,449
They’re saying it had gone from this, to
this.

131
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,280
So it’s still going up!

132
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,220
But forget about that.

133
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,120
The Chinese Communist Party leaders

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,039
wanted you to believe the coronavirus was
on the decline in China.

135
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,539
And that they controlled it in only three
weeks!

136
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,630
But here’s the rub:

137
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,450
Communist Party leaders didn’t actually
believe it themselves.

138
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,050
If they did, they wouldn’t have canceled

139
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,870
their own hugely important political meeting
in March.

140
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,940
So yes, Chinese leaders were...putting a good
face on things.

141
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,450
And that’s why, while they were implementing
ruthless authoritarianism,

142
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,940
and announcing they’d won, they were also...

143
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,660
Step 5: Co-Opting Respected Global Institutions

144
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,729
...institutions like the World Health Organization,
or W.H.O.

145
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,340
This report on the coronavirus comes from
a joint mission

146
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,889
between the W.H.O and the Chinese government.

147
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,830
It says, “China has rolled out perhaps the
most ambitious,

148
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,240
agile and aggressive disease containment effort
in history.”

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
In fact, the leader of the Joint Mission said,

150
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,509
“Hundreds of thousands of people in China
did not get COVID-19

151
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,129
because of this aggressive response.”

152
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:49,189
Don’t worry, he’s basing that on data
given to the W.H.O. by Chinese scientists.

153
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:53,279
And here’s what the head of the W.H.O. had
to say.

154
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,699
“Almost all member states are praising China
for what they did.

155
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:05,610
China took action massively at the epicenter,

156
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,980
at the source of the outbreak.”

157
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,589
Here’s another W.H.O. official.

158
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:11,769
“If I had COVID-19,

159
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,230
I’d want to be treated in China.”

160
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,119
If you’re wondering how on earth the W.H.O.

161
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:21,959
would be willing to lavish such praise on
the Chinese Communist Party,

162
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,800
even though *this* is happening on the ground...

163
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,310
...I suggest you go back and watch my episode
from February 22

164
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,040
called “Coronavirus: How WHO Corruption
Helped It Spread”.

165
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,510
Suffice it to say, when respected global institutions
take Chinese money,

166
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,180
sometimes it colors their vision.

167
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,470
And impaires their hearing.

168
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,170
And after co-opting the W.H.O.,

169
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,880
the Chinese Communist Party has been...

170
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,699
Step 6: Repeating the Praise in State-Run
Media

171
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,179
Oh, look!

172
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,149
The W.H.O. head praises China’s efforts
to curb the coronavirus!

173
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,049
Even the head of the United Nations has praised
China’s efforts!

174
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:08,889
Here’s a video released by state-run CGTN
showing

175
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:13,730
how the Communist Party has done such\h a
good job fighting the coronavirus,

176
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,389
that they’re now sending a team of Chinese
experts to help Italy.

177
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,380
“China has sent a special medical team to
Italy

178
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,370
to assist with control efforts there.

179
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,269
It comes after China's foreign minister told
his Italian counterpart

180
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,730
that Beijing stood ready to help.

181
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,730
And after pushing that message through English-language
state-run media,

182
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,790
the stage is set for...

183
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,429
Step 7: Getting Western Media to Praise China

184
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,649
Now that the Chinese Communist Party has claimed

185
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,290
it’s won against the coronavirus,

186
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,760
and co-opted global institutions to agree,

187
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,299
and pushed that message aggressively in its
own state-run media,

188
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:55,930
it seems Western media are willing to pick
up the narrative.

189
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,119
Here’s a video from South China Morning
Post.

190
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:02,279
“A 7-member team was sent to Italy,

191
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,279
the worst-hit country after China.”

192
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,610
Hmmm... that footage looks familiar.

193
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,139
Here’s an article from the Associated Press:

194
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:15,079
“W.H.O. chief praises China’s virus fight,

195
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,569
urges more from world”

196
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:21,610
That article does not mention the Chinese
Communist Party’s coverup,

197
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:25,009
or its ruthless authoritarianism.

198
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:28,459
And the Associated Press is a *newswire* service,

199
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,860
so that article got picked up by potentially
hundreds of other Western media.

200
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,839
And here’s a report from Reuters—

201
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,399
another newswire service.

202
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,769
“It’s a sign Chinese efforts to contain
coronavirus are working.

203
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,119
President Xi Jinping visited its epicenter,
Wuhan, on Tuesday,

204
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,959
for the first time since the outbreak began.

205
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,749
His arrival in the city where coronavirus
is understood

206
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:53,679
o have taken hold late last year

207
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,179
could suggest China is about to declare victory
in the battle.

208
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,959
Xi visiting those who were on the frontline:

209
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,380
health workers, soldiers, police, and volunteers.”

210
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:15,009
Wow, thanks Reuters—

211
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:20,050
for creating a story entirely based on Chinese
state-media footage,

212
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,149
and then pushing that pre-packaged video out
to

213
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,709
the thousands of Western TV channels

214
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,109
that subscribe to your newsfeed!

215
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:31,310
And also, thanks for not questioning any of
it.

216
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,949
Including how, when the video cuts to show
Xi Jinping

217
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,850
talking to the guy in the hospital,

218
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,579
he’s actually not talking directly to the
guy.

219
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:43,070
It’s through a TV screen nine feet away.

220
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,300
As if the coronavirus could get through the
TV screen.

221
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,079
And here’s a reporter from the New York
Times interviewed on MSNBC.

222
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,709
“China has had enormous success in beating
down its epidemic.”

223
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:03,129
He goes on for a full 5 minutes about how
great China’s approach is.

224
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,660
He makes the Chinese medical system look really
competent,

225
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,290
when that’s just not the reality most people
on the ground have been facing.

226
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,410
Although, in a way he’s right...

227
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,279
“China has had enormous success in beating
down its epidemic.”

228
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,619
Clearly, a lot of Western media organizations

229
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,709
are not as skeptical as they should be

230
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:27,319
when it comes to Chinese government propaganda.

231
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:30,179
Which means now, we’re going to see...

232
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:34,329
Step 8: China Saves Us All

233
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:38,139
The natural extension of this is that, since
the Chinese Communist Party

234
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,970
has done such a great job beating the coronavirus—

235
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,290
Oh, sorry, wrong clip.

236
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,459
“If I had COVID-19, I’d want to be treated
in China.”

237
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,790
Thank you.

238
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,239
—now it’s time to learn from China!

239
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,809
If only we could implement

240
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:56,139
the same great system here in the West!

241
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,649
Western media: Take it away!

242
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,149
“Can China's COVID-19 strategy work elsewhere?”

243
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:05,559
“Drastic measures—similar to those deployed
by China...

244
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,540
to contain the epidemic are now overdue elsewhere.”

245
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,059
Yes, but could you put it even more clearly?

246
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:17,319
“China saves its people as democracies slaughter
theirs”.

247
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,169
And it’s not just the idea that

248
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:22,040
China’s repressive authoritarian communist
system

249
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,809
has done a great job at containing the coronavirus
inside China.

250
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:26,809
I

251
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,230
t’s also the idea that China’s repressive
authoritarian communist system

252
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,209
has saved the rest of the world.

253
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:35,490
Back in February,

254
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,319
Chinese state-run media started rolling out
the idea t

255
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:43,350
hat China was buying the world time by controlling
the epidemic.

256
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,339
In fact, they made claims about how the fact
that China

257
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:49,669
had 99% of the world’s coronavirus cases

258
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:53,009
proved that they were helping the world.

259
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,540
You have the most coronavirus,

260
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,850
which means you’re the best?

261
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,079
Got it.

262
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,809
Of course, as the coronavirus continued to
spread around the world,

263
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,499
the Chinese Communist Party couldn’t claim
that

264
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,720
they had successfully contained it in China
anymore.

265
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,819
But the idea that their massive lockdown bought
the rest of the world time,

266
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,600
well, that took hold.

267
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,519
Like in this New York Times headline.

268
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,359
And that’s how the Chinese Communist Party
has taken

269
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:23,179
what should have been a devastating PR disaster,

270
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,589
and turned it into a propaganda win.

271
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:28,260
I really gotta tip my hat to them.

272
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,660
They’re truly the best.

273
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,730
And now that we’re busy trying to drag *ourselves*
out of the water,

274
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,739
we’ve totally forgotten who threw us overboard
in the first place.

275
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:45,259
But there are still some pesky Western media
that haven’t forgotten.

276
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,249
And they’re blaming China.

277
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:50,549
Which is why the Communist Party’s propaganda
machine

278
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,619
has created a new spin,

279
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,779
by tapping into a hot-button issue Western
media organizations

280
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,869
love to report on:

281
00:15:58,869 --> 00:15:59,869
Racism!

282
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,559
That’s something I’ll be talking about
in our next episode.

283
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,220
For now, be sure to share this episode,

284
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,410
so your friends and family know the truth.

285
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,600
Don’t let the Chinese Communist Party’s
propaganda win the day.

286
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,020
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

287
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,920
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

288
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,080
See you next time.
