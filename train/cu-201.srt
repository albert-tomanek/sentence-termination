1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:02,899
The Chinese regime is furious

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,220
over the arrest of the Huawei CFO in Canada

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,759
If she’s extradited to the US,

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,840
there could be trouble.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,639
Meanwhile, China authorities have abducted
Canadian citizens

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,900
as Trump prepares his next move in the US-China
Trade War.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,060
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,310
The CFO of one of China’s biggest telecom
companies,

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,480
Huawei, has been released on bail.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,390
Meng Wanzhou was arrested during

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,830
a plane transfer last week in Canada

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,030
and now faces extradition to the United States,

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,880
where, if convicted, she could face up to
30 years in jail.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,430
The conditions of her release were steep.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,110
The bail was set at 10 million Canadian dollars,

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,860
which is about 7 million US.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,530
Plus, “Among conditions of her bail,

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,600
the 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle
monitor

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,230
and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.”

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,690
That means she’s going to miss out on

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,560
the thrilling Canadian nightlife.

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,620
But don’t worry,

23
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,720
Meng can still greet her friends and supporters
at home.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,729
Like these guys, who showed up with flowers
at her mansion.

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,460
Which is exactly the same kind of treatment

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,100
Chinese dissidents get when they’re under
house arrest.

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,229
In addition to that,

28
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,310
“Five friends pledged equity in their homes

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,759
and other money as a guarantee she will not
flee.”

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,229
You know, sometimes it takes

31
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,929
getting arrested for violating sanctions on
Iran

32
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,170
to find out who your real friends are.

33
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,869
I’m sure that if something like that ever
happened to me,

34
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,380
Shelley would do the same.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,560
Shelley?

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,100
Why aren’t you saying anything?

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,320
Fine, I guess we aren’t real friends.

38
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,289
Now China’s Foreign Ministry has called
the arrest a mistake.

39
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,740
“We have already made our position clear

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,329
to the United States and Canada,

41
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,759
that they should immediately correct their
mistake

42
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,560
and release Meng Wanzhou.”

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,009
He went on to say,

44
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,329
“Any person, especially if it is a leader
of the United States,

45
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,670
or a high-level figure,

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,320
who is willing to make positive efforts to
push this situation

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,749
toward the correct direction,

48
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,209
then that, of course, deserves to be well
received.”

49
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,840
I’m sorry,

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,469
“Any person,

51
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,050
especially if it is a leader of the United
States?”

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,800
I wonder who Lu Kang could be talking about.

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,190
Well, President Trump responded.

54
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,730
With a resounding, maybe.

55
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,120
In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump
said,

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,660
“If I think it’s good for what will be
certainly

57
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,970
the largest trade deal ever made—

58
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,360
which is a very important thing—

59
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,780
what’s good for national security—

60
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,450
I would certainly intervene if I thought it
was necessary.”

61
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,160
Which I guess is Trump-speak for let’s make
a deal.

62
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,790
Trump has been promising a yuge increase in
tariffs on Chinese goods,

63
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,320
unless China will come to an agreement he
likes

64
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,820
within a 90-day window that’s already ticking
down.

65
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,010
Billions of dollars are on the line.

66
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,620
But Meng’s arrest has made it more complicated.

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,740
Chinese state-run media had warned there would
be

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,570
“severe consequences” for Meng’s arrest.

69
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,900
“It added yet another point of tension

70
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,180
between Washington and Beijing.”

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,900
And not just for Washington.

72
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,270
Also for Ottawa.

73
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,700
That’s...the capital of Canada.

74
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,010
“On Tuesday, Canada confirmed that one its
citizens,

75
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,330
a former Canadian diplomat, was detained there.”

76
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,570
China has detained Canadian citizen Michael
Kovrig.

77
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,170
He’s a former diplomat, at one point serving
as

78
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,080
the vice consul at Canada’s embassy in Beijing.

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,160
He was working for the NGO International Crisis
Group

80
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,670
and was abducted on Monday.

81
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,460
I mean, arrested.

82
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,580
Chinese authorities have publicly stated their
arrest of Kovrig

83
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,790
totally has nothing to do with Meng Wanzhou.

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,460
He was arrested simply because his NGO

85
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,470
was violating Chinese law by not being registered
in China.

86
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,540
Amnesty International says the Chinese government

87
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,470
has created new laws regulating NGOs specifically
for this purpose.

88
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:55,010
“The Chinese government recently enacted
a law

89
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,610
governing the activities of foreign NGO

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,600
so they all have to be officially registered
in China,

91
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,490
which is very difficult for many of them to
do,

92
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,900
and therefore because it’s so difficult,

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,440
a lot of times it's impossible to do work
without,

94
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,870
in effect, breaking the law.”

95
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,919
“That creates the situation, a lot of the
time,

96
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,009
the Chinese government can ignore that,

97
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,000
but when they need to or when they want to,

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,650
they can always point to this so-called illegal
activity

99
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,090
by foreign NGO workers and take actions if
they want to.”

100
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,780
And as a former Canadian ambassador to China
said,

101
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,569
“In China there are no coincidences ...

102
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,870
If they want to send you a message they will
send you a message.”

103
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,639
But China’s fast and loose approach to the
law

104
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,159
is actually part of the reason they won’t
understand

105
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,610
why this is a bad idea.

106
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,349
According to a former Canadian ambassador,

107
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:53,900
“It won’t work.

108
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,060
The Canadian court system

109
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,820
is not susceptible to pressure.

110
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,039
It is truly independent.”

111
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,139
Of course all of this should sound very familiar.

112
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,740
In 2014, Canada arrested a Chinese businessman

113
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,879
accused of stealing US military secrets.

114
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,219
And not long after,

115
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:12,879
Chinese authorities arrested a Canadian couple
living in China.

116
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,229
In the end, the Chinese businessman

117
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:15,690
was still extradited to the US,

118
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,439
and the Canadian couple spent two years in
prison

119
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,210
and house arrest before being deported.

120
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,340
Actually that spy case was pretty complicated
and interesting,

121
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,370
so let me know in the comments if you’d
like me to do

122
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,770
a China Uncensored episode about it.

123
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,190
Anyway, the point is,

124
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,629
if you mess with Chinese citizens for breaking
your laws,

125
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:35,939
the Chinese Communist Party won’t hesitate
to

126
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,330
break China’s laws to mess with your citizens.

127
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,650
In fact, in addition to Michael Kovrig,

128
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,440
Chinese authorities have also abducted, uh,

129
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,250
detained another Canadian citizen named Michael
Spavor.

130
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,289
If you’re a Canadian named Michael,

131
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,499
maybe now is a good time to leave China.

132
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,949
Spavor started a company in China that promotes

133
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:57,620
cultural exchanges with North Korea,

134
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,009
and he had helped arrange Dennis Rodman’s
first trip there.

135
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,729
Chinese authorities say that both Michaels
are being investigated

136
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,120
for “activities that endangered China’s
national security.”

137
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,539
It’s interesting to note that Chinese authorities

138
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,379
have only detained Canadians so far.

139
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,559
Maybe because they realize that taking Americans

140
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,819
would bring things to a whole new level.

141
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,539
Meanwhile, the US State Department is considering

142
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:23,130
issuing a travel warning to US citizens going
to China.

143
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,250
Just to be safe.

144
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,969
So what do you think of the arrest of Meng
Wanzhou

145
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,749
and the detention of Michael Kovrig and Michael
Spavor?

146
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:30,699
Leave your comments below.

147
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:32,870
And now it’s the time you’ve all been
waiting for,

148
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,499
when I answer questions from a member of my
50-Cent Army,

149
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:37,790
fans who support China Uncensored

150
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,029
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

151
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,530
Pekka Saari asks,

152
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,110
“Winston from serpentza said in his last
live stream

153
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,930
that you're political propaganda channel

154
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,199
paid by the Falun Gong,

155
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,029
are you going to respond?

156
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:54,180
Ah, the China Uncensored funding conspiracy
theories.

157
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,059
I’ve heard a lot over the years,

158
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,870
usually that we’re funded by the CIA,

159
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,439
or Falun Gong, or just vague “anti-China
forces.”

160
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,129
Now typically I hear that from professional
Chinese trolls,

161
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,410
so I was actually a bit surprised

162
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,729
to hear that coming from Winston.

163
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,259
I actually like a lot of his videos,

164
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,730
even though we don’t always see eye to eye.

165
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,349
And I know he tries to be accurate with his
information,

166
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,539
so I was surprised to hear he jumped on

167
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:19,539
that conspiracy theory bandwagon.

168
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,139
Anyway, he’s wrong about this.

169
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,259
We’ve been very open about where

170
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,939
the funding for China Uncensored comes from.

171
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,349
About 20% is from YouTube ad revenue,

172
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,879
and the other 80% is from people like you:

173
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,110
Our roughly 2,000 supporters on Patreon.

174
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,400
Now that being said, I want to make something
very clear—

175
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,629
I am totally open to secret funding.

176
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:41,689
Especially from the CIA.

177
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,339
They have loads of money!

178
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,999
Then maybe our studio could look more like
this.

179
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:46,999
Instead of this.

180
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,960
Anyway, I hope that answers your question,
Pekka.

181
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,129
And if you’d like your question answered
on the show,

182
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,749
join the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army on
Patreon.

183
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:57,759
Remember, 80% of our revenue comes from you
guys.

184
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,069
And as a way of saying thanks,

185
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,499
I’ll give you some cool perks,

186
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,089
as well as answering your questions on the
show.

187
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,089
Thanks for watching.

188
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,040
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

189
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
See you next time.
