00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,259
On this episode of China Uncensored, the China-UK
relationship has gone nuclear!

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:12,710
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,419
Oh ho man!

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:20,269
Chinese leader Xi Jinping just got done with
an amazing tour of the United Kingdom.

5
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,970
And believe me, it was way better than hanging
out with that stick in the mud Barack Obama

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,660
Let's sample the delicate aroma of our fine
wine.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:44,800
Pff, c'mon, put on your sunglasses, 'cause
it's time to party with the British entourage!

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,370
And then head to the pub to pound back a few
brews with the Prime Minister.

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,370
Yes, the old world knows how to throw an old
school party.

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,250
And like Chinese media said, it was a "redder
than red carpet welcome."

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,141
And to celebrate Great Britain's new so-called
"Golden Era of Relations" with China, what

12
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:10,840
better way than to ride with the queen in
her golden carriage?

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,250
The queen even gave Xi a tour of her personal
collection of Chinese treasures.

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,250
Halooo!

15
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,689
How do you enjoy all the beautiful things
we stole from your country?

16
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,560
Sorry about the Opium Wars.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,830
Anyway, the message was clear.

18
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,659
Britain is now China's "best friend."

19
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,530
And the "most open country" to Chinese investment.

20
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,929
And also the least open to frank dialog about
human rights.

21
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:41,159
Judging by how British police kept all the
protesters behind metal barriers like cattle.

22
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,969
And how the government prevented reporters
from having any meaningful access to the Chinese

23
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:47,829
leader during his entire visit.

24
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,369
And probably all of Britain's..."self-restraint,"
shall we say...impressed Xi Jinping.

25
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:59,729
Because he signed an extra 16 billion dollars
in trade deals, compared to what was originally

26
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,729
planned.

27
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,640
Oh man, Li Ka-Ching!

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,099
The UK is raking in it!

29
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:10,270
This worked out way better than the time in
2012 when David Cameron met with the Dalai

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,870
Lama and China was all pissy.

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,650
I mean, what can the Dalai Lama do for you?!

32
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,060
Inner peace?!

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,470
Yeah, whatever.

34
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,260
And Cameron made a very good point: "The stronger
our economic, trading, business and other

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,210
partnerships, the stronger our relationship
and the more able we are to have the necessary

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,970
and frank discussions about other issues."

37
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,930
It's the same logic former US President Bill
Clinton used back in 2000 when he pushed to

38
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,760
open up permanent trade relations with China.

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,350
And look at how well that's worked out!

40
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,810
I mean, China's human rights situation is
the best it's been in...um, wow, ok that's

41
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,850
a pretty low bar.

42
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,040
But anyway, the biggest deal to come out of
this new golden era of relations is the announcement

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,120
that China will invest a 30 percent stake
in the construction of a nuclear reactor at

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,660
England's Hinkley Point power station.

45
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,680
Is letting China build a nuclear reactor in
the UK a good idea?

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,350
Some people don't think so.

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,330
For example Britain's own intelligence agents.

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,590
There seems to be a concern that allowing
a Chinese state-owned company to work on the

49
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,760
nuclear reactor could give them an opportunity
to insert backdoor traps into the technology.

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,700
That could allow the Chinese regime to shut
down the reactor in the event that the UK

51
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,590
decides to, you know, "hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people" by say, acknowledging

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,510
Taiwanese independence.

53
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,060
According to an anonymous security source
quoted by the Times, "There is a big division

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,780
between the money men and the security side...

55
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,710
The Treasury is in the lead and it isn't listening
to anyone--they see China as an opportunity,

56
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,030
but we see the threat."

57
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,420
There's also a general concern from economists
that while the UK is buying up everything

58
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,770
China has to offer, there's not much money
flowing the other way.

59
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,090
But perhaps most disconcerting is how this
affects the West's ability to deal with the

60
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,500
Chinese regime.

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,160
Up until now, the West has been able to collectively
bargain with China, albeit not with overwhelming

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,410
success.

63
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,570
They pressure China to, for example, follow
international law, improve human rights, et

64
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,570
cetera.

65
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,419
But now the UK has just sent the message that
we won't even raise those concerns if the

66
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,049
price is right.

67
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,849
So other countries may start to feel pressure
to do the same.

68
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:31,710
This also affects the US's ability to get
the UK's support in its dealings with China.

69
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,169
I mean, what happened to the good old days
when the UK would follow whatever hair brained

70
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:38,229
scheme America came up with?

71
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,990
Also, you know, it might not be wise for the
UK to lean too hard on a country that could

72
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,879
face a major economic crash or regime toppling
political instability--and both of those could

73
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,460
easily happen within the next decade.

74
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,650
And when that happens, all that glitters might
not be gold in the golden age of UK-China

75
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,650
relations.

76
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,650
So what do you think?

77
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,580
How many billions of dollars would you require
in exchange for letting China build a nuclear

78
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,710
reactor in your back yard?
