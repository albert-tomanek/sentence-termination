00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,400
thanksgiving is coming to China!

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,479
And just like the American one...

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,600
it hides a tale of mass carnage.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,280
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,260
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,030
Local officials in Wenchuan County,

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,600
in the Sichuan Province of China

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,070
have created a new holiday.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,970
It’s called Thanksgiving Day.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,690
Is it a day where people remember a bountiful
feast

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,850
between Communist Party officials

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,539
and the Tibetans they saved from

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,899
the clutches of the evil Dalai Lama,

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,280
thanks to the brilliant guidance

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,700
of the Great Helmsman Mao Zedong?

17
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,260
Not quite.

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,399
Actually, Wenchuan officials created

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,140
the new Thanksgiving Day

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,809
to commemorate the massive earthquake

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,970
that hit Sichuan province in 2008.

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,809
Wenchuan was the hardest hit area.

23
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,670
And if it seems weird to give thanks

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,739
on the date of a huge natural disaster...

25
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,770
welcome to life under the Chinese Communist
Party.

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,590
May 12 was the ten year anniversary

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,190
of the 7.9-magnitude quake, which killed 70,000
people—

28
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,340
according to official numbers from the Communist
Party.

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,640
Others put that number at closer to 300,000.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,750
But the most heartbreaking

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,310
and controversial part of this disaster

32
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,890
was that thousands of children died

33
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,700
when their schools collapsed

34
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,270
because of cheap construction.

35
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,450
It turns out,

36
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,220
local officials embezzled money

37
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,369
meant for construction materials,

38
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,200
particularly for public schools.

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,220
There used to be a school under these rocks.

40
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,220
According to locals,

41
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,799
the Chinese officials who were responsible
for that

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,040
have not been held accountable.

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
In fact,

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,229
they went on to embezzle reimbursement funds,
too.

45
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,759
And “parents and the local people who reported
on the officials

46
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,120
or who wanted to appeal are still under surveillance.”

47
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,430
So...what about this terrible tragedy

48
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,939
makes it Thanksgiving Day?

49
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,899
Enter the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda
department.

50
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,689
State-run Xinhua News writes about these

51
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,179
new “beautiful, tidy buildings”...

52
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,519
...and about the local people who expressed

53
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,350
how thankful they were for the

54
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,599
“gushing springs of generosity”

55
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,939
that came from real donations

56
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,549
from Chinese people around the country.

57
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,379
But more importantly,

58
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,799
they expressed thanks for all the hard work

59
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,620
and dedication of Chinese Communist Party
officials.

60
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,319
Not the ones who embezzled all the money.

61
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,489
We don’t talk about them.

62
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,659
And the people who lost their only child

63
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,340
because of corrupt officials and are

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,719
still trying to get justice from the government?

65
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,769
They’re under house arrest.

66
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,269
At the time, the earthquake was a hugely sensitive
issue.

67
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,439
So it should come as no surprise

68
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,279
that the Wenchuan officials’ decision

69
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:53,099
to call the tenth anniversary of this disaster
“Thanksgiving Day”

70
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,239
was not well received by everyone in China.

71
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,019
That online post has since been deleted.

72
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,480
Censors have been scrubbing the internet

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,719
in the lead up to the sensitive anniversary.

74
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,749
It’s so sensitive,

75
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:09,930
that AFP journalists were even harassed by
plainclothes police

76
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,989
for trying to write a feel good piece

77
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,559
about a famous pig that survived the earthquake.

78
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,209
Maybe because it could make people question

79
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,419
why a pig survived but not thousands of schoolkids.

80
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,419
Over the years,

81
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,809
the Communist Party has been a little nervous
about

82
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:29,879
any artistic commemoration of the earthquake.

83
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,229
Artist Ai Weiwei created this three-and-a-half-hour
long recording

84
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,720
of people reading five thousand names of dead
children.

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,609
He was also detained for months and beaten
up by police

86
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:45,639
for trying to find out all the names of the
children who died.

87
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,599
And Chinese writer Tan Zuoren spent five years
in prison

88
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,979
after trying to investigate the corruption

89
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,840
that led to the collapsed schools.

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,849
But you know what?

91
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:58,760
There are some artists that really get it—

92
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,569
artists that have earned enthusiastic support
from the state.

93
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,449
A month after the earthquake,

94
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,869
one Chinese literary figure wrote a poem called

95
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:10,349
“A Tearful Request for the Earthquake Survivors.”

96
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,269
In it, “He implored parents to stop their
protests.

97
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:17,750
He suggested the parents were being used

98
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,740
by those with ‘ulterior motives’ and by
‘anti-Chinese forces.’”

99
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,060
It’s not very thankful of the parents to
protest, is it?

100
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,210
But the Sichuan earthquake is not unique.

101
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,400
This is usually how the Party always responds

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,389
to what it calls “sudden incidents.”

103
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,169
Sudden incidents are a broad group

104
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,449
that includes accidents, natural disasters,
and...protests.

105
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,300
That’s why, according to Professor of History

106
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,090
at Simon Fraser University, Jeremy Brown,

107
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,810
“Instead of being transparent,

108
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,729
or treating accident victims compassionately,

109
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,479
the impulse is to cover it up,

110
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:56,810
and target them for surveillance and crackdowns.

111
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,740
Because that’s what you do to a protest,
right?”

112
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,569
Officials are basically incentivized to cover
things up.

113
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,080
That’s why anytime there is a sudden event,

114
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,669
the Party follows the same protocol—

115
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,820
suppress critical voices,

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,449
and talk about how good the government did.

117
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,930
Remember the mysterious Tianjin explosions
in 2015?

118
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,949
Sure, the firefighters were woefully unprepared
to deal with it.

119
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,270
But don’t pay attention to that!

120
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,820
Focus instead on state-run newspaper articles

121
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,930
about Chinese leaders urging an all-out effort
to save people!

122
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,620
And in 2012, Beijing suffered major flooding

123
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,530
after unusually severe rains.

124
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,909
But state-run CCTV didn’t cover much about

125
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:43,629
how the newly built drainage systems were
so bad

126
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,189
that 37 people died from the flooding.

127
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,189
No!

128
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,580
They ran this footage of dedicated rescue
workers

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,719
keeping everything safe.

130
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,300
Plus this friendly reminder to locals.

131
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,520
“Furthermore, there's a must follow order.

132
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,099
No one can die inside of Beijing.

133
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:03,419
Local officials would be held accountable
if anyone did.”

134
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,719
And I would feel awful if my death

135
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,360
inconvenienced my beloved local officials.

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,909
Or here’s an oldie but a goodie.

137
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,180
And it involves our old friend Zhou Yongkang,

138
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,169
the purged top Party official,

139
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,439
Jiang Zemin lackey,

140
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,509
and live-action Thwomp.

141
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:21,659
In 1994,

142
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,590
he was an official in the state-run oil company

143
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,979
China National Petroleum Corporation.

144
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,740
His company ran an oil town in Xinjiang called
Karamay.

145
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,060
A short circuit sparked a fire in the Karamay
Friendship Theater,

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,180
where about 300 school children were being
visited

147
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,159
by high ranking local officials.

148
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,680
Don’t worry, they all made it out alive.

149
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
The officials.

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,530
Not the children, they all died.

151
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,229
“According to survivors,

152
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,870
a woman who had either helped organize the
performance

153
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,719
or was a government official immediately stood
up

154
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,999
and told everybody to be quiet,

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,080
sit still, and let the leaders go first.

156
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,400
Unfortunately, by the time the leaders had
finished exiting

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,210
the fire had spread out beyond control.”

158
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,479
Of course footage shows

159
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,840
the quick response of rescue teams...

160
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,689
well after the fire.

161
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,419
Zhou Yongkang took charge in the aftermath,

162
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:16,120
by “not giving in to the demands of the
parents,

163
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,020
who then became targeted as troublemakers

164
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,580
and came under surveillance themselves.”

165
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,159
And then he made a touching speech where he
said,

166
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,909
“I believe that all of the little boys and
girls in their graves

167
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,569
would hope for Karamay to be stable.

168
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,629
Be steadfast in opposing whatever words and
deeds

169
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,629
are not conducive to stability.”

170
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:39,690
Excuse me, so beautiful.

171
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,460
Zhou Yongkang, by the way,

172
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,020
was the person in charge of

173
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,909
the Chinese Communist Party’s security apparatus

174
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,639
during the Sichuan earthquake.

175
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,550
I guess he really led by example.

176
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,479
I mean, frankly, everyday should be Thanksgiving
Day,

177
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,340
because every day is a day to remember

178
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,319
how the Chinese Communist Party saved China.

179
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,099
You see, before the Communist Party took over
in 1949,

180
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,229
accidents were common in China.

181
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,419
Presumably, because the evil capitalist system
exploited people.

182
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,400
But accidents seemed to totally stop under
Communism!

183
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,550
As Professor Jeremy Brown discovered,

184
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,729
if you read state-run People’s Daily,

185
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,029
“There were no accidents in China

186
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:25,699
between about 1956 and the 1980s...

187
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,050
It just stopped.

188
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,340
There were a few mentions of accidents in
capitalist countries,

189
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,289
as proof that capitalist countries exploited
their workers

190
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,710
and didn’t care about safety.

191
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,430
But there were actually no accidents in China

192
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,110
openly reported for the rest of the Mao period.”

193
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,410
And that’s why May 12 will not be known
as

194
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,680
the day thousands of schoolchildren died

195
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,709
because of government corruption.

196
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,660
But as Thanksgiving Day—

197
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,420
a day to give thanks to the Communist Party.

198
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,940
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

199
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,120
Once again, I'm your host, Chris Chappell. See you next time.

200
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,480
Don’t go anywhere,

201
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,740
because I’m answering questions

202
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,089
from fans of the show!

203
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,100
This one comes from Hadrian Battlefury.

204
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,800
“Is there anything I can do to
help the channel?”

205
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,960
Absolutely.

206
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,840
Here’s what you can do:

207
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,160
Share the show with your friends and family.

208
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,620
The more views and fans China Uncensored has,

209
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,040
the stronger it is.

210
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,500
And if you can,

211
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,360
consider financially supporting China Uncensored
on Patreon.

212
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,570
It’s a website that lets you contribute

213
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,310
a dollar or more per episode.

214
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,730
And as a perk,

215
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,230
you get to submit questions to me

216
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,990
that I’ll answer at the end of each episode,

217
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,070

Especially the one where you get named dropped.
