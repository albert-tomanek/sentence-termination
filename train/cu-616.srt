1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,340
Welcome to tonight's
event, a panel discussion

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,660
on the hidden agenda of
China's silent invasion.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,240
Speaking of silent, please take a moment

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,963
to silence your phones.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,170
Tonight, we'll be talking

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,410
about the Chinese
Communist Party's efforts

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,350
to influence Australia
though political donations,

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,150
clandestine operations and intimidation,

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,690
and the growing awareness of these issues.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,700
Here tonight to discuss these topics

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,240
and how they are affecting Australia,

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,250
I'm joined by three panelists.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,840
Dr. Feng Chongyi, Associate
Professor in China Studies

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,900

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,810
and an adjunct professor of History

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,090
at Nankai University, Tianjin.

Dr. Feng's current research,
yes, round of applause.

18
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,000
(audience clapping)

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,240
Dr. Feng's current research focuses on

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,010
intellectual and political development

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,883
in modern and contemporary China.

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,250
Then, we have Dr. Kevin Carrico.

23
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,830
He teaches contemporary Chinese society

24
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,120
and modern Chinese history in the

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,500
Department of International
Studies, Languages and Culture

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,510
at Macquarie University.

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,516
Round of applause, please.

28
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:15,516
(audience clapping)

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,970
His research examines
nationalism and ethnicity

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,750
in China, Tibet, and Hong Kong.

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,370
He's also the author of The Great Han -

32
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,900
Race, Nationalism, and
Tradition in China Today.

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,470
And, finally, there are the end,

34
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,230
we're joined by Chen Yonglin.

35
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,226
Please, round of applause.

36
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:37,940
(audience clapping)

37
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,360
He is a former Chinese diplomat

38
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,940
in the Sydney Chinese Consulate

39
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,730
who defected in 2005.

40
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,550
Mr. Chen became the first
whistleblower to reveal

41
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,600
that a network of Chinese
spies exists in Australia.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,360
He's also a member of the
Australia Values Alliance

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,440
which opposes the influence
of Beijing in Australia.

44
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,870
And I'm Chris Chappell,
host of China Uncensored

45
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,260
a New York based, English
language satirical news show.

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,800
Looks at China and how
it affects the world.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,705
So, let's begin.

48
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:10,780
(audience clapping)

49
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,877
Thank you.

50
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,973
Turn on the microphones, okay.

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,760
First, let's take a look
at the overall picture.

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,420
What is the Chinese Communist
Party doing in Australia?

53
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,563
And that's an open question
to whoever likes to take it.

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,810
- I think they're, I think that

55
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,060
what the Chinese Communist Party is doing

56
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,906
is denying the full diversity of opinions

57
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:43,110
that exist within the humanity
that's broadly labeled,

58
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,840
you know, Australians of Chinese heritage,

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,093
or Chinese Australians, okay.

60
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,880
And this is an approach, of course,

61
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,230
that is taken within China

62
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,470
through the silencing of
voices that are critical of,

63
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,010
or oppositional to the government,

64
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,330
and of course, the CCP
does that very well,

65
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,563
and it's been doing it for, you know,

66
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,693
nearly 70 years, okay.

67
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,820
Having lived in the US,

68
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,810
and engaged quite a fair bit

69
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,710
with Chinese communities there,

70
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,003
and also having lived in Sydney,

71
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,150
I have found that, in
terms of media options,

72
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,100
in terms of activities,

73
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,210
I do think that there is
considerably more influence

74
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,210
from, sort of, Beijing
backed, State narratives,

75
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,200
in the media and in activities in Sydney,

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,290
than we see in most cities

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,320
that I've visited in the United States,

78
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,060
and I think that's a problematic situation

79
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,650
that needs to be dealt with more fully

80
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,770
so that the full diversity of viewpoints

81
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,670
within the community can be expressed

82
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,220
and everyone can have an opportunity

83
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,200
to participate in Australia's
democratic system.

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,740
- And Dr. Feng, in your own words,

85
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,757
what is the Chinese Communist
Party doing in Australia?

86
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,610
- (laughs)

87
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,200
I think the Chinese Communist Party today

88
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,770
is extremely successful in implementing

89
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,533
this United Front strategy in Australia.

90
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,170
With my little eyes (laughs),

91
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:29,170
I can see the extensive
network had been establish

92
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,500
in all aspects of our life in Australia.

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,250
In business, in government, in media,

94
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,130
in education, anywhere you mention,

95
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,243
you can see the very extensive
network had been created.

96
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,030
- So the next question is why is

97
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,583
the Chinese Communist Party
trying to influence Australia?

98
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,333
- Oh, should I say it?

99
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,630
Thank you, thank you.

100
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,950
Okay, talking about, sorry,

101
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,263
talking about the 2004,

102
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,470
the embassarial conference,

103
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,640
Hu Jintao

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,670
especially mentioned the
strategy on Australia.

105
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,223
It's called the peripheral,

106
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,320
it's to see Australia
as a peripheral area,

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,960
as neighboring country,

108
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,560
in China it's called
(speaks foreign language).

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,060
That's border, Grand Border Strategy.

110
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,270
So, in that time, China
start to see Australia

111
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,810
as a neighboring country,

112
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,720
but traditionally Australia
is pretty far away,

113
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,040
it's, geographically it's far away,

114
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,680
across the South China Sea.

115
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,030
And because, the decision
on this is because

116
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,860
Australia has rich of resources,

117
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,180
energy resources, high
grade mineral resources,

118
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,210
and China can rely on,

119
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,210
China to use Australia resources,

120
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,493
that's one of the main reason.

121
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:06,493
From that year, China
started FTA negotiation

122
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,660
with Australia,

123
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,023
so after 10 years, until 2015,

124
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:16,130
FTA agreement was reached.

125
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,130
But of course, China attached
many conditions on that.

126
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,650
The one thing I was to, unfortunately,

127
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,650
I was unable to get a
copy of a coded report

128
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,710
submitted by ambassador
Fu Ying at that time.

129
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,910
He proposed to the central government

130
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,830
that China can sacrifice
a lot on agricultural area

131
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,830
to exchange for Australia
political and strategically

132
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,510
compromise in area like the
ANZAC treaty with the US,

133
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,993
may be compromise if
there's any war happen

134
00:06:56,993 --> 00:07:00,753
in future across the Taiwan strait, yes.

135
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,320
- I would largely agree
with what Yonglin has said

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,373
and I'll try to remember to speak up.

137
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,230
The way that I view things is that

138
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,490
I do think there is, sort of, a narrative

139
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,790
within China, pushed
by the official media,

140
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,963
also pushed in popular culture,

141
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,513
that China is, sort of,
reemerging onto its,

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,173
you know, proper place in the
global hierarchy of nations.

143
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,560
And I believe, you know, ideally speaking,

144
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,380
that wouldn't be a bad thing,
but the issue that emerges

145
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,403
is that the political system, of course,

146
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,240
in China, poses a number of problems,

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,090
and creates

148
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,610
a situation in which

149
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,820
one finds it difficult
to be very enthusiastic

150
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,393
about what is known as, you know,

151
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,540
what is termed as the rise of China.

152
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,040
- And Dr. Feng, your thoughts?

153
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,690
- I think I have a little
different idea on that.

154
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,663
I do not see that, it
as a strength, a strong,

155
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,070
that once extend its influence outside.

156
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,600
I see it as a weakness.

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,830
We all know that the diplomacy

158
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,530
is extension of domestic politics.

159
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,873
The Chinese Communist regime back home,

160
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:40,873
especially after the collapse
of communism in 1989, 1991?

161
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:46,390
The Chinese Communist
regime had very, very strong

162
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,733
sense of regime insecurity.

163
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,830
So all these activities,
United Front strategy

164
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:58,956
aim to create favorable
international environment

165
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,930
for the survival of this outdated regime.

166
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,950
We call it post-authoritarian,

167
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,030
now surrounded by democracies
all over the world.

168
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,600
It's extremely

169
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,580
intensive insecurity,
the sense of insecurity

170
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,870
that push them to create this

171
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,900
United Front strategy for survival.

172
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,920
- Kevin, you have some thoughts?

173
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,800
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I would
say that we actually agree

174
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,320
it's just that I think there's
a considerable difference

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,690
between, sort of, the
rhetoric and the reality

176
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,940
and I would agree that, while, you know,

177
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,870
official media puts off these
airs of great confidence,

178
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,930
in reality, you know,
we are clearly talking

179
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,950
about a very, very insecure regime,

180
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,430
that spends even more on internal security

181
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,340
than it spends on military.

182
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,162
- Are you saying we can't
trust Chinese state run media?

183
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:56,130
- (laughs) I think that might
be a fair assessment, yes.

184
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,840
- Alright, well, let's move on

185
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,770
to some recent issues
with Australian politics.

186
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,930
What are some of the specific tactics

187
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,050
the Chinese Communist Party uses

188
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,943
to influence Australian politicians?

189
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,770
Chen, you might, you
used to work for them,

190
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,935
you might have some ideas.

191
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:16,960
(audience laughs)

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,980
- (laughs) Yeah, the
tactics in for Australia

193
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,470
is in China called all around diplomacy

194
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,470
establish relations with, including,

195
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,008
the final stage with Australia is called

196
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:31,220
strategic partnership,
or something like that

197
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,130
- [Chris] Sounds so friendly.

198
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,920
- Yeah, sounds very friendly.

199
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,100
And the

200
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:43,780
The work on Australia is in all around,

201
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,989
all these fields, including politically,

202
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:50,280
building up a personal relationship

203
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,690
with Australian leaders and politicians,

204
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,700
so, you can see in the past 12 years,

205
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,700
there're huge, hundreds
of Chinese leaders,

206
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,460
officials visited Australia,
to establish a relations

207
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,000
with three levels of
Australian government.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And also, China called cultural exchange,

209
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,870
actually we all know that China

210
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,778
has no culture to
exchange after communism.

211
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,735
(audience laughs and claps)

212
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:29,080
So you can now there's
almost, there's nothing

213
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,290
Australia return visit
or performance in China,

214
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,690
almost, there're only some concert,

215
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,473
a few concert, symphony,

216
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,030
a concert like that, others--

217
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,230
- Chen, I'm curious, when
an Australian politician

218
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,150
is given one of these
all-expenses paid trips to China,

219
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,623
what kind of things do they get to see?

220
00:11:55,977 --> 00:12:00,977
- They will see that Australia
economy all rely on China.

221
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,540
But Australian politician,
they see only the surface,

222
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,510
but actually China rely
on Australia resources.

223
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,340
That's why they work so hard, and,

224
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,530
but it seems Australian politician

225
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,580
easy to be persuaded, lobbied.

226
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,630
- That's a very interesting point,

227
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,960
I've heard a lot, since
I've been in Australia,

228
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,310
about how, even from
Australian politicians,

229
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,830
how reliant Australia is on
China as a trade partner,

230
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,663
but that's very interesting

231
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,600
that you say it's the other way around.

232
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,110
Kevin, I'd like to ask you,

233
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,300
if you could share some
information with us

234
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,576
about one Sam Dastyari.

235
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:43,409
(audience sniggers)

236
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:46,970
- Well, yeah, Sam Dastyari, huh,

237
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,370
what can I say about him?
(audience laughs)

238
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,767
Uh, he is, uh

239
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,331
- [Chris] Keep it, you
know, family friendly.

240
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,740
(audience laughs)
- Yeah, you know, yeah.

241
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,813
I mean, you know, as I understand,

242
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,810
these people can be very litigious.

243
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,150
But, perhaps,

244
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,220
- [Chris] That's true.

245
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,570
- Sam Dastyari

246
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,390
made friends with

247
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,200
some people

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,103
who appear to have,

249
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,010
perhaps, complicated
relationships with the party,

250
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,680
the United Front Work Department.

251
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,330
What happened, as I think we all know,

252
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,280
is that Dastyari, I think
we've established firmly,

253
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,780
made some very embarrassing statements

254
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,840
about the South China
Sea at a press conference

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that, not only went against
his own party's policies,

256
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,100
also went against
Australian national policy,

257
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,320
and also, I think is fair to say,

258
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,890
went completely against all logic

259
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,560
in terms of anybody who's actually

260
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,250
studied the history of
the South China Sea,

261
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,990
and recent developments in it.

262
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,120
- It is kind of concerning to
see that the South China Sea

263
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,673
may be extending all the
way down to Australia.

264
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,530
Dr. Feng, what have you seen

265
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,930
as the Communist Party's
tactics to influence

266
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,973
the politics of Australia.

267
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,070
- You talk about one aspect
of the United Front strategy,

268
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,750
I mean, for Chinese, we all know

269
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,767
that's (speaks foreign language),

270
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,300
that's, a part of (speaks
foreign language),

271
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,210
that's to make friends,
to create connections.

272
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,807
But there's another aspect,
is (speaks foreign language),

273
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,496
to attack, to kill, to destroy.

274
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:41,833
It actually, not only
to make friends with,

275
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,603
close to China and act on the,

276
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,340
on behalf of the Chinese Communist regime,

277
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,500
but also if you look at
the Chinese community here,

278
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,970
the local politicians, the party,

279
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,440
they have been very
successful to make sure

280
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,400
that any anti-communist candidate

281
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,610
will not get the

282
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,763
nomination, will not.

283
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,670
You mentioned John Hu the other day,

284
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,530
he was a very good example

285
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,560
that if you are not working closely

286
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,890
with the Chinese regime, Communist regime,

287
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,430
you will be sidelined,
may lose your position,

288
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,900
and then you will not get the, so called,

289
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,800
Chinese community support.

290
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,090
A lot of associations have been work

291
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,480
as proxy of the regime out there.

292
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,103
- So this is affecting who
gets elected in Australia.

293
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,730
- Yeah, I agree with Professor Feng

294
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,020
that (speaks foreign language) that means

295
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,303
united and conquered.

296
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:58,400
The, of course, through
the political donations,

297
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:01,048
political donations is just

298
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:04,430
a way of establishing personal relations.

299
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,680
There's always a purpose when someone

300
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,360
tries to give money to you.

301
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,100
And, of course, the Australian party's

302
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,710
habit to receive that,

303
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,903
they needed to fulfill
their promise on the table.

304
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,890
- One thing, I'd like to jump off

305
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,070
of something you said, Dr. Feng.

306
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,420
What happens to Australian
officials or politicians

307
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,770
who criticize the Chinese Communist Party,

308
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,700
or who stand up for groups
the party doesn't like,

309
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,883
like Tibetans, or the
Falun Gong practitioners?

310
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,190
- He's working in the Chinese government,

311
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,420
he know how to deal
with them, huh (laughs)

312
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,740
But as you can see, friends and enemies.

313
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,190
The Chinese Communist
Party, that's ruled in China

314
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,350
almost 70 years now, they
have very strong team

315
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,620
to do very good research on politicians

316
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,430
or any other pro-de-mics.

317
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,630
Who are their enemies,
who are their friends?

318
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,080
If you are labeled, or
identified as enemies

319
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,970
you will not get invitation,

320
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,140
you will not get the service.

321
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,470
You mentioned that donation to parties,

322
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,470
but also very lucrative
work opportunities,

323
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,410
business opportunities have been created

324
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,883
for Chinese friends, like,

325
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
Keating, Paul Keating,

326
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,943
like Bob Hawke,

327
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,820
a lot of them have been offered

328
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,413
very good job as advisor,

329
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,823
of consultant on the board,

330
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,260
and actually these retired politicians,

331
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,660
if you look at them,
have become super rich

332
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,450
after their retirement.

333
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,626
If you check their income,

334
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,750
you may find out many of them did that.

335
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,810
But for others, you will not

336
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,980
get that kind of service,
invitation, or, yeah.

337
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,550
- So it can be very profitable

338
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,070
to be in league with the
Chinese Communist Party,

339
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,561
and less so if you're the other direction.

340
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,878
- (laughs) that's right.

341
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,300
- So Chen, actually
your job when you worked

342
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,750
for the Chinese consulate was to monitor,

343
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,033
I believe, it's called
the five poisonous groups?

344
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,120
- Yeah, five groups including
democracy activists,

345
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,470
Falun Gong, Falun Gong was a priority

346
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,840
when I was in the consulate,

347
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,543
but later it goes a little bit down.

348
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,280
Falun Gong, Tibetan group,

349
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,890
Eastern Turkestan,

350
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,667
and also Taiwan, so these
- Very poisonous groups.

351
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,470
- These, all these groups is actually

352
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,262
the enemy of the Chinese regime,

353
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:03,262
but it's, you can see that
it's domestic politic of China.

354
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,560
These people, but Chinese regime see them

355
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,900
as anti-China forces, like foreign forces,

356
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,540
so they are not foreign,
they are not foreign,

357
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,050
these democracy activists.

358
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,230
So, at that time, I was
also in a, pretty shocked

359
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,033
at my major job was dealing with these,

360
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,800
have different opinions,

361
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,663
and I was very shocked as well.

362
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,220
- Kevin, what are your
thoughts on the issue?

363
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,300
- Well, I think that's
very revealing, sort of,

364
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,700
the labeling of people
with different opinions as

365
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,250
inherently foreign, right?

366
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,630
And that, I think, reveals the, sort of,

367
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,700
homogenizing aims of the party state.

368
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,430
This desire to say, we
all have the same opinion,

369
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,430
we all agree, and everybody
who disagrees is not Chinese,

370
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,470
Is not, you know

371
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,303
- Racist.

372
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

373
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,430
And, you know, this goes back

374
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,970
to the friend, enemy distinction, you know

375
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,783
that Professor Feng talked about,

376
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,810
and that, unfortunately, I
think, after all these years,

377
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,510
all these years after the first article

378
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,830
in Mao's collected works,

379
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,700
which raises the question,
who are our enemies,

380
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,933
who are our friends?

381
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,670
This type of thinking, I would say,

382
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,088
unfortunately, still, very much dominates

383
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:42,670
the party state's approach
to Chinese society

384
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,903
and the outside world more broadly.

385
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,670
- And this touches on something

386
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,520
you were mentioning earlier Dr. Feng,

387
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,270
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called

388
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,090
the United Front Work Department

389
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,870
the communist party's magic weapon.

390
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,040
So, let's talk about it.

391
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,623
What is the United Front?

392
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:04,150
- Actually the magic weapon metaphor

393
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,313
was created by Mao in
an article written 1949.

394
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,070
It's three magic weapons.

395
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,970
One is United Front strategy,

396
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,450
the other is arms struggle,

397
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,400
and yet another is the...

398
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:27,311
(mumbles in foreign language)

399
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,333
party leadership.

400
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,510
That everything should
be under the control

401
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,530
or leadership of the party.

402
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,680
And this United Front,
what I already mentioned

403
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,943
is two part.

404
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Related, two part.

405
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,830
One, is to identify friends,

406
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,795
actually within that period of time

407
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,070
it's actually during the Chinese civil war

408
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,020
between the communist party
and the nationalist government.

409
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,803
They actually create the
so-called second front line.

410
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,000
A lot of friends of dem-ya

411
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
and even for government
officials, and the national army,

412
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,410
a lot of rebellion and revolt

413
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,410
within the republican government

414
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,480
to defect into the
communist, very successful.

415
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,820
And that is the, to get the friends,

416
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,850
and then for the other part,

417
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,850
that's to identify the
enemy, to do away with them.

418
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,400
It last for now, it's
seven or eight decades now,

419
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,183
if look at the democracy movement,

420
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,070
leaders since 1989 especially,

421
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,760
they are all marginalized.

422
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,920
Not only in China, but also
in the whole societies,

423
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,080
in Australia, in United States, anywhere

424
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,760
because they are virtually sealed off

425
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,693
from any business opportunities.

426
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,210
It's very unfortunate, if
you look at those leaders.

427
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,213
They are all end up, poverty,

428
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,890
loss of those social connections,

429
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,684
and there's no opportunity
for them to get rich.

430
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:22,340
The only opportunity can offer to people

431
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,680
is that if you work for the party,

432
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,960
or work with the party.

433
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Otherwise, you will be
isolated, marginalized

434
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,450
or even destroyed.

435
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,660
You know, a lot of people have been jailed

436
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,640
for more than 10 years, five years, yes.

437
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,020
- Dr. Carrico would you like to add

438
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,193
your thoughts about the United Front?

439
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,820
- Well, I think there are people who are

440
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,610
considerably more specialized
in this matter than me, right?

441
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,527
- [Chris] You may pass it
on to Chen if you like.

442
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,463
- But I would say that,

443
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,040
how shall I say it,

444
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,070
there have been a number of individuals

445
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,070
who have been, in recent years,

446
00:24:08,186 --> 00:24:09,523
there have been suggestions that

447
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:14,440
"Oh, this person could be
involved with United Front work",

448
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,460
and the response has unanimously been

449
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:19,277
"I'm not involved in United Front work,

450
00:24:19,277 --> 00:24:20,667
"I don't even know what

451
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,917
"the United Front Work
Department is", right?

452
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,370
But to take such claims
seriously, I think,

453
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,560
is to completely misunderstand
the United Front approach,

454
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,937
in so far as nobody says

455
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,507
"Oh hey, by the way, I'm United Front

456
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,007
"and I'm here to share my
thoughts with everyone".

457
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,563
It's not something that's
publicized, I believe,

458
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,680
one could even argue that in some cases,

459
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,680
someone could be engaging
in United Front related work

460
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,270
without, perhaps, even fully being aware,

461
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,993
right, of what they're doing.

462
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,500
So it's a very complex system

463
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,170
that I personally can't
fully wrap my head around,

464
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,780
but I do think it is worthy

465
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,360
of closer discussion and scrutiny.

466
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,660
- Mr. Chen, your thoughts
on the United Front?

467
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,560
- Yeah, United Work Front actually

468
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,350
is based on the Chinese community,

469
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,430
I mean, the overseas influence,

470
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,430
and, of course, will extend
to some old friends of China,

471
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,400
there are many old friends
of China around the world

472
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,490
like Dr. Henry Kissinger, and, like...

473
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,050
I don't have any meaning

474
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:44,050
of despising these important politicians

475
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,580
and in here, in Australia, Gough Whitlam

476
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,136
was regarded as the
great leader, of course,

477
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:58,136
I respect him in his, what
he has achieved in history,

478
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,810
including, especially,
relations with China.

479
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,280
And, but unfortunately, you know, the,

480
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,280
some of these old friends
will become a negative

481
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,650
in the current time for the people.

482
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,140
Politicians like...

483
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,270
We will a very, I once, you know,

484
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,540
visited Gough Whitlam's office,

485
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,420
and Gough Whitlam was very proud that,

486
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,140
he told us that he
trained Mark Latham, okay.

487
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,670
And he introduced us
to his then secretary,

488
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,670
Steven Chaytor, and he told us that,

489
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,741
told the consulate general Liao Zihong

490
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:54,741
and that Steven Chaytor will
be the future labor leader.

491
00:26:55,702 --> 00:27:00,702
And in, of course later, in 2007,

492
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,440
Steven Chaytor was elected
as a New South Wales MP.

493
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,440
And of course, he fade
from his political career

494
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,490
because of some scandal.

495
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:18,490
And he's obviously, you
know, by making such friends,

496
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:24,260
China benefited a lot to
get inside information,

497
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,740
and that's just a small case.

498
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,740
I'm not saying that Gough
Whitlam has done anything wrong,

499
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,623
but what China benefit
from such relations.

500
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,420
- Well I think we've really established

501
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,670
how the Chinese Communist
Party is having a big impact

502
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,100
in Australian politics.

503
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,823
Let's move on to Australian universities.

504
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,480
What is the role of the

505
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,500
Chinese Students and Scholars
Association, or CSSA?

506
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,423
How do they influence
Australian universities?

507
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,680
- As a former leader of (laughs)

508
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,130
overseas Chinese students, overseas,

509
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,510
actually I was sent to the UK

510
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,680
for a joint PhD program at the UK.

511
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,610
At that time I was party's, actually,

512
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,000
and by extension, I was appointed as

513
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,680
one of the leaders,
president, vice president,

514
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,620
of the Chinese Students
and Scholars Association.

515
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,090
At that time, actually, we
enjoy a lot of privilege.

516
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,040
The consulate and the
embassy get us a lot of money

517
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,490
to run a house that whoever the leaders

518
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,530
who live in there, you
do not need to pay rent.

519
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,010
Even the electricity, water, everything,

520
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,690
all the bill are the picked up

521
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,160
by the consulate and the embassy.

522
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,080
And we also have so-called
operational budget

523
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,170
that you can travel long,

524
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,170
you can have meeting weekly or monthly,

525
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,140
and then we have the task to report

526
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,420
the political, ideological affairs

527
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,170
of the Chinese students to
the embassy, to the consulate,

528
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,300
and work very closely with them.

529
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,460
There is a regular meeting,
because we were educated

530
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,940
that if you are student leader,

531
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,481
from kindergarten you have
(speaks foreign language),

532
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:32,470
class monitor and
whatsoever, that's your duty

533
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,280
to serve the party state,

534
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,290
and report the whatever
political activities,

535
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:44,290
ideological conditions of
your colleagues, students.

536
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,283
That is the basic operation
I experienced as a leader.

537
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:57,840
- I have a considerable
amount to say about this

538
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,663
but I'll try to keep it short.

539
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:07,090
I teach contemporary Chinese issues.

540
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I talk about difficult topics

541
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,160
in the classroom,

542
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,620
and over the past, you know,
five years of teaching,

543
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,513
as I've discussed with the media,

544
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,230
I have had students whose
discussions of sensitive topics

545
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,523
have made their way back, via reports,

546
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,433
to their families in China.

547
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:37,000
And that is a development that
I find very, very disturbing

548
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,240
that something that's
discussed in the classroom

549
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,470
in the United States or in Australia

550
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,470
is transmitted back to China
and used in a threatening way

551
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,970
to talk to people's families.

552
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,970
Now, I spoke to media about
this at various points.

553
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
In response, China Daily
published a hit piece against me,

554
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,750
alleging that I had said that

555
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,650
all Chinese students are spies, okay.

556
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,210
I never said that, nobody's
ever said that, okay.

557
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:16,210
And in discussing with colleagues,
discussing with friends,

558
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,540
people who opposed me
participating in this activity,

559
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,127
people have also told me,
ah, people are saying to me,

560
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:27,760
"Somebody told me all
Chinese students are spies."

561
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,210
Okay, first of all, I've never met anybody

562
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,220
who said all Chinese students are spies.

563
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,300
Second of all, if somebody
actually does say that,

564
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,490
they're an idiot, okay.

565
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,060
It's not at all true that all
Chinese students are spies.

566
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,723
There is, however, a situation in which,

567
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,920
as a result of monitoring,
whether through CSSAs,

568
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,980
whether through people who
are politically connected,

569
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,240
there are situations in
which Chinese students

570
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,130
in Australia can feel uncomfortable
sharing their viewpoints

571
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,010
if they have a viewpoint that diverges

572
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,990
from the Chinese party state.

573
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,190
So I'm, I wanna point out that

574
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,927
I don't think everybody
involved in CSSAs is a spy.

575
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,510
I do want to say that there are situations

576
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,190
in which CSSAs are used to monitor

577
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,240
and report on other students,

578
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,593
and when that happens,

579
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,840
those instants should be
treated very seriously

580
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,043
and action should be taken.

581
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,410
- Yeah, all the CSSA actually
belongs to the Chinese regime.

582
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:43,763
At the beginning,

583
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:47,830
the Chinese,

584
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,820
there's an Office of Education

585
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,200
in the Chinese embassy and the consulate.

586
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Their task, main task, is
to manage these students,

587
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,720
and because, you know, right now,

588
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,687
each year, like 120 Chinese
students study in Australia.

589
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,900
A lot of them may have to return to China.

590
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,320
Of course, there's, a lot will stay,

591
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,440
and there's always a risk for the regime

592
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,440
that if these large number
of students return to China,

593
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,680
bring back the thoughts of human rights,

594
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,760
or democracy, or freedom of speech.

595
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,870
And so, it's a really important job

596
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,980
for the Chinese overseas mission.

597
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,980
And usually, if there's, like
in New England University

598
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,920
in Australia, in the
northwest of New South Wales,

599
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,710
there is no CSSA,

600
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,590
the education council will, at that time,

601
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,070
travel to the New England University,

602
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,070
and, to install one in the university.

603
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,930
So, in each university there is one CSSA.

604
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:13,510
And then, above that, there
is called a state CSSA.

605
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,850
It's called New South Wales CSSA,

606
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,110
or Victoria CSSA,

607
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,663
or Canberra CSSA.

608
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:27,430
So, that is convenient to control.

609
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,450
It's like the structure
in the Chinese community.

610
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,740
There's a top one.

611
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,740
That top one is the

612
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,150
Chinese Council for the Promotion
of Peaceful Reunification,

613
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,213
and some others like Chinese,

614
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,770
the organization of the
Chinese Associations,

615
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,980
or FCA, in Victoria,

616
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,270
it's called Federation of
Chinese Associations in Victoria.

617
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,550
That is easy to manage, to control.

618
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,360
They just collect the
heads of these groups

619
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,610
and make instruction,

620
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,790
the instruction will
pass down to individual.

621
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,243
That's the power structure.

622
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,810
- I think it's stunning
the way you've all revealed

623
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,040
how the Chinese Communist
Party is silencing critics

624
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,610
in the Australia government,

625
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,830
and in the Chinese
communities in Australia,

626
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,723
and in universities.

627
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,530
That's actually quite horrifying.

628
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,623
I wanna bounce of
something Dr. Carrico said.

629
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,530
The Chinese Communist
Party often accuses critics

630
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,250
of racism or intolerance
in order to silence them.

631
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,790
Is there a way to bring
up legitimate concerns

632
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,450
about the party's actions

633
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,227
and also not be racist?

634
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,614
- Maybe I'll let them say it first.

635
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:46,650
(audience laughs)

636
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,557
- [Chris] Why, why do you say that?

637
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:52,603
- Because he's European
(audience laughs)

638
00:35:52,603 --> 00:35:53,973
appearance, you don't want
to be accused as racist.

639
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:03,923
(laughs) this is an outrageous
accusation, actually.

640
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,320
We all know, what you define as racism.

641
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,153
Racism is

642
00:36:11,642 --> 00:36:14,240
discrimination or prejudice

643
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,073
based on the collective
identity as race or ethnicity.

644
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,950
When you with criticism against a regime

645
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,490
to protect ordinary Chinese in China,

646
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,937
or the resident of Chinese communities

647
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:38,800
here in Australia or in United States,

648
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,142
that's nothing to do with racism.

649
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:46,880
These kind of accusation is based on the

650
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,560
party strategy again

651
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,650
to conflate

652
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,550
the Chinese state government

653
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,140
and the Chinese nation, or Chinese people.

654
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,513
And then whatever you attack,
or you criticize the regime,

655
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,600
they label you as racist
to attack the Chinese.

656
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,150
So this is a very traditional
and sometimes effective trick

657
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,720
to stop those legitimate
discussion or debate

658
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,180
on what should we do about these

659
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:27,140
what's said, the communist,

660
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,810
some people even don't want
to label it as a dictatorship.

661
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,870
You don't, if you with
criticism, you are racist.

662
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,150
And then, that means,
you should allow them

663
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,720
to do anything against Chinese
people or other people.

664
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,047
Actually those people
who accuse these critics

665
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,210
are sometimes, and not always,

666
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,993
sometimes are actually based on racism.

667
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,900
When they actually argue that
the Chinese are different.

668
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,900
Chinese only deserve dictatorship,
only deserve despotism.

669
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,500
They do not deserve human right.

670
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,160
They are not capable of democracy,

671
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,980
they're lower blood, they need control.

672
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,550
It's extremely racist ideas, actually,

673
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,550
when they put out these propositions.

674
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,550
- I would agree, indeed, that

675
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,520
it is racist,

676
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,890
it is orientalist to assume

677
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,570
that the government that the
Chinese people have today

678
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,770
is the government that they deserve.

679
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,530
In fact, this is a government

680
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,960
that has been forced upon people,

681
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,493
and continues to force itself upon people.

682
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,940
And I think that, as Professor Feng said,

683
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,210
the real racists are the people

684
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,730
who have lower expectations
for the Chinese people,

685
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,793
and want to deny them
their basic human rights.

686
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:03,530
- Those are very good points,

687
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,460
but have you ever considered

688
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,529
you might be racist against Chinese?

689
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:08,485
- [Kevin] (laughs)

690
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:10,180
- So I think now, what's important

691
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,483
is what can all Australians
do about this issue?

692
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,843
- Well--
- I'll choose

693
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:19,730
alright go ahead.

694
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,230
- Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'll go.

695
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,450
You know, I don't have
any political connections,

696
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,420
there's not really much
that I can do, in reality,

697
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,613
besides write some
articles and do some talks.

698
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,890
But in that sense, that is what

699
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,130
I would encourage people to do,

700
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:45,130
to really resist, not
only overt censorship,

701
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,840
to resist pressures that come from above,

702
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,600
to resist pressures from the party state,

703
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,650
but also to resist, sort of,
the pressures in your mind.

704
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,070
You know, every time I do a lecture,

705
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,700
and I mention Taiwan, you know, I think,

706
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,124
oh how should I say Taiwan (mumbles)

707
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:04,880
the Republic of China, Taiwan Province.

708
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,780
You know, at the end of the day,

709
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,790
Taiwan is just Taiwan, you know.

710
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,470
I know that a lecturer was
given a lot of pressure,

711
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,290
got into a lot of trouble

712
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,590
for referring to Taiwan as a country,

713
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,210
but, you know, this is slightly ridiculous

714
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,520
to deny the fact that a place

715
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,020
with its own borders, own
military, own currency,

716
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,450
own economy, own political system,

717
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,663
to pretend that it's not a country.

718
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,500
Many, you know,
governments along the world

719
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,260
sort of play along with this game,

720
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,930
but I think that it's important

721
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,590
for people in civil society,

722
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,310
for people in university positions

723
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,620
to not play along with this game,

724
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,620
and to, you know, perhaps
live and speak in truth

725
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,883
about the realities of China
and Asia as a whole today.

726
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:03,170
- Dr. Feng, your thoughts?

727
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,450
- Yes, a little, one thing I would expect

728
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,380
from Australian government,
or the public in general,

729
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:17,380
that is to somehow protect my
compatriot, the Chinese here.

730
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,060
They come all the way,
thousands of miles away,

731
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,080
to this country in order to enjoy

732
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,760
human rights, freedom, democracy.

733
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,316
But unfortunately, the Chinese influence

734
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:36,493
or interference kept so strong

735
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,140
that they're actually kept
under the shadow of the Chinese,

736
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,320
the extension of Chinese
communist regime there.

737
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,543
When you look at the media,

738
00:41:45,543 --> 00:41:48,200
it's dominantly told the party line,

739
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,470
almost identical with People's Daily,

740
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:56,344
or the central station
(speaks foreign language)

741
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:57,660
but in China.

742
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,133
When you look at the Chinese
associations all around,

743
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,720
the overwhelming majority of them

744
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,000
actually have been controlled

745
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,870
by the Chinese party state,
or work for the party state.

746
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,703
And the

747
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,156
the resident of Chinese cal-le-gy here,

748
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,543
they should be able, they
should have been able to,

749
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,900
what we call, integrated into
the normal political life,

750
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,900
to accept new ideas of freedom,
democracy, human right,

751
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,300
and become a active and informed citizen

752
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,423
within this multicultural democracy.

753
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,050
So, they need protection to

754
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,450
enjoy political civilization

755
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,270
available to other
communities in Australia.

756
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,033
- [Chris] And Chen, please,
share with us your thoughts.

757
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,280
- I think the Australian can do a lot.

758
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,330
The most important thing is to protect

759
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,690
Chinese Australians,
real Chinese Australians.

760
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,730
And, the, because right now,

761
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:15,730
the CCP's infiltration is massive.

762
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:20,979
Most of the current Chinese organizations

763
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,530
run pro-CCP.

764
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,520
They either been
infiltrated or controlled.

765
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,860
They're affiliated to
the Australian Council

766
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,210
of Promotion of Peaceful Reunification.

767
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,335
And the

768
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:38,850
the majority of Chinese migrants,

769
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,940
mainland Chinese, I mean,

770
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,650
mainland Chinese migrants are very quiet.

771
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:45,940
They are silent majority

772
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,940
because they have been
scared of China politics

773
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,383
and they don't want to get involved.

774
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:58,320
They have, there are many
connections with mainland China.

775
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,800
They worried about the visas,

776
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,987
they said, "Oh my parents are getting old,

777
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:05,967
"and I need to see their last,

778
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:09,700
"for the last time" and they worry about,

779
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:14,263
because Chinese, you know, very
cherish the family relations

780
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,993
and

781
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:19,070
the majority are silent.

782
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:23,227
Of course, but now, and since 2016,

783
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,564
majority want to say something,

784
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:30,732
want to, because last
time the Chinese community

785
00:44:30,732 --> 00:44:34,820
were shocked that the concert

786
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:39,820
praising the mass murder Mao Zedong

787
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:43,730
was going to be held
at the Sydney Town Hall

788
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,863
and Melbourne Town Hall.

789
00:44:45,863 --> 00:44:48,550
And later, some people stood up

790
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,270
and to campaign against it.

791
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:56,263
And later, against the
Chinese Revolutionary Ballet.

792
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,940
That's a propaganda
piece, brainwashed piece,

793
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,200
it's called, we call it

794
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,433
fascist asiatic aesthetic.

795
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:08,870
And, the Red Detachment of Women.

796
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:13,870
It used to be, the Chinese Red Ballet

797
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,850
used to travel around the world,

798
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:20,173
they met little criticism,

799
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,200
and this time, in Australia,

800
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,650
they met a huge criticism

801
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:31,700
from the public,

802
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,700
especially the voice of the
silent Chinese majority.

803
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,150
And I hope the Australian

804
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,830
can hear the voice of
silent Chinese majority.

805
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,943
And especially now, the
Foreign Transparency,

806
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,663
the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme,

807
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:57,010
is just want to protect
Chinese Australian interest,

808
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,130
because we can't allow
these fake community

809
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,163
to represent the majority
of mainland Chinese.

810
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,660
And the, it's

811
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,830
not targeting only to China,

812
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,313
but all foreign influence.

813
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,650
The government is trying to
protect the Chinese Australians,

814
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:28,990
and why there're so many disagreement?

815
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,677
It seems they try to say

816
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:33,930
"I represent the Chinese community".

817
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,220
They represent Chinese community.

818
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,280
They claim they represent
the Chinese community.

819
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,280
Because China has say that
this law is against China.

820
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,280
And China is worried about its

821
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,647
worried about its force,

822
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:55,900
its power, its influence in Australia.

823
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,223
I believe there will be,

824
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,950
still will be some,

825
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,950
you know, some more debate on this.

826
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,840
Otherwise, you can see that
there's no infiltration at all,

827
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,140
and there will be more.

828
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,710
I can see the last time,
there's about 30 China experts,

829
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,723
they said China experts, who,

830
00:47:24,354 --> 00:47:26,990
to air the views submitted

831
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:31,320
to the parliamentary committee
on security intelligence

832
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,930
that they are against the law.

833
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:40,930
This law, Foreign Influence
Transparency Scheme is nothing

834
00:47:41,045 --> 00:47:44,900
but to protect the
Australian national interest.

835
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,890
The US have a Foreign
Agent Registration Act.

836
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:50,340
That's the same thing.

837
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,340
And it runs well, if US
want to put into practice.

838
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,290
- One final question before
we wrap up for a Q and A,

839
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,650
what is the communist party's end goal?

840
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,823
What happens if nothing is done?

841
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:14,113
- You know, you know, you
know their objective? (laughs)

842
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:16,663
It's,

843
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,650
I think when we talk about
this transparency scheme

844
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,943
or whatever the legislation amendment,

845
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,303
to me, it's almost too late.

846
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,640
I already mentioned
from the very beginning

847
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,920
the Chinese Communist Party state

848
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,990
has extremely successful
to establish its network

849
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,283
within the Chinese community,

850
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:43,190
Chinese community in particular.

851
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,510
And extends to education,
business, government, everywhere.

852
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,990
So, it's fully understandable

853
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:54,370
that you have got this
very strong reaction

854
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,000
because they already
part of the party state.

855
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,970
They are extension of the
power, of the influence

856
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,180
of the party state, here in Australia.

857
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,463
If nothing is done,

858
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,410
this divided and rule,

859
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,410
you have enemies, you have friends

860
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,960
that you are got on board
with the party state.

861
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,520
You get rich, you get influence,

862
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,648
and then you actually battling

863
00:49:19,648 --> 00:49:23,010
from both sides, Australia and China,

864
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,530
within the government, within education,

865
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,170
within business.

866
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,250
And then if you are a
dissident in this sense,

867
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:31,250
you lose everything.

868
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,280
So that is if nothing is done.

869
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,043
This will be quite,

870
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,970
at least less pleasant
situation will continue

871
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,963
and then will,

872
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,920
quite miserable situation

873
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,170
for guys like me, like Yonglin,

874
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,113
or like many people among you here.

875
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,250
- [Chris] And Dr. Carrico.

876
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,780
- Well I assume the end goal is

877
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,331
a win-win mutually beneficial relationship

878
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:08,480
in which all sides are happy.

879
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,993
No, no, that was a play on words.

880
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,960
But I don't really like
to predict the future.

881
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,040
I would just say that at the moment,

882
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,140
I do know that people,

883
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,000
even living outside of China,

884
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,070
are still concerned, right,

885
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:37,373
about political influence
from the party state.

886
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:44,470
And if nothing is done, I
think that interference,

887
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,623
that influence will continue to grow.

888
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,283
Those fears will become ever greater,

889
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,860
and there will be ever
less room for people

890
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,960
of Chinese descent and,
you know, for all of us

891
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,960
to really contribute to open discussion

892
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,060
of the challenges facing Australia

893
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,163
and the region as a whole.

894
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,693
And that is an endpoint that
I would not want to see.

895
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,960
- [Chris] And Mr. Chen.

896
00:51:20,808 --> 00:51:23,450
- Yeah, sorry, I want to mention again

897
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:28,450
about the so-called submission
of ideas of 30 scholars.

898
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,630
I found two of them actually

899
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:34,410
are the head of Confucius Institute,

900
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:39,030
and can they represent the academic views

901
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,850
or represent the Chinese community?

902
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:42,850
- [Audience] No, no.

903
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,900
- So, there's one is a Confucius
of University of Adelaide,

904
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,493
the other is the Confucius--

905
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:56,187
- [Audience] Sydney U

906
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:57,970
- [Kevin] Yeah, Sydney and Adelaide

907
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,570
- Yeah yeah. And also, I
found at least two of them

908
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,800
actually used to work for
China Daily, in China.

909
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,430
So they born in China,
they grow up in China,

910
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:14,430
and then they came to
Australia to do academic work

911
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,620
to influence Australian society.

912
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,783
And I'm not saying they're Chinese agent.

913
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,580
But anyway, they, we needed
to know their background,

914
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,460
need to know background.

915
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,390
And some of them scholars,
whatever you say,

916
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,780
scholars, that they've been research

917
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,700
funded by the Chinese donors,

918
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,700
and including, of course,
even some of ambassador,

919
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,330
former ambassador of Australia,

920
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:51,330
and, the, even I've said
that when Gough Whitlam

921
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,540
established relations with China,

922
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,400
that's a good move,
wise move for Australia,

923
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,150
but now, it's not wise,

924
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:02,860
as the United States already confessed

925
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,860
that it's a bad move to judge China,

926
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:12,220
that China will automatically
turn to democracy

927
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,300
after the economic growth.

928
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,650
And that's the wrong decision.

929
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:22,370
And obviously, some of academics

930
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:27,200
may just stick to that track,

931
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,900
I think they need to renew their brain.

932
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,526
They need to renew their brain.

933
00:53:32,526 --> 00:53:33,359
(audience laughs)

934
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,660
They just, they should not
just stick to their China,

935
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,660
are these academics travel
a lot in mainland China,

936
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,500
of course, I don't know

937
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,530
how much benefit they've got from China,

938
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:51,100
but anyway, they have been
the target of lobbyist.

939
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,880
And the Chinese, you know,
for the Chinese community,

940
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,443
the Chinese blood is an asset.

941
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,650
It doesn't mean that all Chinese
will connected to the CCP,

942
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,580
but it's easy target,

943
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,602
because of their connection with China,

944
00:54:10,602 --> 00:54:12,468
their ancestors in China,

945
00:54:12,468 --> 00:54:15,280
and they usually, sometimes, you know,

946
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,450
because of proud of nationalism,

947
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:22,420
proud of racism, or
Chinese race is superior,

948
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,110
and, and, and

949
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:28,070
that easy to be lobbied,

950
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,717
and, but that doesn't mean, you know,

951
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:35,717
like I said that, the
Professor Feng also said,

952
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,770
that the

953
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:44,120
Mr. Kevin Carrico

954
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,010
and he said "All Chinese are spies".

955
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,323
That's wrong, that's wrong.

956
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,730
The, but still, Chinese students

957
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,093
are very easy to be coerced,

958
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,290
because most, as we know that background,

959
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,453
Chinese, all Chinese,
you know, when I grew up

960
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:07,290
in China, I was brainwashed.

961
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,800
And I then went to
foreign affairs college,

962
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,570
and I have a chance to
know the outside world.

963
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,120
I can read the voice of America,

964
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,710
can listen to the voice of America,

965
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,970
can read Time Magazine,
Newsweekly, and all these.

966
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,410
And even get education,

967
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:31,210
get teachings from the,
some, at that time,

968
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,430
volunteer experts to teach us language,

969
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,970
and they taught us Western philosophies.

970
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,970
And, there're not many
Chinese who have such chances

971
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:47,023
to struggle, to get rid of the brainwash,

972
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,193
but of course, nowadays,
because of internet,

973
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:54,950
a lot of Chinese have stand up

974
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:59,950
and the netizens against the regime.

975
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,220
- Well thank you very much
for all of your thoughts.

976
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,470
I do feel our brains have been
renewed from this discussion.

977
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,860
Unfortunately, we are now out of time,

978
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,040
but I want to thank you
all for coming tonight

979
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,020
and the incredible passion
I've seen in the audience.

980
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,688
Let's have another round of
applause for our panelists.

981
00:56:18,688 --> 00:56:21,438
(audience claps)
