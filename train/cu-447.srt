00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,060
China becomes Iran’s new BFF.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,880
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,580
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,570
The Iranian regime is in trouble.

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,369
And the Chinese Communist Party is coming
to the rescue.

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,489
Like a prince rescuing a damsel in distress...

8
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:26,539
Or, you know, an evil prince rescuing an evil
damsel in distress.

9
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,109
But first, a bit of background on what’s
happening in Iran.

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:31,109
Back in May,

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,390
the Trump Administration pulled out of the
Iran Nuclear Deal.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,410
In August, they followed that up with tough
sanctions on Iran.

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,440
Those covered access to US dollar banknotes,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,989
the automotive sector, and exports of metals,

15
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,320
agricultural products, and...wait...carpets?

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,050
Sanctions on Persian rugs!?

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,800
Now I’m never going to see a whole new world!

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,910
Anyway, on November 4,

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,579
the US plans to impose sanctions on Iranian
oil.

20
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:02,850
“Washington aims to bring Iranian oil exports
down to zero

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,689
to force Tehran to re-negotiate a nuclear
deal.”

22
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,920
And that spells trouble for the already struggling
Iranian economy.

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,230
Over the past year,

24
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,320
Iran has seen 200% inflation.

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,790
Add that to the pressure of already high unemployment.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,700
So it’s no wonder that Iran has seen more
than 100 public protests

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,619
in less than 10 months.

28
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,850
And the protests haven’t eased up.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,180
This next news video is from just after the
Trump administration

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,950
announced it was withdrawing from the Nuclear
Deal.

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,049
“The recent protests inside iran have been
deadly,

32
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,399
with security forces turning their weapons
on their own people

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,310
and promising to resolutely confront growing
unrest

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,750
over economic struggles.”

35
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,100
What’s different about these protests—

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,480
compared to the big ones in 2009—

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,820
is that they aren’t targeted

38
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,479
at any particular political faction.

39
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,579
They’re against the entire system.

40
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,799
Here are protestors shouting “Mullahs, get
lost.”

41
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,140
In Iran, mullahs are the religious leaders

42
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,950
who control the government.

43
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,670
In another city, the protesters shout

44
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,680
“This is a bloody month, the mullahs are
falling.”

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,150
And in this video,

46
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,050
protesters are rejecting their government’s

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,260
anti-American propaganda,

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,060
shouting “Our enemy is here;

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,240
Iran’s leaders lie when they say it’s
America.”

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,270
How did the Iranian regime respond to

51
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,900
the civil unrest and economic woes?

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,780
By saying it would bring America to its knees.

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Yeah!

54
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,740
That’ll fix unemployment!

55
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,830
But fear not, where there’s an authoritarian
regime in trouble,

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,680
a dictatorship that’s lost the support of
the people,

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,880
or a system collapsing because of corruption—

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,300
the Chinese Communist Party will ride to the
rescue.

59
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,640
Many traditional buyers of Iranian oil like
South Korea,

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,460
India, and the EU have been cutting oil shipments
from Iran

61
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,510
under threat of US sanctions.

62
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,100
So the Chinese regime has been stepping in
to buy it up.

63
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,360
And at the same time,

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,580
cheap Chinese goods are flooding into Iran.

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,800
So China is filling the gaps left behind

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,100
by countries that are retreating.

67
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,190
China is now Iran’s biggest trading partner

68
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,600
and has traditionally relied on Iran’s oil

69
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,010
to fuel economic growth both inside China,

70
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,201
and as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.

71
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:21,370
In 2017, China imported a third of all Iranian
oil,

72
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,180
more than any other country.

73
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,160
So when a French energy giant called Total

74
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,100
succumbed to US pressure,

75
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,200
and pulled out of a 5 billion dollar agreement

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,750
to develop a massive offshore natural gas
field in Iran...

77
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,900
Guess what?

78
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,300
China stepped in.

79
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,350
The same thing could happen with an important
seaport in Iran

80
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,180
that India has planned to invest half a billion
dollars into.

81
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,950
The port is located in the strategic Gulf
of Oman

82
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,090
and would give India access to Afghanistan,

83
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,520
Russia and Europe.

84
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,280
However, “Iran has indicated its willingness

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,640
to involve China in the project

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,090
should negotiations with India stall.”

87
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,820
Which would give the Chinese regime

88
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,780
a nice port on the other side of India,

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,240
just 100 miles away from the one they have
in Pakistan.

90
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,780
And China stands to make out big on Iranian
oil.

91
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,830
With other buyers cutting back,

92
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,520
Iran has been forced to store 13 million barrels

93
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,069
in offshore supertankers.

94
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,439
The Chinese Communist Party knows that

95
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,470
with Iran in a political bind,

96
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,830
it’s a great opportunity to buy up cheap
oil.

97
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,040
Especially since other Chinese oil suppliers
are struggling.

98
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,470
And China’s not just getting the oil for
cheap.

99
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,710
They’re also getting it without all the
risk.

100
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,370
Two of China’s largest state backed oil
companies

101
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,860
have activated a clause to get around US sanctions.

102
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,960
So whereas in June,

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,479
nearly half of the vessels shipping oil from
Iran to China

104
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,870
were operated by Chinese companies,

105
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,050
in July all of the tankers were operated

106
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,800
by the National Iranian Tanker Company.

107
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,400
That means, “Iran will cover all the costs
and risks of

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,760
delivering the crude as well as handling the
insurance.”

109
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,110
And yes, it was a mutual decision.

110
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,110
Of course the United States is aware that
China

111
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,120
is the kink in its plan to sanction Iranian
oil.

112
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,150
Which is why the US says China, like other
countries,

113
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,150
faces the same threat of sanctions

114
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,120
for continuing to import Iranian oil.

115
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,990
Of course, China could always do what it did

116
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,439
when it was buying Iranian oil during the
sanctions

117
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,280
before the Iran Nuclear Deal.

118
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,699
You see, most banks don’t want to finance
Iranian trade

119
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,159
because if the US cuts off access to the dollar,

120
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,319
they’re sunk.

121
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,219
But the giant China National Petroleum Corp

122
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,450
literally has its own bank,

123
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,379
called the Bank of Kunlun.

124
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,030
It can use that to handle oil transactions,

125
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,330
because It “has very limited exposure

126
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,509
to the global financial system,

127
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,539
so is well placed to continue dealing with
Iran...

128
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,069
The Central Bank of Iran has accounts at Kunlun

129
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,720
into which Chinese buyers have paid the equivalent
of

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,969
billions of dollars for oil.”

131
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:06,460
See, at the end of the day, China needs oil.

132
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,539
And Iran needs to sell it.

133
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,819
So as the United States squeezes,

134
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,219
Iran is becoming more dependent

135
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,139
on the Chinese Communist Party.

136
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,910
But given what’s happened with a lot of
countries

137
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,270
that do business with the Communist Party—

138
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,419
like Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Djibouti—

139
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,400
it might not be all peaches and cream

140
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
for Iran in the long run.

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
And before you go,

142
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,860
it's time to answer a question

143
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,850
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

144
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,759
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,270
Alfred Schneider asks,

146
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,009
“Chris, I hear the CCP has done a great
job cracking down

147
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,850
on subversive activities such as praying,

148
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,509
meditating, and reading the Bible.

149
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,849
What’s the latest news on how the good fight

150
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,600
is going against these dangerous extremists?”

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
Good question, Alfred.

152
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,900
Yes, the CCP is doing a great job cracking
down on

153
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,849
people who believe in things.

154
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,229
Earlier this year,

155
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,750
authorities blew up a Christian megachurch
with dynamite.

156
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,349
There’s a new law is in the works

157
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,919
that prohibits online preaching.

158
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,220
And just last week,

159
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,199
one of the largest underground churches in
Beijing

160
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,569
got shut down...

161
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,979
because the pastors refused to install surveillance
cameras

162
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,770
that would have allowed Chinese authorities

163
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,719
to benevolently monitor every church-goer.

164
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,069
And authorities across China have been forcing
churches

165
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,430
to remove images of that subversive anti-Roman
splittist—

166
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,400
you know, Jesus—

167
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,189
and replace them with wholesome images of

168
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,530
communist leader Xi Jinping.

169
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,419
But despite all this persecution—

170
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,430
or perhaps partly because of it—

171
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,199
Christianity is on the rise in China,

172
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,330
in both official and underground churches.

173
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,680
Thanks for your question, Alfred.

174
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,990
And thank you for watching China Uncensored.

177

See you next time.

178
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,820
Want me to answer your question?
