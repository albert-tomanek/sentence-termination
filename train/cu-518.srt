00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:10,250
bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
America Up For Sale Now for years, people

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,760
have been saying China isn t ready for democracy,
but if the US keeps supporting China s brutal

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,970
Communist Party with our business, jobs, and
money, China will end up with more freedom.

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,870
That makes total sense! But it turns out all
we ve really been doing is supporting China

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,550
s brutal Communist Party. And they doesn t
seem too fond of the idea of democracy. The

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:37,899
US owes China one point one seven trillion
dollars, pays about 100 million dollars a

7
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,510
day in interest on that, and according to
the US Census bureau, in 2012 the US had a

8
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,979
300 billion dollar trade deficit with China,
the largest trade deficit any country ever

9
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:56,109
has had ever in history. Now, while this might
scare some people, the US has a few tricks

10
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,869
up its sleeve. The US has allowed its economy
to tank so hard that now the value of the

11
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:07,370
dollar is plummeting, so who cares how many
trillions of dollars of debt China owns. Looks

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:13,350
like the US has pulled the wool over the Communist
Party s eyes. But even as the American economy

13
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,230
suffers, there s still some who want to buy
American. China! All across the country, the

14
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,630
Chinese governments, or Chinese companies,
which for the most part are owned or linked

15
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,360
to the Chinese government, have been buying
up bits and pieces of America. Real estate,

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,340
infrastructure, businesses, homes, farmland,
natural resources, cough oil. According to

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,110
the Rhodium Group, an investment monitoring
company that focuses on China, in 2012, Chinese

18
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,140
investment in the US was $6.5 billion, whereas
in 2009 it was only 1.9 billion and before

19
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,520
that it wasn t even a billion. So where exactly
is this money going? Well, some people are

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,380
concerned that Sinomach, which the Chinese
government owns most of, is trying to establish

21
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,110
special economic zone, just like they have
in China, right in the middle of America.

22
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,970
Shenzhen was just a tiny finishing village
in the 70 s before it was designated a special

23
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,159
economic zone. And look at the workers paradise
it s become now! I mean, America s very own

24
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,150
Shenzhen, who wouldn t want that?! Here s
another one. In May of 2012, Sino-Michigan

25
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,150
Properties LLC bought up 200 acres of land
near the town of Milan, Michigan. But come

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,749
on, it s not like they re going to build a
Chinese city in the middle of America, right?

27
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:31,170
Actually, that s exactly what the plan was.
They had plans to build an entire city, complete

28
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,379
with lakes and a cultural center, catered
to Chinese businessmen who want to start companies

29
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:40,769
in the US, just 40 minutes away from Detroit.
It hit a little snag when they found it wasn

30
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,349
t legally possible to bring in that many Chinese
immigrants and still be profitable with current

31
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:50,239
immigration laws. Then there s the China Ocean
Shipping Company that owns vital ports on

32
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,060
both coasts. Which, you d think if US citizens
can now be sentenced to indefinite dentition

33
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,640
without trial under the National Defense Authorization
Act, the US government would at least give

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,450
equal weight to a possible conflict of interest
created by a communist country that flouts

35
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,560
the rule of law OWNING VITAL PORTS. The problem
is very little reporting is done about these

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,249
topics so it s really hard to know what the
latest developments are but is there a real

37
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:21,849
threat? Well, the US Congress apparently think
Chinese companies could present a huge threat.

38
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:27,159
In October 2012, A US House Intelligence Committee
found that Chinese telecommunications companies

39
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,590
Huawei and ZTE operations in the US were a
quote threat to national security interests.

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,980
Of course that didn t stop China s largest
auto parts maker from buying US A123 Systems

41
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,950
in January. They make electronic car batteries
and had a couple of big military contracts.

42
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,169
So sure that might transfer sensitive technology
used by the US military developed with US

43
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:55,669
taxpayer money into the hands of the Chinese
government, but I mean, they re our allies,

44
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,629
right? Since former US President Bill Clinton
signed a trade deal with ex-Chinese leader

45
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,790
Jiang Zemin, who by the way at the time was
orchestrating a genocide against 100 million

46
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,400
Falun Gong practitioners in China, the US
has found itself with a 2.5 trillion dollar

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,490
trade deficit. Maybe that wasn t such a good
idea. s funny, in a way, because the US has

48
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:22,000
pumped so much money into the Chinese Communist
Party directly or through its subsidiaries,

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,850
it s almost like the US is funding all this,
and all the horrible things the Chinese regime

50
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,110
does to the Chinese people. But remember,
China absolutely is not ready for democracy.

51
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,730
Whew, this was a depressing episode. I think
we should all take our minds off of it for

52
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,130
a little while with a nice, relaxing trip
to the movies. hCH' hy.t hi>X h_EG h6/M ha-@
