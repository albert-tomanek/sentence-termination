00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,890
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,449
From Russia with love

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,870
China’s richest man is retiring, and headed
to the beach.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,420
And, how to adjust your watch...to terrorism
time.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,760
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,100
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,890
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,980
President Trump’s trade war with China

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,710
has the Communist Party worried.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,280
China’s Shanghai stock exchange has hit
a 31-month low.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,140
Trump is asking big American companies

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,559
to move production back to the United States.

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,999
And he wants to put even more tariffs on China.

14
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:40,339
And you know what that means:

15
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:44,120
A stronger alliance between America’s two
biggest rivals:

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,420
China and Russia!

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,120
Xi Jinping and Vladimir “No relation to
Dracula” Putin

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,370
met on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic
Forum.

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,769
What could these two masterminds of evil

20
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,679
possibly come together to do?!

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,379
Why, shopping!

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,620
And making pancakes!!!

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:12,340
Wow, Xi Jinping is so much better at it than
Putin

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,790
Be sure to load up on the caviar!

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,540
Two kinds!

26
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,410
You boys deserve a treat!

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,860
That’s the happiest I’ve ever seen Xi
Jinping...

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,110
Since that one time he got to hold

29
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,320
that really big cucumber.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,810
Now while making pancakes together

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,370
may not seem sinister or evil,

32
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,850
may I just point out to you,

33
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,680
metal utensils on nonstick pans.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,780
Noooooo!

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,210
This is what we’re up against, people.

36
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,560
Anyway, in between the shopping and cooking,

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,590
Xi Jinping did suggest, “both countries
should continue

38
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,330
investing in energy, agricultural projects,
tourism,

39
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,360
infrastructure and education.”

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,430
While also emphasizing, that, you know,

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,650
“China is open for international cooperation”

42
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,740
and is “willing to study” opportunities
with other countries.

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,110
Speaking of international cooperation,

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,950
Putin also gave Xi Jinping a ticket to the
gun show.

45
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,060
No, not that gun show.

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,060
This gun show.

47
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,730
Russia just hosted its biggest war games

48
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,810
since the fall of the Soviet Union.

49
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,150
And Putin invited his pancake buddy to join
in.

50
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,389
It was massive exercise near the Russia-China
border.

51
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,180
Russia and China have hosted joint war games
before,

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,489
but this was by far the biggest.

53
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,040
They mobilized 300,000 troops.

54
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,249
China’s Defense Ministry said don’t worry,

55
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:35,730
the games were only focused on “defenses,

56
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,340
firepower strikes and counterattack”—

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,370
and were “not directed against any third
party”.

58
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,959
You hear that, President Trump?

59
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,700
Not directed at any third party.

60
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,549
But while the war games were going on

61
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:50,800
along one Russia-China border,

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,989
the US has expressed its concern with

63
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,790
another area near China’s border—Xinjiang.

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,959
The US State Department expressed concern
over

65
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,859
the worsening crackdown on Uighur Muslims
there.

66
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:02,989
That’s right.

67
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,249
The Trump administration is expressing concern

68
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,129
about the treatment of Muslims.

69
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,329
Apparently they’re even considering putting
sanctions

70
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,590
on Chinese officials who’ve been persecuting
them.

71
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,329
But the Chinese Communist Party hit back,

72
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,629
saying “whoa whoa whoa,

73
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,620
there’s no religious persecution in China!”

74
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,590
“The Chinese government guarantees freedom
of religion

75
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,620
for its citizens in accordance with the law.

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,629
All peoples of China fully enjoy freedom of
religion

77
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,469
in accordance with the law."

78
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,610
My gosh, he didn’t even bat an eyelash.

79
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,519
I think Shelley has some competition

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,790
for the ultimate straight man.

81
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,019
Meanwhile, China is drafting a law

82
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,260
to crack down on “chaotic online religious
info.”

83
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,620
My favorite Chinese state run media the Global
Times

84
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,060
says the draft law is very timely,

85
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,819
because “religious information on the Chinese
internet

86
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,519
is chaotic due to the illegal promotion

87
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,430
of some extreme forces and cults.”

88
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,559
Basically if you want to talk about religion
online,

89
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,840
you need a license.

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,989
And no more live streaming.

91
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:04,989
But remember…

92
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,409
“All peoples of China fully enjoy freedom
of religion

93
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,540
in accordance with the law."

94
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,480
Speaking of saying one thing and doing another,

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,809
the Chinese regime has approached the World
Trade Organization

96
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:18,280
for permission to sanction the US.

97
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,870
You know, the same World Trade Organization
whose rules

98
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,000
China has violated dozens of times.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,620
China’s push for sanctions is based on a
2013 complaint it made

100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,630
about the anti-dumping duties the US had put
on China.

101
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,420
They were designed to offset the artificially
low cost

102
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,860
of Chinese imports that were undercutting
US manufacturing.

103
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,510
But how the US calculated those dumping duties

104
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,780
was found to have been illegal in a string
of trade disputes

105
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,210
brought to the WTO.

106
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,160
But don’t worry, those sanctions on the
US

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,390
won’t be happening any time soon.

108
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,560
“It is likely to lead to years of legal
wrangling.”

109
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,070
Man, I can see why everyone just ignores the
WTO.

110
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,190
And why President Trump thinks it’s the
worst deal ever.

111
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,510
No, seriously.

112
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,620
“I would say the WTO is the single worst
trade deal ever made,

113
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,750
and if they don’t shape up,

114
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,400
I would withdraw from the WTO.”

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,110
The world of Chinese business is incredibly
murky,

116
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,730
especially because of the close working relationship

117
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,470
private businesses have to have with the Chinese
government.

118
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,300
So it definitely raised some eyebrows when
Alibaba CEO

119
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,230
and richest man in China Jack Ma said he was
retiring.

120
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,860
Even Vladimir Putin was surprised!

121
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,530
I mean, Putin didn’t retire even when the
law required him to!

122
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,940
But considering the tendency for powerful
business leaders in China

123
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,640
to be purged and end up in detention,

124
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,430
Jack Ma’s retirement has people wondering
about

125
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,330
whether he or his company might be in trouble.

126
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,150
“In China, businessmen who fly too high
have a habit

127
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,770
of falling out of favor with the ruling Communist
Party.”

128
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,400
But Jack Ma says not to worry, there are no
charges against him,

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
and he’s not going to prison!

130
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,680
He just wants to hand over the company to
younger leadership—

131
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,240
so he can have a chance to live life.

132
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,800
As he put it, he’d rather die on the beach
than in his office.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,390
Die on the beach?

134
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,730
In China?

135
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,090
Um...dying in the office doesn’t actually
sound so bad.

136
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,140
Anyway, speaking of having a chance to live
life,

137
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,040
three offices related to family planning have
closed down.

138
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,000
“Family Planning” in China is a euphemism

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,530
that refers to the Communist Party-run offices

140
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,920
that control how many children you’re allowed
to have.

141
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,820
And if you try to have too many,

142
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,560
they help make sure mom gets an abortion,

143
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,490
whether she likes it or not.

144
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,480
But China’s population is getting old

145
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,660
and there aren’t enough young people anymore.

146
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,020
That’s why the Communist Party is doing
away with

147
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,910
the Family Planning office that implemented
the famous

148
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,480
One Child Policy and then the Two Child Policy.

149
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,020
But while policies change,

150
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,860
the Communist Party isn’t planning to relax
control.

151
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,600
They’re just replacing the Family Planning
offices

152
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,960
with “a new office for ‘population monitoring

153
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,260
and family development’”.

154
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,470
That doesn’t sound creepy at all.

155
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,460
It will be responsible for, “improving birth
policy

156
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,570
and to organize implementation,

157
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,470
and to establish and improve the system

158
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,010
of extraordinary family assistance for family
planning.”

159
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,420
Okay, yeah, that’s sounding really creepy
now.

160
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,490
A man in China’s Western region of Xinjiang

161
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,460
has been detained on terrorism charges.

162
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,470
Is it because he’s Muslim?

163
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,470
No.

164
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,810
Was he plotting a terrorist attack?

165
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,950
Also no.

166
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,440
It was much more serious.

167
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,590
He had set his watch two hours behind Beijing
time.

168
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,350
You see, even though China covers

169
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,780
what normally would stretch across five time
zones,

170
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,430
The Chinese Communist Party decided long ago

171
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,900
that all official clocks must be set to Beijing
time.

172
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,400
So 9am in Xinjiang might not even have daylight
yet.

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,170
That’s why people in Xinjiang

174
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,770
also keep their own informal local time—

175
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,190
you know, so things make sense.

176
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,020
But insisting that things make sense

177
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,080
is also a subtle way to subvert the central
authorities.

178
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,170
But really, in a region where the paramilitary

179
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,770
is employing surveillance cameras

180
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,400
and even drones to watch your every move,

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,740
it’s probably worth setting your watch to
the official time.

182
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,880
And now it’s that time when we answer questions
from fans

183
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,390
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

184
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,820
With YouTube demonetization,

185
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,360
we basically rely entirely on viewer support,

186
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,440
so this is our way of saying thank you.

187
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,020
David Michael White asks, Matt,

188
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,600
what is your Chinese zodiak sign?

189
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,560
Dog.

190
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,400
Thanks for your question, David.

191
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,320
And remember, when you support this show—

192
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,980
like with a dollar per episode,

193
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,060
which is less than a cup of coffee by the
way—

194
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,920
you’ll be making a huge difference.

195
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,010

See you next time.

Oh hi...you’re still here?

201
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,450
I guess you must really want more!

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,670
