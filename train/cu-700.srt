1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,159
don’t worry!

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,560
The Chinese military has you covered.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,880
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
PLARF.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,000
No, I’m not celebrating 25 years of Pinky
and the Brain.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,590
I’m talking about the Chinese Communist
Party’s

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,529
People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force.

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,520
New satellite photos have emerged of a PLARF
base

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,950
in China’s Sichuan Province.

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,130
And what does the People’s Liberation Army
Rocket Force

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,410
plan to do tonight?

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,040
The same thing it does every night:

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,790
Try to take over the world!

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,690
Well, not the world.

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,930
But possibly part of India.

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,050
China’s Sichuan Province is of course a
short distance

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,940
from the Arunachal Pradesh,

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,020
territory disputed by both India and the Chinese
Regime.

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,750
According to The Print, this new Chinese base
could potentially

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,820
“support a brigade-sized intercontinental
ballistic missile formation”

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,090
capable of covering “all of India,

24
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,749
the Indian Ocean Region as well as large parts
of continental America.”

25
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:06,909
Reports of the new base come just a few months

26
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,350
after the tenth successful test

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,329
of China’s latest and most powerful ICBM,

28
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,749
the DF-41.

29
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:15,931
According to video from state-run People’s
Daily,

30
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:21,359
the DF-41 is capable of carrying up to 10
nuclear warheads,

31
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,659
with a range of about 7500 miles.

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,240
With that kind of range, a DF-41 launched
from Sichuan

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,219
is capable of traveling around the globe—

34
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,649
or across the flat Earth disk,

35
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,200
if that’s your thing—

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,450
to strike the continental United States.

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,799
Also, it can hit India.

38
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,069
Which is way closer.

39
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,899
But India isn’t exactly a sitting duck.

40
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:43,899
Or...sitting cow.

41
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:46,579
Or elephant.

42
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,950
Whatever the appropriate sitting animal is
in this scenario.

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,450
Earlier this year, India tested its own nuclear
capable missile

44
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,189
that could hit anywhere in China.

45
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,189
Then in March,

46
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,200
China sold Pakistan, “a powerful tracking
system

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,939
in an unprecedented deal that could speed
up

48
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,049
the Pakistani military’s development

49
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,059
of multi-warhead missiles.”

50
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:10,189
Which was then later followed by China’s
DF-41 test

51
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,700
and news of the new missile garrison.

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,129
And this is just the latest development in
a long history

53
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,180
of bad nuclear family relations.

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,519
China and India have the two largest populations
in Asia,

55
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,760
and the nations often compete for the same
sphere of influence.

56
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,719
Plus they both have nukes.

57
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,020
But really, is that any reason they couldn’t
still be friends?

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,980
After all, China’s foreign minister says
that

59
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,689
India’s Elephant and China’s dragon

60
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,879
should dance instead of fight.

61
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,040
How would that work?

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,020
Would it look something like this?

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,140
Unfortunately, in the past,

64
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,120
India and China have been more interested

65
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,200
in fighting than dancing.

66
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,319
China and India fought a brief but bloody
war in 1962

67
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,269
over disputed territory.

68
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,769
And they still periodically have confrontations

69
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,730
over the same territory.

70
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,799
Like the longer, but fortunately not bloody,

71
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:11,829
confrontation last summer.

72
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,409
“Its personnel were caught on camera

73
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,409
jostling with Indian troops—

74
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:17,980
some time in second week of June

75
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,930
across the LAC in Sikkim.”

76
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,450
That standoff lasted over 70 days.

77
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,879
And in that entire time,

78
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,349
no one thought to have a dance.

79
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,819
Really.

80
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,480
But the Chinese Communist Party has been patiently
working

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,930
to weaken and surround India.

82
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,469
“China is allegedly the principal opponent
to India’s bid

83
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,370
for the United Nations Security Council membership

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,659
and it has also been opposing India’s entry

85
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,739
at the Nuclear Suppliers Group.”

86
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,859
India wants a voice in that influential nuclear
group.

87
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,770
According to the Arms Control Association,

88
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,500
India has around 140 nukes.

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,670
For its part,

90
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,840
India is one of the rare countries in the
region

91
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,670
that doesn’t support China’s Belt and
Road Initiative.

92
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,799
That’s where the Chinese regime builds infrastructure

93
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,450
in other countries,

94
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,599
gets them in debt,

95
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,659
and then occasionally forces them to establish

96
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,829
potential Chinese military bases.

97
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,790
That’s called the String of Pearls theory.

98
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,790
And look!

99
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,970
It just so happens they all surround the Indian
Ocean.

100
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,690
But it’s not like the Chinese Communist
Party is going to try

101
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,570
to make a move on the Indian Ocean, right?

102
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,560
I mean, the China Ocean has a ring to it.

103
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,060
Well, not so much a ring, as a string...of
pearls.

104
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,240
Maybe we’ve been looking at this problem
all wrong.

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,729
Why should India and China have

106
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,830
to choose between dancing and fighting?

107
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,020
When they could dance and fight at the same
time?

108
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,990
Now that’s a dance off!

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,560
Then again, with India and China both able

110
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,180
to cover each other in nuclear missiles,

111
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,000
the fate of the world should probably depend
on

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,919
more than just great choreography.

113
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,080
I think I’m ready for new world leadership.

114
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,620
So what do you think of China’s new missile
base?

115
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,160
What is the risk to India?

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,759
Leave your comments below.

117
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,759
And before you go,

118
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,910
it’s time to answer a question from a fan

119
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,280
who supports China Uncensored

120
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,580
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

121
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,539
Jonathan Swanberg asks,

122
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,240
“With the United States announcing

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,449
its United States Space Force,

124
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,180
do you think China will follow suit?

125
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,460
I mean they already have a freakin laser in
the works...

126
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,370
Is this just wishful thinking for someone

127
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,629
who wants to join the space Marines?

128
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,330
Good question.

129
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,650
Back in 2014,

130
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,699
there were rumors that the Chinese military

131
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:40,320
was going to establish a space force,

132
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,760
but those rumors were never confirmed.

133
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,830
But regardless,

134
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,050
the Chinese space program

135
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,930
is already a branch of the military—

136
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,389
the Chinese Communist Party’s military.

137
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,800
And they’re already weaponizing space,

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,780
like with freakin’ lasers, as you pointed
out.

139
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,990
And I assume they believe Mars has belonged
to China

140
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,360
since ancient times.

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,100
Because it’s called the Red Planet!

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,830
Anyway, in my view,

143
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,280
the US sees the Chinese regime’s space plans

144
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,860
as a real threat,

145
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,740
and is responding to that by establishing

146
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,300
the US Space Force.

147
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,100
But Jonathan, trust me,

148
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,220
you don’t know want to join the space marines.

149
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,880
It’s not gonna be pretty once you have to
fight the aliens.

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,740
Thanks for your question Jonathan.

151
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,720
