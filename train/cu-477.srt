1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:03,860
During the Great Leap Forward,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,740
Mao killed 45 million people.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,580
But the Chinese Communist Party

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:15,809
Still calls it a natural disaster.

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:31,369
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,960
This week, the Chinese Communist Party celebrates
its 100-year anniversary.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,739
And the Party is giving itself the best birthday
present of all: the gift of changing its own

8
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:43,280
past.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Like any 100-year old, the Chinese Communist
Party wants to look good on its big day.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,550
So Party officials don’t like it when people
bring up all the mistakes they made before.

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,309
In Party-speak, they call this “historical
nihilism.”

12
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,679
Historical nihilism is anything that questions
the Party’s official rainbows-and-sunshine

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,949
version of its past.

14
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,620
Because questioning the Party’s past also
“means denying the ‘inevitability’ of

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,030
China’s march towards socialism.”

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,080
Chinese leader Xi Jinping blames historical
nihilism for the collapse of the Soviet Union.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,420
And he’s determined that’s not going to
happen to the Chinese Communist Party.

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,480
Which is why earlier this year, the Party
launched a hotline for people to report any

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,860
cases of historical nihilism they see.

20
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,610
“The tip line allows people to report fellow
netizens who ‘distort’ the Party’s history,

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,430
attack its leadership and policies, defame
national heroes and ‘deny the excellence

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,810
of advanced socialist culture’ online.”

23
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,490
Reporting people for wrongthink: a proud communist
tradition.

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,270
As a result of that campaign, Chinese authorities
deleted 2 million online posts for historical

25
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,270
nihilism.

26
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,200
But we’re not in China.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,640
So let’s commit some historical nihilism.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,130
It’s time to once again go down the memory
hole, with our new segment on the Chinese

29
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,880
Communist Party’s 100-year anniversary.

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,450
We call it 100 Years of Things That Never
Happened.

31
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,450
Today we’re talking about the Chinese Communist
Party’s most spectacular failure: The Great

32
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,590
Leap Forward.

33
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,080
You’ve got to hand it to Communist Party
Chairman Mao Zedong . He really knew how to

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,319
name things.

35
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,730
“Land Reform” sounds way better than “Killing
Land Owners and Taking Their Stuff.”

36
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,530
The “Hundred Flowers Campaign” sounds
way better than “Torturing Intellectuals

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,310
for Criticizing Me.”

38
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,390
And the Great Leap Forward sounds way better
than “Ruining the Economy While Killing

39
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,060
45 Million People.”

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,380
The Great Leap Forward was Mao’s plan to
supercharge China’s transformation into

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,270
a communist utopia by collectivizing and industrializing
the country at the same time.

42
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:07,240
But within two years, all of that collectivization
and industrialization led to...mass starvation.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,770
Mao was not a patient man.

44
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,920
Other Communist Party officials wanted to
industrialize the country more gradually,

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,240
but Mao disagreed.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,270
He wanted to do everything at once.

47
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,540
It’s kind of like when you decide that your
New Year’s Resolution is to quit smoking

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,690
and lose weight and exercise and then by February
you realize you haven’t met any of your

49
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,680
goals except for killing 45 million people.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,739
It happens.

51
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,450
Mao kicked off the Great Leap Forward after
traveling to the Soviet Union in late 1957

52
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,000
and meeting Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,660
When Khrushchev announced that the Soviet
Union would overtake the US in industrial

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,310
output in 15 years, Mao announced that China
would overtake the UK in the same amount of

55
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,310
time.

56
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,720
Mao wasn’t just competing with the UK.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,250
He was also competing with the Soviet Union.

58
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,709
He didn’t like having to listen to the Soviets
all the time and wanted China to develop its

59
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,570
own form of communism.

60
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,569
And he saw the Great Leap Forward as his opportunity
to do just that.

61
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,459
But before the Great Leap Forward could happen,
Mao had to purge anyone who was standing in

62
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,280
his way.

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,299
Political purges: a proud communist tradition.

64
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,639
Mao started by forcing Party officials who
had previously questioned his economic plans

65
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,120
to submit self-criticisms.

66
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,690
He especially focused on Chinese Premier Zhou
Enlai, his second-in-command.

67
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,400
Zhou confessed to being guilty of “rightist
conservative thinking” and repeatedly pledged

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,690
his loyalty to Mao.

69
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,500
This was the beginning of the Anti-Rightist
Campaign, which Mao used to end any objections

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,380
to the Great Leap Forward.

71
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,580
By the end of the campaign, millions of people
would be purged.

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,960
So what actually happened during the Great
Leap Forward?

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,720
I’ll tell you after the break.

74
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
Welcome back.

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,490
The Great Leap Forward started with a crazy
competition.

76
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,750
Mao pitted Party officials against each other,
who all competed for their region to grow

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,030
the most crops.

78
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,960
To meet increasingly impossible targets, people
did all kinds of insane things.

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,780
People worked in the fields day and night.

80
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,180
They fertilized fields with things like white
sugar, or human hair.

81
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,570
People even demolished houses to make fertilizer.

82
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,000
They planted crops more deeply and closer
together to grow more.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,550
And most of all, they lied.

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,410
Farmers knew that planting crops close together
was actually bad and wouldn’t increase output,

85
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,010
but they were afraid to say anything, because
they didn’t want to be purged as rightists.

86
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,699
Meanwhile Party officials were doing things
like moving extra crops to the side of the

87
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,240
road when Mao would visit, so it looked like
there were bumper harvests.

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,850
This is a famous photo from the Great Leap
Forward.

89
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,110
It was meant to show that the wheat crop was
so dense that four children could jump on

90
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,580
top of it.

91
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,229
But the photo is staged.

92
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:19,199
As Mao got more and more reports of record-breaking
crop yields, most of which were fake, he believed

93
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,320
his plan was working.

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,710
And he encouraged Chinese people to eat five
meals a day.

95
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,040
Surely this won’t have any unforeseen consequences.

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,370
To cope with the huge amounts of labor needed
for agriculture, some areas started organizing

97
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,890
peasant farmers into huge communes that were
set up like military units.

98
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:48,389
Mao approved, and by the summer of 1958, Party
officials were encouraged to collectivize

99
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,340
all of the land.

100
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,259
Party officials predicted that China would
soon achieve communism.

101
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,150
Almost overnight, people’s communes sprang
up across China.

102
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,470
A commune comprised many villages with thousands
of families.

103
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,080
Each day was strictly regimented.

104
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,110
Family life was virtually abolished.

105
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,930
Children were placed in communal nurseries
while their parents worked around the clock.

106
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,949
People ate in the fields, or in communal dining
halls.

107
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,570
But while Mao liked the communes, Chinese
peasants did not.

108
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,840
In the most radical communes, people were
forced to give up everything they owned, including

109
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,260
livestock.

110
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,530
So instead, people would kill their animals
and eat them before being forced to live in

111
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,920
a commune.

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,729
Because once you eat something, no one can
take it away from you.

113
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:49,410
People would sell everything they owned in
order to keep the communes from confiscating

114
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,389
their property.

115
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:56,039
Communes even destroyed people’s houses
so they could use the bricks for communal

116
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,240
dorms.

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,770
In some cases, those communal dorms never
got built, leaving people homeless.

118
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,510
But the biggest problem with the communes
were the communal canteens, where everyone

119
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,880
was forced to eat.

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,560
First of all, Party officials had to actually
force people to eat at the canteens, by taking

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,169
away any food they had privately stored, and
even confiscating their kitchen utensils.

122
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:29,600
But once people started eating at the canteens,
they ate as much as they physically could.

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,479
Because once you eat something, no one can
take it away from you.

124
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,020
People would literally eat five meals a day,
because Mao said so.

125
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,180
And there was massive food waste.

126
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,270
In fact, researchers say these communal canteens
were one of the biggest reasons for the great

127
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,209
famine that would soon follow.

128
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,750
So much for agricultural collectivization.

129
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,170
Mao’s version of industrialization was just
as big of a problem.

130
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,910
Mao was obsessed with overtaking Great Britain’s
steel output.

131
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,400
But China didn’t have enough industrial
equipment to do that.

132
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,529
Instead, communes set up “backyard furnaces”
to smelt iron to make steel.

133
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:17,710
If people didn’t work on the furnaces, the
communes wouldn’t give them food.

134
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,839
In the frenzy to smelt iron, people melted
down iron tools, even their pots and pans.

135
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,180
Which it turns out didn’t really matter,
since soon there wouldn’t be any food to

136
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,800
put in those pans anyway.

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,660
People also cut down entire forests for fuel.

138
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,740
But it still wasn’t enough.

139
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:44,680
“We burned tables, chairs, window frames,
and finally we even opened old coffins and

140
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,070
used the wood.

141
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,490
They really stank.

142
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:56,320
We kept the fires burning day and night.”

143
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,480
In the end, Party officials met their targets.

144
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,730
But according to a government report, less
than 30 percent of the iron made in these

145
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,950
backyard furnaces was even usable to refine
into steel.

146
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:15,170
Meanwhile, so many peasant farmers were put
on iron and steel making duty that crops were

147
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,570
rotting in the fields.

148
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,940
Surely this won’t have any unforeseen consequences.

149
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,620
More after the break.

150
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,680
Welcome back.

151
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,930
There were signs of famine in China as early
as the first year of the Great Leap Forward,

152
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,930
1958.

153
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,740
But many of those signs were dismissed by
Party officials as the lies of rightists and

154
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,570
counter-revolutionaries who were trying to
sabotage the glorious march to communism.

155
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,360
By 1959 it was unmistakable.

156
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,450
Party leaders knew there was widespread famine.

157
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,810
But there was another problem.

158
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,790
The Chinese regime had borrowed heavily from
the Soviet Union to finance the Great Leap

159
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,200
Forward.

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,019
Now they needed money from exports of grain
and other food to pay it back.

161
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:11,709
At a secret meeting in Shanghai in 1959, Mao
ordered Party officials to take up to one

162
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:17,010
third of all the grain from the communes,
more than they had ever taken before.

163
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,580
“At the meeting [Mao] announced that 'When
there is not enough to eat people starve to

164
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
death.

165
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,120
It is better to let half of the people die
so that the other half can eat their fill.'

166
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,850
That’s some real Thanos energy.

167
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,730
The Chinese Communist Party also didn’t
want to lose face internationally by admitting

168
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,740
a famine was happening.

169
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,340
They even gave away grain for free to their
allies during the famine, and they also refused

170
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,520
food aid from the US, the Soviet Union, and
even the Red Cross.

171
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,180
To prevent news of the famine getting out,
people were not allowed to leave their local

172
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,529
areas, even to beg.

173
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,910
“My aunt’s family was a typical big family
in the countryside with several generations

174
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,400
of the family living together.

175
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,290
There were 36 people altogether.

176
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,560
During the three years of famine, one died
after another.

177
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,040
Eventually only three people were left alive.

178
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,780
At first when someone died, they would take
the body and bury it.

179
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,480
Later they didn’t have the strength to take
the bodies out.

180
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,230
They could only look at them.

181
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,610
They watched the bodies being eaten by rats.

182
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:38,680
And their eyeballs stuck out.

183
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,010
People didn’t even have the strength to
chase the rats away.”

184
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,649
There are wide estimates of how many died
during the Great Leap Forward.

185
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:52,800
On the low end of the scale, the Chinese Communist
Party grudgingly admits that 10 million people

186
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,410
died during 1960.

187
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,540
Historian Frank Dikotter , who wrote his book
Mao’s Great Famine based on recently available

188
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,640
Chinese Communist Party archives, says the
true death toll is 45 million.

189
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,899
Dikotter also says that people didn’t just
die of starvation.

190
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,890
He estimates that 2 to 3 million people were
purposely killed.

191
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,970
Either buried alive, tortured, or beaten to
death.

192
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,930
He gives examples of a father who was forced
to bury his son alive for stealing a handful

193
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:33,590
of grain, and a man who was branded with a
hot iron and crushed with a stone for digging

194
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,339
up a potato.

195
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:40,889
Even the people who died of starvation were
often the victims of Party officials.

196
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,630
“Many of the victims did not die because
there was no grain available in the villages,

197
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:53,880
instead they were deliberately and selectively
deprived of food by local [Party officials].”

198
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,410
That included the old, weak, and sick, who
were deprived of food because they couldn’t

199
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,480
work.

200
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,410
China achieved communism, all right.

201
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,540
The Chinese Communist Party does not officially
recognize that the famine was caused by the

202
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,010
Great Leap Forward.

203
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,670
They call it the “Three Years of Natural
Disasters” or the “Three Years of Difficulty.”

204
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,820
But whatever natural disasters there may have
been were minor compared to the destruction

205
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,779
caused by the Communist Party’s collectivization
and industrialization schemes.

206
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:31,120
Like the massive deforestation to fuel the
backyard furnaces.

207
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,110
And a campaign to kill sparrows, which led
to more locusts eating crops.

208
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:42,880
Mao’s Great Leap Forward was a huge catastrophe
that killed 45 million people and totally

209
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,660
destroyed the economy.

210
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,540
It would take years for the country to recover.

211
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,950
It was a giant mistake for Mao.

212
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,120
But he definitely learned his lesson.

213
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,870
You see, the real problem facing the Great
Leap Forward wasn’t the rightists.

214
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,920
It was the counterrevolutionaries!

215
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,200
Which is why he then launched the Cultural
Revolution.

216
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,630
Surely this won’t have any unforeseen consequences.

217
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:16,240
But that’s a topic for another segment of
100 Years of Things That Never Happened.

218
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,890
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a fan who supports China Uncensored on

219
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,580
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

220
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,639
Hontas Farmer asks, Do you think that now
this is no longer a front in the culture war

221
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,240
or a political campaign the US will take real
action against China's assets for damage caused

222
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,860
by this virus?

223
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:43,399
For that matter if we financed the gain of
function research might the US be liable?

224
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,449
That was on an episode we did about how the
Chinese Communist Party is censoring the science

225
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:52,880
around the coronavirus outbreak, and specifically
trying to discredit the lab leak hypothesis.

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,780
Well Hontas, I think that even though Trump
is out of office, the coronavirus is still

227
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,990
a pretty big part of the cultural war in the
U.S.President Biden has said that he wants

228
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,510
US intelligence agencies to look into the
lab leak hypothesis.

229
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:11,640
But since there probably will never be absolute
proof it was a lab leak, the US government

230
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,310
probably won’t take financial action against
the Chinese regime.

231
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,630
And yes, you also point out something that’s
kind of tricky for the U.S.

232
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:25,519
The U.S. did finance gain of function research
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

233
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,060
And gain-of-function research is widely considered
normal in the scientific community.

234
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,830
So if this pandemic was caused by a lab leak,
there’s a bigger issue about whether we

235
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,430
should even be doing this kind of research
at all, even if it’s not in China.

236
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,190
Thanks for your question, Hontas Farmer.

237
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,020
