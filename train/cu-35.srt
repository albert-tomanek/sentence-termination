00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,140
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,150
Vietnam’s most famous pop singer

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,660
has something to say.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,000
But some powerful people don’t want her
to say it.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,960
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,500
As I’m sure you can imagine,

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,460
life under the Communist regime of Vietnam

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,070
isn’t always easy.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,410
Even if you’re a famous celebrity.

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,410
Like Mai Khoi.

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,800
In 2010 she won a prestigious songwriting
award

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,390
from state-run Vietnam Television.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:38,860
Her style was conventional pop music.

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,680
But she never liked the heavy hand

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,570
of the authoritarian communist government,

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,800
and she started to speak out in favor of democracy.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,910
“She was one of a small number of activists
who tried

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,430
but failed in 2016 to gain seats to Vietnam's
parliament,

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,440
which is dominated by the ruling Communist
Party.”

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,800
Her music began to reflect her transformation

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,990
into an outspoken political activist.

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,710
Here’s a more recent piece,

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,400
called Re-education Camp.

25
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,480
she...

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,640
doesn't need

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,800
to sit inside there

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,990
And let’s just say,

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,140
when you criticise a communist regime,

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,140
they don’t like it.

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,550
She’s been detained by authorities...

32
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,020
and effectively banned from performing in
her own country.

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,100
Obviously, I thought:

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,480
“Sounds like someone I’d like to meet.”

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,530
So I sat down with Mai Khoi

36
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,960
at the Oslo Freedom Forum in Taiwan.

37
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,550
Thank you for joining us today.

38
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,980
My pleasure.

39
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Great.

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,890
So, you used to be like the Lady Gaga of Vietnam,

41
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,300
but now you're more like the Pussy Riot of
Vietnam.

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,100
Why did you put all that fame at risk for
activism?

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,750
Actually, I don't care what people call me,

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,610
because they can have their opinions but I

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,680
just care about what I am doing now.

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,259
Because the fact is,

47
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,550
I have to face the problems myself

48
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,380
and I have to spread the message myself

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,850
so what I have is my fame.

50
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,370
And because since I’m famous,

51
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,560
many people follow me

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,120
and they watch what I'm doing every day.

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,610
That is a good way to say something

54
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,650
if you want to change the society.

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,270
It gave you a platform.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
Right.

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,600
And how has your activism

58
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,709
affected or changed your music?

59
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,459
My music has changed in style,

60
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,730
because I was performing in many styles of
music before:

61
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,350
pop, rock, jazz, folk,

62
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:08,550
but when I turned to protest kind of music,

63
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:15,120
I had to do something different from before.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,610
So, I choose experimental ethnic jazz,

65
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,400
contemporary, kind of,

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,870
that kind of music to express my lyrics

67
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,180
because is very strong music.

68
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,030
It touches people’s emotions through

69
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,489
the very big range of in dynamics.

70
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,209
Yeah, so my music is now very abstract

71
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,730
but very strong.

72
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,730
And what's it like being

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,550
a performer under Communism?

74
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,170
I’ve never performed for the Communist Party.

75
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,980
I just ... because I was born there,

76
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,860
I've grew up there

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,530
and I have to worked under the censorship
system.

78
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,810
If I wanted to release the new album, release
new song,

79
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,690
if I wanted to get on the television,

80
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,560
the media, they control everything

81
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:21,319
so you ask for permission before you can do
anything.

82
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,990
And those kind of things I want to reject.

83
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,819
The censorship system for art and music

84
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,229
is really useless.

85
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,879
People don't need that.

86
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,620
So I know as a performer,

87
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,430
censorship is a big issue for you.

88
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,490
Do you think, when I post a clip of this interview

89
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,439
on Facebook, it will be viewable in Vietnam?

90
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,449
Facebook is under pressure now.

91
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:52,850
I mean, the government has a new cybersecurity
law,

92
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,680
and from that law they want to censor the
contents on Facebook,

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,160
and Google, and YouTube.

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,460
And the news that you're making about me

95
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,400
or about political issues may be censored,

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,680
yeah I don't know if people can see it or
not

97
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,569
but it depends on the content,

98
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,409
on how you write the article.

99
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,979
Why do you think communist dictatorships

100
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,920
rely on censorship?

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,279
The Communist Party, is very scared

102
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,930
to receive criticism from people every day.

103
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,650
So when people have internet and social media,

104
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,340
they write,

105
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,340
they can write their opinions on Facebook
every day

106
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,839
and the government receives so much criticism.

107
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,789
They fear this.

108
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,059
And they are scared they will lose their power.

109
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:12,330
Yes, because they realize

110
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,279
the power of freedom of expression.

111
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,379
So what can people living

112
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,189
under Communism do to get freedom?

113
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:25,990
As I said,

114
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,830
we have to step out of fear

115
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,979
and we have to learn,

116
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,699
we have to discover,

117
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,849
we have to know about our rights.

118
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:43,720
Yes.

119
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,400
It's lucky that we have internet,

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,800
if we didn’t have internet,

121
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
maybe to this day, we would still be living
in the dark.

122
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,099
Yes.

123
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:56,099
And I can see,

124
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,839
I can see people in my country

125
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,320
have made big improvements,

126
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,160
they can get information from internet

127
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,749
without censorship.

128
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:13,300
And that's a good way for people to show their
power.

129
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,689
And how do your fellow countrymen

130
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:21,309
feel about what you've done?

131
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:24,729
Many young people have been inspired

132
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:29,509
by me and they sent messages to me

133
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,300
every day on Facebook.

134
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,889
And they want to make a change.

135
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,650
They want to do something.

136
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,659
They want to be an activist.

137
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,659
Yes.

138
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,309
And I'm so happy when

139
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:47,550
what I've do encourages young people

140
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,240
to make a change for their country.

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,589
So what advice would you give

142
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,259
to young people living under an authoritarian
regime?

143
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:03,259
You know, to play by the rules,

144
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:04,509
within the law.

145
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,559
I still follow their law.

146
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:13,409
What I am doing now is not illegal.

147
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,659
I'm following their law so they have no reason

148
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,159
to stop me

149
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:23,289
or they have no reason to put me in jail.

150
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:27,080
And it’s lucky that I am famous

151
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,419
and many people already know me.

152
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,599
So I have a voice.

153
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,460
I have a bigger voice than other people.

154
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,010
What can people in western countries

155
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,820
do to help or change the situation?

156
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:53,840
I know, western countries can help a lot.

157
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,200
Especially, on freedom of expression

158
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,200
if everyone can raise awareness

159
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,880
about the internet issues

160
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,150
and put more pressure on

161
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,220
social media companies like

162
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,030
Facebook, Google, YouTube

163
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:26,940
to force them to protect freedom of expression.

164
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,900
That will be a good way to help

165
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,510
the people in my country.

166
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:42,340
I know, Vietnam is a small country

167
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,690
many countries have problems too

168
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,990
but we can,

169
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,450
together,

170
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,560
make the connection

171
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:03,690
and we can raise awareness of the problems in our country.

172
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,460
And I think,

173
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,520
if the western countries just

174
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,280
pay attention and spend a little bit

175
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,060
more time to think about the problems

176
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,140
of other countries like my country

177
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,570
and do something.

178
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,570
Everyone can show,

179
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,220
everyone can do something.

180
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank you so much for joining us today.

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,380
I know our fans, in Vietnam in particular,

182
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,290
will be very happy to hear your words.

183
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,690
Yes.

184
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,300
They also very nervous.

185
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:55,680
They also very worry about me.

186
