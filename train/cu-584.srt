1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,930
China could soon have more Christians

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,970
than any other country.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,490
But not if the Communist Party can help it.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,480
China’s war on Christianity continues.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,060
I’m Chris Chappell.

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,500
and click the notification bell

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,960
so you get an alert when we publish a new
episode.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,820
The Chinese Communist Party is officially
atheist.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,040
In fact, if you want to be a Party member,

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,780
you need to give up your religious beliefs.

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,800
The Party has been fighting a war against
religion

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,680
since the very beginning.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,550
Nevertheless, a lot of people in China still
want religion.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,579
“By 2030, China's total Christian population,

18
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,710
including Catholics,

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,540
would exceed 247 million,

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,899
placing it above Mexico, Brazil and the United
States

21
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,920
as the largest Christian congregation in the
world.”

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,030
So the Chinese Communist Party is trying a
new tactic.

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,110
If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em!

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,830
Or, actually, make ’em join you!

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,070
And then beat ’em.

26
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,069
The Party officially recognizes five religions
in China—

27
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:10,170
Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity.

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,179
And it wants to control these religions by
making them sinicize.

29
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:17,810
For the Party, “Sinicize” doesn’t mean
“make more Chinese”.

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,869
It means bring them under the Party’s control.

31
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:24,590
They just want it to seem like it’s about
making things more Chinese,

32
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,950
because that sounds way better than Communize
or Socialismify.

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,880
Even though that’s what it actually is.

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,990
For example, “One of the goals of a government
work plan

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,270
for ‘promoting Chinese Christianity’

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,100
between 2018 and 2022 is ‘thought reform.’”

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,569
Authoritarian Communist States and thought
reform

38
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,979
go together like peanut butter and jelly.

39
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,969
As one high ranking Chinese Politburo member
said,

40
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,429
“[Religious] leaders must steer religions
forward

41
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,509
with Chinese socialism.

42
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,869
Whatever your belief is,

43
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,179
you must first abide by law.”

44
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:00,509
And let’s just say,

45
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,389
the Communist Party is making the law

46
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,759
very unfriendly toward Christians in China.

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,330
Here are 10 ways.

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,800
Number 10

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Surveillance

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,450
The first step in making sure Christians

51
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,060
are really following Chinese law

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,230
and sinicizing is being able to watch them
at all times.

53
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,280
China’s Zhejiang Province is sometimes known
as

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,700
China’s Jerusalem for having a large number
of Christians.

55
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,890
And the local government there is forcing
churches

56
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,240
to install surveillance equipment.

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,030
It’s to fight terrorism.

58
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,760
No seriously, that’s what local officials
said.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Because nothing says fighting terrorism

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,910
like targeting innocent people,

61
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,360
and putting them under surveillance.

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,400
And if people protest the cameras,

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
the Party can always blame terrorism.

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,760
That they need to fight.

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,980
With even more cameras.

66
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,100
Number 9

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Online Suppression

68
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,430
2018 saw a whole bunch of new regulations

69
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,600
aimed at curbing Christianity’s rise.

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,870
One proposed law targets online religious
content,

71
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,190
restricting “images or even descriptions
of religious activities—

72
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,460
from praying and chanting, to burning incense.”

73
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,980
Ok, I don’t know who goes online to describe
burning incense,

74
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,600
or why, but how sinister could that possibly
be?

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,290
Exceptions to online postings are made

76
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,490
for certain officially recognized organizations,

77
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,290
but it seems all individual posting would
be banned.

78
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,530
According to China legal expert Jeremy Daum,

79
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,790
a founder of China Law Translate...

80
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,310
...the regulations were worded so broadly
and vaguely

81
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,350
that technically even photos of a wedding
would fall under them.

82
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,960
Unless you pick the right wedding venue.

83
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Number 8

84
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Limiting Donations

85
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,850
In 2017, the Communist Party updated

86
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,980
its rules regulating religions.

87
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,510
The new rules say donations from foreign groups

88
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,040
and individuals are banned—

89
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,319
and donations over 15 thousand dollars

90
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,060
need to be reported to authorities.

91
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,520
So for instance, as an American,

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,400
if you donate to a Chinese church

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,490
that’s helping with disaster relief—

94
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,150
the church will be punished if they accept
it.

95
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,290
And even Chinese donors who want to contribute
a lot

96
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,630
need to be reported to the authorities.

97
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,400
I imagine that’s because the authorities

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,620
want to give such generous people an award.

99
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,400
And that award is extra surveillance.

100
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Congratulations!

101
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,460
Smile, you’re on camera.

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Forever.

103
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Number 7

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,060
Tearing down crosses.

105
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,651
In just two years, authorities in Zhejiang
province

106
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,819
took down more than 1,000 crosses on churches.

107
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:39,000
Sometimes, they just accidentally burst into
flames.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,840
What a clear building code violation.

109
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,800
No wonder these fire traps have to be taken
down.

110
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,300
And sometimes the problem is so serious,

111
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,990
the entire church has to go.

112
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,990
Here’s one example.

113
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,600
The Sanjiang Church.

114
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,060
Impressive, right?

115
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
It took 12 years

116
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,860
and 4.7 million dollars in donations to build.

117
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,029
Authorities demolished it overnight.

118
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,319
And guess what?

119
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,009
That was a state sanctioned church.

120
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,039
It had official approval from the local government,

121
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,389
who even lauded it as a marvel of engineering.

122
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,190
But what the Communist Party giveth,

123
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,229
it can take away..eth.

124
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,229
Number 6

125
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,229
Locking people up

126
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:19,150
The Chinese Communist Party decided

127
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,800
to celebrate Christmas last year the only
way it knew how...

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,509
with the mass arrest of Christians.

129
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,509
To be fair,

130
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,039
they all belonged to the Early Rain Church,

131
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,809
which was known for extremist views.

132
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,229
What kind of extremist views?

133
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,759
“Every year the church commemorates victims

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,110
of the [Tiananmen Square Massacre] in 1989.”

135
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,689
Clearly that church requires thought reform.

136
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,800
Early Rain is an example of what’s known
in China as house churches.

137
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,580
Those are churches that are not officially
registered with the state.

138
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,389
Unlike the state-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic
Movement,

139
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,569
and the China Patriotic Catholic Association.

140
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,459
And yes that is seriously what they are called.

141
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,459


142
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:01,459
According to Bob Fu,

143
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:04,259
founder of the US-based Christian rights organization
China Aid,

144
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,490
“There were more than 10,000 cases of detention
of Christians” in 2018.

145
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,370
And what happens to these Christians held
in detention?

146
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,430
I mean, at least Chinese officials

147
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,330
aren’t feeding them to the lions, right?

148
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,680
Of course not!

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,300
Even the Party knows that life is valuable.

150
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
And that’s why...

151
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Number 5

152
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,639
They’re killing Christians for their organs

153
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,909
If you’ve been watching China Uncensored
for a while,

154
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,289
you know the Chinese Communist Party

155
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,809
has been killing people for their organs,

156
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,939
and selling them to rich people who need transplants.

157
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,229
Now I’m not saying this happens to most
Christians who are detained,

158
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:39,969
but according to this report,

159
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,840
...every year the Chinese Communist Party

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,939
harvests between 60 and 100 thousand organs

161
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,680
from unwilling prisoners of conscience.

162
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,699
It seems the majority are from Falun Gong
practitioners.

163
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,169
But many still come from “Tibetan Buddhists,

164
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,409
Uighur Muslims and of course,

165
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,490
select House Christians.”

166
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,009
Yes, only select Christian organs.

167
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,330
Number 4

168
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,330
Targeting the children

169
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,059
You know, the Chinese Communist Party

170
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,629
always thinks of the children.

171
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,999
That’s why in Jiangxi Province,

172
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,509
children have been forbidden from attending
church.

173
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,289
And apparently, if you’re on welfare,

174
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,169
you’ll get it taken away if you go to church.

175
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,930
In Zhejiang province, officials banned Sunday
School.

176
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,930
Chinese children were absolutely devastated.

177
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,439
But don’t worry, kids.

178
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,860
Churches are getting around that order

179
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,669
by switching Sunday School to Saturday.

180
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:33,930
Brilliant.

181
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,830
These regulations focused on children

182
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,309
are actually a lot like the ones in China’s
Xinjiang region,

183
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,680
home to ethnic Uighurs who are mostly Muslims.

184
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,599
People are supposed to report on their neighbors

185
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:48,069
if they see anyone luring children into religion.

186
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,069
Luring children into religion?

187
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,900
Maybe the Communist Party has confused religions

188
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,520
with unmarked white vans.

189
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,589
That would explain why they think religions
are so dangerous.

190
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:59,650
Which is why they want people to...

191
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,650
Number 3

192
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,860
Renounce the faith

193
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
Last year,

194
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,080
Voice of America uncovered that Christians

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,330
were being forced to sign forms like this
one.

196
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,119
It says, “I had limited understanding of
Christianity.

197
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,229
Taking on Christianity as my belief

198
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,559
is also blindly following the trend.

199
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,660
Now I have a more comprehensive understanding

200
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,080
of religion and religious beliefs.

201
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,610
After further studying Christianity,

202
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,409
I have a clearer understanding of my spiritual
needs.

203
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,879
I announce that I will not participate in

204
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,339
Christian religious activities from now on

205
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:32,930
and I will no longer believe in Christianity.”

206
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,330
Yeah, I think I’m getting a better idea

207
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,780
of the kind of thought reform the Party wants.

208
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
Number 2

209
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,590
Your own personal Xi Jinping

210
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,740
Christians often talk about helping the poor.

211
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,220
So I think actually a lot of Christians

212
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,030
must appreciate the Party’s recent directive:

213
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,120
If you want to escape poverty,

214
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
take down that picture of Jesus,

215
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,210
and put up a picture of Communist Party leader
Xi Jinping!

216
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,780
That gem came from “a local government poverty-relief
programme

217
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,600
that seeks to ‘transform believers in religion

218
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,950
into believers in the party.’”

219
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,950
And it worked so well!

220
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,580
After local officials made personal visits
to Christian homes,

221
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,770
“more than 600 villagers ‘voluntarily’

222
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,740
got rid of the religious texts and paintings

223
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,160
they had in their homes,

224
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,890
and replaced them with 453 portraits of Xi”
Jinping.

225
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,210
Really, I think they’d have done better
to have one per person.

226
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,620
I mean, this is Communism.

227
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,310
Who wants to share?

228
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,740
And finally Number 1

229
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,470
Edits of biblical proportions

230
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,340
Burning bibles was so 2018.

231
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,220
Now, the Party is “‘retranslating and
annotating’ the Bible,

232
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,280
to find commonalities with socialism and establish

233
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,930
a ‘correct understanding’ of the text.”

234
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,660
Finally, after thousands of years

235
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,960
of erroneous biblical interpretation,

236
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,350
the Communist Party is finally giving us

237
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,050
the correct understanding of Good Book.

238
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,930
I happen to have a copy right here.

239
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,700
The First Commandment:

240
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,350
Thou shalt have no other gods before me

241
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,560
except as required by Chinese law.

242
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,330
Okay, that’s weird.

243
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,030
Thou shalt not kill,

244
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,740
unless thou art killing rightists,

245
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,960
counterrevolutionaries, running dogs,

246
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,730
separatists, religious extremists,

247
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,040
hostile foreign forces, etc.

248
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,250
Et cetera?

249
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,870
What do they mean, et cetera?

250
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,100
Ok, what about the New Testament?

251
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,020
“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want

252
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,100
anything except Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought,

253
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,160
Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three
Represents,

254
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,100
the Scientific Outlook on Development,

255
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,200
and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism

256
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,740
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”

257
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,900
Wow!

258
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,280
Revisionist Bible study is so much fun!

259
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,880
And mandatory.

260
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,880
So what do you think of the crackdown on Christians?

261
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,500
And what do you expect to be

262
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,180
in the Communist Party version of the bible?

263
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,740
And now, it’s time for me to answer a question

264
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,120
from a member of my 50-Cent Army,

265
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,500
the fans who support China Uncensored

266
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,550
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

267
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,030
Jordan Laramore asks,

268
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,550
“Is the 610 Office part of the People's
Armed Police

269
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,550
or is a completely separate organization?

270
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,900
Do they share intelligence like the CIA and
FBI do?

271
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,780
Well, speaking of cracking down on religious
people...

272
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,680
the 610 office was created in 1999 by then-leader
Jiang Zemin.

273
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,670
He used it mainly to persecute Falun Gong
practitioners

274
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,470
...but his real purpose was probably to establish

275
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,930
his own private intelligence and police agency—

276
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,790
outside the rule of law.

277
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,630
Think of it like having your own Nazi Gestapo.

278
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,370
Whoever controls it has enormous power—

279
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,330
including power over political rivals.

280
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,970
So forget inter-agency cooperation.

281
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,910
The 610 office was in fact established to
out-rank

282
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,920
other agencies like the Public Security Bureau.

283
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,890
The head of the 610 office has always been
a

284
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,840
top-ranked official from the Politburo Standing
Committee,

285
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,510
the group of seven men that rules the Chinese
Communist Party.

286
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,950
Operationally, it’s completely separate
from the People’s Armed Police.

287
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,800
There’s been some talk recently

288
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,280
of Xi Jinping disbanding the 610 office.

289
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,170
But don’t get too excited.

290
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,560
First, it’s probably just a power play against
Jiang Zemin’s cronies.

291
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,290
Second, it might be like five years ago,

292
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,830
when China’s congress “voted” to end
re-education camps.

293
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,320
And then four years later, partially legalized
them again...

294
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,380
...but this time, called them “vocational
training centers”.

295
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,980
But to answer your question precisely, Jordan,

296
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,000
not much is known about the secret workings
of the 610 office.

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,430
Do they share intelligence?

298
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,140
Maybe sometimes.

299
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,140
But they are in no way like the FBI.

300
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,440
If you’d like me to do an episode on the
610 office,

301
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,350
let me know in the comments below.

302
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,360
Be like Jordan, and support China Uncensored

303
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,860
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

304
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,220
The link is below.

305
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,720
And I might answer your question on the show
next time.

306
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,100
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

307
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
