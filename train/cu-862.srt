1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,730
Chinese citizens are boycotting again

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,520
This time over a beverage company

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,749
What did the company do?

4
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:19,460
And is China’s cancel culture getting out
of hand?

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:33,399
Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,320
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,970
The CCP celebrated its 100th anniversary on
July 1.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,329
And in Hong Kong, police were out on the streets
to make sure everyone was celebrating in the

9
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,430
right way.

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,940
That is, by not protesting.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,510
But that night, a Hong Kong policeman was
stabbed in what police called a lone-wolf

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,510
attack.

13
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,320
The man who stabbed the officer committed
suicide after the attack.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,080
And it turns out, he had “left behind several
suicide notes declaring his hatred of police,

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,940
his opposition to the Beijing-imposed security
law, and his intention to kill an officer

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,310
on July 1.”

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,870
The police officer is ok.

18
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,940
He’s recovering in the hospital.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,470
The attacker was a 50-year-old Hong Kong man
named Leung Gin-fai.

20
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,200
He worked at a Hong Kong beverage factory
called Vitasoy, which sells soy milk and other

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,310
flavored drinks.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,750
After the stabbing/suicide incident, an employee
at Vitasoy issued this internal memo.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,550
It says, “We regret to inform everyone about
the unfortunate death of Mr. Leung on July

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,580
1st.

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,700
Our company expresses our deepest condolences
to Leung’s family.”

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560
Now Mr. Leung was the attacker, not the victim.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,330
That being said, it’s understandable how
a Vitasoy employee could have written that

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,330
memo.

29
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,560
Maybe they mixed up the details of what happened.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,159
Or maybe they were actually sympathetic.

31
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,369
After all, according to this RFA survey, 81%
of Hong Kongers consider Leung a martyr, while

32
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,680
only 6% consider Leung a terrorist.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,530
But publicly, that’s not an ok view to have.

34
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,130
“Hong Kong authorities warned that advocating
for people to mourn for the attacker was no

35
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,770
different from ‘supporting terrorism.’”

36
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,830
And unfortunately for Vitasoy, that internal
memo got leaked.

37
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,430
People started sharing it across the Chinese
internet.

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,990
And Chinese netizens were...how should I put
this?

39
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,520
Extremely butt-hurt.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,300
They were angry at the memo’s choice of
words.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,340
They were furious that a person committing
suicide after attacking a police officer was

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,230
called an “unfortunate death”.

43
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,710
Plus they didn’t like the word “accident”
used to describe the incident.

44
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,920
And then mainland China’s terrifying “cancel
culture” reared its ugly head.

45
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,720
Immediately, there was a flood of comments
criticizing Vitasoy for defending Leung.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,870
“Trash Vitasoy, rooting for a terrorist!

47
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,870
It’s time to boycott!

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,370
Get out of the mainland market!”

49
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,940
“Those who support Vitasoy should leave
China.”

50
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,610
“Supporting terrorism?

51
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,540
Get out of China.”

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,460
Less than a day after word got out, this hashtag
started trending: “Have you thrown out your

53
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Vitasoy today?”

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,640
It got 5 million impressions on social media
platform Weibo.

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,070
The hashtag “Vitasoy supports Hong Kong
Protestors” has 75 million impressions.

56
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:42,980
And the hashtag “Get out of the mainland,
Vitasoy!” hit 120 million impressions.

57
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,050
Celebrities who had business relations with
Vitasoy quickly released official statements

58
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,450
denouncing their collaborations with the brand.

59
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,740
And the commercials that these actors have
done for Vitasoy in May have been taken down

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,650
from Bilibili, China’s version of YouTube.

61
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,769
Videos began circulating of local retailers
rejecting Vitasoy.

62
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,659
Starting today after the government announcement,
we’re taking all of the Vitasoy products

63
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:09,659
off the shelves.

64
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,849
We’re not selling this.

65
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,480
Everyone can go watch the video on Douyin
(TikTok) about the Vitasoy incident.

66
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,509
It’s a pity, it’s really a pity.

67
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,529
This guy buys a box of Vitasoy, just so he
can throw it in the trash.

68
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,990
It’s my fault for loving trash.

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,050
Get out of here, Trash!

70
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:36,789
And this kid shows that canceling Vitasoy
can be a family activity.

71
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:38,969
That boy is clearly a national hero.

72
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:42,669
You gotta teach ’em to cancel when they’re
young.

73
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,479
And this image went viral.

74
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,860
It reads “Chinese people don’t eat Vitasoy!

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,090
Vitasoy, Get out of China!

76
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,300
Oppose anti-Chinese behavior!”

77
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,360
Chinese people “Not eating” has become
a trending meme in China.

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
It means The Chinese people don’t accept
this.

79
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,369
It's like when your 4 year old doesn't want
to eat the broccoli on their plate.

80
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,970
The phrase was used during the recent boycott
over Xinjiang cotton).

81
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,569
Fashion brands like Nike and H&M declared
they would no longer use Xinjiang cotton because

82
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:19,810
of concerns over Uyghur slave labor . So nationalistic
Chinese netizens canceled them...for not supporting

83
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,880
China’s slave labor.

84
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,879
You can watch my video on that, where you’ll
see how quickly Chinese citizens burned their

85
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:29,460
shoes and apparel in a cotton boycott.

86
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,479
And now it’s the same thing happening to
Hong Kong’s Vitasoy . And in Vitsoy’s

87
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,470
case, it’s having a huge impact on their
bottom line.

88
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,460
More after the break.

89
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,210
Welcome back.

90
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,800
China accounts for up to 70% of Vitasoy’s
sales .

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,110
But once Chinese netizens began to cancel
Vitasoy, its shares plunged by 12% practically

92
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,110
overnight.

93
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,000
It was their biggest single-day drop since
their listing in 1994.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,499
After the initial backlash from their leaked
internal memo, vitasoy tried to walk it back

95
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,889
in this official statement.

96
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,529
“We have noticed that a document related
to the incident that occurred in Hong Kong

97
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,939
on July 1 is circulating on the Internet.

98
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,889
These documents were not officially approved
for release by Vitasoy Group.

99
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,639
Instead, they were written by an employee
privately and forwarded internally.

100
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,330
They were not authorized and did not follow
the Vitasoy Group’s internal approval process.”

101
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:34,300
Vitasoy also released this statement, saying
they’re “committed to supporting the stability,

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,159
prosperity and development of Mainland China
and Hong Kong.”

103
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,840
Which is code for we are not against the Chinese
Communist Party.

104
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,929
So officially, Vitasoy’s response checked
all the politically correct boxes.

105
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,659
But it was too late.

106
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,189
The Chinese boycott had already begun.

107
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:56,330
Throwing away Vitasoy beverages had already
become the newest act of Chinese patriotism!

108
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,330
Can’t sell this no more.

109
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
Gotta be a good Chinese person.

110
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,669
Can’t be selling this stuff, I’m taking
it all off the shelf.

111
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,639
This too, all of it.

112
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,220
All of it.

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,800
I’m not selling.

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,909
In this video, a man comes to make sure that
this store clerk is taking Vitasoy off the

115
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:19,419
shelves for the right reason.

116
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,409
Man: Excuse me miss, you’re taking the Vitasoy
beverages off the shelves?

117
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,139
Woman: It’s not an issue with the quality
of the product.

118
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,379
Man: I know, I know, I saw the news.

119
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,119
So I’m just asking if you’re removing
them off the shelves?

120
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,119
Woman: Of course.

121
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:35,360
People are also posting photos of their trips
to their local stores, just to check up on

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,780
whether Vitasoy was taken off the shelves.

123
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,520
And any store that still had Vitasoy would
be shamed.

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:50,509
This live streamer was drinking a carton of
Vitasoy lemonade, when his live chat ordered

125
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,610
him to get rid of that carton right away.

126
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,610
Oh, sorry.

127
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,050
Ok ok ok, I threw it out, I threw it out,
I threw it out.

128
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,719
Did something happen in the news?

129
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,719
Let me see.

130
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:00,719

Meanwhile fans in the livestream chat are
typing “gd”, which is code for the censored

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,139
term “Hong Kong Independence”.

135

Ohh, I see, ok.

00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:25,110

Yes, China’s the best.

140
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,029
Because if you don’t prove you threw your
politically incorrect drink in the trash,

141
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,499
the mob will come for you.

142
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:48,499
.

143
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:54,250
And just when things seemed like they couldn’t
get worse for Vitasoy...came the bomb threats.

144
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,550
Then an official notice was posted on the
Chinese internet stating the Human Resources

145
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,160
Director of Vitasoy’s Hong Kong Operations
had left the company.

146
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,360
This led netizens to believe Vitasoy fired
her.

147
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,720
But that still wasn’t enough!

148
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,940
Netizens doxxed her and shared pictures and
videos of her LinkedIn account.

149
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,040
That account is now no longer available on
LinkedIn.

150
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,180
And finally, Vitasoy’s chairman announced
that the company has fired the employee who

151
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,440
wrote the original memo.

152
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,910
Now I know China takes its law about respecting
the police very seriously.

153
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,330
But Vitasoy didn’t slander the police, and
they didn’t harm national security.

154
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,140
But with the response to Vitasoy’s one internal
memo, Vitasoy and its employees were put in

155
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,569
real danger.

156
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:48,509
Chinese boycotts often get out of hand really
fast.

157
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:53,800
When the cause is “politically correct,”
China’s state censors will take a back seat,

158
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,519
and let the people turn on each other.

159
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,250
It’s a great way to let people blow off
steam.

160
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,079
And sure, some people get hurt, but only the
“bad” people—the ones who don’t express

161
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,930
unconditional love for the Chinese Communist
Party.

162
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,860
And now, I’ll answer a question from a member
of the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army that

163
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,460
supports this show on Patreon.

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,620
is somewhat reluctant to invade Taiwan.

166
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,310
I hope they aren’t really considering invading
the country of Taiwan.”

167
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,470
Well Marc, the Chinese Communist Party is
not reluctant to invade Taiwan.

168
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,779
They want to do it.

169
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,670
In fact, the US admiral in charge of US Indo-Pacific
Command recently called it China’s number

170
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,820
one priority.

171
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,410
For the Communist Party, they see it as part
of their “rejuvenation” of China.

172
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,250
Plus they want to occupy Taiwan for military
reasons.

173
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,949
They need their navy to be established in
what’s called the “first island chain”

174
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:55,120
to access the Pacific.

175
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,220
Now you asked if they’re reluctant to invade.

176
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,699
They’re not.

177
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,839
But they are cautious.

178
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,010
They won’t try it until they think there’s
a strong chance they’ll succeed.

179
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,230
And the more Taiwan prepares for an invasion,
the less likely it will happen.

180
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,660
And the more support countries like the US,
Japan, and Australia show for defending Taiwan,

181
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,589
the less likely they’ll have to *actually*
defend Taiwan.

182
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,569
Thanks for your question, Marc.

183
