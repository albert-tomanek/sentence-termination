1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,610
The Chinese Communist Party says

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,900
There’s no genocide in Xinjiang

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,360
And I totally believe them

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,880
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,000
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,270
Well everyone, I was wrong.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,160
There is no genocide in Xinjiang.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,779
The Chinese Communist Party is not trying
to eliminate the Uyghur ethnic minority.

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,710
Who are extremely happy all the time, especially
when they dance.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,230
How did I see the error of my ways?

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,690
Was it all of the YouTube comments calling
me a CIA puppet?

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,690
Close.

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,520
It was this magnificent documentary.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,610
Dating from remote antiquity, Xinjiang has
been an integral and inseparable part of the

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,660
Chinese territory.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,120
And indeed, a land of special significance.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,239
Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central
Committee, under the exceptional care the

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,150
Party and the central government have devoted,
with the generous assistance of the 19 pairing-up

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,860
cities, and through the concerted efforts
of cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups,

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:26,439
Xinjiang has been transformed to a land of
life, a land of thriving vitality.

21
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:34,910
Yes, Xinjiang has been a part of Chinese territory
since ancient times, which is why “Xinjiang”

22
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,880
literally means “new frontier.”

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,990
And I am especially convinced of the exceptional
care of the Communist Party.

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,990
I mean, there were happy dancing ethnic minorities
*and* doves of peace and thriving vitality.

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,100
How can you argue with that?

26
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,100
You know what?

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,520
This is too much sarcasm even for me.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,880
If you think anyone who buys this kind of
propaganda must be an idiot—well, there

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,060
are a lot of idiots out there.

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,109
That’s why some Western governments are
actually saying we shouldn’t call what’s

31
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:12,829
happening in Xinjiang genocide.

32
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,650
New Zealand is the latest example.

33
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,120
They’re not calling it genocide.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,730
Instead, they’re going “to water down
the language, and discuss concerns about human

35
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,579
rights abuses in the region in more general
terms.”

36
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:29,950
Genocide is such a harsh word.

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,110
Instead we should be talking about how the
Chinese government is being a big meany to

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,170
the Uyghurs.

39
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,969
Maybe New Zealand didn’t want to be too
critical because of their upgraded free trade

40
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:45,349
deal with China, their number one trade partner.

41
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:48,400
Or maybe I’m being unfair to New Zealand.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,799
After all, New Zealand leader Jacinda Arden
is taking a tougher stance on China.

43
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:58,980
“By saying it was getting harder to reconcile
differences as China’s role in the world

44
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
grows.”

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,090
Wow.

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,639
What a tough stance.

47
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,319
It’s getting harder to reconcile differences?

48
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,060
How will Chinese leader Xi Jinping sleep at
night?

49
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,359
This is like saying your mom telling you you
can only have two cookies before bed instead

50
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,109
of three is taking a tough stance.

51
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,599
But that Arden’s extremely mild comment
was considered anything close to tough shows

52
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,920
you how low the bar is when it comes to standing
up to the Chinese regime.

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,420
But one country that is standing up in a big
way is the US.

54
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,469
The US State Department under both Trump and
Biden, has said that the Chinese Communist

55
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,419
Party is committing genocide against the Uyghurs.

56
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,859
Some US allies have done the same.

57
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,540
Others have not.

58
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,170
Leading to a genocide divide, if you will.

59
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,299
So far, on one side is the US State Deparatment,
along with the UK and Canadian Parliaments,

60
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,919
which have all said that it’s genocide.

61
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:05,719
On the other side are Australia and New Zealand,
which won’t use the word genocide.

62
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,449
I just want to remind everyone that the Chinese
regime’s treatment of the Uyghurs qualifies

63
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,910
as genocide, according to the UN Genocide
Convention.

64
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,560
According to the UN, genocide includes “killing
members of the group, causing serious bodily

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,130
or mental harm, deliberately inflicting on
the group conditions of life calculated to

66
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,620
bring about its physical destruction, imposing
measures intended to prevent births within

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,800
the group, and forcibly transferring children
of the group to another group.”

68
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,090
With the intent to destroy a group.

69
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:49,159
Look China, the UN Genocide Convention is
not an instruction manual!

70
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,069
All of this is happening in Xinjiang.

71
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,199
So based on the UN Genocide Convention, it’s
genocide.

72
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,460
At least until China convinces the UN to completely
change their definition of genocide.

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,889
That’s partly a joke and partly an extremely
depressing prediction.

74
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:12,970
Now, I did a previous episode on why Western
countries hesitate to use the term “genocide.”

75
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,150
Basically, it gets harder to do business with
China if we admit the Chinese regime is committing

76
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,150
genocide.

77
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,750
And Western companies really, really want
to do business with China.

78
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,080
Heck, they’ll even give innovation awards
to Chinese companies that monitor prisoners

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,229
in Xinjiang.

80
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:38,850
But now that the US and other Western democracies
are actually using the “g” word, companies

81
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,340
are facing pressure to stop working with Chinese
suppliers that use forced labor.

82
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,120
Enough pressure to force them to do something
about it.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,729
The US has imposed many sanctions on Chinese
officials and Chinese state-run companies

84
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,710
because of the genocide.

85
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,169
And Canada, the UK, and even the EU have imposed
sanctions, too.

86
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,530
The Chinese Communist Party is freaking out.

87
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,310
They didn’t expect to get in trouble for
committing genocide against the Uyghurs.

88
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,150
After all, they got away with it when they
did pretty much the same things to the Tibetans,

89
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,810
the Mongolians, and Falun Gong.

90
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,160
The Communist Party needs China to be known
as “a shiny huge market where companies

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,169
can make a lot of money.”

92
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:29,699
But if this keeps going, China will instead
be known as “a bigger North Korea.”

93
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,189
The Party can’t let that happen.

94
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:36,009
Which is why they’re kicking off a huge
propaganda campaign.

95
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,190
I’ll tell you about it after the break.

96
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,499
Welcome Back.

97
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,080
The Chinese regime doesn’t want to be known
as “a bigger North Korea.”

98
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,219
Especially in the run up to the 2022 Winter
Olympics in Beijing.

99
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:55,300
So this year, they’ve been pushing hard
on a new propaganda campaign to deny the accusations

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,690
of genocide.

101
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,550
By showing how happy and wonderful Xinjiang
is.

102
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,379
This is a land of religious harmony where
the freedom of religious belief is respected

103
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,750
and protected.

104
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:14,129
This is a land of happiness where people’s
well being is constantly improved

105
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,789
All ethnic customs are duly respected

106
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:19,960
And let’s not forget the dancing!

107
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,810
That’s how you know that ethnic minorities
are really happy.

108
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,510
They spontaneously start dancing.

109
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,979
So much dancing.

110
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,180
Eat your heart out, Kevin Bacon.

111
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Footloose)

112
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,449
The Chinese Communist Party has used the tactic
before.

113
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,570
And not just with the Uyghurs.

114
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,599
As their repression of Tibet grew worse, Chinese
state-run media repeatedly emphasized how

115
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,529
happy Tibetans were.

116
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,919
In fact, Tibetans are the happiest people
in the country.

117
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,289
You can tell because they’re dancing.

118
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,720
Well, Tibetans were the happiest, but now
the Uyghurs are even happier.

119
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,800
The Chinese embassy in Canberra screened this
video of happy Uyghurs for Australian journalists

120
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,570
as part of a two-hour propaganda blitz earlier
this year.

121
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,129
But those cynical Western journalists just
weren’t buying it.

122
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,960
Maybe because Western journalists have been
repeatedly forced out of China after reporting

123
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,419
on Xinjiang.

124
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:25,160
And before they’re forced out, this is what
they face when they try to go to Xinjiang.

125
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:35,419
“We were turned back from checkpoints, stopped
from filming, questioned, and followed.”

126
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,240
That happened to the BBC when they tried to
report on the use of forced labor in Xinjiang’s

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,459
cotton industry.

128
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:47,800
But don’t worry, even if Western journalists
can’t get the scoop, Chinese state-run media

129
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,170
is there to do the hard-hitting investigative
reporting.

130
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,820
“I left no stone unturned, but still couldn’t
find any trace of genocide.”

131
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,820
“So Michelle, you can see, with us is a
very prosperous Aitiga Square, and this is

132
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,270
exactly what is happening in Kashgar.

133
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,589
There’s definitely no genocide, so to speak.

134
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,230
So Michelle, back to you.”

135
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,860
“Yes, I looked very hard, but there’s
no genocide anywhere in the middle of this

136
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,990
square.

137
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,990
Back to you, Michelle.”

138
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:24,580
But for some reason, people outside China
might be skeptical of Chinese state-run propaganda.

139
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,529
But the Chinese Communist Party has a solution.

140
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,589
More after the break.

141
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:31,950
Welcome back.

142
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,029
The Chinese Communist Party has been trying
to spread its propaganda about happy Uyghurs

143
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,740
in Xinjiang.

144
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,320
Including by buying ads on major social media
platforms, like Facebook.

145
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,100
And using fake fans to boost their message
on Twitter.

146
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,010
But what happens if people are skeptical about
what the Chinese Communist Party has to say?

147
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:59,089
Well, the Party has a solution: get other
people to say it for them.

148
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,779
For example, if you don’t believe the Party
when it says there’s no genocide in Xinjiang,

149
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,050
do you believe the Economist?

150
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:13,110
Or how about a Columbia University professor
like Jeffrey Sachs, who says the genocide

151
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,449
allegations are unjustified?

152
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,600
Sachs’s argument sounds deceptively reasonable.

153
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,529
He says the US government doesn’t have proof
of genocide, so they shouldn’t accuse China

154
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:30,240
of genocide, but instead should back a UN
investigation in Xinjiang.

155
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,670
Of course, the Chinese regime will never allow
an independent investigation into Xinjiang.

156
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,170
Especially not through the UN, which it has
a huge amount of influence over.

157
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,139
So if the only way we can get proof is through
a UN investigation that will never happen,

158
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,920
then we’ll never call it genocide.

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,990
And meanwhile the Chinese regime can just
continue harvesting organs from Uyghurs.

160
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,120
Jeffrey Sachs, by the way, is a popular interviewee
for Chinese state-run media.

161
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,769
I’m not saying that Sachs is bought off
or even influenced by the Chinese Communist

162
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,079
Party.

163
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,440
But when the Party finds people who agree
with them, they will exploit them for propaganda.

164
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,920
Here’s another example: Western Youtubers
living in China.

165
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,839
If you do a search for Xinjiang on YouTube,
you will find lots of videos of YouTubers

166
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:29,899
who travel to Xinjiang and are making videos
of what they say is really happening there.

167
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,050
Spoiler alert: they don’t find any genocide,
either.

168
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,740
Of course, they’re not exactly going to
tour the concentration camps.

169
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,890
Instead, they show bustling cities, speak
to Uyghurs who say that life is pretty good,

170
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,759
and some of them even travel to cotton farms
to show that there’s no forced labor.

171
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,519
Again, I’m not saying these YouTubers are
bought off by the Communist Party.

172
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,079
Always.

173
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:58,710
But it is interesting that these YouTubers
were allowed to travel through Xinjiang and

174
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,540
talk to people, unlike the BBC.

175
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,089
And that people in Xinjiang were willing to
talk to them.

176
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:11,100
State-run CGTN even followed one of these
YouTubers around while he was in Xinjiang,

177
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,370
and made a news story out of that.

178
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,420
Clearly what he was saying aligned with the
Party’s narrative.

179
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,140
These YouTube videos capitalize on a general
mistrust of the mainstream media, and claim

180
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,390
to show what’s really happening on the ground.

181
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,980
But if what they’re showing is also what
the authoritarian regime wants you to see,

182
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,069
maybe take that with a grain of salt.

183
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,089
Several grains of salt.

184
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,440
Of course, this type of propaganda isn’t
the only way the Chinese Communist Party is

185
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,550
trying to cover up the Uyghur genocide.

186
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,420
A major part of it is attacking activists
and scholars that are exposing the genocide.

187
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,319
They say they’re lying about all the torture
and rape.

188
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:58,250
Or Chinese state-run media get their family
members still living in China to say it for

189
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,250
them.

190
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,829
They totally volunteered.

191
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:08,180
Imagine not seeing your parents in years only
to watch them disown you in a Chinese propaganda

192
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,380
video.

193
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,300
And the final piece of the Chinese regime’s
Xinjiang propaganda push is one that they’re

194
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,750
really, really good at: playing the victim.

195
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,690
The US was the first country to come out and
call the Chinese regime’s actions a genocide.

196
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,170
So the Communist Party can pull out its favorite
accusation: Western imperialism.

197
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:36,279
You see, the US is organizing a smear campaign
because of its hegemony.

198
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,770
And the accusations of genocide are just a
US attempt to contain China that’s doomed

199
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,420
to fail.

200
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,240
I love it when the Communist Party plays the
classics.

201
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,819
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a fan who supports the show on the crowd

202
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:52,160
funding website Patreon.

203
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,620
Go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn
more.

204
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,379
LivenTs says:
I know that almost literally everything is

205
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:01,840
made in China.

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,360
Is there a list of things that aren't?

207
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,279
Is there a website I can search for a product
and find what companies make it not in China?

208
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,410
Or in which I can search a company, and find
out where it produces?

209
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,910
Maybe that's what we need.

210
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,710
Actually LivenTs, we’ve been talking about
creating a website that does exactly that.

211
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,529
That would let you know what products are
made in China and if there are alternatives

212
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,639
that aren’t made in China.

213
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,279
Is that something that you guys would be interested
in?

214
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,459
Is it something you think you could help us
make?

215
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,220
Let me know in the comments below.

216
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,880
Thanks for your question, LivenTs.

217
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,350
And thank you for supporting the show on Patreon.

218
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,129
Thank you for watching this episode.

219
00:14:41,129 --> 00:15:01,790
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next
time.
