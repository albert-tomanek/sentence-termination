bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
what you don t know about the New York Times

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:11,790
Is Killing People Logo Hi, welcome to China
Uncensored, I m Chris Chappell. You know,

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,410
the New York Times is one of the few foreign
language news websites that s actually unblocked

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,115
in China. Why is that? If you saw one of my
earlier episodes, you know the New York Times

5
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:20,115
is being paid to publish Chinese propaganda.
It s called China Watch. They aren t the only

6
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:21,115
ones either; the Washington Post has a whole
site dedicated to it, but with a very obvious

7
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,115
warning that it isn t their own reporting.
And you know, the kind of stories you get

8
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:23,115
in these things are top notch. Like this one
about China s new leader Xi Jinping being

9
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:24,115
a caring listener. And he has dreamy eyes.
But hey, I get it. In America we like presidents

10
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:25,115
we can share a beer with. And look at how
well that turned out for us. But the New York

11
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:26,115
Times is taking it to a whole new level. You
know the Times has been criticized for failing

12
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:27,115
to report on the Holocaust. There s a book
about it called Buried by the Times. During

13
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:34,829
World War 2, in 24,000 front-page stories,
only 26 were about the Holocaust and in only

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,579
six were Jews mentioned as the primary victims.
Well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,680
twice; better buy the New York Post. Now it
s the Chinese regime s genocide of Falun Gong

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,999
practitioners in China that the Times is not
only ignoring, but actually helping. Since

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:47,999
1999, Falun Gong adherents have been the victims
of a systematic campaign of torture and terror,

18
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:48,999
including beatings, electric baton shocks,
injections with psychotropic drugs, forced-feeding,

19
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:49,999
rape and other forms of sexual abuse. Report
after report has come in about this from sources

20
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:50,999
like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
the UN, and even the US government. In 2006,

21
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:51,999
an independent investigation even found massive
evidence that China at the state-level has

22
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:52,999
been forcefully harvesting the organs of still-living
Falun Gong practitioners for sale. A recent

23
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:53,999
US Congressional hearing lead to a dear colleague
letter signed by 106 US Senators demanding

24
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:54,999
the US State Department release what it knows
about it. But don t bother looking for the

25
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:55,999
congressional hearing or dear colleague letter
in the New York Times. They didn t cover it.

26
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:56,999
In fact, since 2001, there s been a sharp
decline in any reporting about Falun Gong.

27
00:00:56,999 --> 00:00:57,999
In ten years after the persecution began in
1999, only 164 articles have been written

28
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:02,679
about Falun Gong, most were in the first two
years. Not only did the number shrink, the

29
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:08,430
tone of the articles they did publish dramatically
changed after 2001. Considering Falun Gong

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,030
is a persecuted group inside China, you d
think the stories would, I don t know, be

31
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,890
about China. But since 2003, not a single
meaningful article about Falun Gong inside

32
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,500
China was published. And it also seems to
me that if you were to report on a group suffering

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,079
genocide at the hands of the Chinese Communist
regime, you wouldn t use the Chinese Communist

34
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,930
regime as your main source of information.
But that s exactly what the New York Times

35
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,640
has been doing. So before 2001, Falun Gong
was described as a peaceful spiritual practice

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,480
with roots in traditional Chinese culture,
that were victims of a quote, propaganda blitz,

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,700
which recalls Maoist campaigns of the 1950s
and 60s. (Show in Video Edit-Mark Landler

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,700
s account from July 22, 1999 that describes
the practice as a fusion of the ancient Chinese

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,700
practice of qigong the channeling of vital
energies through breathing exercises with

40
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,579
elements of Buddhism and Taoism) But after
2001, suddenly Falun Gong practitioners began

41
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:56,649
to sound like THEY were the bad guys. In a
third of the articles the New York Times published

42
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,390
about Falun Gong, they described the practice
as a sect, or just used the term the Chinese

43
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,689
regime uses, evil cult. And it really stopped
sounding like they were even being persecuted.

44
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:14,120
In 2005, Jim Yardley of the Times wrote, Falun
Gong is waging an aggressive campaign to publicize

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,659
its allegations of mistreatment, which the
Chinese government has denied. It is impossible

46
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:25,150
to prove or disprove all of its specific allegations.
The next year, evidence for the forced organ

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,400
harvesting of still living Falun Gong practitioners
became public. I guess though the Times feels

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,870
that the burden of proof is on the victims.
That s how a sane world works, right? But

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,420
then they also started contradicting their
own reporting. In 1999, when the persecution

50
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,880
began, the Times cited figures put out by
China that there were 70 million people practicing

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Falun Gong in China. But then in 2001, Craig
Smith wrote that the number was made up by

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,379
Falun Gong practitioners, and that quote,
Closer scrutiny suggests the movement in China

53
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,489
never numbered more than several million.
Which is funny because when he was working

54
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,319
for the Wall Street Journal, he wrote, some
government officials estimate that the number

55
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,879
of followers has reached 60 million or more.
s also written that Falun Gong practitioners

56
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,410
have, died as a result of confrontations with
the police or prison guards. Not from brutal

57
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,000
torture of an all-powerful regime crushing
dissidence, mind you, but just a confrontation,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,989
between police and what he describes as a
sect that makes up numbers. I m sure they

59
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,560
just fell down the stairs. So if the Times
is your only source, you get the skewed image

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,280
that Falun Gong is a weird, extremist group,
that on the one hand could very well not be

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,580
suffering persecution, but at the same time
also have been crushed by the Chinese regime.

62
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,909
(image of NY Times article Falun Gong Manages
Skimpy Rally; Is Sect Fading?) And it s really

63
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:43,549
weird that there was such a big shift AFTER
2001. I wonder what happened, you know, it

64
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,239
s not like I have access to the inner workings
of the New York Times or the Chinese government

65
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:54,079
for that matter. Butttttttt, it does strangely
seem to coincide with an exclusive interview

66
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,860
the New York Times happened to pull off with
Jiang Zemin, then Chinese leader and also

67
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,140
the guy who started the persecution against
Falun Gong. And then suddenly after that interview,

68
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,250
the New York Times website became unblocked
in China and to this day remains one of the

69
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,459
few foreign news sites to be so. In fact,
Professor Jiao Buobiao said the New York Times

70
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,620
is the only international newspaper available
at Beijing University s library. And they

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,300
just happen to be towing the Party line about
the biggest human rights violation of the

72
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,410
21st century. Pretty random coincidence, huh?
I wonder if they make people in China pay

73
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,020
to see their website because I m pretty sick
of that myself. So from now on, if you re

74
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,190
looking for China news, I d suggest maybe
not reading the New York Times. Once again,

75
