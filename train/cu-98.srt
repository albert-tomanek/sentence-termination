1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,829
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,340
how far can you push a lie?

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,960
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,180
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,269
From the country that brought you

6
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,849
a ban on reincarnation,

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,320
comes the most mind-bending

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,320
assault on logic yet.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,099
You see, the Chinese Communist Party

10
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,500
is a bit like Richard Simmons.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,419
Only instead of stretching those glutes,

12
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:30,710
the Communist Party stretches the truth.

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,880
Unlike Richard Simmons,

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,270
the Communist Party has not

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,520
suddenly disappeared.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
You may be familiar with the Chinese regime

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,840
doing some construction in disputed territorial
waters

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,200
in the South China Sea.

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,300
This is Fiery Cross Reef.

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,990
And here’s a timelapse of Fiery Cross Reef.

21
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,560
You can see a close-up of the 10,000-foot
runway

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,920
they built on it,

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,460
perfect for military planes.

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,020
And according to US officials,

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,170
these might be missile silos.

26
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,360
So if you go by what some people call

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,920
objective reality,

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,499
you’d think the Chinese regime is building

29
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,030
man-made islands for military purposes.

30
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,270
But if you take the red and yellow pill,

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,109
things aren’t what they seem.

32
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:18,389
Because according to Wu Qian,

33
00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:19,659
China’s Defense Minister,

34
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,119
there’s “no such thing.”

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,119
In other news:

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,859
War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance
is Strength.

37
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:31,009
Specifically what the Defense Minister said
was,

38
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,110
"Most of the building is for civilian purposes”

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,729
“including necessary defensive facilities”

40
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,780
But he also said:

41
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,399
"There is no such thing

42
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,990
as man-made islands"

43
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,990
In other words,

44
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,509
military falls under the category of civilian.

45
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,509
And there’s no such thing

46
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,499
as what they’re building, anyway.

47
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:54,119
Yes, none of this exists.

48
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,469
When reporters asked him to explain his comment,

49
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,310
“Wu declined to elaborate,

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,179
saying China had already provided a full explanation

51
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,009
of its construction work.”

52
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,580
Construction work that never happened, right?

53
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,420
It's like something out of a movie.

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,530
Wait a second!

55
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,020
I know what’s going on!

56
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,980
Wu Qian is trying to use Jedi mind tricks
on us.

57
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,810
“There are no man-made islands.”

58
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,200
Well, Wu Qian, Jedi mind tricks don’t work
on me.

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Hey!

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,330
C’mon Seamus.

61
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,830
At least Photoshop me onto a character

62
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,300
from one of the good Star Wars movies.

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,020
That’s more like it.

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,200
Or maybe it's not Star Wars...

65
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,640
Maybe there are no man-made islands

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,560
because there is no reality.

67
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,660
We're all just living in some kind of artificial
simulation

68
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,640
of a world that doesn't exist anymore.

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,520
Nah, that's just crazy.

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Anyway, why is this man-made islands thing

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,700
such a big deal?

72
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,050
Well, the Chinese regime is engaged in territorial
disputes

73
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,800
with many of its neighbors

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,130
over the resource-rich South China Sea.

75
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,970
China claims pretty much all of it

76
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,390
within this red line,

77
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,700
called the nine-dash line.

78
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,760
Whether or not those claims have historical
legitimacy,

79
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,630
the Chinese regime is proceeding aggressively

80
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,060
by dredging up sand and piling it on

81
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,860
mostly submerged reefs.

82
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,471
Then, they use those man-made islands

83
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,480
to exert territorial claims,

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,750
saying those islands belong to China,

85
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,420
since, you know,

86
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,210
China built them.

87
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,960
Then they say they never built them,

88
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,740
even though we have pictures of them

89
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,320
doing it.

90
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,410
Wait!

91
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,610
What if the Chinese regime

92
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,190
didn't build those islands after all?

93
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,230
What if that's what Wu Qian meant

94
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,150
when he said there were no man-made islands?

95
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,350
The Chinese military wasn't dredging up sand

96
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,180
to build islands.

97
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,450
It was merely helping to uncover natural islands

98
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,630
with natural sand that exists

99
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,870
at the bottom of the ocean

100
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,930
and would one day maybe form those exact islands

101
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,340
on those exact coral reefs

102
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,060
that the Chinese military killed

103
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,260
in order to not build those islands on top
of.

104
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,410
If you think about it,

105
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,900
it's very eco-friendly.

106
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,220
Al Gore would approve.

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,840
And it’s a great strategy.

108
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,380
Because no matter how insane it is,

109
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,660
what is anyone going to do about it?

110
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,000
No one wants to go to war with China.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,150
And so the Chinese regime

112
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,540
keeps pushing the envelope

113
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,660
until they push it into Crazytown.

114
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,280
Which was primarily built for civilian purposes,

115
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,630
including necessary defensive facilities.

116
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,180
So what do you think of China’s claim

117
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,280
there’s no such thing as man-made islands?

118
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,630
Leave your comments below.

119
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,220
