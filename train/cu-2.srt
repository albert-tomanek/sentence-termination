1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,690
Xi Jinping solidifies his grip on the military
police.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,900
The hottest viral sensation in China is Ice
Boy.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,509
And finally, you can buy your own half-built
skyscraper...

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,170
it’s a bit of a fixer-upper.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,980
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,020
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,220
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,810
Protests broke out recently in Iran

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,050
over the poor economy.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,640
And that has China worried.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,110
According to this article from Radio Free
Asia,

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,600
...China’s propaganda department told state-run
media

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,690
not to report on the Iranian protests.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,000
For some reason they don’t want Chinese
people

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,699
learning about a popular uprising

17
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,769
against an authoritarian regime

18
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:49,180
started by people upset over economic hardship.

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,449
Plus, online forums discussing

20
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,850
anything to do with Iran

21
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,030
are being monitored.

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,579
And let’s just say,

23
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,940
they’re open to the idea of detaining people.

24
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,420
That’s the way to stop protests from getting
started.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,309
Preemptive detention.

26
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,309
Before on the show,

27
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:06,410
I’ve talked about how there’s a political
battle

28
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,040
raging between current Chinese leader Xi Jinping

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,550
and a faction tied to former Chinese leader

30
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,640
and Jabba the Hutt’s personal mini-me,

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,200
Jiang Zemin.

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,830
To be the Master Blaster of Chinese politics

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,520
it’s important to control two things—

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
the military and the police.

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,830
Well, Xi Jinping has spent years

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,310
purging the military of Jiang Zemin’s cronies

37
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,000
and getting himself named Commander in Xi-ef.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,810
Now he’s after the police.

39
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,140
Specifically the paramilitary police.

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,160
One of the big things Xi did at the end of
2017

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,170
was to have the paramilitary police report
directly to

42
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,250
the Central Military Commission.

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,130
Which Xi is in charge of.

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,690
Xi’s speech to the paramilitary police

45
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,100
follows another speech he made last week

46
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,120
to the actual military.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,880
He told soldiers not to fear death.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,260
Inspirational words for soldiers

49
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,140
who fight on the front lines.

50
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,750
But for soldiers who are still in training,

51
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,740
fearing death is a good thing.

52
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,930
It could save your life

53
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,489
if you’re bad at, say,

54
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,489
grenades.

55
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,890
Just throwing that out there.

56
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,569
Why the big speech?

57
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,670
Xi Jinping probably just felt the army

58
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,049
needed a little kick in the rear.

59
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,090
Apparently they’ve wasting time

60
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,750
building snowmen.

61
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,049
Can we zoom out a little on that tank one?

62
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:29,840
Well, someone’s getting preemptively sent
to detention.

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,280
But as impressive as the PLA is

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,790
at building snow propaganda,

65
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,069
they can’t compete with the the annual

66
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,870
Harbin Ice Festival.

67
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,299
10,000 people worked for months

68
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,830
crafting this winter wonderland that will
be seen

69
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,150
by an estimated 1.5 million people.

70
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,189
Sadly none of them will be me.

71
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,349
Of course the cold isn’t fun and games for
everyone.

72
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,489
This little boy has become something of a
national hero

73
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,560
after this photo of him went viral.

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,920
His hair is coated in frost after his daily

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,599
three mile walk to school in a thin jacket.

76
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,760
Wow, his hands look like he’s been

77
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
working in a coal mine

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,010
for the last 50 years.

79
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,810
But he got a 99 on his test!

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,639
His name is Wang Fuman,

81
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,409
and people are calling him Ice Boy.

82
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,370
The rural school he goes to doesn’t even
have

83
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,430
heat in the winter.

84
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,800
He and his sister are left behind children—

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,150
their father is a migrant worker

86
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,900
trying to earn money in the city,

87
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,799
and only comes home every 4 or 5 months.

88
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,959
Their mother abandoned the family.

89
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,430
The good news is that his photo

90
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,790
has inspired people across China

91
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,739
to donate winter clothing to a local youth
charity.

92
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,150
And the school has received

93
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,769
over 15,000 dollars in donations so far.

94
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,169
Which means Ice Boy finally gets gloves.

95
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,169


96
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,169
Plus, someone offered his dad

97
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,090
a construction job close to home,

98
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,409
so he can actually see his kids.

99
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,659
Someday Ice Boy will be able to tell his children,

100
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,270
with complete honesty,

101
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,270
when I was your age,

102
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,720
I had to walk 3 miles to school everyday,

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
in the snow,

104
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
uphill,

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,579
both ways.

106
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,260
And here are the viral videos to prove it.

107
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
And his kids will say,

108
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,280
“What’s a video?”

109
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,530
In other news, ever want to own a skyscraper?

110
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,600
Well now you can!

111
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,340
A court in Shanxi is trying to dump this beautiful,

112
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,940
39-story skyscraper on Taobao,

113
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,890
China’s version of Ebay.

114
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,950
You can own it for just 84 million dollars.

115
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,100
Basically, the builders ran out of money

116
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,420
before it could be completed

117
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,860
and it’s just been sitting there

118
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,370
ever since 2010.

119
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,440
Now the first auction

120
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,010
was not the most successful.

121
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,070
Zero people bid on it.

122
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,160
But don’t worry,

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,820
you haven’t missed your chance!

124
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,630
The Shanxi court has a new plan.

125
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,200
Another auction!

126
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
What do you think?

You know, you don’t have to

131
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,850
walk uphill both ways in the snow
