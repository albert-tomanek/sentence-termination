00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,750
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:05,230
A foreign country has been interfering in
our elections.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,440
Guess which one!

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,650
The CIA says China is undermining the US.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,420
And if anyone knows about undermining a country,

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,420
it’s the CIA.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,670
And finally, fingers crossed for a trip to
Tibet!

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,420
Sadly it probably won’t be free.

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,140
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,640
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,570
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,950
A foreign government is interfering in US
elections.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,580
And President Trump is tired of

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,120
letting Russia get all the credit.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,390
This time, he’s talking about

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,090
a different country in particular:

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,090
China.

18
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,280
Speaking to the UN Security Council,

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,340
Trump said, “[China does] not want me or
us to win

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,410
because I am the first president ever

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,699
to challenge China on trade.

22
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:52,980
We are winning on trade.

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,899
We are winning at every level.

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,899
We don't want them to meddle

25
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:57,930
or interfere in our upcoming election."

26
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,930
And that had to be a bit awkward.

27
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,960
I mean, the UN Security Council is only five
countries.

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,250
And China is one of them.

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,460
Well, Russia is also one of them,

30
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,890
so I guess they were relieved.

31
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,799
Is the Chinese Communist Party interfering
in US elections?

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,070
Yes, but not like Russia.

33
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,790
Internet bots are for amateurs.

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,370
More on that in a future episode.

35
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,229
According to the new director of the CIA,

36
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:27,040
China is working to diminish US influence
around the world.

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,310
She specifically talked about how the Chinese
regime

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,229
promises loans to many developing countries,

39
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,229
which they can’t repay.

40
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,390
On paper,

41
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,600
China is investing almost a trillion dollars

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
as part of its Belt and Road Initiative—

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,460
an infrastructure plan where China

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,890
gives developing countries massive loans.

45
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,159
So far, the actual amount spent has been

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,510
less than the Chinese regime promised.

47
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,630
Which is actually a good thing,

48
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,119
because those loans have been

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,260
trapping those countries in debt,

50
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,130
while Chinese businesses extract resources

51
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,799
and often do very little for the local economies.

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,670
Yes, why would any country

53
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,380
ever want to do business with anyone else?

54
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,700
Now believe it or not, US-China relations
aren’t doing great.

55
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,260
I know, shocking, but there are some warning
signs.

56
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,190
Just two days before a planned meeting between

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,060
a top Chinese naval officer and his US counterpart,

58
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,680
the Chinese side called it off!

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
At the same time,

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,410
China denied a request from a US naval vessel

61
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,250
to enter port in Hong Kong.

62
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,760
This is not a first.

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
In 2016,

64
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,410
when everyone was freaking out about China

65
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,120
building military facilities

66
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,790
on artificial islands in the South China Sea,

67
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,250
the ones they said they would never militarize…

68
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,500
China also denied another US naval ship

69
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,880
from entering port in Hong Kong.

70
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,920
The ship denied entry this time, the USS Wasp,
responded,

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,560
“Roger That.

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,200
We’ll just buzzzz off.”

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,450
But that doesn’t mean there can’t be friendly
military exchange

74
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,970
between the US and another part of China.

75
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,700
Namely, Taiwan.

76
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,070
Which communist China believes is a province,

77
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,200
but most sane people believe is a country.

78
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,430
The US is selling 330 million dollars of weapons
to Taiwan.

79
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,730
Obviously, the Chinese Communist Party is
unhappy.

80
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,840
So they “urged” the US to cancel the deal,

81
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,200
or risk doing damage to US-China relations.

82
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,240
I believe that ship has already sailed.

83
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,580
That ship is the USS Wasp

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,980
and it’s somewhere off the coast of Hong
Kong by now.

85
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,170
Some good news for a change.

86
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,170
The Vatican and the Chinese Communist Party

87
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,890
are close to finalizing an agreement

88
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,260
that will change the lives of Catholics in
China.

89
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,200
No, it won’t stop the Party from tearing
down churches.

90
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,510
Or get the Party to stop forcing people

91
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,130
to replace pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping.

92
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,680
Or stop Christians from being killed for their
organs.

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,170
But, so far the Pope will agree to recognize

94
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,230
7 Catholic bishops appointed by

95
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,880
the officially atheist Chinese Communist Party.

96
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,190
I don’t think the Pope understands how to
negotiate a deal.

97
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,580
Maybe he should get some advice.

98
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,290
And finally, planning a trip to Tibet just
got a little easier...

99
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,490
well, okay it’s not easy.

100
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,380
US citizens are still banned from travelling
there.

101
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,570
I think it’s because we just couldn’t
withstand the sheer joy

102
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,350
Tibetans feel about being liberated by the
Chinese Communist Party.

103
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,500
Yeah, that looks like joy...

104
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,730
the same way this looks like being liberated.

105
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,770
But the US House of Representatives has passed

106
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,660
a new bill that will deny US entry to Chinese
officials

107
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,840
who prohibit American citizens from traveling
to Tibet.

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
Will this force a change in Tibet?

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Who knows?

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,030
I mean, if the Chinese regime didn’t change
for the Beastie Boys,

111
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,120
are they really going to change for a bunch
of congressmen?

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
So what do you think?

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,470
Leave your comments below.

114
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,490
And before you go,

115
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,210
now is the time when I answer questions from
you!

116
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,070
The loyal members of the China Uncensored
50-cent army

117
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,730
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

118
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,370
Charles Walter Brooke asks

119
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,540
“Chris, which High Ranking Member of the
Chinese Communist Party

120
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,199
would you most like to Interview, and Why?

121
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,199


122
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,600
And, What kind of uncomfortable questions

123
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,480
would you like to grill them with?”

124
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,810
Well, besides obviously Xi Jinping—

125
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,760
who has not yet responded to my repeated

126
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,220
requests for an interview, by the way—

127
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,800
I’d like to interview Wang Qishan.

128
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,480
Wang is Vice President of the People’s Republic,

129
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,900
and more importantly, he’s Xi Jinping’s
main guy

130
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,590
in charge of the anti-corruption campaign

131
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,490
being used to purge all the officials Xi Jinping
doesn’t like.

132
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,930
I’d ask Wang Qishan to give me the dirt
on

133
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,310
all the corrupt officials that are next on
the chopping block.

134
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,020
And I’d bring a wheelbarrow,

135
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,740
because there’s gonna be a lot of dirt.

136
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,790
Thanks for your question, Charles.

137
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,620
And if you have a burning question,

138
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,860
first, you should probably have a doctor check
that out.

139
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,680
And then, you should sign up to support China
