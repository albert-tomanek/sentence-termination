1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,840
Hell on Earth Is in China

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,290
Masanjia Labor Camp

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,520
And one man managed to get his story out

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,029
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,400
Masanjia Labor Camp was known as

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,339
one of China’s most brutal prisons.

8
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:23,060
Survivors call it hell on Earth.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,829
And a lot of them carry the scars to prove
it.

10
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,710
The things that happened in Masanjia,

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,939
those stories usually don’t see the light
of day.

12
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,930
But in 2013, this woman, Julie Keith

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,360
went shopping for Halloween Decorations at
Kmart.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,730
And inside was something truly spooky.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,140
A desperate letter from a prisoner inside
Masanjia.

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,760
That real life story was turned into an edge
of your seat documentary

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,260
called Letter from Masanjia.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,460
I sat down with director Leon Lee to find
out more.

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,560
Thanks for joining us today, Leon.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,690
Thank you for having me.

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,170
So for those watching who haven't seen Letter
from Masanjia,

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,400
what is it about?

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,299
It's a real life message in a bottle story.

24
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,759
A woman in Oregon found an SOS note

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,880
in a package of Halloween decorations she
purchased from Kmart.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,570
It turned out it was written by a man in one
of the most

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,130
notorious labor camps in China, Masanjia Labor
Camp.

28
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,310
And it took us three years to track down the
letter writer,

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,639
and he told us the full story.

30
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,990
So Masanjia.

31
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,780
Can you paint us a picture of what Masanjia
is?

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,359
Because it's not a normal labor camp.

33
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,460
Well it started from being a normal labor
camp,

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,490
and then quickly it turned out to be what
they call

35
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,259
a national center of excellence

36
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,810
for reeducating and transforming people,

37
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,530
mainly through torture.

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,700
So-

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,869
Excellent.

40
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,420
In Chinese dissidents' words, "This is a place
of nightmare."

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,039
This is the place they would rather die than
being sentenced to.

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,830
So when you heard about the letter, it was
found by...

43
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,830
What was her name?

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,830
Julie-

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,830
Julie Keith.

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,830
Julie Keith.

47
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,180
When you heard about that story, were you
like,

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,980
"Wow, I got to make a movie about this"?

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,640
I immediately flew to Oregon,

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,120
where the Julie Keith lived,

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
and I talked to her.

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,110
She was very cooperative.

53
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,810
I think I interviewed her several times over
the years.

54
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,349
I knew there had to be an amazing story behind
it,

55
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,290
because at the time I had interviewed

56
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,549
over a dozen survivors from Masanjia Labor
Camp.

57
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:52,519
I just couldn't imagine how could this letter
writer

58
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:54,830
find a pen and paper?

59
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,040
How could he write the letter

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,260
under the watchful eyes of the guards?

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,750
How could he manage to hide it?

62
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,260
And who is this person?

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,489
So I really wanted to find out the story behind
it.

64
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,500
And because of my previous films,

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:23,099
I had a underground network in China consist
of dissidents and journalists.

66
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,470
And I put the word out.

67
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,370
As I said, three years later, one day somebody
told me,

68
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,200
"I think I got your guy."

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,959
And we had our initial meeting over Skype.

70
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,299
Because at this point, he was out of Masanjia,
correct?

71
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:41,299
Right.

72
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,010
He had been out for a couple of years, and
he was in hiding.

73
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,390
He certainly knew that the letter was discovered,

74
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,569
and he knew it was one of the reasons that

75
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:57,439
the entire labor camp system in China was
abolished,

76
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,549
and that's probably why he did not want to
advertise

77
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,769
that he was the letter writer.

78
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,470
It probably wouldn't have been good for him.

79
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,109
But then you come out with this movie saying
that

80
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,650
he was the writer of this letter.

81
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,249
Were you concerned either for his safety

82
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:17,030
or for your own safety in making this movie?

83
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,250
Well certainly for his safety.

84
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,560
It was an easy decision for me to, after talking
to him,

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,440
to decide to make this film,

86
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,300
because obviously we both realized what it
meant,

87
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,240
but he said something that changed my mind.

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,190
He said, "Look, I am providing technical support

89
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,080
to the underground press now,

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,460
and these are the people are the most targeted

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,460
by the Chinese communist regime.

92
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,250
So if I get caught,

93
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,500
whether by helping other people or helping
you making the film,

94
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,090
I face the same consequences.

95
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,470
If I take the same risks,

96
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,930
I might as well do something more effective."

97
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,250
So that's how we came together to work on
this film,

98
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,520
but then there was still one problem.

99
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
As I said, because of my previous films,

100
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,620
I couldn't go back to China.

101
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,800
Because you've done several movies

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,360
critical of the Chinese Communist Party, correct?

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,840
Certainly not welcomed by the Communist Party.

104
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,889
And at the same time, Sun Yi, the letter writer,

105
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:32,990
he did not know how to use a camera.

106
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,920
So we two have to find ways to mainly work
over Skype.

107
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,050
That involves training for him, how to use
a camera,

108
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,740
how to collect audio,

109
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,160
how to take pictures or shoot videos without
being discovered,

110
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,700
and how to use a microphone.

111
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,419
How does he even transfer footage to me?

112
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:06,599
So that whole logistical things we had to
work out one by one.

113
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,569
So not only was he the star of your movie,

114
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,629
he was also the cameraman inside China for
you.

115
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:12,870
Quite often, yes.

116
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,090
Now one part of the movie that was amazing
to me is,

117
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,259
at one point he went back to Masanjia to get
footage.

118
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,970
And I remember you said like,

119
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,130
"That's a terrible idea.

120
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,660
You can't do that."

121
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
But he went ahead.

122
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,350
What was going on with that?

123
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,400
One day over our Skype meeting, he said, "I
have an idea.

124
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,259
I want to go back to Masanjia Labor Camp

125
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,770
and interview the former inmate guards."

126
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,960
I said, "That's not a good idea."

127
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,740
He felt they were quite close to him, but
I told him,

128
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,270
"No matter how close you think you were,

129
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,250
these were the people that could just

130
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,120
turn back and call the authority."

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,770
But he really wanted to go back.

132
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,810
And he said, "This is not only for the film,

133
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,699
but more importantly, this is for them.

134
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,539
This might be their only chance to find redemption."

135
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:15,080
So he went back, and he compressed the footage,

136
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,210
he encrypted and sent to me online.

137
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,940
I watched the two interviews with two former
inmate guards,

138
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,789
and I was in tears.

139
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:32,420
One guard was at one point telling people

140
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,599
how good he was as a torturer,

141
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,830
and the new methods he invented himself,

142
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,470
and how effective they were.

143
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,770
But as soon as he met Sun Yi,

144
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,050
he completely changed to a different person.

145
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,180
He talked about how his of Falun Gong,

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,320
how his entire point of view on life was changed
by knowing Sun Yi.

147
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,430
And that's an important part.

148
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,629
Sun Yi was in Masanjia for practicing Falun
Gong.

149
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:07,419
So of all of the things you could make a documentary
about,

150
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,280
why do you feel it was important to make one
about Falun Gong?

151
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,569
Well if he wasn't practicing Falun Gong,

152
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,060
I probably would make the film anyway.

153
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,979
It is a rare story that connects Western viewers

154
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,639
to human rights violations in China.

155
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,360
But he happens to be a Falun Gong practitioner,

156
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,250
which is all the better,

157
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,370
because the persecution against Falun Gong

158
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,539
is one of the largest in the world now

159
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,800
in terms of human rights violation.

160
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,750
It's been going on since 1999.

161
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,072
And in terms of its scale and severity,

162
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:57,120
it's probably one of the largest atrocities
we're facing nowadays.

163
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,029
And as I understand it,

164
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,620
Sun Yi wrote multiple letters while in Masanjia,

165
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,839
and only the one was found, correct?

166
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,910
Yes.

167
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:14,470
What was Julie's reaction when she got this
letter?

168
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,730
Sun Yi wrote probably 20 letters.

169
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:25,640
And by the way, it took him more than one
night to write one letter.

170
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,310
So it's obviously very difficult for him to
find time to write it.

171
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,640
And Julie's initial reaction was that she
thought it was a hoax.

172
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,860
So she immediately went online, Googled Masanjia
Labor Camp,

173
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,220
and did her research, and very soon she realized
this is not a hoax.

174
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,700
This is real.

175
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,550
And she wanted to do what Sun Yi asked her
to do.

176
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,589
It was in the letter that the writer wanted
the recipient

177
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:01,700
to send the letter to the human rights organization.

178
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
She did.

179
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,830
She tried to contact Human Rights Watch, I
believe,

180
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,660
but it went nowhere.

181
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,459
So she did not stop.

182
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,480
She then tried to find...

183
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,860
I think she posted on Facebook,

184
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,880
and then she contacted her local newspaper.

185
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,920
It became a front page story on Christmas
Eve.

186
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,690
And then after that it, just went viral.

187
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,529
CNN, Fox News, New York Times, everywhere.

188
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,839
Have you faced any pushback from the Chinese
Communist Party

189
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,330
for making this documentary?

190
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,880
Not on this film.

191
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Not so far.

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,959
At least not I'm aware of.

193
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,740
But my previous films, in particular Human
Harvest,

194
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,970
which was about large-scale organ harvesting

195
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,190
on prisoners of conscience in China,

196
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,850
I received lots of interference.

197
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:09,139
For example, in festivals, in other forms
of distribution,

198
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,730
quite often there were pushbacks.

199
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,130
What has been the response to Letter from
Masanjia?

200
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:24,410
We had our world premier at Hot Docs in I
think maybe last year.

201
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,300
So it's got a year on the circuit now.

202
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,260
We've been in I think over 40 festival,

203
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,600
winning over 1000 awards.

204
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,020
And almost every screening, I see people in
tears.

205
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,440
I have people walk up to me and telling me

206
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,980
that they are filmmakers themselves,

207
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,560
they are well aware of all the techniques,

208
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,070
but somehow this film moved them to their
core.

209
00:11:55,070 --> 00:12:01,660
Government officials wanted to take action
after seeing the film.

210
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,920
The film screened in European Parliament in
Brussels.

211
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,320
It screened in Canadian Parliament.

212
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,720
We are still organizing screenings

213
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,940
in other parliaments around the world.

214
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,390
And we have lawmakers telling me that

215
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,230
an individual story like Sun Yi's journey

216
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:30,480
is so much more powerful than reading reports.

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,639
So basically, from all walks of life,

218
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,130
people suddenly realized that,

219
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,070
whatever impression they had of China before,

220
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,329
it has opened their eyes to see very different
things,

221
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,610
different aspects of China.

222
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,690
So Sun Yi did a lot of the camera work inside
of China.

223
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,540
As I understand it, he also contribute sketches
to the documentary.

224
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,600
Yes.

225
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,720
Part of the film was animated

226
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,690
because it is obviously very difficult to
do reenactment

227
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,600
or going back to inside Masanjia Labor Camp.

228
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,640
So it was a interesting story.

229
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,600
Again, we had our Skype meeting one day,

230
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
and Sun Yi wanted to show me some artwork.

231
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,410
He, obviously, he kept a sketchbook

232
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,700
after he was released from Masanjia,

233
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,200
and he wanted to remember his experience inside.

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,610
So, right then we decided to do animated sequences

235
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,620
based on his own sketches.

236
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,459
His sketch has a particular style that's similar
to

237
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:46,300
a traditional Chinese graphic novel.

238
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,230
When I ask him,

239
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,130
he told me since he was young he loved reading

240
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,810
traditional Chinese graphic novels,

241
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,769
and he would quite often practice drawing

242
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,540
the figures on the book margin,

243
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,720
so he became quite good.

244
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,910
Later on he became an engineer,

245
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,730
so he studied drafting, which also helped,
I suppose.

246
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,839
So, he himself did all the sketches for the
key scenes,

247
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,839
and based on that,

248
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,870
we had a professional team who did all the
animation

249
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,079
but making sure would still follow his art
style.

250
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,360
Well I certainly recommend Letter to Masanjia
for anyone watching.

251
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,440
If somebody wanted to see the movie,

252
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,660
where should they go?

253
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,990
It's on various digital platforms now.

254
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,610
The common ones, iTunes, Amazon, Google Play.

255
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,029
It's also on YouTube.

256
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,800
And we also have physical DVD and Blu-rays
available in different outlets.

257
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,500
If you visit letterfrommasanjia.com and click
on watch,

258
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,640
you'll see dozens of platforms where you can
watch the film.

259
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Great.

260
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,790
We'll definitely provide a link to that at
the end of this video.

261
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,100

Thank you.

264
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,650
If you haven't seen Letter from Masanjia,

265
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,240
