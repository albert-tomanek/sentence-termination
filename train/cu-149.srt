1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:02,860
China has a shortage of women

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,910
And Chinese men are getting them from Burma

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,320
As the West retreats, China is rising

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,330
And that has some serious consequences

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,260
for the Burmese people.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,640
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,820
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,820
Myanmar.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,330
The country formerly known as Burma.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,980
And as you can see, it shares a border with
China.

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,490
And it’s full of women.

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,830
Or, you know, about 50% women.

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,769
Which is a lot more than China,

14
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,640
where decades of population control has resulted
in

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,550
30 million fewer women than men.

16
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,680
And that’s resulted in a thriving sex trade

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,620
between the two countries.

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,070
China and the United States have used Myanmar-slash-Burma

19
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,350
as a battleground of influence.

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,510
But with mounting human rights problems

21
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,610
and accusations of ethnic cleansing of the
Rohingya people,

22
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,120
the West is retreating.

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,980
And China is taking advantage.

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,550
At the 2019 Oslo Freedom Forum,

25
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,270
Shelley Zhang had the chance to sit down with
Esther Htusan.

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,920
She’s a Pulitzer Prize winning Burmese journalist.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,320
And she shares with us what China’s influence

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,310
is doing to her country.

29
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,920
Thanks for joining us today, Esther.

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,060
Thanks for having me.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,100
So how would you describe the relationship

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,950
between Burma and China?

33
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,659
Well, Burma had been under the military dictatorship

34
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,609
for about half a century

35
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:25,640
and during that period,

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,590
it was isolated from the rest of the world,

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:37,479
especially the western country.

38
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,620
China is one of the main country that support
Burma

39
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,850
so they had a very long, close relationship

40
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,189
between the two countries and China

41
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,820
was a long time investor in the country

42
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,539
when the rest of the world

43
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,881
would not even enter Burma,

44
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,840
so they do have this love and hate relationship

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,170
because sometimes the political conflicts
with China.

46
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,880
Then sometimes Burma has only China as the
only country

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,160
that they can rely on so there is this,

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,510
I would say it's a very close relationship

49
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,950
that has been a long standing with China.

50
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,080
There is some tension there, is what you're
saying?

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,720
Yeah, there were times when Burma felt like
China

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,940
was bullying them because they had no other
country

53
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,960
to rely on so there is some tension coming
up

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,330
and then it will ease again when China

55
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,080
had a better investment plan inside Burma

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,350
so it's just this on and off, love and hate
relationship.

57
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,370
So one of the things that might be

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,550
a little bit of a source of tension

59
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,380
is human trafficking in Burma, right?

60
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,590
The one child policy in China has left a lot
of extra men

61
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,440
who can't get wives and that's led to some
trafficking,

62
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,930
sex trafficking of women from Southeast Asia.

63
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,740
Is this something that's affecting Burmese
women too?

64
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,130
Absolutely.

65
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,150
Over the years there are just hundreds

66
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,660
of thousands of women who have been trafficked
inside of Burma

67
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,500
and then sold as brides in China and it has
become a very lucrative,

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,230
illicit trade cross border.

69
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,720
Not only just Burma but also

70
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,820
other Southeast Asian nations that border
with China.

71
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,480
So the biggest problem is that China initiated
this one child policy

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,160
a long time ago and to balance out their male
and female population,

73
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,640
it is going to take a long time because they
did it for so long

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,250
that they have imbalanced women.

75
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,650
There's something like thirty million more
Chinese men.

76
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,200
Exactly so they need more women for those
men to get married

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,990
because they don't have enough women so what
happens

78
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,670
is mostly Southeast Asian countries,

79
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,920
particularly the more poorer area that is
bordering China

80
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,049
like Burma for example,

81
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,539
Northern and Northeast Burma,

82
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,979
many women along this border have been trafficked
for many times

83
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:26,729
for example I did a few investigative stories
about women

84
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,050
who had been affected by Burma's internal
conflict

85
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,610
and then they were fleeing closer to China
border

86
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,850
and ended up getting trafficked and sold as
brides in China.

87
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,810
So it is a very regular incidence and it is
a very big issue

88
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,250
inside Burma at the moment.

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,449
So you said hundreds of thousands of women?

90
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,490
Over the years, right.

91
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,969
So is this something the Burmese government
is talking about

92
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:56,599
or is it more off-limits because it has to
do with China?

93
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,680
So when it come to human trafficking issue,

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,129
it is less political so there are things that
the Burmese authorities

95
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:10,370
try to stop but the problem with Burma is
the rule of law.

96
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,080
It has a very weak implementation of rule
of law

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,219
and particularly along the border region

98
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:23,539
there's no influence of legal protections

99
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,779
or there's no control over by the central
government

100
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,660
along the border so it's more difficult

101
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,240
for the government to implement trying to
stop human trafficking

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:42,099
or also the Burmese government has long been
famous for incompetence

103
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,699
to actually try to stop this kind of issue
so it's still ongoing.

104
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,460
They seem to be doing better job trying

105
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,080
to stop this kind of human trafficking

106
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,629
or even trying to get involved in going to
rescue women

107
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,460
who had already been trafficked

108
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,319
but the problem is the Burmese government
is not that willing

109
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,159
to really use the man power to rescue these
women

110
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:14,689
or to actually stop this issue because to
me as a journalist

111
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,400
it seems like the authorities don't really
care.

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,660
Is there a way for these Burmese women

113
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,320
to escape once they get to China?

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,099
Can they get back?

115
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:29,439
So we have women organizations inside

116
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,419
and also along the border of China

117
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:34,300
and these women organizations are amazing.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,650
They are doing a great job.

119
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,539
They actually sent out people who can rescue
these women

120
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,340
in the middle of nowhere inside China.

121
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,500
It could take days, it could take months,

122
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,439
sometimes it take year but they don't give
up.

123
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,979
They actually go and try to rescue.

124
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,699
That's amazing that they can get these women
out.

125
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:56,699
Sure.

126
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,050
So we were talking about border issues with
Burma

127
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,129
and China and Burma shares a pretty substantial
border with China.

128
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,419
And you talked a little bit about people fleeing
conflicts.

129
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,389
Are there Burmese refugees that go into China

130
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,139
and how does China deal with that issue?

131
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,339
So as you said there's a substantial border
sharing

132
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,379
along Burma and China

133
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,009
and it is mostly in the East and Northeast
of Burma

134
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,880
and along this border we have ethnic conflict

135
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,770
that's ongoing for decades.

136
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,279
It's been ongoing along the border where ethnic
minority groups

137
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,360
have been fighting against the central government

138
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,339
for indigenous rights and self-determination.

139
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:48,620
Even since right after British Colonialism.

140
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,249
And China of course when there's conflict
along the border,

141
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:59,479
it produced quite an incredible number of
refugees.

142
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,089
Many people fleeing from conflict

143
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,439
and for many civilians along the border,

144
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,710
they don't feel safe to run into

145
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,939
the Burmese government controlled area.

146
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:13,029
For them, they rather flee into China

147
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,749
so most of them crossed into China.

148
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:18,009
But as far as I have seen.

149
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,569
The Chinese government had not done a more
sympathetic job.

150
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:28,529
Most of them are chased away by the Chinese
soldiers back to Burma

151
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,789
where they are airstrike bombing

152
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:35,760
or there are still active conflict ongoing

153
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,380
so they don't seem to have really sympathetic...

154
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,430
So they don't really seem to treat them as
refugees, basically?

155
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,430
No.

156
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,920
Because according to the U.N. charter

157
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,070
they should be accepting refugees.

158
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,070
Right.

159
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,060
So most of the displaced people

160
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,540
or people running as refugees are sent back
to Burma.

161
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,029
I read something about China actually supporting
militias

162
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,800
in part of Burma.

163
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,660
Is that true?

164
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
Yeah.

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,050
China has a very big influence,

166
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,019
not only just one ethnic group but quite a
lot of

167
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:14,899
different ethnic groups mostly along their
border so yeah.

168
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:15,899
Definitely.

169
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,300
They have a big influence and they have support

170
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,980
from some of those ethnic groups.

171
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,860
Can you tell me a little bit about what's
happening

172
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,339
with the militia groups in the Wa state

173
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,350
along the border with China?

174
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:32,170
So the Wa state, it was a self-administrative
zone

175
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,240
by constitution in Burma so it is part of
Burma,

176
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,339
it is Eastern part of Burma that borders China.

177
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,540
And because they have this really long,

178
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,970
good relationship with China,

179
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,910
later on they get the biggest support from
China

180
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,519
compared to many other ethnic groups in Burma

181
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,850
and later on this administrative region

182
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,610
had become a part of China.

183
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,800
When you go to this area,

184
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,959
you will feel like you are in China because
the currency

185
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,360
is in Chinese currency.

186
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,860
People are speaking mostly Chinese

187
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,649
and most people don't speak Burmese

188
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:21,560
so they have this very identical Chinese influence

189
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,440
as well as the enormous support that they
have from China.

190
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,620
This area also had a large number of Chinese
investments

191
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,550
on the extractive industries drug-trade route

192
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,180
because this region also is quite close

193
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,310
to other Southeast Asian nations

194
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,649
so it's kind of on the border with other countries
as well

195
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:50,680
so it's the perfect location for illicit drug-trade

196
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,350
and other sorts of investment.

197
00:10:53,350 --> 00:11:00,550
So the Chinese authority is basically supporting
this area

198
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,810
because of the investments and things like
that?

199
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,810
Not just because of the investment

200
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,690
but also the Chinese government want a location

201
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,970
where they can actually be inside of Burma

202
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,290
but not as the central Chinese government

203
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,509
but as a state that they can completely control

204
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:26,110
and they can have their own armed forces,

205
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,980
they can have their own strength

206
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,589
which they can show against the Burmese authorities
as well.

207
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,319
So it's a very strange way to describe this
area

208
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:39,329
because it is Burma but it looks like China.

209
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:44,470
So is this not a conflict with the Burmese
government

210
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,020
if China is essentially supporting this self-administrative

211
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,040
but kind of separatist state that then

212
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,279
they are able to have a lot of influence over?

213
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,279
Definitely.

214
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,640
So in the very beginning of this armed groups,

215
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,790
they will attack quite a lot by the central
Burmese army

216
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,139
but later on when they get support from China,

217
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:13,250
they had the strongest armed forces among
any of the ethnic groups

218
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,759
so the central Burmese government

219
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,829
don't usually try to provoke this particular
group.

220
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,149
They feel like if they provoke this ethnic
group,

221
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,149
it will look like they are provoking the Chinese
authority as well

222
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,080
so that's just this very strange relationship
with this group,

223
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,090
with the central Burmese government.

224
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,790
That's interesting because with China,

225
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,160
a lot of what they talk about

226
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,470
is not interfering with other countries internal
affairs

227
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,500
because they don't want other countries

228
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,620
to interfere in their affairs

229
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,319
but then it seems that that is a pretty big
interference

230
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,319
in Burma's affairs

231
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,839
to kind of be supporting this other group.

232
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,069
Well, China always make this kind of rules

233
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:02,220
whenever they talk at the international level,

234
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,760
they say things only if they have interest.

235
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:14,379
They would tell the international organizations

236
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,130
that "we don't interfere what's going on in
Burma"

237
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,720
But when the conflict that is ongoing in Burma

238
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,220
is supported by China and there are just atrocities

239
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,670
ongoing just inside Burma

240
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,889
and because of these issues most talked in
the international level

241
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,870
and they would say "oh, it's nothing.

242
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,529
We don't really interfere Burma"

243
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,529
but on the other hand,

244
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,480
they are supporting in many different ways
to make sure

245
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,830
that there's conflict.

246
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:53,649
So China would come up with things based on
their interests.

247
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,850
So speaking of China's interest in Burma,

248
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,899
China has this one belt,

249
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,050
one road plan where they're investing in a
lot of countries

250
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,060
and I know with Burma, they have the China-Myanmar
Economic Corridor

251
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,250
which is part of the belt and road.

252
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,760
What are they investing in in Burma?

253
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,740
So most of the extractive industry like jade,
or amber, or gold,

254
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:21,180
they are mostly influenced by the Chinese
businesses

255
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,339
and then now they are trying to push for

256
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:30,199
one of the biggest hydropower dam in northern
Burma

257
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,699
and this is the most controversial project
inside Burma

258
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:41,279
and it really effects the internal politics
of Burma

259
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,990
because majority of people don't want this
project

260
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,970
but then the previous government

261
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,930
signed an agreement to implement this project

262
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,639
but now it's in limbo,

263
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,680
but anyway that's another project

264
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:01,829
and there's the deep water seaport as well
as gas pipeline.

265
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,240
So they actually crossed the gas pipeline
all the way

266
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,790
from western part of Burma into Yunnan province
in China.

267
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,790
That is pretty far.

268
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,130
That is pretty far and they have already built
this pipeline.

269
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,319
So its extracting the gas from western Burma
and taking it to Yunnan.

270
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,319
Exactly.

271
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,440
I want to ask about the hydropower dam.

272
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,420
What is so controversial about it?

273
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,509
Well so the problem is the Chinese company

274
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:35,829
did not come up a what if there is environmental
damage

275
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,759
that occurs in Burma when they build this
dam

276
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,370
because it will be in the most northern part
of Burma

277
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,839
and then if something happen, then thousands
of people

278
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,710
could die along the way, all the way down
to the south.

279
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,540
So people are really afraid that also at the
same time.

280
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,259
Most Chinese investments, so far that we have
seen,

281
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:08,879
it's not sustainable and people are afraid
of that

282
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,519
and also they don't usually care about environmental
damage.

283
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,509
They extract whatever they want

284
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:17,540
and then leave just the way it is.

285
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,569
So that's what we have seen along the way

286
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:23,260
throughout their investments

287
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,529
so people are afraid of the irresponsible
investments

288
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:31,089
and environmental damage so it's very controversial
inside Burma

289
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:36,040
and this project even could decide who wins
the election.

290
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,339
Really?

291
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,200
So China, in a way,

292
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,279
could have a huge effect on Burma's next election

293
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,310
is what you're saying?

294
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,310
Definitely.

295
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,389
Is this an issue that people talk about inside
Burma?

296
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,939
Like China's influence on Burma, these investments?

297
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:50,939
They do.

298
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:54,220
So, we have groups of civil society

299
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,940
who try to make investment responsible

300
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,959
or try to make development projects for local
people.

301
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:06,959
They just want the government

302
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,669
to make sure that the Chinese investments
are responsible

303
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:15,329
and also that benefits local people as well

304
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,799
but mostly it doesn't so people are really
angry

305
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,309
about most Chinese investments.

306
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:23,140
So how does the Burmese government react

307
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,170
to these civil groups saying

308
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,870
"we need to make sure these investments are
sustainable?"

309
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,460
Well the problem is they don't care.

310
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,750
For them, it is more important

311
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,659
to have a better relationship with China

312
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:37,380
than listen to civil society groups.

313
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,210
And probably the money is pretty important
too.

314
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,210
Definitely.

315
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,140
Particularly during the military government,

316
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,350
money is the main thing.

317
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,760
They had never used whatever they earned from
the country.

318
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,570
It all went to their pocket.

319
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,210
It was never really spent for the good of
the people for a long time.

320
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,550
So it still it's a habit.

321
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,700
It doesn't go away overnight but it is still
ongoing.

322
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,210
So let's talk about one of the things

323
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,580
that was really in the news with Burma lately.

324
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,580
The Rohingya issue.

325
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,570
And a lot of other countries had criticized

326
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,049
the Burmese government's treatment of the
Rohingyas

327
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:20,230
but what was China's stance on that?

328
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,690
Well as a long-term friend and a neighbor,

329
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:28,070
they of course always support the Burmese
military

330
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,270
or the Burmese government.

331
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,770
Well when you look at China,

332
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,820
China is not the best example of respecting
human rights

333
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,980
so of course for them when a bunch of people
get killed

334
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,240
or when nearly a million people fled to another
country

335
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,630
yet they don't want to criticize the Burmese
government

336
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:57,179
because they don't want to be friended with
the government

337
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,409
so they always protect the Burmese government
at the United Nations

338
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:07,580
or at any other level so it's very awkward

339
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,610
that one of those very powerful countries

340
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:17,039
would support really ugly atrocities.

341
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,610
So do you think China's support is giving
Burma

342
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,310
the ability to push back against other countries?

343
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,490
Absolutely.

344
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,809
Particularly the West.

345
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,090
The other problem with China is the reason

346
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,789
why they are protecting Burma is because

347
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:38,159
they don't want Burma to lean onto the western
countries.

348
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,020
For example, Burma opened up

349
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,840
a little bit more from military dictatorships.

350
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,360
In 2012, they opened the doors to the West

351
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,790
so that we started having western countries

352
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:55,560
coming into Burma and China did not like that
at all so for them,

353
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,630
they want to keep Burma to themselves as much
as possible

354
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,680
so by protecting the Burmese authorities,

355
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,770
who committed gruesome atrocities against
minorities in the country,

356
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:16,539
for them they know Burma will be on their
side

357
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,850
when they protect them on an international
level

358
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,159
when the whole world is criticizing Burma
so yeah.

359
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,940
So they are back to being Burma's biggest
friend then?

360
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,970
Exactly.

361
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,970
Thank you so much, Esther,

362
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,030
for talking to us.

363
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,760
Thank you.
