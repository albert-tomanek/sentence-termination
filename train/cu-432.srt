1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,050
Has China done a good job

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,380
fighting the coronavirus?

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,360
They’ve gotten a lot of praise.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,020
But Taiwan does it differently.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,420
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,500
I’m Chris Chappell.

This episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

10
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,050
Because you should be using a reliable VPN
whenever you go online.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,520
The Chinese Communist Party has taken

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,570
some pretty heavy handed measures

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,230
to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,030
Like putting an entire province of 58 million
people under lockdown...

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,530
Restricting the movements of more than half
the country…

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,230
and forcing people who might be sick

17
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,510
into quarantine centers against their will.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,510
The World Health Organization has praised
how China

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,900
has handled the coronavirus outbreak.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,090
“Almost all member states are praising China
for what they did.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,380
China took action massively at the epicenter,

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,600
at the source of the outbreak.”

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,170
And even some Western media have been praising
the China model.

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,390
*This* article suggests that “drastic measures—

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,370
similar to those deployed by China and imposed
in parts of Italy—

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,999
to contain the epidemic are now overdue elsewhere.”

27
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:38,759
Yeah, I can’t wait to see this in America.

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,819
And Chinese state-run media haven’t just
been praising

29
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,700
their own authoritarian system.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,329
They’ve also been highlighting criticism
of the United States

31
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,189
and other democracies for their coronavirus
response.

32
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,459
Which of course shows just how superior

33
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,250
China’s authoritarian response to the coronavirus
has been.

34
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,789
As long as you ignore the part where

35
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:02,889
they let it spread uncontrolled for weeks

36
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,429
and detained people for talking about it.

37
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,460
But democratic Taiwan has taken a very different

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,659
approach to the coronavirus than mainland
China.

39
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:16,230
And it’s kept the number infections and
deaths shockingly low.

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,560
Based on the numbers,

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Taiwan should have been hit really hard by
the coronavirus.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,970
There have officially been 80,000 infections
in mainland China.

43
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,470
The true figure is probably at least a few
hundred thousand,

44
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,269
because there aren’t enough healthcare workers
or test kits

45
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,510
to test all the people who are at risk.

46
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,129
Not to mention the fact that the Chinese Communist
Party

47
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,010
has a keen interest in keeping the official
count low.

48
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,310
Taiwan’s population is one sixtieth of China’s.

49
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,310
Based on that,

50
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,360
you might expect Taiwan to have at least a
thousand cases.

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,739
But it only has 47.

52
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,739
That’s really few—

53
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,010
especially given that millions of people travel

54
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,270
between China and Taiwan each year...

55
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,390
and especially given that the World Health
Organization

56
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,460
has excluded Taiwan from participating in
W.H.O. programs,

57
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,209
because of pressure from China.

58
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,590
So why are there so few cases in Taiwan?

59
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,930
Especially when there are so many cases

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,750
in South Korea, Italy, and Iran?

61
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,019
It’s because Taiwan’s response to the
coronavirus

62
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,140
has been diligent, open, and transparent.

63
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,280
It’s no secret what Taiwan’s leadership

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,689
thinks about the Chinese Communist Party.

65
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:36,030
“President Tsai says Beijing is the biggest
threat

66
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,079
to Taiwan’s free and democratic way of life.”

67
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,400
And it turns out,

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,739
Taiwan recognizing Beijing’s threat on all
levels

69
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,080
has been a very wise perspective for handling
the coronavirus.

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,579
As of what we know now,

71
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,950
the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan,

72
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,049
China started some time around early December
last year.

73
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,540
But the Chinese officials covered it up until
January 20.

74
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,719
That’s when Chinese leader Xi Jinping

75
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,049
first publicly admitted that the new coronavirus
was a thing,

76
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,099
and that officials should make “resolute
efforts” to curb the virus.

77
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,200
But a full three weeks before that—

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,489
while Xi Jinping was giving his New Year propaganda
speech

79
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,790
and most people in China had no idea about
the coronavirus...

80
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,819
...Taiwan’s leadership was already on the
ball.

81
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,090
“On December 31, 2019, when the World Health
Organization

82
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,840
was notified of pneumonia of unknown cause
in Wuhan, China,

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,870
Taiwanese officials began to board planes
and assess passengers

84
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,720
on direct flights from Wuhan

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
for fever and pneumonia symptoms

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,770
before passengers could deplane.”

87
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,600
Then, “As early as January 5, 2020,

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,870
notification was expanded to include any individual

89
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,150
who had traveled to Wuhan in the past 14 days

90
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,020
and had a fever or symptoms of upper respiratory
tract infection.”

91
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,190
And soon, the Taiwan government began

92
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,990
a highly effective campaign to educate the
public.

93
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,550
Taiwan’s Minister of Health

94
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,590
has given numerous matter-of-fact speeches

95
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,060
about the risks of the coronavirus,

96
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,550
and how people can protect themselves.

97
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,860
President Tsai Ing-wen made this video about

98
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,370
how pharmacies are rationing surgical masks.

99
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,199
Taiwan is using a mask rationing system

100
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,780
to stop people from hoarding and price gouging
masks.

101
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
At the same time, Taiwan has also

102
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,440
dramatically increased their mask manufacturing.

103
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,910
And President Tsai demonstrated social distancing,

104
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,389
by using a traditional greeting instead of
a handshake.

105
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,919
Much better than the social distancing

106
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,090
most of experienced in high school.

107
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,610
Not me of course.

108
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,610
And most importantly,

109
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,569
Taiwan’s government at all levels has pushed

110
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:57,319
the most important message over and over again:

111
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,160
Wash your hands—your filthy, filthy hands.

112
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
And because it’s Taiwan,

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,729
a lot of the messaging involves cuddly mascots.

114
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,080
Like this shiba inu.

115
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,099
Who tells you to wash your dirty paws.

116
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,849
Cover your snout when sneezing

117
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,919
and keep a positive attitude while doing epidemic
prevention.

118
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,639
How can you say no to that face?

119
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,599
That’s so much better than Corona-Chan.

120
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,560
But I wouldn’t want you to think that Taiwan’s
disease prevention

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,010
relies entirely on shiba inus.

122
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,470
They’re also using robots.

123
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,110
One elementary school in Taiwan built these
LEGO robots

124
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,509
to dispense disinfectant.

125
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,629
“Washing hands is super!”

126
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:41,479
Side note, when you’re washing your hands
with soap,

127
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,680
you should scrub them for a full 20 seconds.

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,389
That’s how long it takes to sing “Happy
Birthday” twice.

129
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,580
You don’t have to sing it out loud.

130
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,350
Or you could recite the Litany Against Fear
from Dune.

131
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,610
That works too.

132
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,270
One reason Taiwan has done such a good job
fighting the coronavirus

133
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,260
is because of their experience with the SARS
epidemic in 2003,

134
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,770
where more than 400 people in Taiwan were
infected.

135
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,659
Less than a year later,

136
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,639
Taiwan established the National Health Command
Center, or NHCC.

137
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,130
“The NHCC is meant to serve as

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,130
a disaster management center command point,

139
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,889
coordinating and advising authorities

140
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,120
at a regional and central level,

141
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,540
so that in the case of a new outbreak,

142
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,110
no time and resources are wasted.”

143
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,400
The NHCC used technology to merge the databases

144
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,289
for Taiwan’s national health insurance system

145
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,090
and its travel entry system.

146
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,110
“Persons with low risk were sent a health
declaration border pass

147
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,030
via SMS to their phones for faster immigration
clearance;

148
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,199
those with higher risk were quarantined at
home

149
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,750
and tracked through their mobile phone

150
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,129
to ensure that they remained at home during
the incubation period.”

151
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:58,430
So instead of forcibly quarantining 58 million
people,

152
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,349
Taiwan only quarantined the small number of
individuals

153
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,750
who actually posed a risk to others.

154
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,439
Yeah, that’s much better than this.

155
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,300
Taiwan has also fared a lot better than some
of the countries

156
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,460
that have joined China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

157
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,250
South Korea, Italy, and Iran all have serious
outbreaks right now.

158
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,479
And their governments all have strong ties

159
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,530
to the Chinese Communist Party.

160
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,530
Coincidence?

161
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,199
Maybe, maybe not.

162
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,129
Consider this: China’s official position

163
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,220
is that travel restrictions are an “overreaction.”

164
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,979
And China has criticized the West for spreading

165
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,169
“negative, twisted falsehoods” about the
coronavirus.

166
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,890
I’ll bet certain governments felt political
pressure

167
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,450
to not to take massive action back in January,

168
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,660
when the coronavirus could have been more
easily stopped.

169
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,350
For example, Italy joined China’s Belt and
Road last year.

170
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,940
That may be why they hesitated to impose a
travel ban

171
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,440
on visitors from mainland China.

172
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Of course, the coronavirus has now spread

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,920
to more than 9,000 people in Italy,

174
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,300
and the entire country is on lockdown.

175
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,810
South Korea and Iran also didn’t issue travel
restrictions

176
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,149
or do big public health campaigns early on,

177
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,810
perhaps to avoid upsetting Beijing.

178
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,029
On the other hand,

179
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,490
Taiwan started taking action a full three
weeks

180
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,240
before the Chinese Communist Party

181
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,280
even admitted there was an outbreak.

182
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,140
They ignored the pressure, and they did it
right.

183
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,470
The lesson?

184
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,490
Good things come to those

185
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,180
who don’t trust the Chinese Communist Party.

186
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,760
And this episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

187
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,040
