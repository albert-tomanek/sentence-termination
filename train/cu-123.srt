1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,400
A patriotic Chinese Netizen

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,170
reported a YouTuber

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,600
for promoting Taiwan independence.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,670
And that was his big mistake.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:21,060
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,900
The Great Firewall surrounds China’s very
own highly censored, highly restricted, and

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,609
highly surveilled internet.

8
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,930
It’s one of the many ways the Chinese Communist
Party keeps track of and controls the Chinese

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,230
people.

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:44,440
Chinese leader Xi Jinping calls it cyber sovereignty,
which means no subversive foreign ideas allowed.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,240
And in China, the ‘Great Firewall’ is
changing a generation.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,780
“When so few have alternative sources of
information, government propaganda becomes

13
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,610
more believable.

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,740
Inside China, people are living in an information
bubble that the government is getting better

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,350
at controlling.”

16
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,890
Now you’d think that some Chinese people
would want to go around the Great Firewall

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,460
to access the rest of the internet, and see
things that are banned in China.

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,000
Like YouTube.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,579
And some of them do—by using VPN software.

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:25,470
Using a VPN in China falls into a weird legal
gray area.

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,880
But a lot of people use VPNs anyway, and authorities
only crack down occasionally.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,090
Like during sensitive political anniversaries,
or if they want to go after you for something

23
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,439
else.

24
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,920
But just because some Chinese netizens can
use VPNs to *access* the rest of the internet,

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,549
doesn’t mean the internet opens up their
minds.

26
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,580
In some cases, people use it to fight for
the Communist Party’s agenda.

27
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,569
I mean, just read some of the YouTube comments
below this video.

28
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:01,899
Which brings us to the story of a mainland
Chinese student who goes by the username “Lonely

29
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,429
Fly.”

30
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,539
In December, Lonely Fly was using a VPN to
watch YouTube.

31
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,140
Specifically, he was watching this channel
that translates as “Photographer Diary Fun

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,140
TV”.

33
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,570
It’s hosted by a YouTuber in Taiwan named
Ba-Jiohng.

34
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:27,050
And in one video, Ba-Jiohng was promoting
a dangerous idea: Taiwan independence.

35
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,310
Now because of the education mainland Chinese
people receive, they generally believe Taiwan

36
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,040
is a province of China.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,800
So when Lonely Fly saw this video promoting
the independence of Taiwan province, he did

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,570
what any good Chinese nationalist would do:
He wrote an angry YouTube comment:

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,090
￼
“Ba-Jiohng is a troll for the Democratic

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,040
Progressive Party!

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,340
These videos are a tool to stir conflict.

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,110
Everybody, do not trust him.

43
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,340
There’s evidence all over the Chinese internet
forums that he is an anti-China, anti-communist

44
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,600
influencer.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,760
He’s even been officially blacklisted in
China.

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,600
He’s definitely accepting bribes from the
DPP to share separatist propaganda.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,250
Everyone, do not be deceived!

48
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,240
There’s a whole group behind him, an anti-China
group!

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,040
Please share and spread the word!”

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,700
And then Lonely Fly patriotically reported
Ba-Jiohng to his local Public Security Bureau

51
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,740
in China.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:44,310
Of course, the local Public Security Bureau
couldn’t actually do anything to Ba-Jiohng—because

53
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,530
he lives in Taiwan, which...is not actually
a province of China.

54
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,990
So they did the next best thing: They criticized
Lonely Fly for illegally using a VPN to access

55
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,430
YouTube, and they demanded he write a repentance
letter.

56
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,090
Which he did.

57
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,180
It says:
“Dear comrade policemen,

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,470
I’m sorry.

59
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,800
I should not have used an illegal VPN to break
the law and access the international internet.

60
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,570
I am deeply reflecting on my poor actions.

61
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,430
Starting today, I have learned and respected
the law.

62
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,700
I will not act out of my own ignorance.

63
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,130
I hope the authorities will give me another
chance.”

64
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,120
Lonely Fly then used an illegal VPN to access
YouTube and post his repentance letter...on

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,460
YouTube.

66
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:46,070
And then Lonely Fly continued to use his illegal
VPN to post another angry comment on Ba-Jiohng’s

67
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,460
channel, which says:
￼

68
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,190
“FunTV your mom is dead, I’m not done
with you!

69
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,110
It’s all because of you.

70
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,040
It’s all your fault.

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,410
I went to the public security bureau to report
you but was caught using a VPN illegally.

72
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,600
I even had to write a repentance letter and
was lectured.

73
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,850
My life is ruined now because I have this
on my record.”

74
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,340
Yes, it’s Ba-Jiohng’s fault!

75
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,260
If only Ba-Jiohng hadn’t exercised his free
speech on the open internet, then he wouldn’t

76
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,590
need to be reported in the first place!

77
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:32,110
See, poor Lonely Fly just thought he was doing
the right thing for the Chinese Communist

78
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,700
Party.

79
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:42,430
In his own eyes, Lonely Fly is but a Lonely
Hero, risking his life on the outside internet

80
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,210
fighting for what he believes in.

81
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,620
We’re all the hero of our own story.

82
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:54,140
Although if Lonely Fly is still accessing
YouTube then he clearly doesn’t understand

83
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,060
what he’s done wrong.

84
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,000
Anyway, from here, the story just gets worse
for our hero.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,420
I’ll tell you how after this break.

86
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,700
Welcome back.

87
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,280
So, after getting in trouble for illegally
using a VPN to access YouTube, something terrible

88
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,760
happened to Lonely Fly’s family.

89
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:24,030
And we know about it because Lonely Fly illegally
used a VPN to post this video about it on

90
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:38,190
YouTube.

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:07:04,220
Ok, the 

92
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,400
video is mostly just him crying.

93
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,580
But in a pinned comment, Lonely Fly goes into
greater detail about what happened.

94
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,340
“My family and the village cadre have a
dispute over our property.

95
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,570
It escalated into physical violence.

96
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,830
One of the village cadre’s thugs took a
shovel and hit my grandfather in the back.

97
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,180
He’s now hospitalized.

98
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,320
My friend on the internet asked why I don’t
take this issue to court.

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,949
But that costs money and energy.

100
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:39,931
The police even said that they can’t do
anything about this ‘small dispute’ and

101
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,800
urged us to settle the issue ourselves.

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,790
The thug paid us 2000 yuan for the hospital
fees, but the property dispute still hasn’t

103
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,949
been resolved.

104
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,389
But since we were all worried that they would
come back for more trouble, we could only

105
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,150
write a forgiveness letter and hope they don’t
return.

106
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:05,460
I’ve been crying all night, my emotions
are unstable, but the Chinese people are heroic,

107
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,770
I will not back down from any difficulties.

108
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,360
I also hope everyone can persevere through
their own hardships.

109
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,350
So let me get this straight.

110
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:22,080
The thugs working for a local official barged
in to seize Lonely Fly’s family property,

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,800
and injured his grandfather.

112
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,540
And the police did nothing.

113
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,210
That sounds really serious.

114
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,029
I’m glad Lonely Fly posted this online so
he could raise awareness about the issue.

115
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,130
But of course, he couldn’t post his story
on the heavily censored *Chinese* internet.

116
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,219
It would just get him in trouble.

117
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:46,130
That’s why he used an illegal VPN to post
it on YouTube!

118
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,520
And in his next post, he explains.

119
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,899
“I’ve been warned by the police department.

120
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,610
I’m not allowed to post about this incident
on Weibo or other social media.

121
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,500
I made it clear in my forgiveness letter to
them that I wouldn’t escalate this issue.

122
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,870
If word gets out and causes consequences to
the local government, then it will be all

123
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,130
my fault.

124
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,810
I can only post about this on YouTube.

125
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,590
I’m afraid of them, they have a lot of thugs.

126
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,540
I’m worried for my elderly relatives.

127
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,210
But I cannot sit here and accept this.

128
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:28,290
They hit people, steal land, and only throw
me 2000 yuan and that’s that.”

129
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,920
Right.

130
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,260
Maybe you shouldn’t have posted this on
YouTube either.

131
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,870
It gives the local authorities in China kind
of a bad image.

132
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,870
And they, too, can use a VPN to see what you
write on YouTube.

133
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:51,020
Meanwhile, over in the renegade province of
Taiwan, Ba-jiong and his audience have had

134
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,860
a field day, with very open dialogue about
whether or not the Communist Party is to blame

135
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,029
for the village cadre’s actions.

136
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:03,410
“What does a village cadre’s criminal
acts of stealing property have to do with

137
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,930
the Chinese Communist Party?”

138
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,760
“A village cadre’s criminal acts have
no relation to the CCP?

139
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
An elder has been hospitalized, the police
did nothing to resolve the issue.

140
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
What’s the point of having a government
then?”

141
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,820
￼
“I wish for his grandpa to get better so

142
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,970
he could give his grandson a good smack.”

143
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,710
￼
“Fake Chinese nationalist: Hit with Socialism’s

144
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,040
Iron Fist, he’s no longer patriotic.

145
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,050
True Chinese nationalist: Hit with Socialism’s
Iron Fist, he’s even more patriotic.”

146
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:44,420
Well, Lonely Fly saw some of these online
comments, and realized that he’d accidentally\h

147
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,730
started a discussion about the legitimacy
of the Chinese Communist Party.

148
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:57,149
And so he tried to clear himself...by illegally
using a VPN to post about it on YouTube!

149
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:08,210
I shared this video with absolutely no political
intentions, please don’t believe the people

150
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,089
who are using my situation as a political
tool!

151
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,709
Also, that pro-Taiwan Independence YouTuber,
Photographer Diary FunTV, Let me tell you,\h

152
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:22,870
Let me tell you, This is just a typical civil
dispute, it has nothing to do with our patriotism

153
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,899
and love for China and the CCP.

154
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,520
Stop purposely adding your separatist narrative,
you’re just a buffoon.

155
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,890
What a joke!

156
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:38,150
But eventually, Lonely Fly realized his mistake.

157
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:45,400
So he used an illegal VPN to go online and...delete
his entire YouTube account.

158
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
Better late than never.

159
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,730
That was two weeks ago.

160
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,360
And we haven’t heard from Lonely Fly since.

161
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,589
I hope he and his grandpa are doing ok.

162
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:59,220
Because if there’s any lesson here, it’s
not that Chinese people shouldn’t use a

163
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,010
VPN to access YouTube.

164
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,950
They should!

165
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,490
But I hope when they do, they can use it for
what the internet was originally intended

166
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,100
for: Cat videos.\h

167
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,029
And also, to learn the truth.

168
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:20,180
I hope people in China can learn about what
happens to patriotic people like Lonely Fly—who

169
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,010
was persecuted despite trying to push the
Party line.

170
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,540
No matter whether you’re a Chinese dissident
or a patriotic Chinese citizen who loves the

171
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,890
Communist Party, as long as the Party rules
China, you will eventually be persecuted.

172
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,140
And on that inspiring note, I’ll now answer
a question from a China Uncensored fan on

173
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Patreon.

174
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,871
Patreon is the best way to support us—because
so many of our videos get demonetized by YouTube,

175
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:53,600
and we have a whole team to support.

176
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,120
Chris Gracie asks: “Chris, any thoughts
on the possibility that CCP may have knowingly

177
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,520
released Covid19?

178
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,480
Not such a crazy conspiracy, considering the
effect its had on USA UK etc etc!

179
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,029
And supposedly little in China.”

180
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,649
Good question, Chris.

181
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:16,920
I think it’s unlikely to have been done
on purpose.

182
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,839
The CCP is obsessed with controlling everything.

183
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:21,920
The internet.

184
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Religion.

185
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
Even foreign officials.

186
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,240
There’s no logical reason the CCP would
intentionally release a virus they can’t

187
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
control.

188
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,890
They haven’t controlled it in China, either.

189
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,570
Any reports you read about how China has done
such a great job controlling the virus are

190
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,320
based on lies.

191
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,029
We don’t know the true situation there.\h

192
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:47,760
There are some reports that it could have
*accidentally* leaked from a lab.

193
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,519
And if that’s the case, you can only blame
poor safety standards and human incompetence.

194
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,630
But we don’t know if that’s what happened,
because if it was, the CCP would just cover

195
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,769
it up with more lies.

196
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,190
Thanks for your question, Chris.

197
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,089
And thank you all for your support.

198
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,880
China Uncensored is only possible because
of direct support from viewers.

199
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,990
Go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored and contribute
a dollar or more per episode if you can.

200
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,120
It can make all the difference.

201
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,350
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

202
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,430
See you next time.
