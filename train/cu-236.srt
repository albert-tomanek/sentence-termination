00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,800
A Wu Tang Clan inspired T-shirt

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,120
Is causing another feud between China and
Canada

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:18,070
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:25,400
Canada and China are feuding yet again—this
time over the Wu Tang Clan.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,060
Sort of.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,100
First—I really hope you all remember the
Wu Tang Clan, otherwise I’ll feel incredibly

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,300
old.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,950
But even if you don’t remember them, all
you need to know is they were a hip hop group

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,010
from the 90s.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,320
Actually you don’t need to know that either.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,489
All you really need to know is that this was
their symbol.

12
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:54,280
Now, a Canadian diplomat in China ordered
custom t-shirts that had *this* symbol on

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,399
it.

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,420
Wu Tang is replaced with Wuhan, the city in
China.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,710
And Chinese authorities are furious.\h

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,540
In fact, the issue made it all the way to
China’s Foreign Ministry.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:16,090
At a press conference on Monday, spokesman
Wang Wenbin said China is, “shocked by this

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,850
and has lodged stern representations with
the Canadian Embassy in China, demanding that

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:30,130
the Canadian side immediately thoroughly investigate
the incident and give China a clear explanation.”

20
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,009
Why is the Chinese Communist Party freaking
out about a t-shirt?

21
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,700
Well, it’s because they think the symbol
represents a bat.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:46,920
Some scientists believe the coronavirus pandemic
came from a bat and spread in Wuhan.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,270
So the Communist Party is taking the t-shirt
design as a swipe at China.

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,290
They’re very sensitive.\h

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,540
A Canadian official told Reuters that “The
T-shirt logo designed by a member of the Embassy

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,829
shows a stylized W, and is not intended to
represent a bat.

27
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:12,139
It was created for the team of Embassy staff
working on repatriation of Canadians from

28
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,090
Wuhan in early 2020.

29
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,900
We regret the misunderstanding.”

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:24,189
China’s foreign ministry replied by saying
that Canada’s explanation was not convincing.

31
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,849
The guy who designed the t-shirt is Canadian
diplomat Chad Hensler.

32
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,309
Was it just an innocent mistake?

33
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:36,299
Or was he making a reference to the coronavirus,
bats, and Wuhan?\h

34
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:43,489
Well, former Canadian Ambassador to China
David Mulroney jumped to Chad Hensler’s

35
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,689
defense.

36
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:48,030
In the trolliest way possible.

37
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,659
He tweeted, “I worked with Chad, who is
smart, decent, dedicated.

38
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,010
We’re lucky to have him.

39
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,540
Not his fault if China goes batty over the
Wu-Tang Clan’s logo.

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,930
Guilty conscience?”

41
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,890
Batty?

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,779
Interesting choice of words.

43
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:11,449
Of course China-Canada relations aren’t
so hot right now.

44
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:17,069
At the end of 2018, Canada detained Meng Wanzhou
the CFO of Huawei.

45
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,150
She’s been charged with violating US sanctions
on Iran.

46
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,079
The Chinese Communist Party responded by kidnapping
two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael

47
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,669
Spavor.

48
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:35,150
China has also made veiled threats to the
300,000 Canadians living in Hong Kong.

49
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,639
So China and Canada just do not get along.

50
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,150
Almost like...Shaolin and Wu Tang.

51
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,079
And now I’ll answer a question from one
of you, a fan who supports China Uncensored

52
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,349
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

53
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:58,540
TallMan101 asks, “I don't understand using
spiked clubs, don't they have guns?”

54
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,489
Ah, TallMan is talking about a deadly border
clash between India and China back in June.

55
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,159
At least 20 Indian soldiers died and an unknown
number of Chinese soldiers were killed.\h

56
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,199
India accused Chinese soldiers of using nail-studded
rods like this.

57
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,199
Pretty nasty.

58
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,789
But yeah, why not use guns?

59
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,400
Well, India and China have actually fought
a war over these border disputes.

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,550
That was back in 1962.

61
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,990
In order to prevent escalations, both sides
agreed that their troops on the border wouldn’t

62
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,150
be armed with guns.

63
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,770
And so melee weapons apparently are in vogue.

64
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,241
“Indian commanders acknowledge that their
soldiers, too, now carry hand weapons, like

65
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,400
bamboo sticks and sling shots.”

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
Recently, there was yet another border fight.

67
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,569
Indian security officials told the Associated
Press that there were clashes with sticks

68
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,210
and stones.

69
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,150
At least there was no name calling.

70
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,660
Thanks for your question TallMan.

71
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,289
And thank you for watching.

72
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,199
Have a question you want to ask me?
