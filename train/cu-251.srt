00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,330
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,740
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,580
Let’s talk about the Other China:

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,760
Taiwan.

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,180
A beautiful, tropical island...

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,460
now armed to the teeth with US missiles!

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,790
Just in time for the Fourth of July,

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,810
President Trump announced a plan

9
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,770
to sell more than a billion dollars worth

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,830
of weapons to Taiwan.

11
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,990
Which resulted in a great fireworks display

12
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,990
right in front of the Chinese Embassy.

13
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,949
The weapons package includes

14
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:27,740
1.4 billion dollars worth of “torpedoes,

15
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,420
technical support for early warning radar,

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,900
anti-radiation missiles,

17
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,190
and missile components.”

18
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,790
Trump’s announcement, though,

19
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,530
is not really groundbreaking.

20
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,320
The US has sold weapons to Taiwan

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,910
dozens of times over the past 50 years.

22
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,910
The most recent package was approved

23
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,630
by President Obama less than two years ago.

24
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,550
But for the Chinese Communist Party,

25
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,340
it’s something they never quite get used
to.

26
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,570
Like when your roommate leaves

27
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,610
his dirty socks in the living room.

28
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,940
“Come, on, Carl!

29
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,270
We’ve talked about this a hundred times!

30
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,590
What is your problem?!”

31
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,079
And that’s because the Chinese regime

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,260
considers Taiwan to be a third rail issue.

33
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,569
They say Taiwan is a breakaway province of
China.

34
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,649
And deep in their hearts,

35
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,100
they hope that someday—

36
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,100
someday—

37
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,799
Taiwan and mainland China will be reunited.

38
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,029
And nothing makes you want to get

39
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:16,100
back together with someone

40
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,660
more than having advanced weaponry aimed at
you.

41
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,940
Taiwan...doesn’t really like this.

42
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,840
And neither does its long-time ally,

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,899
the United States.

44
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:26,329
And that’s why the two have

45
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,939
a long-standing weapons agreement.

46
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,520
“Only by actively preparing for battle

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,389
can the battle be stopped.

48
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:35,819
Only with our own strength

49
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,409
can peace be maintained.”

50
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,189
Well, Madam President,

51
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,520
the Chinese ambassador would beg to differ.

52
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,279
“How can you promote peace and stability

53
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,460
by selling arms?

54
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,499
This is a most ridiculous argument.”

55
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:52,689
Yes, China is all about peaceful development,

56
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:55,560
as you can see from the Embassy’s official
website.

57
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,840
And that would be a really good argument...

58
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:03,780
except that China kinda supplies weapons to
37 countries,

59
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,329
making China the third biggest weapons exporter

60
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,899
in the world.

61
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,009
Presumably no one told that

62
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,800
to the Chinese ambassador.

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
Which is why the Embassy said,

64
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,209
“The Chinese government and Chinese people

65
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,200
have every right to be outraged”

66
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,569
over the US-Taiwan weapons deal...

67
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,599
a deal so big, it’s...

68
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,849
wait, it’s only a quarter the size

69
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,050
of China’s $5 billion dollar weapons deal

70
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,240
with Pakistan.

71
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,620
Hmm…

72
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,460
Well, besides all the weapons selling part,

73
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,480
the Communist Party is totally about

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,560
peaceful development, I swear.

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,019
We silly Americans just don’t understand

76
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,610
the larger picture,

77
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,030
which is why Ambassador Cui

78
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,159
said China needs to continue to instruct the
US

79
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,609
and continue advancing on the right track

80
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,750
of China-US relations.

81
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,760
Unfortunately for the Chinese regime,

82
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,030
President Trump seems to be un-instructable.

83
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,409
And in addition to the weapons deal with Taiwan,

84
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,120
this month has seen another shift

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,780
in Trump’s tactics on dealing with China.

86
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,640
There are signs that Washington

87
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,189
is about to take the kid gloves off,

88
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,640
and underneath those gloves…

89
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,170
“Look at these hands,

90
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,540
are they small hands?”

91
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,349
Maybe Indian Prime Minister Modi,

92
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,420
who got this bear hug from the president,

93
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,489
could answer that question.

94
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,090
The two met at the beginning of the week.

95
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,560
India is China’s main Asian rival,

96
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,730
and according to China expert, Gordon Chang,

97
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,950
“It was clear both saw in the other

98
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,639
the means to contain an increasingly aggressive

99
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,330
Chinese state.”

100
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,189
Anyway, the US State Department has labeled
China

101
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,040
as one of the worst human trafficking offenders.

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,170
That was followed by another whammy.

103
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,610
The US accused the Chinese Bank of Dandong

104
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,099
of laundering money for North Korea.

105
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,519
“This bank has served as a gateway

106
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,389
for North Korea to access the U.S.

107
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,219
and international financial systems,

108
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,480
facilitating millions of dollars of transactions

109
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,820
for companies involved in North Korea’s nuclear

110
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,260
and ballistic missile programs.”

111
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,420
And when Steven Mnuchinsays he’s gonna go
after you,

112
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,560
watch out.

113
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,730
Because he was the executive producer

114
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,349
of over a dozen action blockbusters—s

115
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,400
o I assume he can personally call for backup

116
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,970
from the heroes whose movies he’s funded,

117
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,970
including Wonder Woman,

118
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,140
The Man from U.N.C.L.E. slash Superman,

119
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,669
and most fearsome of all,

120
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,709
LEGO Batman.

121
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,470
The U.S. Treasury also slapped sanctions

122
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,500
on two guys and a shipping firm

123
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,180
over their North Korean ties.

124
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,030
Dang! Mnuchin just stole my sitcom idea:

125
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,370
“Two Guys, a Megalomaniac, and a Shipping
Firm.”

126
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,229
Anyway, all this follows President Trump’s

127
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:37,900
reportedly growing frustration

128
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,720
with China’s inability to rein in North
Korea.

129
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,919
Which probably wasn’t helped by this news:

130
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,690
“Kim Jong-Un calls it

131
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,910
‘a gift package for the Fourth of July,’

132
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,360
Pyongyang saying, Wednesday,

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,580
its new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile

134
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,710
can carry a nuclear warhead.”

135
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,229
Apparently it could hit Alaska.

136
00:04:58,229 --> 00:04:59,229
Brings a whole new meaning

137
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,830
to the show Deadliest Catch.

138
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,889
Ever since Trump was elected last November,

139
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,780
the relationship between the US and China

140
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,900
has been up and down

141
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,690
like a game of whack-a-mole.

142
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,490
First, Trump took a phone call from Taiwan’s
president.

143
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,270
“This is believed to be the first time

144
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,370
a president-elect has spoken with

145
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,080
the Taiwanese leader since 1979

146
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
when the two countries broke off ties.

147
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,290
They are going to—

148
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,699
Wolf, I can't underestimate

149
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,490
how they are going to freak out.”

150
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,360
And freak out, China did.

151
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,300
Especially after Trump then questioned

152
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,069
the One China Policy.

153
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,910
But the relationship seemed to thaw in the
spring,

154
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,340
after Trump invited Chinese leader Xi Jinping

155
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,190
to his Mar-a-Lago estate.

156
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,789
I also like to show off my cool house

157
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,810
when people come to visit.

158
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,810
At the time,

159
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,240
Trump said their relationship was really warming
up.

160
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,050
“The relationship developed between

161
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,639
president Xi and myself,

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,490
I think, is outstanding.

163
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,190
We look forward to being together

164
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,090
many times in the future.”

165
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,880
Though now it seems like the relationship

166
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,159
could be getting icy once again,

167
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,900
as Trump feels China’s efforts to stop North
Korea

168
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,070
are going nowhere.

169
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,521
And if he’s not asking for China’s help

170
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,800
any more on North Korea,

171
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,320
well, it’s a good time to sell

172
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,650
a billion dollars in weapons to Taiwan.

173
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,930
And coming up after the break:

174
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,560
We bring you corruption,

175
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,789
sex scandals, and murder.

176
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,640
Or as the Chinese Communist Party calls it,

177
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,400
Tuesday.

178
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,860
Listen, you know what’s better

179
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,520
than a billion dollars worth of weapons?

180
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,250
More China Uncensored.

181
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,560
If you visit ChinaUncensored.tv,

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,360
you can this and other segments

183
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,800
on our full length episode right now—

184
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,699
before they come out on YouTube.

185
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,509
We began doing standard length TV episodes

186
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,169
