1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,299
Tibet has been occupied for 60 years

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,680
The Chinese Communist Party has waged a systematic
campaign

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,910
To wipe out Tibetan Culture

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,420
Will there ever be a Free Tibet?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,140
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,140
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,990
It’s been 60 years since the Chinese Communist
Party liberated Tibet.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,990
From its freedom.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,670
But first, Mao Zedong tried different tactic:

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,300
Making friends with the Dalai Lama.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,269
You know, to get him to see how good

12
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,439
Buddhism with Chinese characteristics could
be.

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,860
Obviously, that did not work out.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,800
In 1959, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,580
He would go on to establish a democratic Tibetan
government

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,330
in exile in Dharamsala, India.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,350
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party would
go on to destroy

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,370
most of the Buddhist temples in Tibet,

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,970
while massacring 1.2 million Tibetans,

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,190
according to some observers.

21
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,720
International calls for Free Tibet died down

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,530
as Western businesses and officials

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,790
eagerly sought out the Chinese market.

24
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,370
Which of course worked out so well for them.

25
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,180
Karma is a...well you get the idea.

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,460
So what is the future of Tibet?

27
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,260
I sat down with Dorjee Tseten,

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,860
a member of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile.

29
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,540
He’s also Executive Director of Students
for a Free Tibet.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,880
Thank you so much for joining us today.

31
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,150
Thank you, Chris.

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,400
So it's been 60 years since, well,

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,410
the Communist Party says it liberated Tibet,

34
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,170
how are things in Tibet?

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,500
So for us, for the Tibetan and for people
around the whole Tibet,

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,870
it's a 60 years of occupation,

37
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,340
and it's 60 years of resistance inside Tibet,

38
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,840
and we need to understand that Tibet is colonized
by China,

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,520
and it's under the military occupation right
now.

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,420
Despite the 60 years of occupation,

41
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,770
Tibetan has continued to resist for their
freedom,

42
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,729
and we're seeing growing resistance inside
Tibet,

43
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,760
especially by the new generation in this difficult
time.

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,110
Do you mean inside Tibet or abroad?

46
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,670
Yeah, inside Tibet, outside Tibet.

47
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,410
So one example that I can give, one of the
recent

48
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,689
like most landmark historic uprising in 2008,

49
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:16,400
that has capture the imagination of the international
community,

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,290
and China was also like shock,

51
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,689
it was led by the Tibetan new generation.

52
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,170
Almost 70 percentage of people who joined
the uprising,

53
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,310
and that took part in like hundreds of cities
and villages

54
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:35,560
around the whole Tibet was led by the new
generation.

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,000
So we can see the new generation of Tibetans
are taking

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,650
the responsibility of the movement in the
resistance.

57
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm curious, why do you think the Chinese
Communist Party

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,800
is so interested in Tibet?

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,329
So Tibet is a strategically very important
for China

60
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:55,900
to spread its control in Asia.

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,969
And when Tibet was occupied, Tibetan movement,
the leadership,

62
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,269
we have been telling to the international
community

63
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,819
that China's aim is not just Tibet,

64
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,170
it want to control the Asia and the global
community.

65
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,870
So what we are seeing right now,

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,830
now China's expansion,

67
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,439
this idea is not limited to Tibet.

68
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,329
We are seeing in Asia, threat in South Asia,
East Asia.

69
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,329
So Tibet is really,

70
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,450
really strategically important place for them,

71
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,010
and Tibet has a very, very rich mineral resources,

72
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,440
and like any other colonized country,

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,939
it is important for China to take away the
resources,

74
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,709
and they're doing the mining, they're [...] the
river.

75
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:44,639
So on that part, China is gaining a lot, and
for them

76
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,409
the continuation of Tibet,

77
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,079
and also the population they can transport
into Tibet,

78
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,010
which now we as concerned that Tibetans are
becoming

79
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,930
a minority in our own land.

80
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,239
So all those are the reason that China continue
to occupy Tibet.

81
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,079
The Chinese Communist Party has been pushing
Tibetans

82
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,739
to be less religious and spend their time
learning Mandarin,

83
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,769
why is the Communist Party so concerned about

84
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,419
changing the culture of Tibet?

85
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,120
So Tibetan language and Tibetan culture,

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,989
Tibetan religion is the core of Tibetan national
identity,

87
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,220
and what China want to do is to wipe out Tibet

88
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,710
from the map of the world,

89
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,169
and Tibetans inside Tibet to forget their
culture,

90
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,210
their identity, so that they can control the
Tibetan people.

91
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,600
But Tibetans are continually resisting by
using their culture

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,350
as a mean of resistance,

93
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,659
which is really, really unique,

94
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,650
and new things that we're seeing in the resistance,

95
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,530
how Tibetans are using culture and language
as a tool to resist.

96
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,020
And China, the sinicization program that is
going on,

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,680
not just in Tibet, but other part of like
occupied territory,

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,229
like in East Turkestan.

99
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:04,949
Basically they'd want to the new generation
to forget everything,

100
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,629
and what we are seeing is new generations
are taking up ...

101
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,940
courageously taking the risk to keep their
identity and fighting back.

102
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,060
Well, I was going to ask about that.

103
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,590
Do you see any parallels between what has
happened in Tibet,

104
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,090
and what is happening with the Uyghurs in
Xinjiang or East Turkestan,

105
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,740
as you call it?

106
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:31,690
Yeah, so the current situation inside East
Turkestan is very,

107
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,159
very difficult, or one point ...

108
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,349
or one or two million Tibet,

109
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:41,820
I mean, Uyghurs are under the concentration
camp which is unbelievable,

110
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,389
and the person who has implemented this policy,

111
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,439
the current party secretary in East Turkestan,

112
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,629
the Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Chen Quanguo,
Chen Quanguo,

113
00:05:55,629 --> 00:06:01,530
he was the party secretary of so-called Tibet
Autonomous Region.

114
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,700
So when he become the party secretary of Tibet
in 2011,

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,060
he had implemented such a policy,

116
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,189
a new policy on security which undermine

117
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,490
and which repress the Tibetan religious freedom

118
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,780
and right of the people,

119
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,510
and under that policy, he implement a grid
system,

120
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,139
urban grid system, and introducing biometric
security,

121
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,930
and then it has really, really impact a lot,

122
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,110
caused a lot of challenges for the Tibetan
people inside Tibet.

123
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,129
So what we are seeing right now happening
to the Uyghur people,

124
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,060
the Tibetans has gone through that.

125
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,189
Because it was the same guy running the show.

126
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:43,189
Yes.

127
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,310
He's the same guys who's doing that,

128
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,090
and for Tibetans despite such difficulty,

129
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,949
we continue to resist,

130
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,560
and we continue to find different ways of
like engaging

131
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,909
and protecting our culture.

132
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:03,639
So I think ... I mean, we have our solidarity
with Uyghur people,

133
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,690
but we need to understand that this is not
just one place happening,

134
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,659
it's happening all over the ... It's a kind
of strategy that China

135
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:15,310
is implementing to the Chinese people

136
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,879
and to all the occupied territories.

137
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,389
I know the Communist Party has gone so far

138
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,280
as to even create laws regulating reincarnation.

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,449
How likely do you think it is,

140
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,240
we're going to see a new Dalai Lama someday

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,469
that's party approved?

142
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:35,419
So I think that's what China want to bring
again in the discussion,

143
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:40,699
but His Holiness Dalai Lama is the soul of
the movement,

144
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,870
and His Holiness Dalai Lama had made it very
clear

145
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,539
that the reincarnation will be chosen by the
Tibetan people

146
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,139
and China has no business in it.

147
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,120
And basically it is funny that Chinese government,

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,509
which repress religion for over last 60 years,

149
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,449
and now finding interest in choosing next
Dalai Lama,

150
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:07,400
and not only that, this is not a new thing,
there's I think a ...

151
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,889
form a new law, I mean, a law in 1995 which
under Order No. 5,

152
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,220
they decide that Chinese government has the
right to choose

153
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,050
any reincarnation in Tibet, which we have
protest,

154
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,590
and now international community is also understanding
that.

155
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,330
Recently there was a resolution in the Congress,

156
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,470
US also saying that it's a Tibetan people
right,

157
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,060
and China cannot decide on that.

158
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,180
So on that part, those are the legal thing,

159
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,760
but basically it is most important that reincarnation

160
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,670
and the religion is so deeply related to the
heart and belief,

161
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,950
no matter what China do.

162
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,760
If Tibetan doesn't believe, they cannot do.

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,610
They can make rules, they can put people behind
the bars,

164
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,820
but they cannot force people to believe.

165
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,860
So on that part, I mean, recently we observed

166
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,550
the 30th birthday of His Holiness The Panchen
Lama,

167
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,130
the Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima,

168
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,300
and he has been missing for the last over
24 years,

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,120
and China tried to do that.

170
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,690
But the China appointed, the so-called Panchen
Lama,

171
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,760
nobody respect, nobody respect inside Tibet,
nobody respect outside.

172
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,850
So I think it shows that it failed.

173
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,910
If China wanted to do again, it won't work,

174
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,000
but then like most important thing is His
Holiness

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,410
has devolved the political authority to the
elected leader

176
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,730
of the democratic institution in exile,

177
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,110
and I think that is really key critical here.

178
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,960
So possibly there will be two Dalai Lamas,

179
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,940
but the Tibetan community will know which
one

180
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,670
is the one they support?

181
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,870
So I think if China does that,

182
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:06,990
it won't definitely make any sense to the
Tibetan community.

183
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,600
And what I'm saying is more important is the
political struggle,

184
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,040
and movement of Tibet will continue.

185
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,510
And His Holiness Dalai Lama under his leadership,

186
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,750
he has established a democratic institution
in exile

187
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,410
which represent both Tibetan people inside
and outside.

188
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,760
In early 60s,

189
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,370
His Holiness first establish the Tibetan parliament
in exile,

190
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,690
and now we have an elected Tibetan president

191
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,440
of Tibetan government in exile.

192
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,270
So I think those are key important that how
movement will sustain,

193
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,420
and it is the legacy of His Holiness.

194
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,820
Even though we still hope that His Holiness

195
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,390
will return to Tibet in this lifetime,

196
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,190
but His Holiness has shown the vision that
how Tibet

197
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,840
should be a democratic institution, and the
exiled government

198
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,190
that based in India is really important in
that whole picture.

199
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,740
And it's interesting as you say,

200
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,900
that there is this democratic institution
that's been created,

201
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,730
because one of the pieces of propaganda the
Communist Party

202
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,990
uses is to say that the Dalai Lama was like

203
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,380
a feudal slave-owning oppressor of the Tibetan
people,

204
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,840
but clearly he has established a democratic
institution.

205
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,850
Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,250
Even before the Chinese invasion,

207
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,940
even when His Holiness was very young,

208
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,490
he try to introduce new changes,

209
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,420
and basically bringing changes in the Tibetan
government and system,

210
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,200
but at the same time even before China's invasion,

211
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,250
Tibetan people are free,

212
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,020
Tibetan people have a government,

213
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,290
of course, His Holiness was the leader.

214
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,860
Tibetan has a system where no matter what
kind of system we have,

215
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,770
but we have food to eat, there was no famine

216
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,670
like the way after Chinese invasion, like
Tibetian,

217
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,490
so many Tibetan faced a lot of challenges,

218
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,040
and right now under occupation.

219
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,830
And His Holiness has always,

220
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:20,830
has this vision to have the people the power,

221
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,290
and to form the democratic institution.

222
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,790
So that's why when His Holiness first escape
and then came to exile,

223
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,240
the first thing he did was forming that democratic
institution.

224
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,450
So China, there's no basis on China's claim
that

225
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:43,530
His Holiness wanted to go back and establish
the same system,

226
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:50,560
there's no basis this for that, and basically
for Tibetan,

227
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,180
we want to have a system which decide our
own future

228
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,940
by the Tibetan people.

229
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,760
You mentioned the United States government,

230
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,220
and one thing I find very encouraging is that

231
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,690
when it comes to Chinese Communist Party,

232
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,200
this is one of few things that is always bipartisan,

233
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,160
it's something both Democrats and Republicans
can agree on.

234
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,960
What has been the support for Tibet and to
Tibetans abroad?

235
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,470
Throughout the Tibetan freedom struggle,

236
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,260
U.S. government and people,

237
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,300
most importantly, has support Tibet issue,

238
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,000
and of course supported His Holiness, Dalai
Lama.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,250
Recently, there was a bill passed in congress
called

240
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,700
Reciprocal Access to Tibet,

241
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,950
which actually seek reciprocity.

242
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:52,010
Because China, right now, rules Tibet under
complete lockdown,

243
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,060
so they don't allowed any people from outside
freely.

244
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,390
Even more difficult for the Tibetan Americans

245
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,110
who have a right to go to Tibet and also like

246
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,520
the American journalists or leaders.

247
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:15,210
This act demand China to have this reciprocity.

248
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,980
Those people who implement such law,

249
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,550
such restriction will be also bar from United
State,

250
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,730
to visit United State.

251
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,430
So it is supported unanimously as a bipartisan
support in the congress,

252
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,100
and it is passed as a law last December,

253
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,140
which is a historic support,

254
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,130
which will make China accountable.

255
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,200
Then the Tibetan government, and Tibetan Exile
Government,

256
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,790
and Tibetan settlements in India for the education,

257
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,950
for the school, for the community,

258
00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:01,860
United State government has been very supportive
throughout the years.

259
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:10,920
Especially the American people has been supportive
for the Tibet movement.

260
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,530
The organization I work right now, Students
for Free Tibet,

261
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,620
was established in United State 25 years ago.

262
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,250
We have so many American members and supporters,

263
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,580
along with Tibetan members,

264
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,580
so we have a grassroot people support for
this movement

265
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,850
from this country and around the world.

266
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,570
I know a few years ago there was a big Free
Tibet movement in Hollywood.

267
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,290
You had actors like Richard Gere promoting
it,

268
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,010
but you don't see that much anymore.

269
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,800
What happened?

270
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,240
Richard Gere is still one of the most important
supporter

271
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,350
and friend of His Holiness, Dalai Lama.

272
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,790
He continue to advocate the rights of Tibetan
people.

273
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:04,670
What we are seeing right now there is a strong
influence from China.

274
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,690
Any stars or Hollywood actors or film makers

275
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,970
keep relation with Tibet or Tibetan leader,

276
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,170
like His Holiness, Dalai Lama,

277
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,390
are barred from visiting China.

278
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,190
So what we were seeing right now,

279
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:25,070
the depression and the situation that Tibetan
people

280
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,160
face inside Tibet is no longer in Tibet.

281
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,620
The influence, the censorship, is now coming
to the rest, as well.

282
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,720
So because of that, of course,

283
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,110
it is sometime difficult for people to stand
for issue of Tibet.

284
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,180
But no matter that, there are many,

285
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,010
many other key people who has shown their
support

286
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,280
despite the consequence they face from China.

287
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,480
But of course, it is our responsibility, now,

288
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,650
especially for Tibetan and American

289
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,800
also to protect our rights here,

290
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,420
how we fight back the censorship.

291
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,680
Because this is a land of free.

292
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,980
This is not China.

293
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,170
But how people still fearful,

294
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,439
because China may punish the companies,

295
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,670
the corporation that try to make business
with China.

296
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,209
Undermining the human rights issue,

297
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,030
basic principle of what United States stand
for.

298
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,390
So I think this is also a fight that we,

299
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,650
as the Students of Free Tibet,

300
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:28,320
and also many other groups and people are
engaged ... Yeah.

301
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:36,810
What is the larger Tibetan community outside
of Tibet doing?

302
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,080
For the last 20 years,

303
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,030
many Tibetans has moved to the West.

304
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,400
Of course, Tibetan from inside Tibet,

305
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,920
as well as like [...] Tibetans in India.

306
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,530
What we have form now, unlike in the past,

307
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,950
Tibetan community has become integrated into
the global community.

308
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,550
So like in North America, we have around like

309
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,150
18 to 20 Tibetan community centers.

310
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,930
Tibetan community try to pass on the culture,

311
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,060
and language, and identity to our new generation.

312
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,660
So through this community center,

313
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,070
which directly operate independently,

314
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,410
but also in relation with our exile government

315
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,790
to protect our culture, language,

316
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,080
so the new generation can take the movement
forward.

317
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,290
The organization I work, Students for Free
Tibet,

318
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,940
as it was established 25 years ago,

319
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,760
along with the political campaign we do, we
do lot of trainings

320
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,950
to the new generation leaders.

321
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,620
Last year, we organize like 12 trainings

322
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,690
engaging almost like 500 participants,

323
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,640
basically to train them as the new generation
leaders

324
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,710
and activists about campaigning,

325
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,910
about media communication, about leadership.

326
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,120
Also about online security,

327
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,010
how to be safe from the China's threat

328
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,280
now we are no longer safe anywhere.

329
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,250
All those things, like we are building the
movement,

330
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,860
both the community and the global Tibetan
movement.

331
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,920
We have over like 180 Tibetan groups around
the world

332
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,300
still campaigning for Tibet, even after such
a long time.

333
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,020
You currently are an MP in the Tibetan parliament,
correct?

334
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
Yeah.

335
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,920
I'm a member of Tibetan parliament in exile

336
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,750
What is being an MP in a government-in-exile
...

337
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,600
What does that entail?

338
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,370
As we struggle for our freedom, His Holiness,
Dalai Lama,

339
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,240
has established the Tibetan Exile Government

340
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,310
and Tibetan parliament early '60s.

341
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,660
As we fight for our freedom,

342
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,100
we also want to create our own vision and
system.

343
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,380
What kind of system we want to create?

344
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,550
So this democratic institution is really important.

345
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,340
As I said, now Tibetans are in almost 30 countries.

346
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,190
But the institution we have, Tibetan Exile
Government,

347
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,160
also known as Central Tibetan Administration,

348
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,390
our president is being elected by people around
the 30 countries.

349
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,290
Our member of parliament also represent all
those people,

350
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,670
especially Tibetan people inside Tibet.

351
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,040
So every five year when we do election,

352
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,800
when Tibetan people in exile,

353
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,320
because when people inside Tibet cannot vote,

354
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,920
so Tibetan people in exile represent the movement.

355
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,220
By representing the movement, when we form
our government,

356
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,990
it is a direct challenge to Chinese government

357
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,600
that what kind of system we want.

358
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,120
We don't want a repressive regime that China
is right now

359
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,570
implementing in Tibet.

360
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,880
That is, I think, key.

361
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,670
His Holiness, Dalai Lama,

362
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:07,180
he has voluntarily stepped down from the political
responsibility in 2011.

363
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,140
Since then, even the exile government role
has become much more important.

364
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,680
Even though we hope that we will go to Tibet
soon,

365
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,880
but it might take time, because any resistance,

366
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,620
any movement take time.

367
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,650
So how we pass this knowledge and experience
to new generation?

368
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,820
I, as a Tibetan born in India, I'm engaged
in the movement

369
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,430
because of that vision from our elder generation.

370
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,790
That's why the democratic institution in the
exile community

371
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,730
as Tibetan Government-in-exile,

372
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,120
also known as Central Tibetan Administration,
is key.

373
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,150
What China claim about His Holiness

374
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,980
and about Tibet is completely baseless.

375
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,470
What we want?

376
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,640
Tibetan people to be free.

377
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,510
Tibetan people can decide their future.

378
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,770
That's why we have a really healthy democratic
system in exile

379
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:13,059
and now Tibetans across the globe in almost
like 30, 40 countries.

380
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,830
Especially like recently,

381
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,620
we mark the Tibetan National Uprising Day,

382
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,350
60 years of Tibetan National Uprising Day.

383
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,640
That was held in almost hundred cities around
the world on same day

384
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,270
by Tibetans and supporters.

385
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,100
So you can see the strength of the movement,

386
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,950
how it's being passed generation after generation.

387
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,510
I think that is key to the movement.

388
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,420
No longer how much it take,

389
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,220
we will continue to resist until we gain our
freedom.

390
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,470
This is something the young Tibetans care
about.

391
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,980
That's completely true, both inside and outside.

392
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,110
Where do you see Tibet in the next 10 years?

393
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,900
As I said, I think it is really critical time,

394
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:01,559
because of His Holiness age and because of
what is happening right now.

395
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,590
As much as we, Tibetan, care for our freedom,

396
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,850
it is now a time for international community

397
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,470
to care for their democracy.

398
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,070
Because what we see…

399
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:20,630
the expansionist kind of approach has now
crossed Tibet or…

400
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,630
It has reached beyond Asia and also in the
West.

401
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,680
Our democracy, our open society,

402
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,950
our freedom is under threat.

403
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,800
I think it is key for Tibetan.

404
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,890
This 10-year is completely important,

405
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,240
especially for new generation.

406
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,890
Also like Tibetan inside and outside,

407
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,350
how we continue our movement.

408
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:45,050
For that, we need to invest in the movement
to new a generation.

409
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:51,780
For the global community, I can see now the
governments or leaders

410
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,330
and the community are awakening.

411
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,930
We have been telling international community
long back like,

412
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,620
"You cannot trust China."

413
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,180
But people thought by doing business,

414
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,370
by opening of China,

415
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,130
there might be a trickle-down democracy,

416
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,080
Chinese might change.

417
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,940
But now things has gone from bad to worse.

418
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,420
The Human Rights Watch report said things

419
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,660
have much more critical, has gone bad, since
like 1989.

420
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,620
We are marking the 30-year of Tiananmen Massacre,
right?

421
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Mm-hmm.

422
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,570
So I think it is time for Tibetans and also
global community

423
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,490
and people who care for freedom to really,

424
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,210
really think and to stand for Tibet issue.

425
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,650
I think Tibet issue is a litmus test,

426
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,910
because for last almost 60 years,

427
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,530
underneath His Holiness, Dalai Lama's leadership,

428
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:47,810
we had practice nonviolence as a mean to resolve
our issue.

429
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,560
If this movement fail,

430
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,950
of course it will caution the matter of nonviolence.

431
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,260
But as I said, not only from the religious
point of view,

432
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,050
but new generation leaders are, in smart and
strategic way,

433
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:11,020
see nonviolence movement as impactful and
practical,

434
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,090
and we are doing that.

435
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,680
But for that, we need global community support.

436
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Mm-hmm.

437
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,900
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

438
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,220
It was fantastic to have a chance to talk
to you.

439
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,880
Thank you so much, Chris, for having me.
