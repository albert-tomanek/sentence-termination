1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,050
Hey Chris, what are you doing?

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,840
You know how China used a nine-dash line

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,220
to stakes its claim in the South China Sea?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,560
I’m just counting how many dashes it needs

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,620
for its new claim in the Arctic.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,280
I think it’s a...52-dash line?

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,939
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,710
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,699
What was that thing they said about winter

10
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,650
in that totally obscure TV show

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,619
that nobody’s ever heard of?

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,620
“Winter is coming.”

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,200
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,710
Well, that’s just make believe.

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,570
Because here in the real world,

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,350
winter has been leaving—

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,040
at least in the North Pole.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,680
“The Arctic is melting so fast,

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,230
the North Pole could be ice-free

20
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,600
during the summer

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,720
within the next decade or two.”

22
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,090
But that’s old news.

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,400
Seriously, that news report

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,100
was from a decade ago.

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,120
And guess what?

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,260
Ten years later,

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,920
a lot of the ice around the North Pole

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,870
is actually gone.

29
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,040
But what’s a loss for polar bears,

30
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,740
is a win for the Chinese Communist Party.

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,100
Because it means new access to

32
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,050
natural resources and shipping lanes!

33
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,410
Hooray!

34
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,900
The US geological survey also estimates

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,190
the Arctic holds about 13% of the world’s

36
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,830
undiscovered oil reserves

37
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,750
and 30% of the natural gas reserves.

38
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,820
“All in all, the Arctic holds about 22%

39
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,680
of the world’s undiscovered hydrocarbon
resources.”

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Wow!

41
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,120
Shipping lanes and natural resources?

42
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,310
No wonder China has just declared itself

43
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,659
a “near-Arctic state.”

44
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,820
China is definitely near the Arctic,

45
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,610
in the sense that the northernmost tip of
China

46
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,720
is a mere thousand miles south of the Arctic
Circle.

47
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,530
Which is like saying that New York

48
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,450
is a near-Carribean city because it’s only

49
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,260
1,000 miles from the Bahamas.

50
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,920
Beach time!

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,140
Of course, it’s actually snowing outside.

52
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,470
People who can read maps

53
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,590
might notice that England and even Germany

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,120
are further north than China.

55
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,229
China is actually much closer to the equator

56
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,229
than to the north pole.

57
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:13,840
But China is definitely on the same planet

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,920
as the Arctic,

59
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,480
so I guess that’s something.

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,700
At least it’s enough for the Chinese Communist
Party

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,650
to have its own ambitious strategy for the
Arctic.

62
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,410
“China is determined to better know the
Arctic,

63
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,410
protect the Arctic,

64
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,580
utilize the Arctic,

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,130
and participate in the governance of the Arctic.”

66
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,260
Yes, the CCP wants China to be

67
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,420
one of the countries calling the shots in
the Arctic,

68
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,220
and wants to quote unquote “utilize” the
Arctic.

69
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,540
And that means using its seafaring shipping
lanes

70
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,069
and getting its hands on Arctic resources.

71
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,710
Like Santa’s workshop.

72
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,010
Then all the toys will be Made in China!

73
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,140
That’s the gist of a new white paper

74
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,270
on China’s Arctic strategy,

75
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,850
recently published by China’s

76
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,450
State Council Information Office.

77
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,020
Ok, except for the part about Santa.

78
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,709
That’s still top secret.

79
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,810
Here’s what the white paper says.

80
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,330
“It stresses that China should be firm

81
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,970
in defining itself as an important

82
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,000
stakeholder in the Arctic,

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,330
for its geographic adjacency to the area

84
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,280
and its participation in the regional

85
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,849
and global affairs.”

86
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,629
A core component of this new plan

87
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:21,810
is to become a shipping powerhouse,

88
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,849
as the warming waters open up faster

89
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,240
and cheaper routes through the ice-free Arctic.

90
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,160
“A milestone was set in 2014

91
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,400
when a cargo vessel went through

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
the Northwest Passage without an ice breaker.”

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,430
The most important arctic shipping route

94
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,660
is the Northwest Passage.

95
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,140
It runs through Canada,

96
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,660
and links East Asia with the Eastern US

97
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,020
during the summer when the ice is melted.

98
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,450
It’s about 40% shorter than going

99
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,160
down through the Panama Canal.

100
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,300
It’s also much cheaper.

101
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,930
Hmm, cheaper and faster than the Panama Canal?

102
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,909
I sure hope Panama doesn’t regret dumping
Taiwan

103
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,590
for the Chinese Communist Party.

104
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,400
The second major Arctic route is called

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,909
the Northeast Passage or the Northern Sea
Route.

106
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,220
It runs along the coast of Russia.

107
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,709
Just 10 years ago,

108
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,280
no ships ran here because of the ice.

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,610
But in 2016,

110
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,489
19 ships crossed through the Northeast Passage.

111
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,430
For China, access to these shipping routes

112
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,520
has become a part of Xi Jinping’s

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,490
One Belt One Road initiative,

114
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,630
which is made of trade corridors

115
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,430
across land and along the sea.

116
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,660
One Belt One Road is the CCP’s

117
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,470
massive scheme to transport goods

118
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,190
between China and the rest of the world—

119
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,440
and in the process,

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
give China access to precious resources.

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,050
Now in its new Arctic strategy,

122
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,330
the Chinese regime is careful to point out

123
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,680
it has no territorial claims in the Arctic.

124
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,180
In fact, “China supports

125
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,350
the peaceful settlement of disputes

126
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,090
over territory and...blah blah blah...

127
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,389
efforts to safeguard security and stability
in the region.”

128
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,500
Because when the Chinese regime

129
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,460
talks about protecting “peace and stability”

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,180
in a disputed region,

131
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,949
you know what it’s code for.

132
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:07,120
Send in the soldiers!

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,500
...of peace!

134
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,430
Look, there’s enough countries

135
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,000
with claims to the Arctic already.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,760
Do they really need another country involved?

137
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,200
Especially one with a history

138
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,009
of building fake islands

139
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,540
and putting real missiles on them?

140
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,729
Even without China,

141
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,560
competing territorial claims in the Arctic

142
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,910
already make the North Pole

143
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,310
an explosive powder keg on thin ice.

144
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,310
Not long ago

145
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,840
Russia tried to show who’s boss

146
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,930
by running the biggest military drills

147
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,840
in the history of the Arctic––

148
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,699
over 155 thousand personnel,

149
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,130
thousands of jets, tanks and ships.

150
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,419
“The training scenario was such

151
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,400
that an armed conflict had erupted

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,330
over the South Kryll Islands with Japan

153
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,850
and the Russian Arctic army was tasked

154
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,900
with defending the Arctic territory

155
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,889
against the American army.”

156
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,180
So if the CCP really does get involved

157
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,180
in Arctic governance,

158
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,120
it’s going to have a lot to deal with.

159
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,650
So could the Arctic become

160
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,860
the new South China Sea?

161
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,560
Maybe we could call it the North China Pole.

162
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,840
If that happens,

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,710
I know what I’ll be doing.

164
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,860
So what do you think?

165
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,539
Will China join the race to control the Arctic?

166
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,760
Or will it chill out?

167
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,419
And who wants me to ride a polar bear?

168
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:20,789
Leave your comments below.

169
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,949
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

170
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,500
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

171
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,840
see you next time.

172
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Wait, before you go,

173
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,300
I have something important to tell you.

174
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,669
You know, not many companies are brave enough

175
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,139
to advertise on China Uncensored.

176
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:38,680
But there is one I want you to know about.

177
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,490
They sell amazing food:

178
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,850
Thrive Life.

179
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,990
And unlike a lot of other meal delivery food,

180
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,760
they’ve got GMO Free,

181
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Gluten Free,

182
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,919
and organic options.

183
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,960
And unlike Blue Apron,

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,180
Thrive Life meal packs won’t go rotten

185
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,860
in you fridge after a couple days.

186
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,290
Thrive food is freeze dried,

187
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,729
so it lasts several months,

188
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:00,729
even years.

189
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,810
I know what you’re thinking.

190
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,810
Freeze dried food?

191
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,660
Are you sure about this?

192
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,039
I was skeptical too...

193
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,380
until they sent me a box of samples.

194
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,020
And I can honestly tell you,

195
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,670
it’s delicious.

196
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,150
They sent me this whole box.

197
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,389
There’s a ton of amazing food in here.

198
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,300
Everything from snacks to meals.

199
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,259
My personal favorite,

200
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,990
South Pacific-Style Stir Fry with Pulled Pork.

201
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,990
Now I know,

202
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,990
it comes in a box,

203
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,110
but this is what it looks like cooked

204
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,380
and it only took me a few minutes to make.

205
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,690
And they sell hundreds of other foods.

206
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,319
Uncensoring China takes a lot of energy.

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,270
And I don’t always have time to plan meals.

208
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,630
I can’t tell you how many times food in
my fridge

209
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,710
has gone bad because I couldn’t cook for
a few days.

210
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,930
Thrive Life basically solved this for me.

211
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,500
It’s super convenient,

212
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,979
tastes great,

213
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,919
and I don’t have to worry about it going
bad.

214
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,690
It’s also more affordable the Blue Apron.

215
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,639
I’ve provided a link below to order.

216
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,229
Just try one or two meals.

217
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,660
You’re gonna love it.

218
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,380
And China Uncensored gets a commission

219
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,250
on any purchase you make.

220
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,819
So this is a great way to help the show,

221
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,310
and get some tasty food out of it.

222
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,259
Plus, if Kim Jong-un ever does launch a nuke,

223
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,760
you’ll have all the food you need

224
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,360
in the post-apocalyptic future.

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,539
So help out the show,

226
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,210
and buy yourselves some treats from Thrive
Life.
