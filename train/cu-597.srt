1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,720
China’s population is shrinking

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,680
That’s bad news for the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,840
Can they solve the problem

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,920
By forcing people to have babies?

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,560
Last week, the Financial Times\h
came out with an explosive report.\h\h

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,560
It said China’s population had declined\h
for the first time in five decades.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,400
This would be the first time the population\h
has decreased since the Great Leap Forward.\h\h

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,240
That was “Mao Zedong’s disastrous\h
economic policy in the late 1950s\h\h

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,840
that caused the deaths of\h
tens of millions of people.”

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,120
Now the idea that China’s population has\h
fallen for the first time in 50 years\h\h

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,160
doesn’t sound controversial.\h
But we’re talking about China,\h\h

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
where anything can become a state secret if\h
the Chinese Communist Party is paranoid enough.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,040
Population growth? State secret.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
Real GDP numbers? State secret.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,480
Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s favorite\h
breakfast food? Definitely state secret.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,720
According to the Financial Times, China’s\h
population fell below 1.4 billion in 2020.\h\h

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,440
Those population numbers come from\h
China’s latest 10-year census,\h\h

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,840
which hasn’t been publicly released\h
yet. The Financial Times got their\h\h

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,080
scoop from anonymous sources claiming\h
to be “familiar with the research.”

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,240
They added that “The figure was considered\h
very sensitive and would not be released until\h\h

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,600
multiple government departments had reached a\h
consensus on the data and its implications.”

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,120
Well after the Financial Times ran this story,\h
Chinese government departments reached a consensus\h\h

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:01,680
on the data. And their consensus was that the\h
Financial Times is a big, fat lying liar who lies.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,000
China’s National Bureau of\h
Statistics came out with a\h\h

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,800
one-line statement saying that\h
China’s population grew in 2020.

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
And Chinese state-run media were quick to publish\h\h

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,880
multiple articles denying\h
the Financial Times report.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,320
Of course, the actual population\h
data still hasn’t been released yet,\h\h

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,680
even though the census was supposed\h
to be published last month. Look,\h\h

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Chinese statistics are an art, not a science.\h
And everyone knows you can’t rush art.

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,240
Especially now that they have to\h
fudge the numbers all over again\h\h

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
to refute that Financial Times report.

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,520
You know what else is an art? Reading\h
between the lines of Chinese propaganda.\h\h

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,080
This Global Times article seems to indicate\h
that the census really did find that China’s\h\h

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,320
population was below 1.4 billion. But\h
they blamed that on a “statistical error.”

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
According to the Global Times,\h\h

38
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,200
China’s population didn’t really drop, it was\h
just never 1.4 billion in the first place.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,440
This is actually plausible. Some experts\h
have said for years that China’s population\h\h

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,120
estimates are inflated. One of the reasons\h
is that local governments are incentivized\h\h

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,600
to inflate their population numbers to get\h
more resources from the central government.

42
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,040
That’s a sign of a really functional system.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
But the Global Times also said that China’s\h\h

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,160
population is likely to start\h
to decline as early as 2022.

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
Which is pretty interesting. Because previous\h
government estimates said that China’s\h\h

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:48,560
population would start to decline after 2027\h
or 2029. Suddenly moving that up to next year\h\h

47
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,720
shows this is a bigger problem\h
than the Party previously admitted.

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,120
So it’s quite possible China’s\h
population is already declining.\h\h

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,320
It’s just too politically sensitive to say it now.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,520
But why are these population\h
statistics so politically sensitive?\h\h

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,440
I’ll tell you after the break.

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,000
Welcome back.

53
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,320
One of the big dangers for the Chinese Communist\h
Party is that just as they get strong enough to\h\h

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,160
become the dominant global power, their internal\h
problems will trigger a crisis. And China’s\h\h

55
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,200
population decline is a big crisis. One that’s due\h
to the Chinese Communist Party’s one-child policy.

56
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,320
The first problem is that China now\h
has too many men and not enough women.\h\h

57
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
The common statistic is that there are more\h
than 30 million more men than women in China.

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,600
That leads to things like sex trafficking\h
women from North Korea and Myanmar.\h\h

59
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,920
We’ve talked about that before on the show.

60
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,080
The second problem is that China is getting old,\h\h

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,760
fast. China’s working age population\h
has been falling since 2011.

62
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,520
If this keeps going, China won’t have enough\h
workers to support its aging population.\h\h

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,600
And with China’s inadequate\h
pension and healthcare system,\h\h

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
that’s putting more pressure on\h
younger people to support older adults.

65
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,480
It’s also a big problem for China’s economy, which\h
has been built on having a huge supply of workers.

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,320
We’ve talked before about the\h
disasters of the one-child\h\h

67
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,440
policy, from the hundreds of millions\h
of forced abortions and sterilizations,\h\h

68
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,520
to the massive fines that were used\h
to make money for local governments.

69
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,840
And the tragic thing is, it turns out the\h
one-child policy was probably unnecessary.\h\h

70
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,400
China’s birthrate had already been falling\h
for a decade before the one-child policy.

71
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,320
But the Chinese Communist Party went ahead\h
with the one-child policy anyway, creating\h\h

72
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,160
an authoritarian social engineering project\h
that screwed up their population for decades.

73
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
Birthrates started falling so fast that in 2016,\h\h

74
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,840
the Party changed their one-child\h
policy to a two-child policy.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,520
Now this doesn’t mean there was more freedom.\h
It just meant that people were allowed to have\h\h

76
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,000
two kids instead of one. You still had to,\h
for example, get a permit to have a kid.

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,120
The massive bureaucracy created by the\h
one-child policy was still there. For example,\h\h

78
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,520
the military, the police, and other state-owned\h
enterprises all have family planning units.

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,840
These family planning units do things like\h
monitor their female employees’ menstrual cycles.\h\h

80
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,880
And you thought your HR department was bad.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,640
But while the two-child policy resulted in\h
an initial bump in the number of babies,\h\h

82
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:54,160
ultimately it hasn’t worked. In 2019, China’s\h
birthrate sank to the lowest level on record.

83
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,320
It turns out that if you spend 35\h
years implementing a one-child policy,\h\h

84
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,080
a generation of only children don’t really\h
want to have more than one child themselves.\h\h

85
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,920
Especially because raising a kid\h
is getting more and more expensive.

86
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
The Chinese Communist Party knows this is\h
a problem. Which is why they’re starting\h\h

87
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,080
to act like your mother when she asks you\h
why she doesn’t have grandchildren yet.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,640
Earlier this year, the People’s\h
Bank of China released a report\h\h

89
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,800
calling for the central government\h
to “fully liberalize and encourage\h\h

90
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
childbirth,” meaning abandon restrictions\h
on how many children people can have.

91
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,760
Now this doesn’t mean there will be more\h
freedom. This is the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

92
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,360
They’re going to use the full power of the\h
state to make sure people do what they want.

93
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,760
Does this mean that the Chinese Communist\h
Party will force people to have babies?

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,800
Should we get ready for China’s baby quotas?

95
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,280
I’ll tell you more after the break.

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Welcome back. Could the Chinese\h
Communist Party make people have babies?\h\h

97
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
Well, they’re definitely going to try.

98
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,840
I’m not saying China’s going to go full Handmaid’s\h
Tale. They just don’t have enough women for that.

99
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,280
But the Party is already pivoting to\h
“encourage” people to have more children.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Earlier this year, Chinese premier Li Keqiang\h\h

101
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,400
talked about working to achieve\h
an “appropriate” fertility level.

102
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
Li didn’t say exactly what appropriate\h
fertility levels were, but here's a hint.

103
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,440
State propaganda slogans are telling\h
couples to “have children for the country.”

104
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,840
Yes, lie back and think of China.\h
That’s probably not going to work.

105
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
There are other ideas that might work better.\h\h

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,360
“Measures now being discussed range\h
from extending maternity leave\h\h

107
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,560
to encouraging people to have a second child\h
with straight cash incentives or tax breaks.”

108
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,080
But possibly not. Similar\h
policies have been tried in Japan,\h\h

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,840
Taiwan, and South Korea\h
after their birthrates fell.\h\h

110
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,760
Things like baby bonuses, new parental leave\h
policies, and expanded preschool availability.

111
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,560
And they didn’t work.

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,920
But if incentives don’t work, the\h
Chinese Communist Party can use\h\h

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,440
propaganda and social pressure. One example\h
of this is the “leftover women” campaign.

114
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,080
That’s a propaganda campaign aimed at shaming\h
educated women into getting married earlier,\h\h

115
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,280
by trying to convince them that if they’re\h
over 27 and unmarried, no one will want them.

116
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,040
And it’s worked, in the sense that it’s\h
given Chinese women in their mid-20s\h\h

117
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
crippling anxiety about their futures.

118
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,640
But it’s clear that this type of campaign will\h
continue. There have been recent proposals\h\h

119
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,080
that “The government should create a ‘good\h
matchmaking environment and encourage women aged\h\h

120
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,040
between 21 and 29 to give birth during\h
this optimal reproductive period.’”

121
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Are we sure that these guys should be\h
creating a good matchmaking environment?

122
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,720
What are they going to do, make\h
a communist version of Tinder?

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,640
But don’t worry, because it’s not just about\h
matchmaking. It’s also about getting married\h\h

124
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
younger. There have been proposals that the\h
government should lower the marriage age to 18.

125
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
But what happens if propaganda\h
and social pressure,\h\h

126
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
not to mention the matchmaking prowess\h
of the Politburo, still isn’t enough?

127
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
Remember what I said earlier about\h
how the one-child policy created\h\h

128
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,240
a massive family planning bureaucracy in China?

129
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,560
Well some experts “fear that officials will\h
reorient the gigantic family-planning bureaucracy,\h\h

130
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,520
which enforced restrictions through forced\h
abortions, sterilizations and steep fines,\h\h

131
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,840
toward pushing women to have children.”

132
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,880
Hey, the Chinese Communist Party loves\h
quotas. The two-child policy could turn\h\h

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,960
into a requirement instead of\h
a restriction. Problem solved.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
I’m not saying this is going to happen\h
immediately. But if other policies\h\h

135
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,560
don’t “persuade” people to have enough\h
children, this will happen eventually.

136
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
And that’s because this is how the\h
Chinese Communist Party functions.\h\h

137
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,200
They govern through mass political campaigns that\h
depend on local officials filling their quotas.

138
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,480
And they already have the\h
family planning system in place.\h\h

139
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,320
Instead of monitoring employees’ menstrual cycles\h
to make sure they don’t get pregnant, state-owned\h\h

140
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,240
companies could monitor employees’ menstrual\h
cycles to make sure they do get pregnant.

141
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Instead of fining people\h
who have too many children,\h\h

142
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
local governments could fine people\h
who don’t have enough children.

143
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Instead of forced abortions, the\h
Communist Party could limit birth control.\h\h

144
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
Actually, they already did that once, under Mao.

145
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,920
Which led to a population explosion,\h
which led to the one-child policy,\h\h

146
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,960
which led to the population decline, which...hmmm.\h\h

147
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,520
It’s almost like giant authoritarian\h
social engineering policies don’t work.

148
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,960
But I wouldn’t want you to think that everyone\h
would be forced to have more kids under the\h\h

149
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,840
Chinese Communist Party’s pro-natal policy.\h
Ethnic minorities will still get sterilized.

150
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,360
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from a fan\h\h

151
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,400
who supports China Uncensored on\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

152
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,400
Rswaggs asks:\h

153
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,240
Why doesn't China invest into fish farms?\h
They must be cheaper than artificial islands.

154
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,320
This was a question from our episode on how\h
China’s fishing fleets are wrecking the oceans.

155
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
Well, Rswaggs, China does invest in fish farms.

156
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
In fact, they have massive floating fish farms\h\h

157
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
that provide two-thirds of\h
the world’s farmed fish.

158
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
If you eat tilapia, it’s probably from China.

159
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,760
The bad news is, that China has had food\h
safety issues with their fish farms.\h\h

160
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Farmers tried to deal with polluted water by\h
feeding fish pesticides and antibiotics that\h\h

161
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,640
are illegal to use in other countries like the US.\h
Which led to import bans on Chinese farmed fish.

162
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,520
In recent years, Chinese fish farmers\h
have tried to clean up their practices.

163
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,400
But even in China, consumers who have enough\h
money prefer wild-caught fish from North America,\h\h

164
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,240
Australia, and other places that\h
they think of as having clean water.

165
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Meanwhile, I’ve stopped eating tilapia.

166
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
Thanks for your question, Rswaggs.

167
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,840
