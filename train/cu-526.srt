1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,070
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,800
pre-trade war trash talk is over.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,390
Now China and the US are in the ring,

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,100
and they’re going to trade is blows.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,860
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,429
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,529
Well, we told you so.

8
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,490
As far back as January of 2017.

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,930
How likely is it that Trump is going to

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,859
impose tariffs on China?

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,369
Oh he’s definitely going to do it.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,369
Really?

13
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,480
100 percent.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,570
And last Friday,

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,510
Trump did it.

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,020
In a White House statement,

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,190
Trump said that the US would implement a 25
percent tariff

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,170
on $50 billion of goods from China that contain
I

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,710
ndustrially significant technologies.

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,730
On the same day,

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,550
the Office of the United States Trade Representative—

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,690
the agency responsible for implementing the
tariffs—

23
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,430
issued a news release.

24
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,540
It was helpfully titled

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:06,200
“USTR Issues Tariffs on Chinese Products
in Response to Unfair Trade Practices.”

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,740
Just in case people thought they might be
issuing tariffs

27
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,680
in response to, I don’t know,

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,300
that terrible Chinese movie Operation Red
Sea.

29
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,500
With the announcement,

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,900
the US Trade Representative published a long
list of 1,102 products

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,420
that will be hit with tariffs starting July
6.

32
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,700
That list includes stuff we all use every
day,

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,470
like can-sealing machines, centrifuges and
Klystron tubes?

34
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,440
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,140
The tariffs don’t include consumer goods,

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,530
like mobile phones and TVs?

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,140
Well, that’s great news.

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,780
Looks like American consumers will still be
able to enjoy

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,979
Wal-Mart’s everyday low prices.

40
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,820
And Wal-Mart’s everyday low standards for
Chinese suppliers.

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,950
But just because the new tariffs don’t cover
consumer goods

42
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,340
doesn’t mean they’re not a big deal for
both countries.

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,640
Most of the goods on the tariff list are related
to China’s

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,489
Made in China 2025 strategic plan to dominate

45
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,659
hi-tech industries like robotics, aerospace,
and industrial machinery.

46
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,120
The Made in China 2025 plan is designed to
drive

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,780
future economic growth for China,

48
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,459
in large measure at the expense of the US.

49
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,849
And a lot of these products were made after
China

50
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,760
stole American technology.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,819
In some cases, the Chinese military simply
hacked in,

52
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,090
stole it, and gave it to local Chinese firms.

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,129
In other cases,

54
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,450
it was because of a Chinese law that US companies

55
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,840
doing business in China were required to

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,870
set up joint ventures with Chinese firms

57
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,780
and then hand over their intellectual property.

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,659
That’s why when announcing the tariffs,

59
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,450
Trump said the the US “can no longer tolerate

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,799
losing our technology and intellectual property

61
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,739
through unfair economic practices.”

62
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,260
One thing Trump hopes to achieve with the
tariffs

63
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,829
is to force China to change parts of its state-led
economic system

64
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,029
that put foreign companies at a disadvantage.

65
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:13,909
But with Friday’s publication of the tariff
list,

66
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:17,040
Chinese state media got seriously triggered.

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,849
An editorial in the Communist Party’s official
People's Daily

68
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,730
said the US was instigating a trade war

69
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,230
and that it would be “extremely destructive
to global trade,

70
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,669
economic globalization, multilateral trade
systems

71
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,049
and global production supply chains.”

72
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,280
State-run Xinhua News said,

73
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,700
“The wise man builds bridges,

74
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,099
the fool builds walls.”

75
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:47,730
Anyway, state-run CCTV announced that China
would fight back.

76
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,040
“China has no choice but to fight back strongly

77
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,809
to resolutely protect its national interests

78
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,079
and the people's interests,

79
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,249
and to resolutely defend globalization

80
00:03:58,249 --> 00:04:01,159
and the multilateral trading system.

81
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,150
We will immediately publish levies

82
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,069
of the same scale and same strength.”

83
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,269
And they did.

84
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:09,609
China announced essentially tit-for-tat tariffs,

85
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,019
also worth $50 billion dollars.

86
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,950
Some of which are also going into effect starting
July 6.

87
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,739
China’s tariff list on US goods includes

88
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,489
soybeans, beef, and whiskey.

89
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,020
There goes my plan for opening a tofu steakhouse-

90
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,300
slash-whiskey bar in downtown Beijing.

91
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,460
But is a trade war really going to be destructive

92
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,760
as China is making it out to be?

93
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, probably not for the US.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,909
Experts say economic growth in US

95
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,550
won’t be affected all that much.

96
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,310
Rich Sega, global chief investment strategist
at Conning,

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,060
says Chinese tariffs won’t be “enough
to derail

98
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,220
strong growth in the US because lower taxes

99
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,560
and deregulation outweigh trade.”

100
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,569
As for China,

101
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:59,289
this could be a big hit to their Made in China
2025 plan.

102
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,190
And that doesn’t even include the additional

103
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,050
$100 billion dollars in tariffs that Trump
has threatened.

104
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,810
What’s that, Shelley?

105
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,180
Trump just announced a possible additional

106
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,590
$200 billion in tariffs?

107
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,810
It’s a good thing China can always just
fake its GDP data.

108
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,900
What’s interesting about the $200 billion
number

109
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,039
is that China doesn’t import that much from
the US.

110
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,290
So while they can match a 50 billion dollar
tariff,

111
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,970
they can’t match a 200 billion dollar one.

112
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,360
What they could do instead

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,970
is go after US companies in China

114
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,990
and make it harder for them to continue manufacturing

115
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,960
and doing business there.

116
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,590
But if they all end up leaving,

117
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,380
who would the Communist Party steal technology
from?

118
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,240
The Chinese regime’s rhetoric against US
tariffs

119
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,490
is hitting a fever pitch because if we do
ever reach an all out trade war,

120
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,979
China is at a disadvantage.

121
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,820
Typically in a trade conflict,

122
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,219
the side that exports the most stuff

123
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,280
has the most to lose.

124
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,820
However, some analysts think that China

125
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,300
could withstand a trade war better than most
exporters,

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,659
since they don’t have to worry about things
like elections,

127
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,449
or public pressure, and they control their
own media.

128
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,789
I guess there are some benefits to being an
authoritarian state.

129
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,409
But regardless of what happens,

130
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,629
there’s one clear winner:

131
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:23,780
Me!

132
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,110
Nothing gives the media delicious fodder

133
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,349
like international conflict.

134
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,389
Especially when it involves...Klystron tubes.

135
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,990
Ok, so maybe it’s not going to be that interesting.

136
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,250
But what do you think?

137
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,630
Leave your comments below.

138
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,630
And before you go,

139
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,219
it’s time for me to answer another question

140
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,430
from a China Uncensored fan on Patreon.

141
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,340
Ivan A. asks:

142
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,120
“Do you think all Western Liberal Democracies

143
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,210
shoulder much off the blame for

144
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,300
China's continual terrible human rights record

145
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,499
by their reluctance to apply ‘Ethical Foreign
Policies’

146
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,430
over the last 20 years?”

147
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,430
Great question, Ivan.

148
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,940
I’ll put it this way:

149
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Back in the 90s,

150
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,919
US president Bill Clinton and a lot of other
countries’ leaders

151
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,360
pushed to allow China to get into the World
Trade Organization.

152
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,491
The idea, they told us, was that

153
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:16,580
“Sure, things are bad in China.

154
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,900
But if China opens up its market,

155
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,379
then democracy and human rights will follow.”

156
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,759
Doesn’t that sound wonderful?

157
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,879
But...if that was really their main motivation

158
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,819
to open up trade with China,

159
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,319
then why weren’t those same politicians
also pitching

160
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
to open up trade with Cuba and North Korea?

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,879
Oh wait, those countries don’t have

162
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,350
a billion potential consumers.

163
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,509
Yeah, so basically rich companies and powerful
politicians

164
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,409
were willing to look the other way when it
came to

165
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:50,150
the Communist Party throwing Falun Gong practitioners

166
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,509
into labor camps in exchange for access to
that sweet,

167
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,249
sweet China market.

168
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:58,270
Wait, how did politicians defend that again?

169
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,039
“I don’t believe that we will have more
influence on China

170
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,569
by giving them the back of our hand.”

171
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,370
Yeah, and how did that work out?

172
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,800
So are Western liberal democracies to blame?

173
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Yes.

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,969
For sure.

175
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,810
But the Chinese Communist Party is even more
to blame.

176
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,400
They’re the ones that are actually throwing
innocent people in labor camps.

177
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,590
They took advantage of foreigners’ greed
to grow China’s economy.

178
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,669
Without foreign investment,

179
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:28,379
the Party would have collapsed a long time
ago.

180
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,810
But with all the intellectual property theft,

181
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,660
the Western liberal democracies got their
just deserts

182
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,040
for exploiting unfairly cheap Chinese labor.

183
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,700
The Party came out on top.

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,800
Of course, now there’s trade tariffs

185
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,120
designed to tackle unfair trade practices.

186
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,060
And those could hurt both the Chinese Communist
Party

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,970
and greedy foreign companies.

188
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,160
But if the tariffs work the way the White
House believes they will,

189
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,880
that may change things for the better in the
long run.

190
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,690
I guess you’ll have to keep watching China
Uncensored

191
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,100
to see what happens.

192
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,440
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. Thanks for watching!

193
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,360
Thanks for watching.

194
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
At the end of most episodes,

195
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,000
