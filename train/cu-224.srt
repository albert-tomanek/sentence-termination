00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,350
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,460
nothing speaks to the glory of Tibetan Buddhism

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,300
like core socialist values.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,000
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,179
You know, no one cares as much about religion

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,970
as the officially atheist Chinese Communist
Party.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,320
That is, they care about getting involved
with religion.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,849
Whether it’s taking down Christian crosses,

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,460
banning reincarnation without government permission,

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,949
or supporting Tibetan Buddhism...

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,349
Wait, what?

12
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,700
Just last week,

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,300
the second highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,620
held a 12-day ritual that hasn’t been performed

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,840
basically since a failed Tibetan uprising
50 years ago.

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,750
It’s called the Kalachakra ritual.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,489
Kalachakra means wheel of time,

18
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,829
I learned from state-run Xinhua

19
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,510
that is reporting on it for
some reason.

20
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,329
The ritual is performed to activate dormant
enlightenment

21
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,789
for the 100,000 people,

22
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,640
including thousands of monks,

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,580
who were apparently allowed to freely gather
to practice Tibetan Buddhism.

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,360
It’s so extraordinary, you just gotta capture
the moment!

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,170
The ceremony was conducted by the Panchen
Lama,

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,490
basically the number two guy in Tibetan Buddhism
after the Dalai Lama.

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,590
As state-run CCTV puts it,

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,729
“The 11th Panchen Lama is the spiritual
leader of Buddhism in Tibet.”

29
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,040
In other words this guy is a big deal.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,260
No, seriously.

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,630
Xinhua even interviewed a living Buddha about
it.

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
“Although the panchen Lama is only 26 years
old,

33
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,240
he has become a very great master in Tibetan
Buddhism.”

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,050
Wow, if a Living Buddha says this Panchen
Lama guy is so great on state-run media,

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,330
you know, there’s probably something really
wrong here.

36
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,729
And you’d be right.

37
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,829
This guy is not the real Panchen Lama

38
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,600
that is, if you go by the traditions of Buddhism
instead of communism.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,380
The way it works in Tibetan Buddhism

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,860
is the Panchen Lama helps find the reincarnation
of the Dalai Lama and vice versa.

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,200
The previous Panchen Lama died in 1989.

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,250
Six years later,

43
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,840
the Dalai Lama named this boy as the next
one.

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,290
But the Chinese regime said,

45
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,910
naw, this is the guy

46
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,660
and the Dalai Lama’s chosen one conveniently
disappeared

47
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,270
along with his family

48
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,080
and haven’t seen seen since.

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Don’t worry,

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Chinese officials say they’re fine.

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,090
So now, the Communist Party loves to bring
this guy out

52
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,300
and show how much the Party supports Tibetan
Buddhism

53
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,390
and how much their appointed lama is beloved
and respected.

54
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,490
And what’s his message to Tibetans?

55
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,280
“I did not waste time studying over the
past two decades.”

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,980
That’s right, Tibetans,

57
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,780
stay poor and uneducated!

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,850
Great message!

59
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,910
What else you got?

60
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,330
“Core values of socialism,

61
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,170
such as harmony, honesty, and equality,

62
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,690
have their corresponding contents in Sutra.”

63
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,900
Ohhh hoooo man.

64
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,310
Yeah.

65
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,430
So how does the Dalai Lama feel about this?

66
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,100
Well, he doesn’t want it to happen to the
next Dalai Lama.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,010
That is, he doesn’t want the Communist Party
to pick his successor.

68
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,680
That may be why he said he the lineage of
the Dalai Lama should end with him.

69
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,650
More specifically, he said,

70
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,130
“There is no guarantee that some stupid
Dalai Lama won’t come next,

71
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,630
who will disgrace himself or herself.

72
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,780
That would be very sad.

73
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,040
So, much better that a centuries-old tradition

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,500
should cease at the time of a quite popular
Dalai Lama.”

75
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,350
To which the Chinese Communist Party responded,

76
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,560
no you have to reincarnate.

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Why do they care?

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,090
Don’t they consider the current Dalai Lama
a dangerous separatist?

79
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,120
Well, yes, but when he dies,

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,700
their Panchen Lama gets to pick the next Dalai
Lama.

81
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
And don’t be surprised if that one also
makes comparisons

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,340
between core socialist values and Tibetan
scripture.

83
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,040
So what do you think about Beijing’s Panchen
Lama

84
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,380
and the state-sponsored Kalachakra ceremony?

85
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,100
Leave your comments below.

86
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,480
And please, share this video with anyone who
may still think

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,160
the Chinese regime has eased up on religion.

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,290
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,500
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you in the bardo.
