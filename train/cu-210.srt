1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,960
China retreats on the Indian border

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,440
The WHO’s latest scandal

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,160
And Estonia is kicking butt!

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,720
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h
YouTube is demonetizing us all the time.\h\h

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,960
But thanks to the support of viewers like\h
you on the crowdfunding website Patreon,\h\h

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,720
I can still bring you these episodes.\h
Head over to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored,\h\h

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,720
and for as little as a dollar an episode,\h
you can help me continue to make the show.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
And now, this week’s China news headlines.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
For a long time, China has been\h
secretly building up military camps\h\h

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,960
along the Indian border. Well, not so secretly\h
that they can't be seen with satellites.\h

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Here’s a bend in the river on May 22 last\h
year, and here’s that same spot on June 23.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
Here’s another Chinese military\h
camp in the same region.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,120
And here’s yet another Chinese military camp.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,880
Meanwhile, this satellite image shows\h
Chinese-built villages along a different\h\h

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,720
section of the Indian border, made at some\h
point between August 2019 and November 2020.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,800
But the latest satellite images show China\h
is actually emptying some of these camps.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,600
These images from Maxar Technologies\h\h

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,480
show the banks of Pangong Tso, a\h
glacial lake in the Ladakh region.\h

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,800
Last week, China and India agreed to\h
withdraw troops. Wait, China is actually\h\h

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:44,320
keeping its promise? Is that because India\h
is successfully staring down China? Or is the\h\h

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,240
People’s Liberation Army pulling back because\h
they have some other plan up their sleeves?

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,280
Last week, I told you about the World Health\h
Organization investigation into the origin\h\h

24
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,680
of the coronavirus. Yes,\h in January\h
the Chinese Communist Party let the WHO\h\h

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,800
into Wuhan to investigate—only a year late!\h

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:14,720
But that’s not a complaint from the WHO. No!\h
WHO investigators praised Chinese officials.\h

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
Even though China refused\h
to hand over important data.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Get this. Apparently the WHO team\h
said their Chinese counterparts “were\h\h

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
frustrated by the team’s persistent\h
questioning and demands for data.”

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,080
I know, you probably think that asking\h
questions and looking for data is\h\h

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,640
a normal part of an investigation.\h
But not in China it isn’t. In China,\h\h

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,720
the government tells you upfront what\h
the result of your investigation will be.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
Which is what they tried to do to the WHO team.\h\h

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,960
“Chinese officials urged the W.H.O. team to\h
embrace the government’s narrative about the\h\h

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,840
source of the virus, including the unproven notion\h
that it might have spread to China from abroad.”

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Meanwhile, it’s not surprising the US says\h
it still hasn't ruled out a lab accident\h\h

37
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
origin for the coronavirus. Because\h
China hasn’t been transparent.

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,240
Which is frankly an understatement.\h
Saying China hasn’t been transparent\h\h

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,920
is like saying it’s a little hard\h
to breathe in the vacuum of space.

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,320
Meanwhile, more countries are voicing\h
support for a global “pandemic treaty.”\h\h

41
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,320
It would require all countries to\h
share data about disease outbreaks.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,640
Which sounds great. Until you remember\h
how well China honors its treaties.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,880
But I wouldn’t want to be too\h
hard on Chinese officials.\h\h

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,040
Or else they might be too\h
hard on American officials.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,240
What I mean is, “In China, some U.S. personnel\h
have complained about being subjected to\h\h

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,000
an anal swab test for the\h
coronavirus by Chinese authorities.”

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,560
You know, the Biden Administration has talked\h
about reciprocity in US China relations, so,\h\h

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,320
maybe Xi Jinping will have something to look\h
forward to on his next state visit to Washington.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,440
FYI, the Chinese artist who made\h
that image has been arrested.

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
And coming up after the break, key\h
members of President Biden’s cabinet\h\h

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
had Chinese business connections.

52
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
Welcome back.

53
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
This week, the Republican Study Committee\h\h

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,360
released a report criticizing members of Biden’s\h
cabinet for Chinese business connections.\h

55
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,400
For example, Secretary of State Antony\h
Blinken co-founded a company called\h\h

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,120
WestExec Advisors, which “helped U.S.\h
universities raise money from China\h\h

57
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,880
without running afoul of\h
Pentagon grant requirements.”

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
Other Biden cabinet members who worked for the\h
firm include Director of National Intelligence\h\h

59
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
Avril Haines, and Press Secretary Jen Psaki.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
Now working for WestExec is\h
not evidence of any wrongdoing.\h\h

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,960
A lot of people have had Chinese business\h
connections, including the previous president.

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,520
What doesn’t look great is,\h\h

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,360
when WestExec recently scrubbed all their China\h
work from their website. Why would they do that?

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,320
However, Secretary of State Blinken said\h
something this week that I’ve actually been\h\h

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,640
saying on the show for a while now—that upholding\h
American values is the way to counter the Chinese\h\h

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,960
Communist Party. In an interview with NPR he\h
said, “We’re in a position of strength when\h\h

67
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,400
we actually stand up for our values, when\h
we don’t say it’s okay for China to create\h\h

68
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,080
concentration camps for Uyghurs in Xinjiang\h
or to trample on democracy in Hong Kong.”

69
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,320
And you know, values are nice. But it’s also\h
nice when values are backed up with warships.\h

70
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
The Biden Administration has conducted its second\h\h

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,440
freedom of navigation operation\h
in the South China Sea.

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,320
The Biden Administration has talked about working\h
with US allies to counter the Chinese Communist\h\h

73
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:13,440
Party. Which sounds great. But the challenge is,\h
the Communist Party’s influence over those allies\h\h

74
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,600
may be growing. China has for the first time\h
overtaken the US as Europe’s main trading partner.

75
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,200
And as we’ve seen from a\h
recent China EU trade deal,\h\h

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,280
there are times when the EU puts\h
profits before human rights.

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,680
But there is some good news. Last week\h\h

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,800
I mentioned the UK would no longer\h
broadcast Chinese state-run CGTN.\h

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Well now, CGTN is going to have to stop\h
broadcasting in 32 countries across Europe.\h

80
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,320
What happened is, as a spillover from\h
old broadcast rules from the 1980s,\h\h

81
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,520
CGTN’s UK license had also allowed it\h
to broadcast across Europe. But now\h\h

82
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,400
with its UK license revoked, CGTN can’t\h
broadcast in any European country—unless\h\h

83
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,800
one of them decides to be stupid\h
and give CGTN a new license.

84
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
And unsurprisingly, this week the\h
Chinese regime decided to retaliate.\h\h

85
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,200
By banning the BBC in China.\h

86
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,440
Which gave my favorite state-run media the Global\h\h

87
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,400
Times the inspiration for this\h
really funny political cartoon.

88
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,280
The broadcaster Radio Television\h
Hong Kong also blocked the BBC.\h\h

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
Because Hong Kong is fully part of China now.

90
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,720
But don’t worry, most people\h
in China won’t even notice.\h\h

91
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,280
“In China [the BBC] is largely restricted\h
and appears only in international hotels\h\h

92
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,080
and some diplomatic compounds, meaning\h
most Chinese people cannot view it.”

93
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
And while Chinese state-run TV had been\h
broadcast in Europe for nearly two decades—most\h\h

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
people in Europe won’t even notice it’s gone,\h
because they never bothered to watch it.

95
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
There is a growing awareness about the\h
threat of the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

96
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Particularly when it comes to espionage.

97
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,800
“In the past week, intelligence agencies in the\h
Netherlands, Finland and Canada expressed deep\h\h

98
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,360
concern about China's espionage and\h
political influence in democracies.”

99
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,160
And Estonia warns of a "silenced\h
world dominated by Beijing".

100
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,680
Wow, good on Estonia. Estonia used to be a major\h
front in the Chinese Communist Party’s attempt\h\h

101
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,920
to invade Europe. But as I\h
mentioned in a recent episode,\h\h

102
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,000
China’s Eastern European strategy is failing.

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,040
And you may remember the ethnically\h
Tibetan NYPD officer who was accused of\h\h

104
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,840
spying on Tibetans for the Chinese Communist\h
Party. Well, there’s been an update.

105
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,280
“The New York City police officer\h
accused of being a spy for China,\h\h

106
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,640
has been granted a release on $2 million\h
bail. But Baimadajie Angwang tested\h\h

107
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,200
positive for COVID-19 last week and may have to\h
wait for a negative test before he's released.”

108
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
My heart breaks for him.

109
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,400
And now I’ll answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army.\h\h

110
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,240
Those are the fans who support the show\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

111
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,680
Phil Morais Jr says, “I work in Fiji and the\h
Chinese government have part of the contract\h\h

112
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,800
to build new roads. They build the new road and\h
then in 12 - 18 months they have to repave the\h\h

113
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,720
whole thing again. Australia has the other\h
contract and those roads are fantastic.”

114
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Ah, Phil is responding to an episode\h
about China’s Tofu Construction.\h\h

115
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,920
Basically, that’s when things get built on\h
the cheap, officials skim money off the top,\h\h

116
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,960
and the construction projects collapse.\h
Often with some devastating results.

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,840
And since China is building things\h
around the world, that’s not good.\h\h

118
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,880
But Phil, don’t complain about the Chinese built\h
roads that need to be repaved after only a year.\h\h

119
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,080
It’s not as bad as how in Kenya, a 12 million\h
dollar bridge collapsed before it even opened.

120
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,840
You might want to watch out for those\h
new Chinese built bridges in Fiji though.

121
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,280
Thanks for writing Phil.

122
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:31,840
And thank you for watching. Once again\h
I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
