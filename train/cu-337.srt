1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,771
A classical Chinese dance show.

2
00:00:02,771 --> 00:00:06,099
The Chinese Communist Party hates it

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,020
And they’ll stop at nothing to shut it down

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,100
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,390
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,390
Shen Yun.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,519
It’s a classical Chinese dance show.

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,660
You’ve seen Shen Yun advertisements everywhere.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,689
Everywhere.

10
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,820
And I do mean everywhere.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,169
Why so much advertising?

12
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:29,890
In part, because the Chinese Communist Party

13
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,399
has spent enormous resources

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,620
trying to suppress the show—

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,920
threatening theaters,

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,420
slashing tour bus tires,

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,680
denying visas, and much more.

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,140
Why does the Communist Party consider this
show

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,230
such a threat?

20
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,880
Matt Gnaizda sits down with Shen Yun

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,980
Master of Ceremonies Leeshai Lemish to learn
more.

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,620
Leeshai, thanks for joining me today.

23
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:53,629
My pleasure.

24
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,570
So the Chinese Communist Party really, really
does not like Shen Yun.

25
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,250
They, for example, sent thugs to slash tour
bus tires.

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,390
.I mean, what's up with that?

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,940
Yeah, so Shen Yun is a performance of traditional
Chinese culture,

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,470
but it's based in New York.

29
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,020
That's the first thing they don't like.

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,730
Here is a celebration of Chinese culture and
it's not under

31
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,170
the Chinese Communist regime's monopoly.

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,940
Second, our mission is to revive traditional
Chinese culture.

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,290
So this is 5,000 years of civilization stories,
history,

34
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,130
different virtues that are brought out through
the stories.

35
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,370
And this is a culture that they spent decades,
about 80 years,

36
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,370
trying to destroy.

37
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,010
Cultural revolution, killing off different
people,

38
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,780
smashing statues, burning books.

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,100
And here we are,

40
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,240
"Hey, this is a celebration of this culture
that you destroyed.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,210
Let's bring it back so people can experience
what traditional Chinese culture really was

42
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,210
about."

43
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,930
And this is really intimidating to them, because
if people reconnect with that culture,

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,750
be it in China or people outside of China,

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,020
realize what Chinese culture really was about
all this time,

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,580
then all of a sudden have some major legitimacy
questions,

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,760
because they brought in a regime that's Soviet,

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,580
it's Marxism, atheism, Darwinism, Maoism,
all this stuff.

49
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,620
Xi Jinping thought on socialism that Chinese
characteristics-

50
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,440
Chinese characteristics, very different from
these ideas,

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,710
like in Journey to the West of a spiritual
elevation.

52
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
And so-

53
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,710
Right.

54
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,710
Yeah, exactly.

55
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,170
Which is really a metaphor for our spiritual
path.

56
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,590
And also fighting bad guys.

57
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,310
Fighting bad guys is good.

58
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,950
Anybody can connect with that.

59
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,690
We actually get a lot of correspondence from
China,

60
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,500
people in China, wanting us to perform there.

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,590
So here we are a company that's celebrating
Chinese culture and we can't perform in China.

62
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,470
And not only that, they're trying to stop
us from performing outside of China.

63
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,330
It's interesting you talk about the culture,

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,740
because there's this article I read in the
Chinese state-run Global Times,

65
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,860
and it basically claims that Falun Gong is
using Shen Yun to push some sort of propaganda,

66
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,010
which was funny because the Chinese Communist
Party

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,840
has been in recent years trying to use Chinese
culture to push their propaganda.

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,070
Right, they have.

69
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,070
Are they jealous?

70
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,660
Well, they have all these Confucius Institutes,
they do all these different things,

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,230
and the reality is, and you probably have
talked about this before,

72
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,610
Confucius institutes, in the name of Confucius,

73
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,500
which was considered number one bastard during
the cultural revolution,

74
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,990
and so they spent all this time smashing Confucius
statues,

75
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,471
and just slandering him-

76
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,500
The whole criticize Confucius thing.

77
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Yeah, like propaganda.

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Yeah.

79
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
It was a big deal.

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
And they're like,

81
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
"Oh yeah, we're all into Confucianism."

82
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,280
But what they actually teach there is there
wasn't really a Tiananmen massacre,

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,800
Falun Gong, they're really anti-China, and
oh, by the way,

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
this is what Chinese characters are.

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,370
It's not traditional taste characters, it's
a simplified version,

86
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,400
so it's easier for you and lacks any content,
but that's okay.

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,701
So they'd been trying to do this whole propaganda
blitz

88
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,660
and really have a monopoly on Chinese culture.

89
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,080
And it's very different type of Chinese culture
that they're talking about

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,940
then what you guys in Shen Yun are doing,
right?

91
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Right.

92
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,970
So Shen Yun was established about 13, 14 years
ago, end of 2006,

93
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,830
with the mission of reviving the real traditional
Chinese culture.

94
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,810
It started off because Chinese New Year would
come around,

95
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,959
usually during the winter, January, February

96
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,940
and people would want to have a performance.

97
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,640
And there was this performance that was done
in China

98
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,410
and on CCTV television, or in the embassies
here outside of China,

99
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,059
and these are just propaganda blitzes of,

100
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,430
"Hey, the Communist Party is great."

101
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,370
And everything was literally red.

102
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,779
It was all about how great China is under
the Communist Party.

103
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,300
And so Chinese people overseas would go like,

104
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,350
"This does not represent us, or our culture,

105
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,680
or celebrating anything.

106
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Let's have our own show."

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,830
And so they would start their own performance.

108
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,110
And this grew, and the first one was here
in Madison Square Garden in 2004 and in 2005,

109
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,390
and Radio City 2006 was my first time hosting
the performance.

110
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,390
And eventually we said,

111
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,500
"Well, let's have our own performance and
really bring this culture back to life."

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,620
And so doing that through classical Chinese
dance, and music, and so on.

113
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,330
And so this is really an idea, like let's
go back into 5,000 years of civilization

114
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,690
and bring any story, any literary figure,
any character, be it [inaudible]

115
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,710
or the real story of Mulan, who by the way,
did not speak English it turns out or-

116
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,710
Really?

117
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,710
Yeah, it's amazing.

118
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,430
And she didn't have a pet lizard dragon also.

119
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,430
Really?

120
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,430
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,840
Well, it's shocking what you discover when
you actually go into.

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,509
But yeah, stories from Journey to the West,

123
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,340
Outlaws of the Marsh, Romance of the Three
Kingdoms, the creation,

124
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,389
Legends of the Creation [crosstalk].

125
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,330
So these are all being brought into Shen Yun
as different performance?

126
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,330
Right.

127
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,081
So Shen Yun is saying let's revive this and
bring this back.

128
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,310
And so it has the effect of first, people
outside of China,

129
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,589
no matter how familiar with Chinese civilization,

130
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,710
they get a sense of, okay, this is a very
different perspective on Chinese culture

131
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,539
and this is actually something you can go
back and you can read [inaudible] poems

132
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,610
from the seventh century and get a sense for
this.

133
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,930
We actually have a story about a famous poet
from that period and how he got inspiration.

134
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,020
You have novels like Journey to the West,
and Romance of the Three Kingdoms

135
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,139
and the characters there, and it's not just
stories.

136
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,189
You have a lot of good versus bad, and action,
and warriors,

137
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,479
and even supernormal abilities, and magic,

138
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,050
but you also have the virtues and the values
behind them.

139
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,349
Ideas of loyalty, and integrity, and faith,
and compassion, tolerance-

140
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

141
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,560
Integrity, compassion, these are not-

142
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,710
It's a little different from the Confucius
institutes.

143
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,960
From Communist Party culture, right?

144
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,669
Yeah, a little different.

145
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,839
So I can see why they're sort of intimidated
by Shen Yun.

146
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,729
Yeah, and the Falun Gong is another part of
that.

147
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:03,159
So Shen was started by Falun Gong practitioners.

148
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,219
A lot of our artists...

149
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,360
So Falun Gong was practiced all throughout
China.

150
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,539
You had people in every sphere.

151
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,619
Certainly you had workers,

152
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,819
and farmers, and different professions, but
then you also-

153
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:10,819
Right.

154
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,129
In the 1990s it was like you go to China

155
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:14,830
and there's just people practicing Falun Gong
everywhere.

156
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,830
Yeah.

157
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,499
And you even had people who were top party
members,

158
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,560
so they didn't see any conflict between being
a Falun Gong practitioner

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,699
and being a Communist Party member.

160
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:24,669
Like you could be a Republican or a Democrat
and practice say yoga or pilates.

161
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,529
It's just funny to think about that, like
from today's perspective.

162
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,539
Absolutely, yeah.

163
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:29,630
But they were also artists.

164
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,509
So you had choreographers, and composers,

165
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:34,059
and leaders of some of the best orchestras
in China.

166
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,619
And some of them came outside of China, and
they said,

167
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:36,619
"Well, we have these skills.

168
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,619
What do we do with them?

169
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,539
Because we'd like to bring back this culture.

170
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,939
We like to tell people the story of what's
happening to Falun Gong in China,"

171
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,479
so this company was founded.

172
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,849
And so these people brought this together,

173
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,680
and then also as part of the performance alongside

174
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,580
the stories are the traditional culture part

175
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,409
and ethnic dances, folk dances and so on.

176
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,439
You also have stories on what's happening

177
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,210
to Falun Gong practitioners in China today.

178
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,300
There's maybe a couple of pieces.

179
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,059
We have about 20 stories every year, 20 different
dances.

180
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,039
Maybe a couple of them are about the Falun
Gong story,

181
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,710
and you have a sense of, okay, so these are
people meditating in the park,

182
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,770
and that maybe is how the story starts, or
it's a family, and then boom,

183
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,469
they get pounced on, there's persecution that
erupts seemingly out of nowhere.

184
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,590
And then they get thrown in jail and it's
basically

185
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,059
a battle of their faith in the face of the
persecution,

186
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,729
and finding inner courage, and finding eventually
hope.

187
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:22,080
And so this story is now a story they've been,
the CCP, Communist Party,

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,979
has been trying to hide all these years, now
20 years of persecution.

189
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,960
They said, "Oh, this is not happening.

190
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,069
Just a small group of people, and we're treating
them very nicely,

191
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,649
and this is all made up."

192
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,129
And here we actually have it on stage at Lincoln
Center,

193
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,300
Kennedy Center, all over the world, and we
have VIPs, CEOs,

194
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,889
congressman in the audience, and they say,

195
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,680
"Oh, this is actually," and it's depicted
very beautiful.

196
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,880
Well but this is your problem, because you're
taking

197
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,219
traditional Chinese values and making them
relevant to today.

198
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,219
Absolutely.

199
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,219
And it's-

200
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:48,219
Right?

201
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,219
This is the worst possible thing you could
do

202
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,219
from the Communist Party's perspective.

203
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,219
Yeah.

204
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,810
Because there's a sense that also this is,
in a way...

205
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,409
A big part of this is like, oh, this is what
human culture really was like a long time

206
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,409
ago,

207
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,409
not just in China, but around the world.

208
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,310
Yes, it has this Chinese flair to it, and
Chinese costumes,

209
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,990
and all the stories, but these ideas of loyalty,
integrity, compassion,

210
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,939
these are things that are common universally.

211
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,660
And so I think people are surprised when they
come to see

212
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,020
the performance that it's not just a journey
into Chinese culture and history,

213
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,370
but actually there's something really deep
that resonates with people,

214
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,910
and inspires them, and uplifts them.

215
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,800
So I want to get back to what the Communist
Party

216
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,339
has done to stop Shen Yun.

217
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,599
And one of the things actually in the same
Global Times articles,

218
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,110
They said that they wanted the Shen Yun performers
names to be

219
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,050
“made public so they will be expelled from
mainstream Chinese communities.”

220
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,759
Basically they want overseas Chinese,

221
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,969
like here in America,

222
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,930
to dox Shen Yun performers and cancel them.

223
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,810
Like, is this actually happening?

224
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,399
Yeah, to actually ostracize them or even blacklist
them,

225
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,820
not allow them to get jobs.

226
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Yeah.

227
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,740
So for example, the Chinese Student Scholar
Association, CSSA,

228
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,529
they're in Columbia, they're in every big
university across the country and around the

229
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:58,529
world,

230
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,940
they have been very active under the auspices

231
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,760
of the Chinese Communist Party's embassies
and consulate.

232
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,550
Actually, the head of the CSSAs in these universities
actually kind of a liaison

233
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,570
with the embassy and they get directives from
them.

234
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,580
So they'll bring them out to welcome a leader
and maybe get paid to do so,

235
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,889
and they'll go and protest Shen Yun,

236
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,880
and maybe they're getting paid to do that.

237
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,589
And so they actually have been very active

238
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,149
in trying to target Shen Yun and trying to
stop us.

239
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,149
Now, not some-

240
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,450
So they get the Chinese student groups to
protest like a Shen Yun performance?

241
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,240
They get Chinese students who are here, have
to go back to China,

242
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,540
have family back in China, maybe even got
a scholarship to be here, and they say,

243
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,240
"We are representative of China.

244
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
You have to follow our orders.

245
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,720
Here's what you're going to do or else you
are going to be in trouble."

246
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
But-

247
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,940
I'm just imagining some foreign governments
trying

248
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,529
to get people to protest Hamilton.

249
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,529
Right?

250
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:43,529
Like that's crazy, right?

251
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,589
No, I've never heard of that happening,

252
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,040
but for us it's kind of a reality.

253
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,019
From day one when we first started in 2006

254
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,690
we've had all these various phenomena.

255
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,510
So one thing that they do is that kind of
a protest.

256
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,420
Not very common anymore because it's really
not successful.

257
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,700
Another thing they do is they try to pressure
family members

258
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
of performers who are still back in China.

259
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,200
So for example, my MC partner.

260
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,839
I'm on stage, I introduce the pieces,

261
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,709
there's a lady who introduces them with me.

262
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,649
She was from Beijing, and her parents were
still in Beijing,

263
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,569
and they would get weekly visits from National
Security Bureau saying,

264
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:10,569
"We know what your daughter-

265
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,569
Inside China?

266
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,569
In Beijing.

267
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,240
They would just come and sit down for a chat
in the living room and say,

268
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
"We know what your daughter is doing.

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,350
We don't like it.

270
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,980
Have her stop doing it or else everybody's
going to be in trouble."

271
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,620
We had an erhu soloist, so this is a person
who plays a two-string erhu,

272
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,639
like the Chinese violin, and her husband was
jailed while she was with Shen Yun.

273
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,639
And so this is some-

274
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,520
For her work in Shen Yun.

275
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,740
We don't really know exactly how,

276
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,520
but it was definitely for his beliefs.

277
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,029
They're both Falun Gong practitioners and-

278
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:36,120
So there's also that.

279
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
It's like a double-

280
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,959
There's also that, and we have-

281
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,959
A double crime, right?

282
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,959
Yeah.

283
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,959
And we have people,

284
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:42,959
members of the company,

285
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,959
who actually experience persecution.

286
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:44,959
They're not the vast majority,

287
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,959
but we have people who were tortured in China,

288
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:46,959
we have people who've lost family members,

289
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,970
we have a dancer whose dad was killed when
she was an infant and thrown in a ditch.

290
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,550
So this persecution story is very relevant
to people,

291
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,040
but I think what we try to portray on stage
is also just the sense of hope and belief.

292
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,740
And the same with Shen Yun.

293
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,910
These performers have been through this now
for 14 years and it's never stopped us.

294
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,089
We've grown from one company to now up to
seven companies,

295
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,500
a tour simultaneously, and we've put up with
a lot.

296
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
So for example, the first year when we were
touring,

297
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,810
they would send other performing arts companies
to try to compete with us.

298
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,540
So they send like 60 something companies around
the world,

299
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,661
and we perform in a theater,

300
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,949
and they'd be across the street or right next
to us at the same time.

301
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,940
And we'd go to a certain country and they
say,

302
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,019
"Yeah, we've already seen Shen Yun."

303
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,019
Say, "What do you mean?

304
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,019
We just got here."

305
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,019
Like, "No, no.

306
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,019
We saw it last week,"

307
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,800
and it turns out that they got tickets for
this other show.

308
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Wait, so you're saying that there is

309
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,870
a Chinese Communist state-sanctioned knock-off?

310
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,920
I've never heard of that kind of thing.

311
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,080
They paid companies to go out just to compete
with us.

312
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,310
And in some cases actually we would move the
show date because of scheduling issues

313
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,480
and they would move their show day to correspond
to it.

314
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,620
And they did this in LA,

315
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,199
across the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion did it,

316
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,770
they sent out companies here to New York.

317
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,770
It was just done, the first couple years especially.

318
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,699
Then it didn't work because the theaters were
empty for them,

319
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:52,779
and people weren't buying tickets,

320
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,760
and there was no competition, and the Shen
Yun brand got established.

321
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,269
So then they started pressuring theaters to
not allow us to perform.

322
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:00,399
So they would write the theaters or even knock
on the door.

323
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,399
Who would write to the theaters?

324
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,399
The Chinese consulates and embassies.

325
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,540
We had this in LA, in New York, in Sydney,
and Munich.

326
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,050
Name us a big city where we've performed,
they've done it.

327
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,970
Is the Chinese consulate even allowed to operate
like that on U.S. soil?

328
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,160
Well, that's a diplomatic question.

329
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,050
I think what's worse is sometimes they will
have

330
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,379
other people do the bidding for them,

331
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:19,180
which is really illegal, because then you're
operating for another regime.

332
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Right.

333
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,590
Like I read about them slashing tires in,

334
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,290
like the tour bus tires in Ottawa.

335
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,290
Yeah.

336
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,980
So what happened was our driver would do a
pre-trip inspection

337
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,079
and he discovers a big cut on the front tire.

338
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,290
So he takes it to the shop, they say,

339
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,420
"Oh, this cut is really interesting."

340
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,420
So what's interesting about it?

341
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,120
Well, it was cut in such a way that the tire
would not deflate right away.

342
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,370
It was just several layers of the rubber had
been cut

343
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,440
so that on the highway at high-speed when
it expands,

344
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,220
then the tire would explode and maybe you
lose control of the vehicle.

345
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,290
At the very least you're going to be stalled
for a long time.

346
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,290
So and that happened.

347
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,589
The very next day we got news of this,

348
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:53,160
I was actually in Memphis,

349
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,060
and we were going to travel to Little Rock.

350
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,360
So we inspected our truck and we discovered
a very similar cut in our truck.

351
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,139
Of course, we just had the tire replaced.

352
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:00,699
And then that night our bus,

353
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,720
in a rain storm driving late at night from
Memphis to Little Rock,

354
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,730
had a flat tire and we were stopped on the
side of the road for a while.

355
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,959
So this went on for some time and then they
started trying to-

356
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,339
Did you know that the Chinese consulate was
behind this?

357
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:11,379
We can't prove it, of course.

358
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,800
They're not going to have the ambassador himself
with a badge saying,

359
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
"Here, I'm going to cut your tire now."

360
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,220
It could just be a coincidence, like all these
tire questions.

361
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,629
It could be a coincidence that we had three
tire slashes in 48 hours.

362
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:20,100
I mean especially in Canada, I mean it's full
of criminals there.

363
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,699
They're very nice though, very polite.

364
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:22,699
Yeah.

365
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,209
And then they start trying to tamper with
our gas tanks.

366
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,120
One case, it was in Texas, like 3:00 AM,

367
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,959
this other pickup truck shows up next to our
bus,

368
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:31,649
and then starts trying to do something with
the gas tank,

369
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,189
and then we have security now watching 24
hours a day.

370
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,580
So then he drives off, and eventually it's
a chase,

371
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,680
and they're calling the police, they're chasing
him.

372
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,040
These are volunteers, mind you.

373
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
And the police is coming over,

374
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,880
and the guy abandons his pickup truck and
runs away.

375
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,999
So whatever he was trying to do was so important
that he was willing

376
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,569
to give up his pickup truck and just give
run.

377
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,089
And this happened Atlanta.

378
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,490
We had people put corrosive material on a
promotions car in Chicago.

379
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,120
These are actually life-threatening type of
things.

380
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,230
Or would cut the cable so that you can actually
have an accident.

381
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,939
But then we have people spying on us,

382
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,480
waiting for us in hotel lobbies, people trying
to take pictures,

383
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,439
people trying to use universal remote controls

384
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:07,300
to shut off our projection in the middle of
a show,

385
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
protests outside.

386
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,200
The funny thing with the protests is they'll
show up and it's like clockwork.

387
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,709
Like the people who are doing this are clearly
not very motivated.

388
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:15,300
They show up at 9:00 o'clock and they leave
at 5:00 PM.

389
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,050
The audience members are coming in, but they're
gone.

390
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,269
They took their banners and left.

391
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,589
And this just happened just now in South Korea.

392
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,600
We were performing there and it was the same
group.

393
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,420
They would travel from city to city.

394
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,079
Who actually is that motivated to protest
a performing arts company?

395
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,470
They would take two, three weeks off from
work

396
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,430
and travel with professionally-made banners
from city to city,

397
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,430
just to follow us around.

398
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,430
But then they leave at 5:00 PM.

399
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,430
Leave at 5:00 PM, yeah, yeah.

400
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,029
I mean you got to take a break.

401
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,290
Protesting is tough work.

402
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,290
It's tough work standing there.

403
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,870
It's pretty cold sometimes too.

404
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,620
So this is not just a one-off thing.

405
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,160
This is like a constant...

406
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,100
They're sort of like state-coordinated type
effort it sounds like.

407
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah.

408
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,410
One thing that they did for example was they
would send emails to the theaters.

409
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,339
So all these various tactics before are not
working.

410
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:55,829
They would send these letters to theaters
saying,

411
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,060
"Don't allow Shen to perform."

412
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
And here in the States people are like,

413
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
"What are you talking about?

414
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
This is America.

415
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
We perform whatever we want."

416
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,339
And some [inaudible] would report this to
the FBI.

417
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,040
In some places like Eastern Europe, like Romania,
Moldova, Ukraine,

418
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
this has a bit of traction because they're
very susceptible to corruption.

419
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
As-

420
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,689
So those theaters have canceled the performances.

421
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:12,839
We've had performances cancel.

422
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,639
We showed up in a theater in Moldova after
a three day bus trip from Turkey,

423
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,209
and we showed up at the theater, and we get
to the hotel late at night,

424
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,009
we show up at the theater next morning for
setup, and they say,

425
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:22,009
"You can't perform.

426
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,060
Your show has been canceled."

427
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,790
And then all the media shows up,

428
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,819
and they do all these interviews,

429
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:26,819
and we find out what's going on.

430
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:29,649
Later on, somebody from town hall actually
found me at a coffee shop,

431
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,699
me and a couple of dancers, and told me,

432
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:32,880
"Here's the backstory of what happened.

433
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,069
We actually got visits from the Chinese embassy
on a regular basis.

434
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,540
They asked us at town hall to pressure them
to cancel the performance."

435
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,769
Then we met with the theater manager

436
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,759
and they brought in the foreign minister.

437
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:48,250
So they basically used a foreign ministry
connection between the PRC and Moldova.

438
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,769
Moldova is a very, very small and poor country
in Eastern Europe, mind you.

439
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:52,959
Very beautiful, don't get me wrong.

440
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,050
But what is the diplomatic incentive here
for China to be that close to Moldova?

441
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,660
They get the foreign minister to do the bidding
for them.

442
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,270
They sit in the theater, you got your foreign
minister,

443
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,980
your Chinese ambassador, your mayor,

444
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,360
and this other executive and the theater manager
saying,

445
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,709
"Cancel the performance."

446
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,230
And this executive from town hall was saying,

447
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,230
"Do not cancel it.

448
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,390
You have a contract.

449
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,319
You have no legal backup if you do this."

450
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,680
And they said, "Well, we have to do it."

451
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,839
What they often uses the carrot and stick.

452
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,399
If you cancel Shen Yun we will bring some
companies from China to perform instead.

453
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,870
If you don't cancel Shen Yun you'll never
get a performance from China,

454
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,889
you're not going to get a visa.

455
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,040
So we had a case in Berlin where the guy who
was working there,

456
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,970
the theater manager, received a similar visit
from the Chinese embassy,

457
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,310
this was a couple of years ago, and they did
the same thing.

458
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,660
"You will not be allowed to visit China personally

459
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,819
and we will not bring any Chinese company
to perform in your theater."

460
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:39,259
This is the Chinese consulate telling them
this.

461
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,839
Chinese embassy in Berlin, yeah, yeah.

462
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:41,839
And-

463
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,839
So how did he react?

464
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:43,839
Well, he was from Eastern Europe,

465
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,839
so he kind of knew the deal with communism,

466
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,629
and he actually experienced persecution himself,
and he said, "Goodbye."

467
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:49,850
And that's what happens most of the time,

468
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,470
especially in strong democracies.

469
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,519
Like the theaters just say,

470
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,190
"We're not going to be intimidated by this.

471
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,190
We're going to run the show."

472
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,190
No, no.

473
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,040
In fact, yeah, they have an opposite effect
on them.

474
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
So for example, in Australia,

475
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,470
we were performing in Canberra our first year
on tour,

476
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,050
and after the show we walk outside the theater

477
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,921
and we see two parliament members standing
there.

478
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:10,100
And they say, "Actually, we got a letter from
the Chinese embassy saying,

479
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,170
'Do not come see the show.'"

480
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,430
And were like, "We hadn't heard of Shen Yun.

481
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,430
What is this?

482
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,430
This isn't interesting.

483
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,430
Let's go check it out."

484
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,430
And all parliament members got the letter
and a bunch of them were there.

485
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,720
Just could have had their meetings there and
everything.

486
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,660
Czech Republic, one time a TV station got
a letter saying,

487
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,290
"Do not interview Shen Yun, do not promote
them."

488
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,300
Like, Shen Yun, what's that?

489
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
It's coming to town.

490
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Okay, we weren't planning on interviewing
them.

491
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,970
It's like, okay, well now we're going to call
them.

492
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,990
So then they got our dancer and our concert
master

493
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,640
wanting to do this interview in the Czech
Republic,

494
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,910
and they said, "This is Czech Republic.

495
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,390
Maybe this is how you do things in China.

496
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,890
Here we decide who will and who will not be
in our show,

497
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,740
who and who will not be on stage,

498
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,020
and we're very glad to have you,

499
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,330
and good luck with your performance."

500
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,820
And this is really the phenomena worldwide.

501
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,300
It's kind of like free advertising.

502
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,890
But the thing is they do some things that
are very tricky.

503
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,970
So for example, they have the China Daily,

504
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,930
is the mouthpiece of the Communist Party in
English.

505
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,990
It's for general consumption.

506
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,090
You can buy it here on the street in New York
City.

507
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,700
They actually had a paid insert that they
put in the Washington Post

508
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,090
and other newspapers in the U.S. and around
the world

509
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,280
pretending to be an article by the Washington
Post criticizing Shen Yun.

510
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,850
It's the China Watch section.

511
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,010
I've seen that in the papers.

512
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,010
Yeah.

513
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,330
So you think, "Oh, the Washington Post has
a cool China section."

514
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,330
Right.

515
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,330
And it's like little font.

516
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,330
It's like paid advertisement,

517
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,330
like at the very bottom [crosstalk].

518
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,940
Yeah, it's a very little font.

519
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,010
But it's formatted like an article.

520
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,590
It's like a 3D or something, yeah.

521
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,590
It looks like a regular article.

522
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,570
So unless you're aware of this dynamic

523
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,610
and you're aware of all the forces behind
the scenes trying to do this,

524
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,670
you're not going to pick up on that.

525
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:28,350
And they're using this sort of state-sanctioned
China watch section to criticize Shen Yun.

526
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,350
Yeah.

527
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,000
And the title was something like Shen Yun
is a Blasphemy to the Arts

528
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,050
or something very over the top communist sounding.

529
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,230
And then this was Washington Post, it was
the Wall Street Journal,

530
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,570
it was in Melbourne, it was in Nashville,
it was in London Telegraph, all over the place.

531
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,830
And so you think, "Oh, all these newspapers
really don't like Shen Yun,"

532
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,240
and then they would send emails to theaters-

533
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
But it's not like that they don't like Shen
Yun.

534
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,540
They're just happy to take lots and lots of
money in exchange for pretending it's,

535
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,620
oh, it's not my problem if it criticizes Shen
Yun, right?

536
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,640
Yes, money turns out to be the currency.

537
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Funny that.

538
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,290
Yeah, but what we've really seen is that it
doesn't really affect us that much.

539
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,460
The recent thing that they're doing is they're
trying to kind of tweak,

540
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
and I can't prove this,

541
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,300
but it seems like there's an attempt to mess
with Google's rankings of Shen Yun articles.

542
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,310
So if you go to Google and Google Shen Yun,
it will come up with...

543
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,540
You know how they have suggested fields for
things to ask,

544
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,630
you have to search for?

545
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,861
They'll be like, what's the deal with Shen
Yun?

546
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:16,861
Is Shen Yun a cult?

547
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:18,840
These kinds of really bizarre things that,
you know,

548
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,250
where's your Shen Yun reviews?

549
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,580
Where is Shen Yun performing arts?

550
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,660
These are very basic things.

551
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,840
So it's not like the Shen Yun website.

552
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
It's like the [crosstalk].

553
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,500
Shen Yun website is still there.

554
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,490
Maybe there's a paid ad for [inaudible] website
still at the top.

555
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,300
Then Wikipedia has a bunch of stuff.

556
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,600
Wikipedia is this whole other battlefield.

557
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,440
There's constant people trying to put negative
stuff about Shen Yun at the top,

558
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,471
and an editor's going in, and they fight over
it,

559
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:38,471
and it goes back and forth.

560
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:40,090
You can see it on a daily basis.

561
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,460
Wikipedia fights, you can never win those.

562
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,640
Yeah, I guess it's a war of attrition.

563
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,850
And then there's these few articles

564
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,070
that had negative reviews about Shen Yun.

565
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,160
We did perform in front of a million people
last year.

566
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,100
I'm on stage, I see the audience reaction.

567
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,260
I know how positive it is.

568
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,080
I walk through the lobby, I talk to people,
I've seen interviews with people.

569
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,680
But yeah, there's some negative articles out
there.

570
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,630
Not that many, but then somehow they're always
at the top of Google.

571
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,240
If you go to the Yahoo, you go to Bing, nowhere
to be found.

572
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,090
Yeah, there's just a bunch of these-

573
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,200
It's just funny because there's been so much
news recently of Google

574
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,180
using people to actually control what goes
in the search results

575
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,530
instead of using the algorithm.

576
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,530
So here's what I don't know;

577
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,550
I mean I use Google like everybody else to
find things.

578
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,740
Maybe use a different search engine, but-

579
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,910
Just try Baidu.

580
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,910
Sure.

581
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,450
Yeah, just go to the Chinese embassy, you
know, .gov,

582
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,440
and see what their perspective on everything
is.

583
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,670
But I don't know if it's Google doing this.

584
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,050
If there is somebody on the inside in Google
or is somebody in China

585
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,670
who's figured out some sort of algorithm

586
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,780
to mess with the search engine optimization
rankings.

587
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,240
They're doing inbound linking.

588
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,990
You know how they post comments linking different
things?

589
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,760
They have the whole 50 Cent army doing things,

590
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,680
which we know they've used for many years

591
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,480
to attack whoever they happen to not like
at a time.

592
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
And they've hacked our website.

593
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,820
They hacked our website one year at the very
beginning of ticket sale season.

594
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Oh, good.

595
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
So the Chinese hackers are also in it.

596
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,560
It's like everything from the slashing tires,

597
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,590
to the writing letters to the theaters,

598
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:06,540
to the getting overseas Chinese students to
protest, to the hacking.

599
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,190
It's just like every aspect of this type of...

600
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,180
I guess in other contexts we often call it
subversion, right?

601
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,460
Yeah, yeah, basically.

602
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,730
And then if you take a step back, it's like,
why?

603
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,410
I mean, you do not have bigger issues to deal
with?

604
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,540
This is what's concerning the performing arts
company outside of China?

605
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,980
You're clearly a huge threat.

606
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,220
I mean, that's a lot of resources.

607
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,220
Yeah, apparently.

608
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
And it's not even-

609
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
I mean, they haven't done that to China Uncensored,

610
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,700
so obviously we're not nearly as much of a
threat.

611
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,211
Well, maybe you'll join the party one day,

612
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:32,040
and certainly if we're communicating over
email

613
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,620
they now know about you as well.

614
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,620
Oh, that's nice.

615
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,680
I think they probably discovered you before,

616
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,030
but the thing is it is a threat to them,

617
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,010
but the reality is that our performers, me
personally,

618
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,220
I've been to China,

619
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,520
I spent time studying and working throughout
Asia,

620
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,350
I would love to bring a show to China.

621
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,350
And I'm the white guy in the show.

622
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,910
I mean, most of the performers are I think
Chinese,

623
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,260
from China, from around the world.

624
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,250
What their dream is to bring the show back
to China,

625
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,800
because it's about celebrating traditional
Chinese culture,

626
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,280
a culture that had almost been entirely lost
because of the cultural revolution,

627
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,890
the anti-five, and anti-three, and anti-rights,

628
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,320
and all this stuff that they did there.

629
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,300
And now many generations of people

630
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,830
who have been brought up under the regime

631
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,390
not really knowing what traditional Chinese
culture is about,

632
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,200
and people that are heroes are portrayed as
villains.

633
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,340
And here we have a show that's bringing out
these stories,

634
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,380
and actually, this is what this person was
actually about,

635
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,760
and here's the virtue that this person represents
in Chinese history,

636
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,953
and want to share it with them.

637
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:22,740
So you're subverting 70 years of communist
cultural destruction.

638
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,980
At the very least 70 years.

639
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,940
But do you really think they're going to let
you into China?

640
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,580
So people who are in China and can afford
to,

641
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,020
they will fly out to Taiwan especially, but
to Japan,

642
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,970
Vancouver, LA, wherever they can go.

643
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,330
And we even had people from the communist
parties bureaucracy

644
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,390
come to us after a show.

645
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,860
Like they'll tell somebody through in the
lobby.

646
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Really?

647
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
They'll secretly come to Shen Yun?

648
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,140
They go “jia you,” which means we support
you, good luck.

649
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,600
After a show, you know, we were sent here
to spy,

650
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,910
but we really like your show, so good luck.

651
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,060
We had dancers from China who just admired
the standards of Shen Yun,

652
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,420
especially now that we're really established,

653
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,570
they'll come and try to learn and try to mimic
stuff,

654
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,620
is of course the highest form of flattery,

655
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,880
but also some people try to defect,

656
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,470
and so they're really on the guard for that.

657
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,540
They try to block performance from leaving
China to join us.

658
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
So it's just a matter of time.

659
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,690
And on the website we get constant emails
from China saying,

660
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,270
"Hey, will you please come perform in China?

661
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,270
We can't wait.

662
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,510
Can we buy a DVD?

663
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,550
We really are rooting for you guys."

664
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,600
And our performers can't wait to go there
to perform,

665
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
but this is the reality right now,

666
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,630
that if you really want to see a performance
of traditional Chinese culture,

667
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,270
you have to go to Lincoln Center,

668
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,270
or you have to go to Taiwan.

669
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,220
You can't go see it this way in Beijing.

670
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,610
You guys have like a,

671
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,570
I saw something like 150 cities in the next
six months.

672
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,570
Yeah.

673
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,420
So we have seven groups that tour around the
world at the same time.

674
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,540
Each company will do 25, 30 cities.

675
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,630
Usually we're somewhere for two, three days,

676
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,900
sometimes two or three weeks, depending.

677
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,780
But yeah, it's a 150 cities or so.

678
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,580
Which is to say, the Chinese Communist Party

679
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,610
is not very good at stopping you.

680
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,160
No, they're not.

681
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
And like I said, it's free advertising,

682
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
and then they got more and more work.

683
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,080
The first year we were just one group with
30 cities.

684
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,500
That's 30 letters with multiple copies to
send out.

685
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
I mean, that's a lot of work.

686
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I mean, you're really just creating so much
work

687
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
for those poor communist officials in China.

688
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,820
Well, it's providing employment for all those
people

689
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,820
posting the comments I guess.

690
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,820
That's true.

691
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,820
You're a job creator.

692
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Yeah.

693
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,820
There you go.

694
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,820
Well, good luck on your upcoming tour-

695
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Thank you.

696
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,930
...and make sure to check those bus tires.

697
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,930
Absolutely.

698
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,250
There's a new tactic every year, but it doesn't
stop us.

699
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,120
We really want to just go perform and we really
hope that

700
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
we can perform in China someday,

701
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
but in the meantime,

702
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
we'll just put up with this stuff.

703
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
All right, well thanks for joining me.

704
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,860
Thank you.
