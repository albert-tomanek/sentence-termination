1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,749
The world is freaking out about Huawei

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:05,040
The Chinese telecom giant

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,440
Many countries are labelling it a national
security risk.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,600
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,009
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,470
In December, at the US’s request,

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,860
Canada arrested the now infamous CFO of Huawei,

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,120
Meng Wanzhou.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Why?

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,400
Well, according to China’s ambassador to
Canada,

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,400
white supremacy.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,440
Ok, to be fair,

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,660
the ambassador said that the white supremacy

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,630
wasn’t about arresting Meng,

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,699
it was about arresting Meng and then complaining
about

16
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:40,190
the Chinese regime arresting two Canadians.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,289
Because if you respect the Canadian legal
system

18
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,670
but don’t respect the Chinese legal system,

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,839
that’s definitely because you’re a white
supremacist.

20
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,609
Or...maybe it’s because the Canadian legal
system

21
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:53,399
looks like this:

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,690
While the Chinese legal system

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,390
looks like this:

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,190
Yeah, even the Chinese ambassador

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,019
would rather be arrested under the Canadian
legal system

26
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,929
than the Chinese legal system.

27
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:06,960
He just can’t say that because he has to
go back to China,

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,020
and...he doesn’t want to get arrested there.

29
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,760
Now, what’s been lost amid the diplomatic
brouhaha

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,400
is the reason the US asked Canada

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,410
to extradite Meng Wanzhou in the first place:

32
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,890
that Meng and Huawei had tricked banks

33
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,710
into violating US sanctions on Iran

34
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,890
by using shell companies owned by Huawei

35
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,340
to secretly do business in Iran.

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,920
So when banks handled Huawei’s financial
transactions,

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,360
they were accidentally doing business with
Iran, too.

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,700
And after Meng’s arrest,

39
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,390
even more evidence has been found

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,950
tying Huawei to these companies.

41
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,200
Now countries around the world have known
for years

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,970
about some of the sketchy dealings of Huawei.

43
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,280
Not the least of which are shady connections

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,980
to the Chinese Communist Party

45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,770
and potential national security concerns.

46
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,410
But Huawei is also the world’s

47
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,750
largest telecommunications company,

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,060
which makes closing the door on Huawei

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,970
a little challenging when financial interest
is on the line.

50
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,100
So here are how 8 different countries have
dealt with Huawei.

51
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,239
Number 8

52
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,400
India

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,799
After the arrest of Huawei’s CFO,

54
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,069
India’s telecom export body requested

55
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,430
a ban on Huawei products for government services,

56
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,769
citing national security concerns.

57
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,400
But India’s telecom minister said the government

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,209
would not look into a ban.

59
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,900
I mean, you can’t ban a company

60
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,389
that could be building your country’s 5G
network, right?!

61
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:36,540
Huawei will be one of several companies participating

62
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,709
in trials to secure permission to build India’s
5G network.

63
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:41,959
Don’t worry,

64
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,659
an Indian official said they would put

65
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,139
all the necessary safeguards in place

66
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,440
before allowing access to core networks.

67
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,340
So India’s stance?

68
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,629
Officials are concerned about Huawei.

69
00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,340
But the have no plans to block Huawei from
government use,

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,040
or from their 5G network

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,959
Number 7

72
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:04,959
Germany

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,959
Germany’s technology watch dog

74
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,560
doesn’t think Huawei is a threat.

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
In fact,

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,909
all three of Germany’s major telecom companies

77
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,959
use Huawei equipment.

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,140
Later this year,

79
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,220
Germany will also be auctioning off contracts

80
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,159
to build its 5G network.

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,859
And Huawei wants to play a major role.

82
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:23,359
Nevertheless, some German officials have launched

83
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,019
a last ditch bid to convince the government

84
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,829
to ban Huawei from the 5G market.

85
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,019
But for now, the German government as a whole

86
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,510
is happy to have Huawei everywhere.

87
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,540
Number 6

88
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
France

89
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,430
When it comes to the war for 5G networks,

90
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,269
France has not surrendered.

91
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,819
According to Bloomberg,

92
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,150
France is considering targeting Huawei as
a security concern.

93
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,189
France is also looking to build 5G networks.

94
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,849
And it’s moving to make parts of its telecoms
infrastructure

95
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,340
inaccessible to Huawei.

96
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,590
“France’s largest telecoms operator, Orange,

97
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,609
won’t use Huawei equipment in its 5G network.”

98
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,180
Other major telecoms have said they’ll look
into similar moves.

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,439
But as of now France has no internal government
ban on Huawei.

100
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,439
Number 5

101
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,709
Japan

102
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,229
The nation that brought us Gundams

103
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:18,579
has decided it doesn’t need Huawei,

104
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,290
at least as far as government contracts go,

105
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,389
because of security risks.

106
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,099
The new Japanese guidelines don’t specifically
mention Huawei,

107
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,349
but are designed to prevent leaks of sensitive
information.

108
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,560
The guidelines cover,

109
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,350
“purchases of personal computers,

110
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,419
servers and telecommunications equipment

111
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,660
by the government and Self-Defense Forces

112
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,400
over concerns that viruses embedded in the
equipment

113
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,450
could cause systems to fail or could leak
sensitive information,

114
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,820
including military operations, to China.”

115
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,009
Japan’s telecom carriers are also saying
no to Huawei.

116
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,830
So Huawei is not getting a lot of love in
Japan.

117
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,830
Number 4

118
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
The United Kingdom

119
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,120
Huawei is also interested in the UK’s 5G
network.

120
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,509
And a few days after Meng Wanzhou’s arrest,

121
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,819
Huawei agreed to address

122
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:11,370
the British government’s security concerns.

123
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,330
However, a major British telecom company,

124
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,330
BT Group,

125
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,509
said it won’t use Huawei equipment for its
core 5G network

126
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,819
and has also begun removing Huawei equipment
from its 4G network.

127
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,270
MI6—British intelligence—

128
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,389
has singled out Huawei as a potential security
risk.

129
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,610
But officially, Huawei is not banned

130
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,069
for government officials or 5G networks.

131
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,069
Number 3

132
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,930
New Zealand

133
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,169
Just days before Meng’s arrest,

134
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,490
New Zealand banned Huawei from the nation’s
5G network,

135
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,920
citing “significant national security risks.”

136
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,909
New Zealand’s intelligence agency

137
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,520
also rejected a proposal from Spark,

138
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,940
one of the country’s biggest telecom carriers,

139
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,580
to use Huawei gear in its 5G network.

140
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,130
Given that the Chinese regime is influencing
New Zealand

141
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,240
‘at every level of society’,

142
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,909
It’s pretty impressive that New Zealand

143
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,860
is coming out strong against the use of Huawei.

144
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,360
Number 2

145
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,729
Australia

146
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,750
Australia is also very concerned.

147
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,840
Back in August,

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,050
Australia banned Huawei

149
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,370
and another major Chinese telecom company,
ZTE,

150
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,240
from building its 5G network.

151
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,930
The initial statement targeted firms

152
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,189
“who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial
directions

153
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,699
from a foreign government,”

154
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,310
but did not mention Huawei or ZTE by name.

155
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,840
I mean, it could be about any company, amirite?

156
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,660
Except that it’s pretty obvious,

157
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,310
and also an Australian government official
told Reuters

158
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,610
that it was in fact targeted at Huawei and
ZTE.

159
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,500
So Australia, also coming out strong.

160
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Number 1

161
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
The United States

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,930
Amurica has always been number 1.

163
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,970
Especially when it comes to raising concerns
over Huawei.

164
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,640
In fact, this whole case with Meng Wanzhou

165
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,759
came out of investigations into Huawei leadership

166
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,680
that the US government began way back in 2010.

167
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,199
And during those investigations

168
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,740
“F.B.I. agents grew concerned that company
officers

169
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,830
were working on behalf of the Chinese government.”

170
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,830
Meanwhile US lawmakers have been calling Huawei

171
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,780
a security risk since at least 2012.

172
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,530
And laws restricting Huawei

173
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,530
from equipping government agencies

174
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,430
began in 2013.

175
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,870
Last year “six major U.S. intelligence heads—

176
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,090
including the FBI, CIA, and NSA—

177
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,520
warned Americans against using

178
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,370
products and services from Huawei.”

179
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,050
And the US has been pushing other countries
to follow its lead.

180
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,900
And more of Huawei’s shady dealings are
coming to light,

181
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,360
like Poland arresting a Huawei executive

182
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,560
for spying right before we recorded this episode.

183
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,550
And more and more countries are beginning
to pay attention.

184
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,550
So America:

185
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,060
We’re number 1...

186
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,419
at blocking Huawei.

187
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,560
So what do you think about Huawei?

188
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,069
Should it be banned or allowed in your country?

189
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,199
And are you watching this on your Huawei phone?

190
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,060
Leave your comments below.

191
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,870

so you get messages about new episodes.

194
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,430
But before you go.

195
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,440
Now it's the time when I answer a question

196
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,560
from a fan who makes China Uncensored possible

197
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,409
by contributing through the crowd funding
website Patreon.

198
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:22,979
William Adderholdt asks,

199
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,789
“I was surprised to read in the newspapers

200
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,319
that the Chinese government forcibly suppressed
observations

201
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,370
by Marxist student groups of Mao's December
26 birthday.

202
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,310
What is the government's official position
on Marxism and Mao,

203
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,019
and what is their actual position?”

204
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,539
Haha, that’s a good question.

205
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,530
In case you don’t know,

206
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,519
November saw a pretty big crackdown

207
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,829
on student Marxist groups in major cities
throughout China.

208
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,380
Now officially, the Chinese Communist Party

209
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,990
loves and venerates Marx and Mao and Lenin

210
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,200
and all the other greats of Communism.

211
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Except for Stalin.

212
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,190
It’s because of the mustache.

213
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,220
What is the Party’s actual position on Marxism?

214
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,230
I would say that it’s not that different

215
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,100
from their official position.

216
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,650
But the crackdown over the student Marxist
groups

217
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,050
isn’t over who believes in communism more,

218
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,050
the state or the students.

219
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,000
It’s over the fact that only the Chinese
Communist Party

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,420
is allowed to control communism in China.

221
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,560
If you’re going to protest in China,

222
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,040
doing it in the name of Marxism won’t protect
you,

223
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,670
because you’re organizing outside of the
party-state.

224
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,200
In the end, communism was never about creating

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,380
a better, more equal world.

226
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,310
That was just a facade to convince the masses

227
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,100
to overthrow the elite,

228
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,950
and ultimately give power to a small group
of

229
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,240
what turned out to be incredibly bad people.

230
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,260
Every country that implemented communism

231
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,590
quickly became a brutal authoritarian state.

232
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,110
So remember, the only people in communist
China

233
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,060
who can talk about overthrowing the elite
are...

234
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,720
the communist elite.

235
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Thanks for the question William.

236
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,260
And if you’d to have a shot at getting

237
