00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,240
China and North Korea are at war!

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,400
A war of words…

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,179
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,639
Chinese leader Mao Zedong once said

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,180
China and North Korea were as close as

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,020
lips and teeth.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,360
Well, it seems like someone

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,450
may have bitten their lip.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,770
China and North Korea appear to be fighting…

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,300
via their state-run media.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,160
A commentary from the state-run

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,730
Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA,

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,980
last week warned China that it should not

16
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,070
“...test the limits of [North Korea’s]
patience.”

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,940
In fact, China should thank North Korea for

18
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,250
“protecting peace and security of China,

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,430
foiling the U.S. scheme for aggression

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,030
by waging a hard fight in the front line

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,970
of the showdown with the U.S.

22
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,180
for more than seven decades.”

23
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,530
In fact, in fact,

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,250
China should really think about how its

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,330
“reckless act of chopping down

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,730
the pillar of [North Korea]-China relations”

27
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,160
could have "grave consequences."

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,880
Boom.

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,180
The point is,

30
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,460
North Korean state-run media

31
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,950
has put China in their crosshairs.

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,780
Now while that may seem shocking,

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
keep in mind,

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,350
usually when North Korean state-run media

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,060
put something in their cross hairs,

36
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,660
they do it literally.

37
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,610
This follows an escalating war of words

38
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,330
between China and North Korea,

39
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,590
proving once again

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,260
that the pen is mightier than the sword—

41
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,160
or at least than North Korea's failed missiles.

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,120
The Chinese Communist Party, for its part,

43
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,270
has been getting more and more unhappy

44
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,810
with North Korea.

45
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,229
Especially because it’s shown the world

46
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,130
that the superpower wannabe

47
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,210
can’t even rein in its little brother.

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,830
In February, the Chinese regime announced

49
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,060
that it would suspend all coal imports

50
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,330
from North Korea for the rest of the year.

51
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,330
State-run North Korean media

52
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,700
responded that China was

53
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,240
“dancing to the tune of the US.”

54
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,140
I mean, they didn't say China.

55
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,420
It just said “a neighboring country.”

56
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,670
It could have been any of the many countries

57
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,950
that neighbor North Korea.

58
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,560
But then my favorite Party mouthpiece, the
Global Times,

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,541
responded that even harsher sanctions against
North Korea

60
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,599
are in order.

61
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,599
Last month, it said

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,120
“The North Korea nuclear issue

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,200
is like a puzzle filled with bombs.”

64
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,010
In fact I believe we have video of someone

65
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,010
trying to deal with that nuclear issue.

66
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,560
Ok...Ok….Ok….

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,960
Nooooooooooo.

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,280
Kids these days

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,380
don't know what they're missing.

70
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,620
Anyway, the Global Times also said Beijing can

71
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,220
“strike back at any side

72
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,480
that crosses the red line.”

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Yeah?

74
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,770
Well North Korean media responded with

75
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,670
“Is it really that great to dance

76
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,720
to another’s tune?”

77
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,950
Is it, unnamed neighboring country?

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,620
Is it?

79
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,760
Actually that does look really great.

80
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,770
But moving on,

81
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,860
this month Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece,

82
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,110
the People’s Daily wrote that North Korea

83
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,070
“put itself and the whole region

84
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,890
into dire peril.”

85
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,379
And then North Korea’s state-run KCNA put
out the commentary

86
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,519
I mentioned in the beginning of the episode,

87
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,990
only this time, they actually did name names.

88
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,880
Yes, it’s China "dancing to the tune of the US".

89
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,340
Ohhhh.

90
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,190
That was for all of us who were confused

91
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,110
about which of North Korea’s many neighboring
countries

92
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,500
has recently changed its stance towards North
Korea.

93
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,970
Well, Global Times responded with

94
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,750
a not so subtle threat to end the alliance.

95
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,450
And then North Korea responded with...

96
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,810
wait, what's that, Shelley?

97
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,849
Ok, I'm being told we have video

98
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,290
of the latest exchange.

99
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,240
Let's take a look.

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,180
It has come to our attention

101
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,510
that a certain neighboring country

102
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,771
we were total BFFs with

103
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:56,800
through the shared blood of our martyrs,

104
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,720
has totally stabbed us in the back

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,599
by dancing with with an evil imperialist country

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,120
when they knew that we liked them first.

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,110
And we totally want our friendship bracelet
back.

108
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,020
This neighboring country is the WORST.

109
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,740
It has come to our attention

110
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:18,400
that the so-called DPRK

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,129
is being totally selfish with all of their
stupid nuclear weapons

112
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,779
because a certain leader is jealous that his
dad

113
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,020
got to hang with Bill Clinton

114
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,770
and he had to settle for Dennis Rodman.

115
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,779
Also you can have your stupid friendship bracelet
back

116
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,199
if you stop subtweeting us all the time,

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,150
that's so basic.

118
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,479
We don't understand what subtweeting or “basic” are,

119
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,409
but we would like to officially say that

120
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,580
we're rubber and you're glue.

121
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,750
And whoever smelt it dealt it.

122
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,360
Whoever denied it supplied it!

123
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,380
That went...in a different direction than
I was expecting.

124
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,389
But you know,

125
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,009
it is comforting that in this time of rising
tensions,

126
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,139
some forms of communication are universal.

127
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,619
But still, things between North Korea and
China remain...

128
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:03,919
not great.

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,169
And since China has recently told its citizens

130
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,939
to get out of Dodge...

131
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,629
...I guess the lips are curling back a

132
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,490
nd baring their teeth.

133
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,689
What do you think of the war of words

134
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,169
between Chinese and North Korean state-run
media?

135
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,529
Leave your comments below.

136
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:20,180
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

137
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,809
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

138
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,259
see you next time...

139
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,640
on the dance floor!
