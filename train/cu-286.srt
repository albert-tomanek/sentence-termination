1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,680
India and the US have signed a military pact.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,280
The CCP goes after political opponents abroad.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
And how one Chinese city is predicting\h
the outcome of the US election.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Welcome to China Uncensored I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,000
This week’s China news headlines.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,080
It’s something Beijing has\h
been terrified of for years.\h\h

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,440
India and the United States are\h
signing a landmark military agreement.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,080
Now before I tell you more, did you\h
know 60% of you who watch the show\h\h

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,960
aren’t subscribed? It would really mean a\h
lot to me if you hit that subscribe button.\h\h

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
It’s a huge help to the show and you can\h
always unsubscribe later if you want.\h\h

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,320
In fact, YouTube might just randomly\h
unsubscribe you even if you don’t want.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, so this military agreement between India\h
and the US is a big deal. The agreement is\h\h

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
called the Basic Exchange and Cooperation\h
Agreement for Geospatial Cooperation.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,640
It’s a mechanism for India and the US to share\h
military intelligence, particularly military\h\h

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,960
satellite surveillance. Which might be useful\h
in, oh I don’t know, the high mountain passes\h\h

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
of the Himalayas, where Chinese soldiers\h
have been encroaching on the Indian border.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and\h
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper\h\h

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,920
visited New Delhi this week. And Pompeo had some\h
strong words on the Chinese Communist Party.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,720
“Our leaders and our citizens see with increasing\h
clarity that the CCP is no friend to democracy,\h\h

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,640
the rule of law, transparency, nor to freedom\h
of navigation, the foundation of a free and open\h\h

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,200
Speaking of the Indo-Pacific, the\h
US, Australia, Japan, and India\h\h

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,360
will be participating in joint naval exercises\h
next month, held in the Indian Ocean.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,880
These four countries make up what’s known as the\h
Quad, an informal alliance basically aimed at\h\h

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,560
standing up to the Chinese Communist Party. That\h
alliance was conceived more than a decade ago,\h\h

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,320
but it did almost nothing because no one\h
wanted to challenge China at the time. But\h\h

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,920
boy have things changed in 2020. Now all four\h
countries are doing joint naval exercises.

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
Meanwhile Secretary of State Pompeo continued\h\h

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
his trip around Asia by bringing up the Chinese\h
Communist Party pretty much everywhere he went.

31
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
In Sri Lanka, he called the\h
Chinese Communist Party a predator.

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
In the Maldives, he said\h
that Beijing was illegally\h\h

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
occupying territory and damaging the environment.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,640
Pompeo also announced that the US will\h
be building an embassy in the Maldives.\h\h

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
It’s part of an effort to check\h
China’s influence in the region.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
In Indonesia,\h\h

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Pompeo said that the US would find new ways to\h
cooperate with Indonesia in the South China Sea.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,520
He also called China’s claims there “unlawful.”

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,320
In Indonesia, Pompeo also notably\h
brought up China’s religious repression,\h\h

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,960
especially their treatment of the Uyghurs.

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,240
"The Chinese Communist Party's\h
war against people of all faiths:\h\h

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,200
Muslims, Buddhists, Christians,\h
and Falun Gong practitioners alike.\h\h

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,080
The atheist CCP (Chinese Communist Party) has\h
tried to convince the world that its brutalisation\h\h

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,040
of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang is necessary\h
as a part of its counterterrorism efforts,\h\h

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,440
or poverty alleviation, depending on\h
which audience that they are speaking to."

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,800
Indonesia has the largest\h
Muslim population in the world.\h\h

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,600
And Pompeo asked Indonesians to not look away\h
from what the Chinese Communist Party was doing.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,880
"I know the CCP has tried to\h
convince Indonesians to look away,\h\h

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,160
to look away from the torments\h
your fellow Muslims are suffering.\h\h

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,640
I know the same CCP officials have spun\h
fantastic tales of happy Uighurs, eager\h\h

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,840
to discard their ethnic, religious and cultural\h
identities to become more modern and enjoy the\h\h

52
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,200
benefits of CCP-led development. When you hear\h
these arguments, I just ask you to do this:\h\h

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:29,440
Search your hearts. Look at the facts. Listen to\h
the tales of the survivors and of their families."

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,000
I can see why the Chinese Communist\h
Party really hates Mike Pompeo.

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,840
The YouGov-Cambridge Globalism Project did\h
a survey of 26,000 people in 25 countries,\h\h

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
asking them about the coronavirus.

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,840
The results? “China appears to have\h
comprehensively lost the international battle\h\h

58
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,680
for hearts and minds over its handling of\h
coronavirus with most people believing it was\h\h

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
responsible for the start of the outbreak and was\h
not transparent about the problem at the outset.”

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,160
This was the widest survey of global public\h
opinion about China’s handling of the pandemic.\h\h

61
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,600
The Chinese Communist Party\h
was not happy about the survey.\h\h

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,760
Mainly because they hate it when\h
anyone asks the people what they think.

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,240
Also bad news for the Party, they may have a\h
massive new coronavirus outbreak on their hands.\h\h

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,000
In Xinjiang. Where they have\h
those concentration camps.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,840
According to state media, there was one case\h
of the coronavirus in the city of Kashgar.

66
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:42,880
And so within two days, they tested everyone\h
in the city. All 4.75 million of them.

67
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,240
It’s hard to know what to make of this news.

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,160
China has definitely exaggerated its\h
ability to do mass coronavirus testing.\h\h

69
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
But it could also be that\h
the coronavirus situation\h\h

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
might be much worse than the Chinese\h
government is telling people. Or both.

71
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,680
Officially, “The testing drive has so far\h\h

72
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,200
identified 137 additional\h
cases—and all are asymptomatic.”

73
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,800
And when has the CCP ever lied about\h
coronavirus numbers? Don’t answer that.

74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
In July, there was an outbreak in\h
Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi. That\h\h

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,480
resulted in an insane lockdown, where officials\h
forced residents to take unproven Covid drugs.

76
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,880
Makes sense. If you’re already\h
ethnically cleansing the region,\h\h

77
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,000
might as well test out some\h
experimental drugs on them, right?

78
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,720
Speaking of crimes against humanity, organ\h
harvesting. It’s a thing Chinese state-run\h\h

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,400
hospitals do because selling dissidents’ organs\h
to rich people can make you a lot of money.

80
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,880
Well, at a recent online press conference,\h
a journalist from Taiwan raised the issue.\h\h

81
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
This was the US Assistant\h
Secretary of State’s response.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
“Well, I can’t think of a\h
more horrific human rights\h\h

83
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,360
abuse than stealing somebody’s liver. We\h
have had consistent reports of this. We\h\h

84
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,120
have actually looked into allegations\h
of it. And I encourage anybody who has\h\h

85
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:24,240
information that we could use to nail\h
this down to please be in touch with us.”

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,440
This follows the final ruling earlier this\h
year of the China Tribunal. It found that\h\h

87
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,760
“Forced organ harvesting has been committed for\h
years throughout China on a significant scale\h\h

88
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,920
and… Falun Gong practitioners have been one—and\h
probably the main—source of organ supply.”

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,560
And “In regard to the Uyghurs the Tribunal\h
had evidence of medical testing on a scale\h\h

90
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,280
that could allow them, amongst other\h
uses, to become an ‘organ bank.’”

91
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,160
Why haven’t you heard more about that?\h\h

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Well, according to former New York Times\h
journalist Didi Kirsten Tatlow who submitted\h\h

93
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,720
testimony to the China Tribunal, her editors\h
discouraged her from reporting about the issue.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,040
In her testimony, Tatlow says that her editors\h
believed that the Chinese state was no longer\h\h

95
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,400
harvesting organs from prisoners. She was told\h
that there was “nothing new” to the story.

96
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,320
And that people who believed this was\h
happening to prisoners of conscience\h\h

97
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,840
were “on the fringes of advocacy.”

98
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,480
I mean, why anger the Chinese authorities and\h
put your entire company's China bureau at risk,\h\h

99
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,880
just to cover one story, right?

100
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,840
Ironically, the Chinese government eventually\h
expelled the New York Times anyway.\h\h

101
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,760
For unrelated reasons.

102
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Even today, the medical community is mostly\h
turning a blind eye to forced organ harvesting.

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
Well gosh, if they have a blind\h
eye, they should go to China!\h\h

104
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
I hear you can get great cornea\h
transplants there, no questions asked.

105
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,480
And stay tuned after the break, because Chinese\h
leaders are deciding the future of China.

106
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,960
Welcome back!

107
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,000
China’s Communist leaders met behind closed doors\h
this week to discuss their 14th 5 year plan.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,880
That’s when the Communist Party plans out the\h
next 5 years of the economy. Because China is\h\h

109
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,560
still Communist and has a planned economy.\h
In case anyone tries to tell you otherwise.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,760
In the leadup to the meeting, Chinese Chairman\h
Xi Jinping made a bunch of personnel changes.

111
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,720
That includes appointing new—and loyal—heads to\h
China’s biggest state-run media organizations:\h\h

112
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
Xinhua and People’s Daily.

113
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,520
Wow, stop the presses! No,\h
seriously. Stop the presses.\h\h

114
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,920
You need to make sure you’re\h
following Party guidelines.

115
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Ready for a story just dripping with\h
delicious irony? The Communist Party of the\h\h

116
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,680
Philippines has ordered, “its armed wing to target\h
Chinese-owned companies operating in the country.”

117
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,120
Communists just can’t seem to get along.\h
The Communist Party has been outlawed in\h\h

118
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,240
the Philippines. But the communist guerilla\h
group says, “These [Chinese] infrastructure\h\h

119
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
projects not only displace thousands of\h
peasants and minorities from their lands,\h\h

120
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,920
they also wreak havoc [on] the natural\h
ecosystem of the country’s remaining forests.”

121
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,200
I mean, they’re not wrong. We did an\h
episode about how a Chinese-built dam\h\h

122
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,840
in Malaysia could kill thousands. Check it out.

123
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,160
But even if the Chinese Communist Party\h
may not have allies in Communist Parties\h\h

124
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,600
in developing countries, at least\h
it still has friends in Europe.

125
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,240
Officials at the European Parliament and\h
the European Commission have hired Hikvision\h\h

126
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,520
to supply thermal imaging\h
cameras for their buildings.\h\h

127
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,440
It’s to test people’s temperatures\h
to see if they have the coronavirus.

128
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,520
Hikvision is a great choice. They\h
have a long, proud history of using\h\h

129
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,520
their surveillance equipment in those\h
Muslim internment camps in Xinjiang.

130
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
Hikvision is also tied to\h
China’s People’s Liberation Army.\h\h

131
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,320
So good job EU. You literally have\h
installed PLA cameras in your buildings.

132
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,840
The FBI has indicted eight Chinese operatives\h
for harassing Chinese dissidents in the US.

133
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,280
These Chinese operatives were a part\h
of what’s called Operation Fox Hunt.\h\h

134
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,120
“The Chinese government claims [it] is an\h
international anti-corruption campaign,\h\h

135
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,520
but the U.S. believes to be a plot to\h
target political opponents and critics.”

136
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Makes sense. China’s *domestic* anti-corruption\h\h

137
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
campaign is also used to target\h
political opponents and critics.

138
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,640
As part of the FBI investigation, “At one\h
point, one of the defendants and an unidentified\h\h

139
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,160
co-conspirator allegedly placed a note on\h
the door of [a John Doe’s home] that said,\h\h

140
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,240
‘If you are willing to go back to the\h
mainland and spend 10 years in prison,\h\h

141
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,120
your wife and children will be all\h
right. That’s the end of this matter!’”

142
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,200
The Chinese Communist Party—it\h
always thinks of the children.

143
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,760
The Chinese city of Yiwu is predicting\h
the outcome of the upcoming US election.

144
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,000
Factories there make a lot of\h
cheap products for the US market.

145
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
And according to the New York Times,\h
“President Trump’s campaign paraphernalia—hats,\h\h

146
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,960
banners, mugs and practically anything else that\h
can carry a logo—has been selling briskly...\h

147
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,280
By contrast, shop owners said during recent\h
visits, bulk orders for materials supporting\h\h

148
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,960
former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\h
Jr. have been almost nonexistent.

149
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,400
This is how an almost unknown Chinese\h
city was able to accurately predict the\h\h

150
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,520
winner of the 2016 presidential\h
election months ahead of time,\h\h

151
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,080
when major American media still had\h
no clue on the day of the election.

152
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,480
We’ll know next week if the\h
Yiwu Index, as it's called,\h\h

153
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,320
is right again. At least I\h
hope we’ll know next week.

154
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
And now, it’s time for me to\h
answer another question from one of\h\h

155
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,920
you, a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

156
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,040
Joesph Griffith asks, “Is\h
flood season over in China?”

157
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,800
That’s a good question, because the\h
flood season this year was devastating.\h\h

158
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,840
It’s hard to get accurate figures, since\h
China downplays the damage and deaths in\h\h

159
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,720
natural disasters, but at least 15 million people\h
were affected in a record breaking flood season.

160
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,520
There were 21 large scale floods this year. The\h
last time flooding was this bad was in 1998.\h\h

161
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,440
At least according to my favorite Chinese\h
state run media, the Global Times.

162
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,320
That seems to be mostly over. Which is\h
good because the massive Three Gorges\h\h

163
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
Dam had begun to deform under the\h
pressure of all those flood waters.

164
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,200
That would have been a black swan\h
disaster for the Chinese Communist Party.

165
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,960
But it seems like for this\h
year, that swan has flown.

166
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
Anyway, thanks for your question Joseph!

167
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,360
And thank you for watching. Remember, it's\h
hard for us to keep this show running. There’s\h\h

168
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,880
not a lot of money in criticizing China.\h
Which is why we rely on your support on\h\h

169
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
the crowd funding website Patreon.\h
For as little as a dollar an episode,\h\h

170
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
you can help us in our fight\h
against the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h
