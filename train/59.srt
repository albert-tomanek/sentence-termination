1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,440
And keep that going please,
for the start of the show!

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,680
No, keep going!

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,560
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,520
Joining me...

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
F***ing hell.
What the f***?!

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,240
We're starting the show.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,640
"Well, no.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,440
"No, I'm not here for this, no, no."

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,880
Let's do that again.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
And why might they have been called
the Black Legion?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Did they go at night?

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,920
No. No.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,740
Did they go in the day?

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,120
I mean they went whenever was best for the…

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,080
Was it camouflage tactics?

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,840
Did they cover themselves in mud or something
to hide in bushes and stuff?

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,920
Ooh,  I'll give you a point
for camouflage tactics, but it wasn't mud.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
S***.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,360
That would be the Brown Legion,
and that's very different.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,080
It's now time to play "Beano character
or shipping forecast area?"

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
Gnasher, Dennis, Softy Walter,
rising slightly.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,200
Westerly three or four, becoming good later.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Fatty, Smithy, failing.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,520
But we did it for Sark, let's do it for
the French as well.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,280
We might get an invite there
at some point as well.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,720
Threaten to play football
and never follow through?

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,120
I followed through when they took up the offer.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,400
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
-Alright, this was a French…
-Poo.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
Sorry?

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,440
He made a poo joke.

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,440
It's funny because it's about poo.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,120
It was just you went,
'poo' as well.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
This…th...
