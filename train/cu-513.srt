1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,770
We told you how China has been taking over
map production.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,799
Pushing false territorial claims over India,

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,000
Taiwan, and the South China Sea...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,090
and forcing the rest of the world to accept
them.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,020
But it turns out, the problem is much worse
than we thought.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,650
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,710
Viewers have sent in the proof, and it’ll
blow your mind.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,279
Chinese maps have infiltrated the rest of
the world.

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,829
Like a virus.

11
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,130
On January 29, we published an episode called

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,730
“How China is Secretly Changing Everyone’s
Maps.”

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,809
I talked about how every company

14
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,300
that prints maps and globes inside China

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,350
is forced to adhere to the Chinese government’s
official map designs.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,379
That means they have to include Taiwan,

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,200
a disputed area controlled by India,

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
and the so-called Nine-Dash Line

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,420
that encompaseses the entire South China Sea...

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,049
all as a part of the People’s Republic of
China.

21
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,760
And as some viewers have pointed out,

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,270
the Nine-Dash Line actually has TEN dashes
on a lot of maps now.

23
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,960
They added the extra one in case Taiwan tries
to escape.

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,350
Nope!

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,909
If you don’t remember the map of China

26
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,590
looking like this when you were a kid...

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,119
that’s because it didn’t.

28
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,780
Other countries—like the US—

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,420
do not recognize some of China’s more outrageous
territorial claims.

30
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,520
These ones.

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,310
But the Chinese regime is trying to change
that.

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,650
They want to change how average people in
other countries

33
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,550
perceive China’s borders.

34
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,210
A lot of maps and globes these days are made
in Chinese factories.

35
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,740
And the Communist Party is using these factories

36
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,189
to change the designs of maps and globes exported
around the world,

37
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,060
with the hope that everyone will just get
used to

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,189
the Chinese regime’s official version,

39
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,090
and eventually accept it.

40
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,940
The US and other Western countries have freedom
of the press,

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,320
so there are no restrictions on what maps
can show.

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,720
And the Chinese regime is taking advantage
of our freedom of the press—

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,520
and our insistence on having all our cheap
stuff made in China.

44
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,989
Chinese state-run media acknowledge their
plan explicitly.

45
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:21,020
Their goal is to “make the [Chinese] government’s
position on territory

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,480
clear to the international community.”

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,970
This is what I call “map warfare”.

48
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,569
The Chinese Communist Party’s goal is to
expand their territory

49
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,290
not by firing bullets,

50
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,569
but by controlling the world’s digital and
printed maps.

51
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:36,660
And it’s working.

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,152
I know it’s working, because I had asked
you guys—

53
00:02:39,152 --> 00:02:40,340
our amazing viewers—

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,800
to send us photos if you saw China’s version
of the map in your country.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,790
And the rabbit hole went much deeper than
I imagined.

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,450
I’m going to show you just a few of the
ones viewers sent in.

57
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,370
Here’s a globe a viewer found in France.

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,459
Chic!

59
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:59,459
And wrong.

60
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,760
Here’s a globe found by a viewer in the
Netherlands.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,620
What were they smoking?

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,360
This is a globe sold in Canada, made by Oregon
Scientific.

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,489
It teaches Canadian children the “correct”
worldview.

64
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,890
Here’s another one for kids, sold on Amazon.com.

65
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,890
It’s for ages 8-plus.

66
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,909
It’s “detailed and educational.”

67
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:19,909
That’s great!

68
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,250
I mean, it’s practically correct!

69
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,220
Except for a few glaring inaccuracies when
it comes to China.

70
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,269
Then there’s the “Discovery Kids Mindblown
Globe

71
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,349
2-in-1 Day and Night Earth”.

72
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,920
Hmmm... that’s kind of hard to see.

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
Well, Discovery is a media company,

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,430
so I wonder if they have some sort of promotional
video online.

75
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,360
“We put a new spin on a classic globe,

76
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,780
to create an educational centerpiece for any
room.

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,819
Clearly marked countries, cities, bodies of
water.”

78
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,780
Wait, slow down:

79
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,769
Is Taiwan the same color as China?

80
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,620
OK, it’s hard to tell from the promo video,
too.

81
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,840
So I bought one from Target in New Jersey.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,970
Let’s see.

83
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,540
Yep!

84
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,200
Taiwan is labeled as a province of China.

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,570
And here’s the Nine-Dash Line.

86
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,579
It also appears to claim that part of India,
Arunachal Pradesh.

87
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,799
“Mind.

88
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,020
Blown.”

89
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,900
I wonder where this globe was manufactured...

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,169
What a surprise.

91
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,590
But ok, a bunch of globes made in China and
sold around the world

92
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,320
have China’s version of the map.

93
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,440
What’s the big deal?

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,830
Well, this Discovery globe is specifically
made for “Hands-on Learning”.

95
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,650
This is a product *designed* to teach children

96
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,600
about “countries, cities, and bodies of
water.”

97
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
And what are American children learning?

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,770
Chinese propaganda, produced by the Discovery
Network,

99
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,480
and conveniently delivered by unsuspecting
parents.

100
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,280
Or Santa Claus.

101
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,350
He outsourced to China.

102
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,350
By the way,

103
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,729
we reached out to “Discovery Mindblown”
for comment.

104
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,780
They did not answer any of our questions.

105
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,740
This changing-of-the-maps has been happening
gradually,

106
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,110
mostly since 2017.

107
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,840
And it falls precisely in line

108
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,550
with the Chinese government’s goal of pushing
its territorial claims

109
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,470
in the international community.

110
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,030
And if you think the infiltration of children’s
globes is bad,

111
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,770
well, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

112
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,740
China’s map warfare is all over the place.

113
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,750
Let’s say you want a VPN to protect your
identity.

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,690
This advertisement from ExpressVPN makes me
think

115
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,960
they don’t realize you can *already* access
Google,

116
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,400
Facebook, and Twitter from Taiwan,

117
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,040
which is a SEPARATE COUNTRY.

118
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah, if you want a reliable VPN,

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,360
I’d suggest you go with Surfshark.

120
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,310
Surfshark has sponsored a bunch of our episodes

121
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,569
about Chinese Communist Party infiltration,

122
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,199
so they know what’s up.

123
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,860
Now, ExpressVPN may have hired a marketing
company

124
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,750
to make that unfortunate ad,

125
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,669
and it was probably a mistake.

126
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,020
But here’s what’s not a mistake:

127
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,880
This screenshot of Apple Maps that a viewer
from the UK sent us.

128
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,280
He bought his iPhone in the UK, and Apple
Maps looked normal.

129
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,300
But when he traveled to China on vacation,

130
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,140
his Apple Maps suddenly changed,

131
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,070
by adding China’s Nine-Dash Line and Taiwan.

132
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,669
We reached out to Apple for comment.

133
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:30,710
They did not respond.

134
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,710
Here’s another example, even worse:

135
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,900
An Indian viewer sent us these screenshots

136
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,220
from the Google Maps app on his mobile phone.

137
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,840
But he didn’t visit China.

138
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,770
These are screenshots he took while he was
in India.

139
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,440
It shows China’s Nine-Dash Line, Taiwan,
and craziest of all—

140
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,840
it legitimizes China’s claims on Arunachal
Pradesh,

141
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,580
that part of India that’s administered by
the Indian Government!

142
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,300
This is a map people *in India* are seeing!

143
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,570
You’d think this would upset the Indian
government.

144
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,300
But our viewer emailed us that

145
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,150
he reported it to the Indian authorities,

146
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,360
and they replied that their Google devices

147
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,780
are showing the correct map,

148
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,090
so they can’t take action against it.

149
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,190
“I don't understand why Google—

150
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,509
a company banned in China—

151
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,100
are using Chinese maps.”

152
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,220
Oh, I can understand why.

153
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,569
Google, by the way,

154
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,919
also did not respond to our requests for comment.

155
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,440
And even when Chinese map *production* hasn’t
been infiltrated,

156
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,210
some printed maps have.

157
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,740
One viewer sent us photos of a book he bought
in China:

158
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,629
The English language edition of Guns, Germs,
and Steel.

159
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,310
Someone from the Chinese government

160
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,289
had literally gone into each physical book

161
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,940
and added a stamp, saying that the maps,

162
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,349
which show Taiwan as a separate country,

163
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,919
are a violation of the One-China Principle.

164
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,009
So those are just a few examples of what

165
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,000
China Uncensored viewers have discovered.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,210
Why does this matter?

167
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,009
Well, China’s version of the world map legitimizes
its claims

168
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,330
over territory that it has no legal right
to.

169
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,030
An international tribunal confirmed this.

170
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,780
If the Chinese Communist Party is able to
succeed

171
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,680
in its “map warfare,”

172
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,000
it directly affects the rest of the world.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,310
For example, their pressure over the Taiwan
issue

174
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,300
prevents people in Taiwan from being

175
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,640
a full part of the international community.

176
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,260
That’s why, as the deadly coronavirus spreads,

177
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,930
China has been able to block the World Health
Organization

178
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,940
from working with Taiwan.

179
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,140
The Chinese regime is happy to risk the lives

180
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,930
of 23 million Taiwanese people

181
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,750
just to assert their territorial politics.

182
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,450
China’s claims also affect countries around
the South China Sea—

183
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,050
like the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

184
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,580
For centuries, their people have relied on
fishing

185
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,720
in the South China Sea.

186
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,480
Now China’s claims threaten their access.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,100
A few years ago, we hired a Filipino fishing
boat

188
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,260
to take us to disputed waters in the South
China Sea

189
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,230
and made an episode about it for China Uncensored.

190
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,070
The fishermen told us they’d been fishing

191
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,000
at the Scarborough Shoal for generations.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,410
But when we got there,

193
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,520
the place was surrounded by the Chinese Coast
Guard,

194
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,480
and they wouldn’t let Filipino boats into
the Shoal,

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,950
where the best fishing is.

196
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,140
Because the Chinese regime decided it was
*their* territory now.

197
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,670
And remember back in the early to mid 20th
Century,

198
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,190
when world maps showed Tibet as a separate
country?

199
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,450
Well, in 1949,

200
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,420
the Chinese Communist Party claimed Tibet
was part of China.

201
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,890
By 1951, they had forced Tibet to accept their
rule.

202
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,250
And within a few years,

203
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,140
Western countries simply accepted that the
territory

204
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,490
is now part of the People’s Republic of
China.

205
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,220
So we should take their territorial claims
seriously.

206
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,040
If we don’t stand up to China’s “map
warfare” now,

207
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,829
it will only get harder to deal with later.

208
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,230
Especially once the next generation grows
up

209
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,910
playing with propaganda globes sold by the
Discovery Network.

210
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,630
So what’s the solution?

211
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,260
Don’t let your kids learn geography.

212
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,580
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

213
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,570
Yes, that is a better idea.

214
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,800
Ok, I just had a better idea.

215
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,180
Tell your elected representatives to actually
DO something

216
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,800
to stop China’s “map warfare.”

217
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,370
We’ve created this petition on Change.org.

218
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,490
It calls on Congress to enact legislation
blocking

219
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,950
the import of maps and globes made in China.

220
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,930
If American companies stop selling globes
and maps made in China,

221
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,190
then the Chinese government has no power over
our maps—

222
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,050
and no power to undermine our freedom of the
press.

223
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,680
So click the link below and sign the petition,

224
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,279
and then share the petition with everyone
you know on social media.

225
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,149
And if you see more examples of China’s
“map warfare,”

226
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,839
keep sending them to us.

227
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:11,730
Especially if you see them being used in schools.

228
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,240
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

229
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Thanks for joining me.
