00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,310
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,140
some people are dying to get married.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,480
Some people die to get married.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,019
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,830
Boy, first dates can be a killer.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,270
Especially when you’re dead.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,120
“Friend?”

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,090
But surely, that’s only the stuff of movies,
right?

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,260
Well, in China, they have a way of making
movies into reality.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,720
Like a new program to predict crime before
it happens.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,140
A surveillance network called Skynet.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,879
And of course, the tradition of Ghost Weddings.

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,190
Now this is actually an ancient tradition,

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,690
but in recent years it’s been making a resurrection
in Shanxi province.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,220
It’s considered bad luck if a young man
dies before getting married.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,530
So earlier this year,

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,469
a family in Shanxi married their son,

18
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,340
three years deceased,

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,370
to the corpse of a woman from a local village.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,860
And it was a bargain at only $27,000!

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,580
I am not making this up.

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,340
In fact, that was a discount price

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,370
because the bride’s family felt it was a
good social match.

24
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,860
Ghosts can be such snobs about social status.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,380
So why are Ghost Weddings haunting the people
of Shanxi again?

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,180
Well, for one, there’s a lot of coal mines
in Shanxi.

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,280
Coal mines in China and survival,

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,220
don’t really go together.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,300
Kind of like Vegemite

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,580
and anything else.

31
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,780
In other words, there’s a lot of eligible
dead bachelors

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,030
who need dead bachelorettes.

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,360
So many, that grave robbing is becoming a
thing.

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,180
“Ah.”

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,820
According to local police reports,

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,130
at least three dozen female bodies

37
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,020
have been stolen from their graves in the
past three years.

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,040
This man had his mother’s body stolen.

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,110
If this sounds extreme,

40
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,180
it’s just the beginning.

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,640
Because this is just one current manifestation

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,500
of a much larger crisis facing China.

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,340
Too many men.

44
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,840
You may have heard the term “leftover women.”

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,320
That’s what the Chinese government's supposedly
feminist All-China Women's Federation

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,910
calls unmarried women over the age of 27.

47
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,050
They wasted time getting an education and
now they’re too old to find a man.

48
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,230
Basically what they’re really saying is,

49
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,810
“FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, MARRY!

50
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,360
MARRY NOW!”

51
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,300
Because China’s real problem isn’t leftover
women.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,370
It’s leftover men.

53
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,010
Decades of the One Child Policy

54
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,470
plus sex-selective abortion and female infanticide

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,140
have led to this:

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,040
There are 22 million more men than women in
China.

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,150
And by 2040 that number could be 40 million.

58
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,220
And when state-run party mouthpiece China
Daily

59
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,010
tries to tell you that this isn’t a problem,

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,550
and uses a cute cartoon to illustrate its
point,

61
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,970
you just know IT’S A HUGE PROBLEM.

62
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,200
To illustrate.

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,100
This is the population of New York...

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,070
Los Angeles... and Chicago.

65
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,350
This is the number of single men in China
with no hope of getting married.

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,310
These men are referred to as “bare branches”

67
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,820
because they’re not adding to the family
tree,

68
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,230
and usually they’re poor, rural, and uneducated.

69
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,810
And they also contribute to China’s rising
problems

70
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,150
with prostitution, sex trafficking, violence,
and ethnic strife.

71
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,110
And apparently, when they die in horrific
accidents

72
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,400
caused by insanely bad safety conditions in
really terrible jobs,

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,640
they’ll still be competing for corpse brides.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,650
So what do you think of Ghost Weddings?

75
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,260
And what do you think the gender imbalance
means for China’s future?

77
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,910
