1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,930
remembering 2016

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,850
because we have to.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,380
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,010
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,870
Well, we all made it through 2016,

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,519
and we deserve a round of applause.

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,410
You know, there’s an old Chinese curse:

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,210
“May you live in interesting times.”

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,839
What's that, Shelley?

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,369
It's not actually a Chinese curse at all,

12
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,380
and was most likely made up by some British
guy?

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,500
Of course it was.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,920
Anyway, boy, do we ever live in interesting
times.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,570
So let’s take a look back at 10 of the biggest
stories

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,890
from China in 2016.

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,320
Number 10

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,149
Beijing, we have a problem.

19
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,730
China has ambitious space plans.

20
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,199
This is the Tiangong-1 space station.

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,559
China launched it in 2011.

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,879
Then in March 2016,

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,489
state-run Xinhua News announced that Tiangong-1

24
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,399
had completed its missions,

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,309
and would “descend gradually in the coming
months”

26
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:05,880
back down to earth.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,290
But what they actually meant

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,380
is that China has lost control of the Tiangong-1.

29
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,100
And by “descend gradually” they meant
crash.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,250
Yes, it will crash back down to Earth—

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,719
breaking apart into chunks as big as 200 pounds,

32
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,180
cannonballing down at terminal velocity,

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,290
landing somewhere that’s impossible to predict,

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,619
on an unknown date in 2017.

35
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,340
Just one way 2017 can have 2016 beat!

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,439
Number 9

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,040
China’s First Female President

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,450
By China, I mean the other China.

39
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,869
In January, the Republic of China elected
its first female President,

40
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,259
Tsai Ing-wen.

41
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,710
And Tsai has never officially acknowledged
the One China policy.

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,990
Which made the other other China really mad.

43
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,960
State-run Xinhua News published a commentary

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,810
that accused Tsai of being emotional, extremist,
and erratic.

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,289
Not because of specific policies, mind you.

46
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,340
But because she’s a single woman.

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,539
You see, as a single female politician,

48
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,979
she does not have the emotional burden of
love,

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,450
family, or children—

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,540
so her political style and strategies are
displayed to be

51
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,760
more emotional, personal and extreme.

52
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,540
Because as elections in several other countries

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
this year

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,590
have conclusively proven,

55
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,470
male political leaders are never emotional,
personal, or extreme.

56
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,750
Number 8

57
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,290
China’s Plan for Internet Domination

58
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,800
On October 1,

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
the US let its contract with ICANN expire.

60
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,430
Very simply,

61
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,430
very simply put,

62
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,800
there’s a department of ICANN that’s in
charge of

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,870
the Internet’s address book.

64
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,500
It makes sure users get to the websites they
intend to visit.

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,110
That address book is like the One Ring of
the Internet.

66
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,700
Whoever controls it controls them all.

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,720
An American organization had overseen ICANN

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,280
since time immemorial,

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,489
i.e. since Al Gore invented the Internet.

70
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,440
But as of October 2016,

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,209
ICANN is controlled by a “multi-stakeholder
model.”

72
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,650
It doesn’t belong to China, either...

73
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,940
but the Chinese regime has gotten pretty good

74
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,720
at manipulating the international stakeholders

75
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,890
that are now overseeing it.

76
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,890
Ultimately,

77
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,529
the Chinese regime’s goal is to control
the world’s internet,

78
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:22,310
and make it look more like the harmonious
internet

79
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,880
protected by China’s Great Firewall.

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,570
Without that pesky freedom of speech.

81
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,550
Number 7

82
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,770
The Panama Papers

83
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,580
April saw the biggest data leak in history:

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,110
the Panama Papers.

85
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,860
2.6 terabytes of documents were leaked

86
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,489
from a Panama-based company called Mossack
Fonseca.

87
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,650
And it was a huge scandal for the Chinese
regime.

88
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,989
Because fully one third of Mossack Fonseca’s
business

89
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,159
came from China.

90
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,550
Those leaked documents revealed a lot of information
about China’s elite,

91
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,530
including at least eight family members

92
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,060
of current and former members of China’s

93
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,250
Politburo Standing Committee.

94
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,840
The Panama Papers also revealed

95
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,030
how wealthy Chinese are increasingly moving
their money

96
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,610
out of China.

97
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,930
Number 6

98
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,439
China Steals a US Drone

99
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,730
Yes, the Chinese navy took a US research drone

100
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,160
in December.

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,690
It was measuring oceanic temperature and stuff

102
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,300
about 50 miles off the coast of the Philippines,

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,520
or 500 miles off the coast of China.

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,360
This caused an international incident, of
course.

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,390
Fortunately,

106
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,020
China gave the drone back once they found
out

107
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,700
it was totally boring research drone.

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
They gave it back

109
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,050
even though president-elect Trump told China
via Twitter

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,140
they could keep it.

111
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,100
I guess they didn’t get the message,

112
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,050
since Twitter is banned in China.

113
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,470
Number 5

114
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,780
China loses the South China Sea

115
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,750
China is embroiled in territorial disputes

116
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,880
with pretty much every one one of its neighbors

117
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,650
over the South China Sea.

118
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,970
That’s what happens when you claim pretty
much the whole thing.

119
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,850
But China’s plans for domination hit a little
snafu in July

120
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,230
when the Philippines successfully got the
UN

121
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,440
to hold an arbitration case in the Hague.

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,730
And the Hague ruled in a unanimous decision

123
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,450
that all of China’s claims are illegitimate.

124
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,170
It was a big win for the Philippines—

125
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,760
at least on paper.

126
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,010
But then this guy got elected—

127
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,780
the new president of the Philippines,

128
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,410
Rodrigo Duterte.

129
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,020
And that brings us to...

130
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,590
Number 4

131
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,020
China wins the South China Sea

132
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,820
President Rodrigo Duterte has been pushing

133
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,660
for closer ties with China,

134
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,950
and turning away from the US.

135
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,180
During his October trip to China,

136
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,710
he didn’t even bring up the territorial
dispute.

137
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,010
And it paid off for him.

138
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,010
Kind of.

139
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,690
The Chinese coast guard stopped blocking Filipino
fishermen

140
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,210
from fishing in the Scarborough Shoal.

141
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,680
Which gave me the perfect opportunity

142
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,280
to plant my flag there.

143
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,090
But by making this concession,

144
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,990
Duterte also weakened the Philippines’ future
claim

145
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,310
to the region.

146
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,310
In other words,

147
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,400
in the long term, China wins.

148
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,570
Number 3

149
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,050
Hong Kong Oath Taking Scandal

150
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,490
The Chinese regime has been aggressively encroaching

151
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,620
on freedoms in Hong Kong.

152
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,690
But pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong

153
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,930
won a big victory in the September elections.

154
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,780
They won 30 seats in the Legislative Council,

155
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,290
giving them veto power over the pro-Beijing
side.

156
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,630
It was a great win.

157
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,230
Until these two took their oaths of office.

158
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,910
They held up flags that said Hong Kong is
not China.

159
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,850
And in their off-script oath,

160
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,280
they referred to China using a slur the Japanese
had used

161
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,490
during World War II.

162
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,130
That gave Beijing the excuse to make an “interpretation”

163
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,130
of Hong Kong Basic Law—

164
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,500
the interpretation being they disqualified
those two officials.

165
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,160
That opened the floodgates.

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,530
Chief Executive CY Leung

167
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,390
is now seeking to disqualify four others.

168
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,370
If they’re successful,

169
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,240
then the pro-democracy side loses its veto
power

170
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,290
in the Legislative Council.

171
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,290
In other words,

172
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,470
the Pro-Beijing side could do whatever it
wants.

173
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,840
And the Chinese Communist Party would win
Hong Kong.

174
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,320
Number 2

175
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,050
People finally start talking about Organ Harvesting

176
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,160
Ten years ago,

177
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,550
former Canadian Member of Parliament David
Kilgour

178
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,720
and human rights lawyer David Matas

179
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,240
began telling the world that the Chinese regime

180
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
was killing Falun Gong practitioners for their
organs.

181
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
And the world media was like,

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,510
“yeah, whatever, where's the smoking gun?”

183
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,510
But this year,

184
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,990
a lot of media started taking their claims
more seriously.

185
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,140
Because in June,

186
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,830
they released a new report that showed that
yes,

187
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,370
the Communist Party is killing Falun Gong
practitioners,

188
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,600
House Christians, and Uighur Muslims—

189
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,250
and selling their organs for profit.

190
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,680
And it’s on a scale of 60 to 100,000 organ
transplants per year.

191
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
Will 2017 shed more light on this terrible
practice?

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,590
Let's hope so.

193
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,060
And Finally, Number 1

194
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,880
Xi Jinping Goes Super Saiyan

195
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,400
Xi Jinping is the strongest leader China has
seen in a generation.

196
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,110
And this year, he powered up.

197
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,570
In April,

198
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,460
he assumed the title of Commander in Chief

199
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,940
of the new Joint Operations Command

200
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,920
of the People’s Liberation Army.

201
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,710
No one saw it coming.

202
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,780
And not just because he was wearing camouflage.

203
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,419
This was a major step forward in his purging
of rivals,

204
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,380
like people tied to former Chinese leader
Jiang Zemin,

205
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,140
who was seen as previously holding an iron
grip

206
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,419
on the armed forces.

207
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,020
Then at the end of October,

208
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,230
Xi Jinping became China’s core leader,

209
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,030
bringing Xi one step closer to becoming

210
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,900
what I like to call a “presitator”—

211
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,900
somewhere between a president and a dictator.

212
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,240
The internal power struggle within the Communist
Party

213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,210
has raged on since 2012.

214
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,720
And 2017 will bring even more changes,

215
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,050
as many of the top leaders of the Party

216
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,680
are supposed to step down.

217
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,940
I bet those will be some fun retirement parties.

218
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,840
So what was your favorite China story of 2016?

219
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,390
Leave your comments below.

220
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,530
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

221
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,410
See you next year.
