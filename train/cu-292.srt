1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,300
China just wants to keep your money safe.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,240
The Chinese regime stands up for its ally
Venezuela.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,690
And Macau goes gambling

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,830
with people's lives.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,780
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,439
I''m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,660
Chinese authorities want to make sure

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,980
that when citizens travel overseas,

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,789
their money is safe.

12
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,540
Safely in China, that is.

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,900
They've put in strict rules

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,770
that limit how much money citizens

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,280
can transfer into foreign currencies.

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,510
But, surprise, surprise,

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,320
some wealthy Chinese have been trying to

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,940
cheat the system.

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,940
For example,

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,290
by going to Macau and gambling

21
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,570
in komodo dragon-filled pits,

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,070
like we talked about in our episode last week.

23
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,740
I'm paraphrasing.

24
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,870
Or by going to, say,

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,020
Paris and buying expensive jewelry

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,790
with their Chinese bank card,

27
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,580
and then returning it for cash.

28
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,670
But why should Chinese authorities work

29
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,480
to resolve fundamental economic problems,

30
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,480
when they can just implement new restrictions!

31
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,100
Like this latest one that went into effect

32
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,049
on September 1st.

33
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:09,539
It requires banks to report

34
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,040
all overseas bank card transactions

35
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,570
of over $150 to the Chinese government.

36
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,200
Officially, it's to help improve

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,509
statistics and record-keeping.

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,049
Totally not because they're scared of

39
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,630
all the rich people fleeing China

40
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,229
with their money.

41
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,229
By the way,

42
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,509
if there are any Parisian jewelers watching
this,

43
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:27,659
it might be a good time

44
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,729
to start selling gold rings

45
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,929
for only $149.99!

46
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:34,479
And across the Pacific now to Venezuela,

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,240
a country no one is fleeing *to*,

48
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,789
but it's still a place China is concerned
about.

49
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,399
President Trump has hit Venezuela

50
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,990
with a new round of sanctions.

51
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,439
The goal is to limit funding

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,350
to what he calls Venezuelan President

53
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,329
Nicolas Maduro's "dictatorship."

54
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:51,649
Whoa, hold on there, Trump.

55
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,289
Just because the Venezuelan government

56
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,119
is forcibly taking over private enterprise,

57
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,280
and police are killing people without due
process,

58
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,270
and President Maduro is rewriting the constitution,

59
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,259
doesn't mean he's a dictator.

60
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,200
Fortunately, Venezuela's is getting support

61
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,380
from its ally, China,

62
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,140
a country that's also totally not a

63
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,180
China's foreign ministry said sanctions

64
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,500
will only make the situation even more
complicated.

65
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,900
I'm sure China's support has nothing to

66
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,880
with the fact that Venezuela owes China

67
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,330
a lot of money.

68
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,320
Speaking of

69
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,900
China's third-richest man may be in trouble.

70
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,140
I'm talking about Wang Jianlin.

71
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,440
He's the owner of the Dalian Wanda group.

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,220
The conglomerate owns everything from

73
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,090
real estate developments to movie studios.

74
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,100
It also owns AMC Theaters,

75
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,790
the one that controls 5,000 movie screens

76
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,500
right here in the USA.

77
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,420
Well, earlier this week,

78
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,010
there were rumors that Wang Jianlin

79
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,840
had been detained by authorities

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,990
and stopped from leaving the country.

81
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,340
I mean, what good is a 30-billion-dollar net
worth

82
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
if you can't leave China, right?

83
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,540
Anyway, as soon as those rumors came out,

84
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,200
Dalian Wanda's stock prices plummeted.

85
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,160
And the company, of course,

86
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,150
was quick to deny the reports.

87
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,570
But in China,

88
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,740
where the news is designed to broadcast

89
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,760
what the Communist Party wants you to hear,

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,960
it's hard to get real information.

91
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,700
So rumors, whether true or not,

92
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,240
can still crater a company's stock prices.

93
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,630
Even without this latest rumor,

94
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,500
Dalian Wanda hasn't been doing that well.

95
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
A few weeks ago,

96
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,780
The New York Times ran a piece

97
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,440
possibly linking Wang Jianlin

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,080
with another Chinese billionaire

99
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,480
we've talked about on the show:

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Xiao Jianhua,

101
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,730
who was disappeared from Hong Kong

102
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,500
earlier this year.

103
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,620
Word is that Xiao is in mainland China

104
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,260
helping authorities to investigate

105
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,660
people in the financial sector.

106
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,550
And as we mentioned in a previous episode,

107
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,760
Dalian Wanda is also in deep debt trouble.

108
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,400
It's currently having a fire sale on

109
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,060
its empire of malls, hotels

110
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,980
and amusement parks.

111
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,540
Now I'll never get to live my dream

112
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,900
of visiting Nanchang Wanda theme park.

113
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,940
It's the most harmonious place on Earth!

114
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,060
Was.

115
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,820
It's been shut down.

116
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,530
To make upgrades.

117
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,920
Riiiight.

118
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,840
Anyway, while rumors about Dalian Wanda

119
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,280
are flying in China,

120
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,160
it's getting harder and harder for people

121
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,420
to spread rumors or truths

122
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,760
without the government knowing

123
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
their real names.

124
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,680
China's put a new round of Internet rules

125
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,940
into effect last Friday.

126
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,160
Internet users will be required

127
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,880
to register their real names

128
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
if they want to make a comment online.

129
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
In other words,

130
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,660
no more Internet anonymity.

131
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,010
So if you say something politically incorrect,

132
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,070
Big Brother will know.

133
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,070
For a long time,

134
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,240
the Chinese regime has been trying to

135
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,220
tie people's online identities

136
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,720
to their real ones.

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,520
The difference with this new regulation

138
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,140
is that now they're putting the responsibility

139
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,180
on Internet companies to actually enforce
it.

140
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,440
Of course, you can always use a VPN

141
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,660
to jump China's restrictive firewall

142
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,900
and access the Internet normally.

143
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,250
But not for long.

144
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,350
The Chinese regime is planning

145
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,240
to ban most of those as well.

146
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Then we'll finally know which Xi Jinping

147
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,850
who comments on our YouTube page

148
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,380
is the real Xi Jinping.

149
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,100
There can be only one.

150
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,660
Now moving on to Macau.

151
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,560
I was there last year,

152
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
but I'm less and less sure

153
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,460
I want to go back.

154
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,460
Last week,

155
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,430
Macau denied entry to Hong Kong reporters

156
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,770
trying to enter the territory.

157
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,770
They were there to report on

158
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,970
the aftermath of Typhoon Hato,

159
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,860
which struck Macau on August 23,

160
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,260
killing eight people.

161
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,639
Instead, Macau immigration authorities

162
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,260
detained the journalists and asked them

163
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,800
to sign a statement that they

164
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,920
posed a risk to the stability

165
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,640
of internal security,

166
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,180
which is completely nonthreatening

167
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,220
and not at all an ominous sign.

168
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,540
The Macau authorities denied that

169
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,240
it was because they were journalists,

170
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,660
but then refused to explain

171
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,820
why the journalists were a threat

172
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,360
to Macau's security.

173
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,910
Yes, the government of Macau

174
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,180
totally respects freedom of the press.

175
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,240
But while Macau was able to stop

176
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,860
the invasion of Hong Kong journalists,

177
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,500
for the first time in Macau's history,

178
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,600
the typhoon prompted an invasion

179
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,240
of Chinese People's Liberation Army.

180
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,140
Soldiers literally ran through the streets

181
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,600
with shovels and mops.

182
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,420
At least it's safer than running with guns.

183
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,800
Or scissors.

184
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Anyway, Macau was affected really,

185
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,080
really badly by Typhoon Hato,

186
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,980
much worse than neighboring Hong Kong was.

187
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,080
That's because Hong Kong

188
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
had issued a typhoon warning on the Tuesday
night

189
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,370
before the storm,

190
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,190
but Macau waited nine more hours,

191
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,930
only issuing that same warning

192
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,700
Wednesday morning.

193
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,580
And it barely gave locals any time to prepare.

194
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,740
How did this happen?

195
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,360
Well, it turns out the Macau weather bureau

196
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,370
is now under investigation

197
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,460
for intentionally delaying the typhoon warning

198
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,460
in a possible effort to save the casinos money.

199
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,540
According to this article,

200
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,580
From the time the typhoon No 8 signal is
hoisted,

201
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,110
casinos are mandated to pay all staff overtime.

202
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, the poor, poor casinos

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,151
would have been forced to pay

204
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:58,340
an extra shift of overtime.

205
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,040
Well now they have their money.

206
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,699
But why do they still feel so empty inside?

207
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,880
And get this,

208
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,220
this isn't even the first time

209
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:08,860
Macau has gambled with a typhoon warning.

210
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,340
The same criticisms happened in 2016

211
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,030
when Typhoon Nida hit.

212
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,229
Hong Kong raised the number 8 typhoon warning,

213
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:20,180
but Macau did not raise any warning.

214
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,090
The weather boss defended that at the time.

215
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,090
But this year,

216
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,639
people in Macau died because of

217
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,580
the delayed typhoon warning.

218
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,020
So it's become a huge scandal,

219
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,700
and forced Macau's weather boss

220
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,880
to step down.

221
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,760
Look, I don't know what a weather boss
does,

222
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,300
but clearly he can't control this media
firestorm.

223
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,420
But hey,

224
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,340
in a city where 80% of tax revenue

225
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
comes from

226
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,020
what's a little gambling with people's
lives?

227
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,310
And coming up after the break,

228
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,900
could India and China finally be resolving

229
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,270
their differences without threatening

230
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,860
to kill each other?

231
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,650
You know what's a real gamble?

232
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,020
Not getting the latest China news

233
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,330
