1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,450
Taiwan is in a life or death struggle

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,660
against the Chinese Communist Party.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,180
And one man’s struggle with brain cancer

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:30,609
put him right in the middle.

5
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:35,340
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,059
The Chinese Communist Party is aggressively
expanding around the world.

7
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,739
All you have to do is listen to what Communist
officials are saying.

8
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,110
Take one of China’s top diplomats.

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,390
Yang Jiechi.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:54,010
In 2010, China was challenged by other members
of ASEAN about the South China Sea Dispute.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,940
Yang thundered in response, “China is a
big country and other countries are small

12
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,649
countries, and that’s just a fact.”

13
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,910
Very diplomatic.

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,880
So China is a big country.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,000
And the CCP uses that weight to swallow up
smaller nations, by buying off their leadership.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,660
Take the Solomon Islands, an archipelago nation
in the Pacific.

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,120
It was one of the few remaining countries
that recognized Taiwan.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,610
That is, until China bought off the central
government in 2019—in exchange for switching

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,630
allegiances to the PRC.

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,960
The Solomon Islands government even quietly
leased one of the islands to China without

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,810
telling the people living there.

22
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,470
And of course, there are bribes.

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:47,120
Daniel Suidani is the premier of Solomon’s
Islands’ most populous island, Malaita Province.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,960
He says China offered him bribes.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,910
But to Beijing’s surprise, Suidani refused
to be bought off.

26
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,130
And he’s become a big thorn in the Chinese
Communist Party’s side—because he demands

27
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,270
transparency and accountability.

28
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:11,730
And now, he’s at risk of being put on trial
for treason, for traveling to Taiwan for brain

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,980
cancer treatment.

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,070
I have Mr. Suidani with me now for more.

31
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,920
INTERVIEW
Thank you for joining me today.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,960
Thank you.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,140
Chris: So let's talk about what's called "the
switch" in the Solomon Islands, when the government

34
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,080
decided to switch diplomatic relations from
Taiwan to China.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Why did that happen?

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:41,700
Premier: First of all, I didn't agree with
the switch at all because the idea of a switch

37
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:53,840
was not in the policy agenda of the government,
And that issue of the switch hasn't been talked

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,390
about to the people.

39
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:04,181
So that idea, when the switch come over from
ROC to PRC, the switch become new to the people

40
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:09,380
because they haven't talked about during the
national campaign for the national general

41
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,310
election in 2019.

42
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,870
So the whole agenda of the switch was not
in the policy agenda for the general election

43
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,970
in 2019.

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:27,370
Premier: So that is why my government and
the people do not agree with what the national

45
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,870
government is doing in terms of the switch
from ROC to PRC.

46
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,400
Chris: So in general, the people of the Solomon
Islands aren't really supportive of the switch?

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,060
Premier: No.

48
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,320
And I'm speaking on behalf of my province,
the Malaita Provincial Government and the

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,959
people.

50
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,910
We are not happy with the switch for a few
reasons.

51
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:02,319
One, the process that has been leading up
to the switch, we believe, is not well followed.

52
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,860
It was hijacked because the government said
during a few months before the switch, that

53
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:19,269
they will consult with agencies in the government,
that before deciding on the switch, there

54
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:27,150
are four committees that should be given report
about the switch before the government can

55
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,300
switch to [inaudible 00:02:50] in regards
to the switch.

56
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,150
Premier: But that doesn't happen.

57
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:44,289
They don't have the reports, but then they
made the switch without the reports that they

58
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,289
relied on.

59
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:54,840
Secondly, because China is a communist country,
and the values that they have is so different

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,789
from the democratic values and the principle
that we have in Solomon Islands.

61
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:05,830
And it's a Christian country, and we uphold
the principles of the democracy.

62
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:14,960
So that is one of the reason why most Solomon
Island people of the nation didn't happy with

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
the switch.

64
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,659
Chris: Well, so if the people of the Solomon
Islands aren't really happy with the switch,

65
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:27,460
why did the government of the Solomon Islands
decide to recognize the People's Republic

66
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,970
of China, the communist party?

67
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,479
Premier: That is what at the moment is the
biggest question in people's mind, on how

68
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:45,349
the government decide to switch to a PRC,
because we are expecting a wider referendum

69
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:51,759
to the people so that they can well aware
of a system of government in terms of the

70
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,550
CCP.

71
00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:01,339
So at the moment with the government, the
national government, it is not a whole of

72
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:05,650
the people of the Solomon Islands that agree
with the switch.

73
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:15,439
But it seems that some of those who in the
DCGA are the ones who support a switch from

74
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,580
ROC to PRC, not everyone in the country.

75
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,310
So the switch is, even at the moment, is not
going down well with the people.

76
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,779
Chris: So it's basically something that only
a small number of elite in the central government

77
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:29,779
wanted.

78
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,360
Premier: Yes, yes, that's correct.

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,009
Chris: So what has Chinese influence brought
to the Solomon Islands?

80
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:42,289
Premier: what I've seen at the moment in the
province, there is nothing.

81
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,800
There is no developments have been seen.

82
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,339
The province is where 80% of the people live.

83
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:52,970
In terms of infrastructure and other development,
there is nothing happening.

84
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:01,469
But the only thing I've seen, well, they used
to talk about is the infrastructure for the

85
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:04,710
Pacific Games in 2023.

86
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:12,969
And that's the only development where the
China and the DCGA government had been involving

87
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:15,509
much in the country at the moment.

88
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,789
Chris: So then this is very strange.

89
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:24,759
If most of the people in the country didn't
want the switch, and if China isn't bringing

90
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,759
a whole lot of infrastructure development
to the Solomon Islands, you got to wonder

91
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,869
what was the motivation for the government
to make the switch.

92
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:41,659
It's a big question.

93
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:49,150
Premier: That question is also what we, as
the people of this nation, are still asking

94
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,369
ourselves what actually really happened to
the switch and why the government agreed to

95
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,240
switch without consulting the people of Solomon
Islands, the nation as a whole.

96
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,499
Chris: So you are the premier of the biggest
province of the Solomon Islands.

97
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:08,279
And as I hear it, you aren't too popular with
the central government.

98
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,110
I think I can kind of imagine, but why is
that?

99
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:22,970
Premier: I believe in being representative
of the people.

100
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,759
We as leaders need to carry the cries of the
people.

101
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,879
We are just representing them.

102
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,699
So when my people disagree with the switch,
it is my duty as the leader of the province

103
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:42,389
to make sure that what my people like, I have
to fight and see that what they like is what

104
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,069
I will perform.

105
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:51,410
So in regards to the switch, as the largest
province in probably the province of Solomon

106
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,079
Islands, my people disagree with the switch.

107
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:58,980
So I will stand for what they aspire to.

108
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,290
So I will not agree with the switch because
that is the like of my people.

109
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,690
I am just a representative.

110
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,140
They elected me to represent them.

111
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,750
So I will always stand for what they like.

112
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,940
This is my belief as to being a leader of
that province.

113
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,740
Chris: So essentially you've become a thorn
in the side of the central government and

114
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,370
Beijing's plans for the Solomon Islands, whatever
those may be.

115
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,350
Premier: Yes.

116
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:32,579
They have been trying to find ways to get
into the province through development that

117
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:38,990
we have been aware of their involvement in
other countries as well.

118
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:45,370
The way they do, or they perform, developments
and they interact with the people is not good.

119
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:54,250
So we haven't got any better safeguards to
safeguard ourself in terms of the influence.

120
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,500
So therefore it would be appropriate for us
to keep them away from entering the province.

121
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,959
So we have made that decision and we stand
by.

122
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,139
Chris: So what do you think is China's goals
with the Solomon Island?

123
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,650
Why are they so interested?

124
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:21,710
Premier: I believe in terms of the interest,
most in the past Chinese are the ones who

125
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:28,940
involve more in this logging industry, and
now they are moving into mining industries.

126
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,949
Chris: So last year you called for a referendum
on making Malaita Province independent from

127
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:35,949
the rest of the Solomon Islands.

128
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,440
It never happened.

129
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,230
But why did you do that?

130
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:46,800
Premier: I was trying to find out, in terms
of the referendum, how many people are still

131
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,149
having the idea of become independent or another
form of government.

132
00:10:52,149 --> 00:11:01,570
So the referendum is just to find out, a format
to find out, the minds of my people because,

133
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,360
see, we are the most [inaudible] province.

134
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,529
We need to find out what is in their mind,
what are the things now in the mind in terms

135
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,440
of the system of government that we are in
now, this is the aim of that referendum to

136
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:25,370
find out there, to go back and ask them so
that we can find out numbers, how many people

137
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:34,510
in the province still in favor of the independence
and maybe others in another form of governance.

138
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,470
Chris: When I made that announcement, they
said that was illegal.

139
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,910
It is unlawful to talk about referendum.

140
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:54,120
But in my view, I was thinking that this referendum
is just to find out from the mind of my people.

141
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,610
It is not actually going into independence
yet, but to find out from the people first

142
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,100
because we are their representative.

143
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,140
We need to find out from them “what do you
think?”

144
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:13,199
But the government think that this idea of
the referendum is unlawful.

145
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,100
So they really stopped me from doing it.

146
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,079
And they are not happy with my announcement.

147
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,670
Chris: I'm really getting a sense for why
the central government doesn't like you so

148
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,670
much.

149
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,029
Now I know you've been getting treatment for
brain cancer.

150
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:37,089
Now, what's interesting is how did that unexpectedly
get tied up in the Taiwan-China issue?

151
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:47,579
Premier: Yes, I've been sick for about six
months back in a country in Solomon Islands.

152
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:56,930
And I've been visiting doctors to check with
my severe headache, and they read the report

153
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,740
to me.

154
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:07,589
And they told me that I need to see a CT scan
machine, to go and have a CT scan to find

155
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,689
out what's happening in my brain.

156
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:20,319
So we get the report from the doctor, from
the Solomon Islands, and the only possible

157
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:28,420
way to have that CT scan, that the machine,
is to come to Brisbane.

158
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,290
Now, we find it a bit difficult because of
financial constraint.

159
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:39,410
We don't have the money because the charges
of that test is huge.

160
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,959
It's about 122,000 Australian dollars.

161
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,300
So it's really difficult for me.

162
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:58,660
So we asked our friends to help and contribute
some kind of money to help me and to get my

163
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,329
airfares to come to Australia, but that doesn't
work out.

164
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:07,499
Premier: So we asked the government to help
and still we haven't got any response from

165
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:08,499
them.

166
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:17,970
So our friends getting forth and helping me
out and putting a GoFundMe.

167
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:27,709
And that is when the Taiwanese government,
and I thank them for their help, and they

168
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:36,029
asked me to come to Taiwan, especially the
President Doctor Tsai Ing-wen, who is so generous

169
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:40,820
in allowing me to come here and looking after
me here in Taiwan.

170
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,670
So now I'm here in Taiwan because of their
help and friends who helped me do the GoFundMe

171
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:53,420
and find money to get me here for the important
medical checkup here in Taiwan.

172
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,889
Chris: So I imagine the central government
that's trying to make these relations happen

173
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:05,060
with China wasn't too happy to hear that you
were going to Taiwan to get this necessary

174
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,949
medical treatment.

175
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,209
Premier: Yes.

176
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:18,620
So actually, when we were trying to get the
formalities to come here or to come to Australia,

177
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,410
the government sent some office resource to
come and talk to me about my coming.

178
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:32,819
And they said, "We will happy to help you
if you go and see the prime minister and shake

179
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,639
his hand, and then we'll help you to go there."

180
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,819
So I said, "Oh, I will not going to do that.

181
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:42,850
It will be okay for me to die than to shake
the hand of the prime minister for that purpose."

182
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:50,389
Premier: So that is why I decide not to, because
when the government of Solomon Island think

183
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:56,220
of helping me, I assume that this is from
the People's Republic of China.

184
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,699
So I don't want to involve and to accept their
money.

185
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:00,850
Chris: Wow.

186
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,060
Well, so while we're filming this, you're
still in Taiwan.

187
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,510
I hear when you get back to the Solomon Islands,
you want to hold a democracy festival.

188
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,939
What is that, and why are you doing it?

189
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:22,889
Premier: I would like to hold this festival
because people need to look after democracy

190
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:29,939
carefully, because if we don't look after
democracy, if we don't share the idea and

191
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:37,389
the values of the democracy, we will certainly
lose it, So it would be best and good for

192
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:45,399
me to continue to talk to my people about
the importance of democracy and what is it

193
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:53,819
important for me and my people to hold on
tight to the government and to do the democratic

194
00:16:53,819 --> 00:17:01,260
system of government, because that allows
everyone in our place to look after themselves,

195
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,829
freedom to move, freedom of speech.

196
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:04,829
You can do anything.

197
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:12,740
Premier: But in a communist country that we
are now seeing gripping in the country at

198
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,320
the moment, there are other things you are
not allowed to do, and there are things you

199
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,830
are not allowed to mention, even if you have
the right to do it.

200
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:31,121
So looking after democracy, one way of doing
it is to get people to a festival that they

201
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:37,800
will hear from our people that will talk about
the system of democracy and the principles

202
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,630
and the values that we hold dear to our hearts.

203
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:49,570
So it's good for me to encourage my people
to come and have heard some people who talk

204
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,490
about democracy so they can pass it to the
future generation of our place.

205
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,040
Chris: I've heard rumors that when you return
to the Solomon Islands, you may be put on

206
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,280
trial for treason.

207
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,580
Why do you think that is?

208
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,100
And what are you risking going back?

209
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,240
What would happen if you were put on trial
for treason?

210
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:21,520
Premier: In terms of the rumors about my arrest
from here, that they will arrest me on my

211
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,970
arrival, but I'm yet to see what part of the
laws in the countries that I breached in coming

212
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,280
to get a treatment here in Taiwan.

213
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:43,780
So they have that idea, and they told, they
going to the newspaper, and they wrote it

214
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,560
in newspaper that I will be arrested on arrival.

215
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,370
So we are still yet to find out whether this
information is true from the government or

216
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:01,570
it's just rumors, but we will see what will
happen when I go back to the country, Solomon

217
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,570
Islands.

218
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,740
Chris: Well, best of luck to you.

219
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,520
This is an important fight.

220
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,430
Beijing's influence really is expanding.

221
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,530
And it, as you say, it brings more authoritarianism.

222
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,520
It doesn't bring the nice infrastructure development
that they promise.

223
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,670
It brings people potentially being put on
trial for treason for getting necessary medical

224
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,300
help.

225
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:33,770
Premier: With that, from my view, because
I've heard that there are people in China

226
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:40,970
who attended medical here in Taiwan, and if
they are also charged for treason for coming

227
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,440
here for their medical treatment in here.

228
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,920
So I was at first a patient from the Solomon
Islands, a sick patient.

229
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,330
That is why I am here, for medical treatments.

230
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:05,490
So I don't see anywhere in the laws of the
country that I broke to come to have a treatment

231
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,320
here in Taiwan.

232
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,510
But we will see what the charges is or was
when I go back to the country because they

233
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,720
are promising to arrest me.

234
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,990
So I'm prepared for anything that comes on
my way back home.

235
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,340
And because I know for sure my coming is not
on any political business.

236
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,930
I am here for medical treatments only.

237
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,240
So that is my purpose for being here in Taiwan.

238
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,250
Chris: Well, thank you very much for taking
the time to join us today.

239
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,350
I know I and everyone watching you is going
to be following your story very closely.

240
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,940
Premier: Thank you very much.

241
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,390
And thank you for watching.
