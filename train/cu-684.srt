1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,600
how would President Hillary Clinton handle
the South China Sea dispute?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,420
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,390
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,640
The South China Sea.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,180
$5 trillion dollars worth of shipping goes
through here every year.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,280
Seven countries have competing claims,

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,290
but China is taking its claims the furthest.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,760
It’s been rapidly building facilities on
disputed reefs.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,370
Basically, China has a Charmander with 2,000
Combat Points

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,930
sitting atop the world’s most contested Pokemon
Gym.

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,269
So will team blue dare to challenge team red?

13
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:46,379
Well, that may depend on who the next president
is.

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,530
In this two-part series,

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,879
I’m joined by senior America correspondent,
Matt Gnaizda.

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,710
On today’s episode, Hillary Clinton.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,019
Thanks for joining us, Matt.

18
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,179
Hi Chris.

19
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,170
If Hillary Clinton becomes the next US president,

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,539
how would she handle the South China Sea dispute?

21
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,519
Hillary Clinton has been accused of many things,
Chris.

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,890
But one of them that’s hard to dispute is
that she’s firmly status quo.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,890
Meaning?

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,380
She wants things to get better,

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,340
but still pretty much within the same framework
as before.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,070
Except, obviously, with herself as president.

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,280
So what does this mean for the South China
Sea?

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,470
Clinton has been involved in the South China
Sea since ancient times, Chris.

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,540
Back in 2009, her first overseas trip as Secretary
of State was to Asia.

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,079
She made 61 more visits to Asian countries
after that.

31
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,720
That’s way more than average.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,119
And one of her key missions

33
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,359
was building an alliance among Asian countries
to counterbalance China.

34
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,740
Like the Trans Pacific Partnership?

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,189
Yeah, that’s one of them.

36
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,170
The TPP is an economic agreement among 10
countries,

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,399
half of them in Asia,

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,229
but none of them are China.

39
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,229
If it gets ratified,

40
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:53,240
it will boost trade between the US and a bunch
of countries...

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,369
that are not China.

42
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:55,369
In other words,

43
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,530
big businesses would be able get their stuff
made

44
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,090
in other third-world countries for cheap.

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,780
Don't be so cynical, Chris...

46
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,719
even though that's completely true.

47
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,549
Ok, but what about China’s military buildup
in the South China Sea?

48
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,680
Well, Clinton helped Obama design the so-called
“Pivot to Asia”

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,090
a term she accidentally coined in 2011.

50
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,480
It’s a way of shifting US attention to Asia,

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,670
with the not-so-secret mission of containing
China and North Korea.

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,630
And what was Clinton’s play here?

53
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,070
First, building diplomatic guanxi—relationships.

54
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,400
She spent much of her four years as Secretary
of State

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,290
building relationships with other Asian countries,

56
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,420
letting them know the US is their friend,

57
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,410
and friends stand together against an encroaching
China.

58
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,560
And second, backing it up with a strong military
presence.

59
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,840
The US spends about $6 billion dollars a year
to maintain

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,490
80,000 troops and more than 100 military installations

61
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,410
in Japan and South Korea.

62
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,170
Plus the US has military agreements with

63
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,980
the Philippines, Singapore, and others in
the region.

64
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,950
So under President Clinton,

65
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,590
it would be like the US knocks on China’s
door

66
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,200
to ask for a peaceful relationship,

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,220
while standing behind her

68
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,910
is an entourage consisting of pretty much
everyone else in the region.

69
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,910
Right.

70
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,712
But she absolutely does not want a war,

71
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,670
and I think she’d avoid that at all costs.

72
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,370
But China is already sort of at war with the
US.

73
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,060
China has thousands of spies,

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,450
they’ve hacked into US infrastructure,

75
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,140
they know US military secrets.

76
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,140
Exactly.

77
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,460
Now, I don’t doubt that US could beat the Chinese military

78
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,370
in any boots-on-the-ground conflict.

79
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,750
Mmm, America.

80
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,510
But war isn’t about who can kill more people.

81
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,290
It’s about who can make the other side give
in first.

82
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,180
And China’s spies and hacking you mentioned

83
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,550
could devastate the US in ways that are hard
to fathom.

84
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,370
So, Clinton doesn’t want the kind of war
where China pulls out all the stops.

85
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,540
So how can she prevent war?

86
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,530
Well I think she’s willing to work closely
with China

87
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,900
no matter how anti-China

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,640
her campaign rhetoric may sound from now till
November.

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,081
Look, in 2008, Senator Clinton said

90
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,020
President Bush should boycott the Beijing
Olympics

91
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,560
because of China’s human rights problems.

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,140
But then in 2011, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton

93
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,350
was eager to show up at China’s Shanghai
Expo.

94
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,900
She even helped raise money for the American
Pavilion there.

95
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,040
Are you saying she’s a hypocrite?

96
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,900
I’m saying she’s a politician.

97
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,370
And she would be the kind of president

98
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,370
who does whatever it takes to protect US interests
in the region,

99
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,420
whether that means being best buddies with
China’s dictators,

100
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,930
or punching them in the mouth.

101
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,700
Or some awkward combination of both.

102
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,180
And what about Donald Trump?

103
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,260
Well, I’ll have to think about that.

104
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,400
Probably that’s a whole other episode, Chris.

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,360
I think you’re right.

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,880
