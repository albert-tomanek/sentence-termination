00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,799
these homemade Chinese vehicles are incredible.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,510
Hi and welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,420
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,559
You know, the Chinese people are overflowing
with creativity.

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,980
And it's really taking them to new heights.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,070
So let's take a look at some incredible vehicles
made by your average Chinese citizen.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,070
Number 10

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,349
This farmer from Wuhan made his very own flying
saucer.

10
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:32,300
It's 12 feet wide!

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,110
Shu Mansheng was able to get it 6 feet off
the ground for over 30 seconds.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,360
And though you might think it's one of a kind,

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,930
he's actually made four others.

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,180
There's no way this UFO is just swamp gas.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,390
Number 9

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,320
A former traffic cop built himself his very
own electric car.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,539
No steering wheel?

18
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,320
No problem!

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,820
It uses foot pedals to navigate.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,449
He said he built it specifically for disabled
people and retirees.

21
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,320
And he taught himself how to make it by reading
books.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,570
Number 8

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,530
Although this may not have quite the shine
of Lamborghini,

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,350
this 9500-dollar home made version can travel
up to 160 mph.

25
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,450
Supposedly.

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,240
It was built by a 28 year old mechanic from
a farming family who said he fell in love

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,689
with cars when he was 16.

28
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,689
I have to say,

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,130
this has really inspired me to try my hand
at building my own dream vehicle

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,470
a death star.

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,470
Number 7

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,409
In China, you're not allowed to own guns.

33
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,590
But how about a tank?

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,740
It was made by a 31 year old retired PLA soldier.

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,930
He said he got the idea when his son's toy
tank broke and he asked for a new one.

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,450
I think his son will be happy with this.

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,250
Number: 6

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,100
But maybe not as happy as this guy's kid!

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,009
It took this farmer 6 months to gather the
scrap metal to make this pretty awesome looking

40
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,299
toy Lamborghini.

41
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,280
Wow, that's a million times cooler than the
Barbie Jeep Wrangler.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,860
And get this, it can travel almost 40 miles
an hour.

43
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,160
Which is probably not safe for a six year
old.

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,260
Number 5

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,849
You really can't get greener than an electric
car made out of wood.

46
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,599
Unless you were to literally paint it green.

47
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,690
He should get on that.

48
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,519
48 year old Chinese carpenter Liu Fulong put
3200 dollars into his car.

49
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,319
It can reach top speeds of 30 mph and man,

50
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,819
those missiles were a nice touch.

51
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,450
It's also apparently armored and comes equipped
with radar...

52
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,170
for some reason.

53
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,920
Number 4
Do you like cutting edge technology with a

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,340
touch of the antique and none of the chic?

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,400
Then behold this robot driven rickshaw!

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,230
It actually walks,

57
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,480
though that probably means it's not the fastest
rickshaw out there.

58
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
Number 3

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,300
You got to give this guy credit for trying
to clean up China.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,760
This DIY street sweeper has 12 rotating brooms
attached to the rear!

61
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,790
Though it seems like it would just blow dirt
onto parked cars.

62
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,849
Number 2

63
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:16,849
Believe it or not,

64
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,709
this 38 year old farmer built his own fully
functional submarine.

65
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,629
It was designed to harvest sea cucumbers.

66
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,280
He's also built 8 other miniature submarines
that can travel at a depth of almost 100 feet

67
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,379
for 10 hours.

68
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,379
Number 1

69
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,629
And finally, a wooden blade helicopter.

70
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,629
Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately,

71
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,769
for 22 year old farmer Wu Zhongyuan,

72
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,659
the local government has forbidden him from
flying it.

73
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,670
Which is too bad because he says it can get
as high as 2600 feet.

74
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,319
So which would you like to ride in most?

75
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,099
Let me know in the comment section below.

76
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,640
Once again I'm Chris Chappell,

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,799
see you next time.
