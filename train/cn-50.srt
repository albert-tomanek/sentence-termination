1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,900
Joining me in the studio today:
He reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,920
Did I win one?

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,320
TOM: Yes!
CHRIS: Good, carry on then.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,960
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,560
Indebted to *you*, good sir.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,560
And the bounciest man on the internet — Matt Gray!

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,140
Good morrow, YouTube.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,900
In front of me, I have a Wikipedia article
and these folks can't see it.

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,860
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,440
and the special prize for
particularly good answers, which is:

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,420
Today we are talking about the Centennial Light.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,760
Oooo, that sounds highbrow and commemorative.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,320
As opposed to lowbrow and commemorative.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,620
Lowbrow commemoration!

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,660
'Dave's dead.'

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,340
[Laughter]

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,140
'Back down t' pit!'

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,200
'We're commemoratin' this with a giant brass arse.'

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,240
Thing is, it is neither highbrow
nor commemorative, but...

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,260
Oh, f***.
Is it in Britain?

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,120
Er, no.
We're over in the US here.

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,080
Uh-oh.

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,600
Livermore, California.

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,240
I know what it is!
It's the really really old light bulb.

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,280
TOM: Point! [DING] In fact...
GARY: Balls!

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,460
GARY: Hang on a minute!
CHRIS: Oh, right...

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,160
So how old's this light bulb?

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,760
Have a guess. From the name.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,380
Oh, okay. Fair enough, yeah.

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,100
No, fair point, actually, because it's obviously
more than a hundred, isn't it, now?

32
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,460
Is it Edison's?

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,560
No, it's a sixty-watt, mass-produced light bulb
from the late 1890s.

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,320
MATT: Oh, it's just a bulb...
TOM: Still shining.

35
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,720
Is it on all the time, or occasionally?

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,900
All the time. It's had a couple of dropouts,
when there's been power cuts and they had to...

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,340
CHRIS: But the bulb has remained...?
TOM: Yeah.

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,660
Right! Well, I find this really interesting,

39
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,400
because I read a Thomas Pynchon novel

40
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,780
wherein one of the characters is an immortal light bulb.

41
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,080
Gravity's Rainbow.

42
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,220
Yeah. Which is weird because at the time...
it goes into this whole thing.

43
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,300
And it turns out there is a conspiracy
amongst the major light bulb manufacturers

44
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,200
to not produce anything that burns
too much over a thousand hours,

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,140
so that they can keep producing light bulbs.

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,620
Er, yeah! That is actually referenced in the article:

47
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,600
It is 'cited as evidence for planned obsolesence'... point.

48
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,380
[DING]
Wahey!

49
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,500
Ahh. So it's a light bulb that's never bust.

50
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,560
Yep.

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,280
But if you leave it on forever...
it's the turning on and off of things that blows them.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,780
That's what does it, innit? Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,140
And if it's on forever then it hasn't had the stress.

54
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,060
I'm trying to think now if I've ever had a light bulb
that's gone out while it's been on...

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
It's always when you turn it on, isn't it.

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,900
GARY: Yeah. It is, yeah.

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,680
On — plink! Yeah.

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't think I've ever had a —

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Can you imagine after a power cut,
turning that bastard back on?

60
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,240
Ah! Right. Yes.

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,480
Can you say roughly what the procedures were
when they had to move it?

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,600
Clench.

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,080
[Laughter]

64
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,980
Yeah. Walk like you are about to follow through.

65
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,420
Or you might put it on a trolley,
actually, the more I think about it.

66
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,800
Ring the insurance company.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,320
Ring the insurance company, certainly...

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,360
It's hung up in a fire department.

69
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,500
Does that give you an idea of
how they may have moved it?

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,660
On a fire engine!

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,840
On a Dalmatian!

72
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,800
With a full fire truck escort, yes. Have a point. [DING]

73
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,500
A fire truck actually would make more sense.

74
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,680
You've still got your 'blues and twos' to clear...
or reds and whatever noise an American fire truck...

75
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
TOM: 'Reds and woos'.

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
Reds and...! 'Woo-woo!'

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,100
Have a point!

78
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,180
But you've got all that mass...

79
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,120
which is keeping the thing
from bucking around as much.

80
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,380
And if anyone hits it, it's not going to move anywhere.

81
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah. Also, fire engine — electrical device — water.

82
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,920
In a fire, someone's going to be —

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
It's not going to be on.

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,820
Yeah, it's not like the fire engine —

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
No, I don't think it's on in the fire...!
I mean when you've got it up in the fire station!

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,360
There's going to be someone servicing an extinguisher
at some point, and being like, 'Ooh s***!'

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,480
Even if you've got it in a little box or something,
which I assume you must do.

88
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,400
It was transferred in a box.

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,980
Well, naturally! It's not going to be
in someone's helmet, is it?

90
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,320
Was it the original box?

91
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,060
TOM: I don't believe so, no.

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,460
Is this thing still pristine, 'new in box'
when it goes on eBay?

93
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,340
Wrapped in cellophane ready for eBay, yeah.

94
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,340
[Laughter]

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,720
'Light Bulb — Condition...'

96
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,400
'Near mint.'
[Laughter]

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,380
'As new. Only 100 years use.'

98
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,560
It's just sat next to a Polo.

99
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,360
'Near mint.'
[Groans]

100
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,140
What colour is it?

101
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,960
CHRIS and MATT: See-through!

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,180
It's a light bulb.

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,800
That's not a stupid question.
It's a fire station. It might be red.

104
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,560
Okay, yes...

105
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,380
No... fire station, not brothel.

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Yeah. Although... you know.

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,680
MATT: What?!
TOM: You get the two confused sometimes.

108
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,560
Roxanne got a new job anyway.

109
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,120
She does have to put on the red light now.
But only when going to and from a job.

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,980
Tesla won't have liked it, will he?

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,420
Tesla probably *would* have liked it.
Edison wouldn't have admitted that Tesla liked it.

112
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,520
Yes, that's true. Edison would have tried to
make money from it, you're absolutely right.

113
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,700
There is a webcam dedicated to —

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,340
F***'s sake.

115
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,400
Have a photo!

116
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,400
It's gonna be on until it goes off!

117
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,860
Ah! What happened on the evening
of May the 20th, 2013?

118
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,920
Did it turn off?

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,240
Yes it did. [DING]

120
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,380
Did it bust, or did it...?

121
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,720
And that was the question. Have a point. [DING]

122
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,580
Because all they know is, the light has gone out.
So they called —

123
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,340
Could they not have just thumped the switch?

124
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,600
GARY: Yeah.

125
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,980
Well, no — it's connected to
an uninterruptible power supply.

126
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,720
This is a lot of f***ing effort for a light bulb.

127
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,180
They put a UPS on the light bulb?

128
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,220
They put a UPS on the light bulb.
You know what happened to that UPS?

129
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,700
MATT: It died.
TOM: It was interrupted, yes.

130
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,300
You know why it was interrupted?

131
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,940
Because someone plugged a cord in the wrong socket.

132
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,140
So they've got to very gently turn it back on again.

133
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,340
Yes. Well, I don't think you can gently turn on a light bulb.
I don't think that is a thing that's possible to do.

134
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
I don't know. I'm not an expert...

135
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,360
I'd say I defer to Matt, but... could you not
just sort of have a dimmer switch dealie?

136
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,900
I'm thinking dimmer switch.

137
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,360
Just slowly build up the current — I mean, more subtly...

138
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,600
probably use something that digitally manages the amount of current like an electric speed controller.

139
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,200
Probably, but those kind of things induce
a load of noise, so that probably wouldn't...

140
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,300
Oh, right.

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,340
What's the problem with it being noisy?

142
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,700
You mean a different kind of noise, don't you.

143
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,680
*Electrical* noise.

144
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,460
Ah, scientists.

145
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,920
CHRIS: You know, like prog rock.
GARY: Yeah.

146
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,820
So what's the second oldest light bulb, then?

147
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,940
'Cos me Nana's house did have one for a long time.

148
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,620
CHRIS: Actually, our spare storeroom...
GARY: Like it.

149
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,980
Yep. We lost the light in the bathroom, so we've got to
find something to just do tonight, can't go out...

150
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,800
So we've got this little back storeroom...

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,360
Right. Go in, pull it out: "Oh! Old 40-watt!"

152
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,420
Not energy-saving or anything else...

153
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,520
Well, they've been "illegal" for however long now...

154
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,600
I was like, "Oh well, that's quite odd..."
Woolworths branded.

155
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,000
ALL: Ohhh...

156
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,780
...which tells its own story. So I think
we're in with a shout for second place.

157
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,720
That's the question now. Someone is out there
that potentially has the second...

158
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,300
Well, you've actually got a list here, and I'm not kidding...

159
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,960
Oh, someone's made one...

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,020
'Longest-lasting light bulbs' is indeed a Wikipedia thing.

161
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,700
Is there one in this country we can go visit?

162
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,180
Er... no, the second place one, according to the
Guinness Book of Records, is in Fort Worth, Texas,

163
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,920
at the Byers Opera House, above the backstage door.

164
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,900
Third one's in New York City, installed in 1912.

165
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,040
What did the owner try and do
to raise his profile? Of the light bulb...

166
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,260
Gave it a Facebook profile.

167
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,640
...to get up the listings somewhat?

168
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,660
Go around smashing second and first place.

169
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,440
He's the one that plugged the cable in wrong
for the Centennial Light.

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,000
GARY: [Gasps]
CHRIS: Dun dun dunnn! Scandal.

171
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,600
That is such a thing, isn't it?
That could happen.

172
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,200
Did he edit Wikipedia?

173
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,080
No, he just wrote to all the agencies
saying that it was a fraud,

174
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,540
because he was an electrical engineer
and the socket wasn't old enough.

175
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,540
Ohhh, smear campaign.

176
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,740
It was essentially a smear campaign.
Do you know what happened to this in the end?

177
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,640
GARY: No one cared.
MATT: No one gave a s***.

178
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,220
No one knows. The store and the entire block
on which it stood was torn down in 2003.

179
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,100
Ah. That's unlikely to achieve a win now, isn't it?

180
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,880
Did someone save the light bulb, though?

181
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,180
Well, there's also the question of whether
the light bulb needs to be turned on to count.

182
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,620
Yes, of course it f***ing does!
It's not a light bulb then, is it?

183
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,080
Well, it is, as an object...

184
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,720
Whoa! Oh, wow. There's a deep philosophical question in there.

185
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,600
If a light bulb is off in a forest,
is it still a light bulb?

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,260
No, the prize has got to be oldest working light bulb
or bust. Because there's tons of old light bulbs.

187
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,980
Yeah, but 'oldest working' could have been
brand new in box from a hundred years ago...

188
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,780
Switch it on, it works: Oh, I've just instantly gone ahead.

189
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,800
Rather than one that's been on-off-on-off...

190
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,040
I just think... in fairness, the other one has been on.

191
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah.

192
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,900
But otherwise, you could just trump it with a light bulb
you've had up your arse for a hundred years.

193
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,700
I like how you said 'trumpet'.

194
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,980
Brannan: official arbiter of the Light Bulb Wars.

195
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,560
The fifth longest-lasting light bulb...

196
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,840
Ipswitch.

197
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,520
Aaah! Let's go!

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,660
In England. The Martin & Newby Electrical Shop.
Dated from the 1930s...

199
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,800
Burned out in January 2001.

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,660
It's him! It's your man with the
friggin' light bulbs is doing it!

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,500
[Laughter]

202
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,500
All these say, building gets torn down,
other one burns out...

203
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,180
He's going round one by one!

204
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,000
This is drifting into Pynchon-novel territory again.

205
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,240
GARY: Yeah!

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
Now, you mentioned Edison...

207
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,880
Oh. Yeh.

208
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,400
GARY: Actually, I mentioned Edison.

209
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,200
He designed a bulb that was supposed to last forever.
What was it called?

210
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,060
Dave.

211
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,560
Everbulb.

212
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,100
Osram.

213
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
No, they're part of the conspiracy.

214
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,760
The Magnificent Bulb of Eternity.

215
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,640
I'll give you the point. Eternal Light. [DING]

216
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,940
It's in the Memorial Tower
at the Edison Memorial Museum.

217
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,460
Has it broke?

218
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,740
Er... it still kind of works,
but there is a slight problem with it.

219
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Its filament's about that big across,
and it needs 200,000 volts to get it to do anything.

220
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,660
Nope, nope.

221
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,800
Is it evil?

222
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,760
[Laughter]
TOM: Nope.

223
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,660
Radiation.

224
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,820
Ooh. No, no...

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,940
Cancer.

226
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,120
There's a slightly bigger problem with
its claim to be the longest light bulb.

227
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,480
Never been switched on ever.

228
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,100
It just isn't.

229
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,980
It just isn't. It's entirely fake. [DING]

230
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,880
It's got a series of automobile headlights around
the bottom that just make it look like it's turned on.

231
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,660
GARY: Aaargh.

232
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,500
As you said, Edison — bit of a cheat.

233
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,340
Yeees.

234
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,200
So that brings us to the end of the show...

235
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,920
Congratulations, Gary! You win this time.

236
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,820
CHRIS: Boo.

237
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,520
You win this sandwich grill that emblazons
collectible images of footballers into your bread.

238
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
It's a Panini Sticker Press.

239
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,500
Americans... I'm sorry.

240
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,160
TOM: That has been Chris Joel...
CHRIS: Goodbye.

241
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,240
TOM: Gary Brannan.
GARY: Good evening.

242
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
TOM: Matt Gray...
MATT: Bye!

243
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,260
I've been Tom Scott. That's been the
Technical Difficulties, and we'll see you next time.

244
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Mickey Johnson — Johnson Mickey.

245
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,880
[Laughter]

246
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,700
Dick Willie — Willie Dick.

247
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,180
TOM: Will he?

248
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,040
GARY: Dunno.

249
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,080
No... he was killed by a stinger.

250
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
This is a coffin ray, so it kills with...?

251
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
Coffins!

252
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,620
Just chucking boxes at folk.

253
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,160
Shark... 'Come on! I'll 'ave yer!'

254
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,560
...the tune that Blur did that
landed on Mars with Beagle 2.

255
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,260
It didn't land — well, it did land!

256
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,180
It landed!

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,140
It landed at high velocity. Downwards.

258
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,080
I know there's a thin line between 'landing' and 'impact'.

259
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,400
I tell that to the wife all the time.
