00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,490
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,750
Rumors of a coup?

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,910
Sounds like a coup for this show!

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,300
US China trade war?

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,110
Fake news!

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,650
And finally, why pollution in China is a good
thing.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,080
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,510
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,330
The rumor mill is churning in Beijing!

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,050
Word on the street is a coup attempt was launched

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,890
against Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,940
There were reports of gunfire near the heart
of the capital…

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,370
...from anti-Xi groups trying to overthrow
him.

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,180
But here’s where it gets really weird.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,860
The rumors say that black rain frog and former

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,090
former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin,

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,370
had teamed up with wood face and former leader
Hu Jintao

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,650
to overthrow Xi Jinping.

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,960
And THAT...is incredibly unlikely.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Hu Jintao was the head

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,390
of the Chinese Communist Party between Jiang
and Xi.

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,860
Hu’s on first?

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,100
Xi’s on first!

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,050
Ok, now it’s just more confusing.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,420
But anyway, before Xi Jinping became the leader
of China,

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,910
there was Hu Jintao.

28
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,380
And before him, Jiang Zemin.

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,540
And before him, Deng Xiaoping.

30
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,790
Jiang Zemin was jealous that Hu Jintao

31
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,210
got to become the leader after him,

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,640
because Jiang didn’t get to pick his own
successor.

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,030
So Jiang constantly tried to undermine Hu,

34
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,420
and also possibly tried to kill him that one
time on a boat.

35
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,400
Unfortunately for Jiang, he didn’t manage
to sink Hu’s battleship.

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,500
In any case, I think it’s safe to say Hu
Jintao did not team up

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,730
with Jiang Zemin to overthrow Xi Jinping.

38
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,810
But rumors can be a powerful force in Chinese
politics.

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,140
“Given the Party’s control over the media
and the secretive

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,479
nature of its political processes,

41
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,740
gossip and rumours have long been the stuff

42
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,760
of informal comment on the issues of the day,

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,300
and the means by which alternative accounts
of Party rule circulate.”

44
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,509
In fact, this latest incident isn’t even
the first time rumors

45
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,929
of a coup against Xi Jinping have circulated.

46
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,319
Shortly after Xi Jinping was appointed

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,269
Chairman of the Communist Party in 2012,

48
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,340
there were rumors there were gunshots heard
in Beijing

49
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,549
and that officials tied to Jiang Zemin tried
to stage a coup.

50
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:25,189
And while the actual gunshots were never confirmed,
years later,

51
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,519
a Party official publicly said that several
people in Jiang’s

52
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,769
faction did try to get rid of Xi Jinping.

53
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,719
All those people are coincidentally now in
prison.

54
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,719
Funny how that happens.

55
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,389
So will these latest rumors be confirmed?

56
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:42,529
I don’t think so.

57
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:47,079
It’s next to impossible for there to be
a Jiang-Hu alliance.

58
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,060
But, another attempt by Jiang’s faction
to stage a coup,

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,529
that is possible.

60
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,489
One thing the rumors do show though,

61
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,879
is that the factional struggle within the
Chinese Communist Party

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,510
is alive and well.

63
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,340
Can’t wait for the next episode of General
Hostility.

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,489
So those coup rumors may just be lies.

65
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,249
But you know who else is good at lies?

66
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,249
The US!

67
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:15,459
You see, according to Chinese state-run media
the People’s Daily,

68
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,059
...the idea that China steals US technology
is totally made up.

69
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,059


70
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,269
What the US is really doing, is trying

71
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,190
to “demonize China and fool the world.”

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,169
Yeah, where does the US get the idea

73
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,709
that China steals American technology?

74
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:35,739
I know those fighter jets look almost the
same,

75
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,689
but actually they’re slightly different...

76
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:42,370
...the way these two action figures are slightly
different.

77
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,730
And that’s truly special.

78
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,950
Speaking of US lies, did you know the US case

79
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,880
against Chinese trade is fake news?

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,980
That’s according to Yu Yongding, of the
Chinese state-run

81
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,269
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,

82
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,849
and member of the People’s Bank of China.

83
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,689
He says Chinese firms would never steal US
technology.

84
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,010
They don’t need to.

85
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,249
They have so much money.

86
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,639
He goes on to say that no one wins a trade
war.

87
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,799
Except China.

88
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,299
China will win this trade war.

89
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,560
Last week we talked about Apple installing

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Chinese censorship programming

91
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,459
in every single iPhone they make.

92
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,280
Well, Apple carries on its tradition

93
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,530
of one-upping its previous innovations.

94
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,560
Because now, Apple is handing all of the iCloud
data

95
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,850
for Chinese users to a Chinese state-run telecom
company.

96
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,760
The move was praised by my favorite

97
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,540
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times.

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,200
But the good news is, this will never affect

99
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,920
iCloud users outside of China.

100
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,640
Right?

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Moving on.

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,150
China’s pollution levels have hit a record
high.

103
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,060
I know that sounds bad.

104
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
But it’s actually great news!

105
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,530
You see, according to the latest research,

106
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,910
trees in Beijing actually grow quicker thanks
to all the pollution.

107
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,220
In fact, if pollution actually went down,

108
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,340
“more trees would have to be planted to
help absorb

109
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,660
the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.”

110
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,670
So fighting pollution will actually make global
warming worse.

111
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,310
By the way, that study was funded by the Chinese
government.

112
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,290
The study also found that swallowing the lies
from Chinese state media

113
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,970
is very nutritious and will keep you full
all day,

114
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,990
without packing on the pounds.

115
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,040
So what do you think?

116
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,490
Leave your comments below.

117
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,960
And before you go, it’s time to answer questions
from fans

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,190
who support China Uncensored with dollars

119
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,330
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

120
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,000
Jeremy Lim asks,

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
“Is there any hope left for a real Hong
Kong democracy?”

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,430
Jeremy, you don’t consider choosing between
three politicians

123
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,170
selected by the Chinese Communist Party real
democracy?

124
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,080
One of the agreements the Chinese Communist
Party

125
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,060
made with the UK for the handover of Hong
Kong,

126
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,950
was that in just a few short years,

127
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,280
they’d have universal suffrage,

128
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,000
and could directly vote for their Chief Executive.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,320
Well, that date kept getting pushed back.

130
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,370
And back.

131
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,670
And back.

132
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,960
Then the Communist Party finally said, ok,

133
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,060
you can have your universal suffrage,

134
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,630
but first we get to pick the candidates.

135
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,550
That’s what sparked the 2014 Hong Kong Umbrella
Movement.

136
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,680
Where I got to see Hong Kong democracy up
close.

137
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,990
To give the Party credit,

138
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,180
they realized that wasn’t a good idea.

139
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,270
So they just went back to the old system,

140
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,620
where a small group of influential citizens,

141
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,930
mostly with ties to the Communist Party,

142
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,410
get to choose the Chief Executive.

143
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,280
But hey, at least Hongkongers still get to
vote

144
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,900
for their legislative members, right?

145
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,060
Until democratically elected lawmakers started
getting purged…

146
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,430
And thrown in jail...

147
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,920
And disqualified from running in elections…

148
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,450
I’d say Hong Kong is winding up with less
democracy

149
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,110
than it had at the end of British rule in
the 90s.

150
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,060
Thanks for your question Jeremy.

151
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,830
I’m now depressed.

152
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,870
Wait a minute!

153
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,050
All I need to do is think of the amazing support

154
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,360
of all the fans of the show!

155
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,280
That chases the clouds away.

156
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,370
Remember, China Uncensored is made possible
by the support

157
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,300

158
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,200
So I’m asking, if you’re able,

159
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,950
consider supporting China Uncensored

160
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,610
