1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,680
well have you considered that maybe this genius\h
side is just a form of chinese communist party\h\h

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,880
efficiency i mean they get rid of their ethnic\h
minorities they get rid of religion and they make\h\h

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,080
a profit from selling the organs i mean it kind of\h
all wraps up nicely that's very dark yeah i mean\h\h

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,320
of course you will not find allies in those\h
technocrats who see the the the chinese model\h\h

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,040
as a solution but keep in mind that every\h
genocide in history has been justified not in\h\h

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,880
not calling it a genocide but using some excuse\h
of course the nazi tried to exterminate the jews\h\h

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,800
because they were you know parasites because\h
they were ruining the germany's economy so we\h\h

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,840
don't hate the nazis said we don't hate jews as\h
such well some something as they said also they\h\h

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,200
hadn't brought that but you know generally\h
speaking we we don't have a problem with\h\h

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,880
jews as such but jews are those people who are\h
ruining the country so for the sake of my country\h\h

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,360
i will get rid of that it's a technocratic uh\h
solution it's a technocratic approach the nazi\h\h

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,400
were the the most efficient uh rats and the soviet\h
unions so and and the soviets were the same and\h\h

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,280
maoists and chinese nowadays are the\h
perfect technocrats they they find\h\h

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,160
technical solution to what they perceive as\h
a problem so falun gong people are considered\h\h

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,160
enemies of the state they are growing too much\h
it's a movement that goes beyond the control of\h\h

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,720
the state so it's a theoretical threat to the\h
state plus we need some some supplies in for a\h\h

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,960
human transplant okay that's the solution to\h
go and harvest it's a technical it's a cynical\h\h

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,680
technical um answer if the technocrats\h
in the west who support the chinese model\h\h

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,640
uh don't understand that or even worse they\h
if they uh cover that they're they're they are\h\h

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,720
they're doing the same basically they are covering\h
it would be like you know saying that hitler was\h\h

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,240
just you know fixing the german economy it would\h
be the same i mean i'm just thinking about how\h\h

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,600
when people talk about china being ruled by\h
technocrats or you know the communist party\h\h

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,360
being technocrat well like that it's it's said\h
it's such a powerful thing a positive thing i mean\h\h

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,560
it's such i said as like it's a positive thing to\h
be a technocrat and you're pointing out that this\h\h

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,880
is actually a terrible like cold-blooded way to\h
look at the world yeah well of course it became\h\h

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:06,720
it even it depends on what what is the meaning\h
you gave to words i use technocrats in a very\h\h

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:16,560
peculiar way probably uh there is a there is a a\h
full um tradition of technocratic thoughts going\h\h

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,480
back to the of late 18th century um\h
basically basically very basically\h\h

29
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,080
saying that we don't care about spiritual problem\h
moral problem ethical problems religious problem\h\h

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,320
all these are alienations this is the language of\h
marx by the way uh what we care of are practical\h\h

31
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,760
problems and practical solutions so\h
what works is good not the reverse\h\h

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,680
i'm not looking for what is good and that and\h
try to put that at work but it if it works\h\h

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,800
it's good i mean there is a i can document a\h
tradition of technocratic thought using the the\h\h

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:12,800
using these this idea so you know the technocrat\h
is that man who sees problems only as technical\h\h

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:21,840
problems and he gives or here he or she gives\h
only technical solution they say value free\h\h

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,080
but they mean you know i basically\h
don't care about values human values so\h\h

37
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,280
if this is the meaning and i'm using technocrats\h
again in in the in this way and we have examples\h\h

38
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:45,120
when if i if i point out at the chinese model\h
as such as working and i say i don't care\h\h

39
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,160
they kill people it works right they they're\h
killing millions of people thousands of people\h\h

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,720
who cares it works so it's good that is the\h
meaning of of tech of a technocrat for me\h\h

41
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,960
uh well it's not something good uh again this\h
is why i called the nazis the best attackers\h\h

42
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,920
because they they they address things\h
uh from a materialistic technical level\h\h

43
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:21,920
uh they found a working of course you\h
know eradicating who uh people would work\h\h

44
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,800
if you if you have too many uh if you if you\h
have an economic problem and you don't have a\h\h

45
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,280
food for everyone and you see we are too many\h
uh and i say and the technocratic approach in\h\h

46
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,360
the sense that i'm using the world will be you\h
know let's kill these people and get rid of them\h\h

47
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,480
it works of course you're reducing the number and\h
the food you have will be enough for everyone but\h\h

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,800
it's completely immoral if you don't look\h
at that and if problems are only technical\h\h

49
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:05,840
problems so solutions are only technical you\h
can find a working model but they are immoral

50
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,040
you
