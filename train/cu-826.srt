1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,310
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,240
China stands up to neo-Nazis

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,280
at American Universities.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,150
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,060
Safe spaces on university campuses.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,480
This is something the Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,840
cares about.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,759
At least when it comes to American universities.

10
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:24,840
Last month,

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,070
the University of California San Diego

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,619
decided to make a neo-Nazi

13
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,939
this year’s graduation speaker.

14
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,480
Of course I’m talking about this guy.

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,040
What’s that?

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,320
You don’t think of the Dalai Lama

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,430
as a neo-Nazi?

18
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,710
Well you must have bought into all that fake news

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,370
about him being a peaceful spiritual leader
of Tibetans

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,340
oppressed by the Chinese Communist Party.

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,500
In fact, he is pretty much a Nazi.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,350
At least according to the Chinese Communist
Party.

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,340
Maybe someone should tell them about Godwin's Law.

24
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,900
Also, Saddam Hussein.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,320
You can imagine how students at UC San Diego

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,609
must have felt about having Nazi Saddam Hussein

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,100
as a commencement speaker.

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,469
Actually, you don’t have to.

29
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:12,860
Let the words of the the UCSD

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,640
Chinese Student and Scholars Association

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,229
educate you:

32
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:21,299
Uhh, it was on the Chinese WeChat platform.

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,299
It says roughly:

34
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,310
“Currently, the various actions undertaken
by the university

35
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,429
have contravened the spirit of respect, tolerance,

36
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:32,000
equality, and earnestness.”

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
“If the university insists on acting unilaterally

38
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,219
and inviting the Dalai Lama to give a speech

39
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,259
at the graduation ceremony,

40
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,060
our association vows to take further measures

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,409
to firmly resist the university’s

42
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,569
unreasonable behavior.”

43
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,619
Quartz found further dissatisfaction

44
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:51,119
from Chinese students at UCSD

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,889
on Facebook.

46
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:56,100
One says #ChineseStudentsMatter.

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,680
I mean, the Dalai Lama speaking at one University

48
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,350
is pretty much the Chinese equivalent of racial prejudice

49
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,829
against black people in the United States, right?

50
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:07,549
And this one says it’s the same

51
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,390
as forcing Muslims to eat pork—

52
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,470
which as we all know from delicious,

53
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,240
delicious Halal carts—is forbidden.

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,300
According to a statement to UC San Diego’s
paper,

55
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,090
the university doesn’t seem like

56
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,030
it’s going to back down.

57
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,120
To be fair,

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,460
Chinese state-run media has opposed pretty
much

59
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,260
every public appearance of the Dalai Lama.

60
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,390
Like when he met with President Bush.

61
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,370
And President Obama.

62
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,530
For generations,

63
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,510
history textbooks in China—

64
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,560
and I use the term “history” lightly—

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,210
have portrayed Tibet as a feudal state,

66
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,820
ruled by an oppressive, slave-driving Dalai
Lama,

67
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,240
until the glorious Communist Party

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,500
“liberated” the Tibetan people.

69
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,830
Those textbooks, of course,

70
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,510
don’t mention how the CCP is responsible

71
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,040
for the deaths of more than a million Tibetans,

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,940
including through torture, starvation, and
executions.

73
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,890
And the destruction of a huge number of Tibetan
temples.

74
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,180
But if you grew up reading that

75
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,820
the Dalai Lama was a feudal dictator

76
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,370
who enslaved his own people,

77
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,220
and that he's trying to split your country
apart,

78
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,231
of course you wouldn't want him

79
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,670
to be your commencement speaker.

80
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,720
But back to the Chinese Student and Scholars
Association,

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,960
or CSSA.

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,450
That’s the group opposing the Dalai Lama

83
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,980
speaking at UC San Diego.

84
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,040
The CSSA is actually a nationwide organization,

85
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,780
found on many university campuses.

86
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,590
It also receives “funding and directives
from the CCP

87
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,730
through its consulates.”

88
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,000
Think about that.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,030
The Chinese regime,

90
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,930
which considers itself to be at war with the
United States,

91
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,480
according to their own internal documents,

92
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,950
is funding, and guiding Chinese student associations

93
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,950
on American university campuses.

94
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,950
In fact,

95
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,010
in that that letter the CSSA wrote,

96
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,710
they even say "the Chinese Student and Scholars
Association

97
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,100
has asked the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles
for instructions,

98
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,890
and having received the instructions

99
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,710
are going to implement them."

100
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,010
And tells students not to act outside official guidance

101
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,039
of the Chinese Communist Party,

102
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,709
as "specific measures to be taken will be
elaborated on

103
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,840
in future announcements."

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,970
While that might seem like an overreaction

105
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,849
by the Chinese consulate and the CSSA,

106
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,760
the Dalai Lama belongs to one of the Chinese
regime’s

107
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,500
“No-go Topics.”

108
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:35,219
So essential to the regime’s disinformation,

109
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:38,509
that any positive mention of it anywhere in
the world

110
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,600
is a serious threat to its power.

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Inside of China,

112
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,699
they don’t have this problem.

113
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,449
The Communist Party works hard to ensure Chinese
universities

114
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,949
are places where no conflicting ideologies
or opinions

115
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,840
can be spoken aloud.

116
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,140
At least not since that pesky incident back
in the ’80s.

117
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,580
But this is America, you say.

118
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,919
And one of our strengths is allowing people

119
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,159
to express conflicting ideologies or opinions.

120
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,349
True.

121
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,129
But freedom of speech doesn't guarantee

122
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,539
freedom from consequences.

123
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,610
Like the time in college when I screened The
Room

124
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,520
for my entire dorm

125
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,180
and then they kicked me out the next day.

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,520
Some people can't appreciate true artistic genius.

127
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
The point is,

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,139
Chinese students can say what they want

129
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,860
about the Dalai Lama,

130
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,719
but other people can also point out

131
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,509
when they're wrong.

132
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:32,400
And maybe this is an opportunity

133
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,749
to think about why they feel that way

134
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,169
about the Dalai Lama

135
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,319
and whether those opinions are based on

136
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,470
twisted information created by the Communist
Party.

137
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,400
So what do you think of the Chinese Student
and Scholars Association

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,669
working together with the Chinese consulate

139
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,150
to make American universities a safe place

140
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,710
for Chinese students?

141
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,009
Leave your comments below.

142
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,169
And if you’re a Chinese student in the US,

143
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:59,629
we’d like to hear what you think, too.

144
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,750
Do you agree with the CSSA?

145
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,400
Or has your view of the Dalai Lama

146
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,669
or other aspects of Chinese history

147
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,340
changed since studying in the US?

148
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
And once again,

149
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,472
I’d like to take a moment to thank all the
fans of China Uncensored

150
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,319
who contribute to China Uncensored on Patreon.

151
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,219
Your support is what makes this show possible.

152
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,490
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

153
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,389
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

154
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,560
See you next time.

155
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,379
Mark Twain once said,

156
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,939
“Clothes make the man.

157
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,210
Naked people have little or no influence

158
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,210
on society.”

159
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,569
That’s why I always wear a suit.

160
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:38,569
Always.

161
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,509
But I didn’t always use to have such good
taste in threads.

162
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,080
Until I met Monsieur Brunold.

163
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,960
Hello, Chris!

164
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,839
With 10 years of experience,

165
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,009
Monsieur Brunold selects only the finest material

166
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,240
for his bespoke suits,

167
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,930
made at his own factory in Europe.

168
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,930
The perfect fit for the perfect suit

169
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,800
for the active man,

170
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
whether you’re skiing, mountain climbing…

171
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,120
Or Uncensoring China.

172
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,759
So if you would like to look as good as my
friend Chris here,

173
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,990
come visit our Manhattan location.

174
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,990
And the best part is,

175
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,919
he won’t just make you look good,

176
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,050
he’ll teach you everything you need to know

177
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,809
about how to dress.

178
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:21,400
And as a special bonus to China Uncensored fans,

179
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,300
we’ll include a free custom shirt

180
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,620
with the purchase of a custom suit.

181
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,620
So if you want to stand up to the forces of evil

182
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,560
while looking really good,

183
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,300
come visit Monsieur Brunold next time you’re
in New York.

184
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,229
Details below.
