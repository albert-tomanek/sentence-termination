00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,920
Hi, Chris Chappell here in the Philippines

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,460
As part of our Pivot to Asia Tour.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,540
Everyone knows that Filipino president, Duterte

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,340
has been cozying up to China.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,920
But what you may not know

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,080
is that the Philippines and China already have a long history together.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,380
That's why I'm standing here in Binondo,

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,540
the oldest Chinatown in the world -

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,500
over 400 years old.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,620
So I thought I'd show you around, but

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,480
we could probably get a local to help me - show me around...

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
Hey, excuse me, sir!

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,100
You're Chris Chappell!

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,020
Oh my God, fellow YouTuber  Travis Kraft!

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,920
You look a bit lost,

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm the perfect guy

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,820
if you need any help being shown around.

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,440
I can take care of that for you.

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,200
What a wonderful, unstaged coincidence!

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's go...

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,720
Thanks, Travis

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,440
I appreciate you taking the time

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,220
to show me around the Philippines.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,680
Absolutely. And here's the river, and it actually looks like they cleaned it up.

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,180
Wow.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,800
Believe it or not, it was worse.

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,360
What a wonderful smell you discovered!

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,580
Hi!

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,020
What a surprise seeing you here.

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,360
I've been looking for you, actually. Where did you go?

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,900
Chris, this is Imabelle, my wife.

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,840
I think you've seen her on my channel.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,660
You look so familiar!

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,620
I recognize you from the show. What another coincidence!

35
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,660
I'm so excited!

36
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,880
You're here!

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,800
So are you gonna join us and help show me around?

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,640
My pleasure!

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,680
Wonderful!

40
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,100
Here we are, Chris!

41
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,060
Hopia!

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,440
So tell me a bit about this hopia.

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
What's special about it?

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,360
Hopia is favorite Chinese snacks.

45
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,760
There's a lot of flavors here that you can choose from.

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,700
I personally like munggo.

47
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,900
There's different kinds of munggos as well,

48
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
but if you wanna try that, then go for it!

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,080
Munggo is a type of bean.

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,560
It's not mango - munggo.

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, a bean - okay.

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,560
What's that, Shelley?

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,440
Go for the ube and cheese...

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,900
Thanks, Shelley...

55
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,580
Ube and cheese - let's get in there.

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,960
I bit it on the cheese end.

57
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,960
That's pretty nice!

58
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,140
It's very sweet cheese.

59
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,040
If it's good, if something here is delicious -

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,200
you should say,

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,480
"Ang sarap sarap!"

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,080
Ang sarap sarap!

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,220
Yeah, ang sarap sarap!

64
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,520
I like that!

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,540
Ang sarap sarap!

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,880
So this is obviously a Catholic church.

67
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,780
Catholicism here is radically different from what Americans think of Catholicism.

68
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,700
In America, there's a lot of emphasis on sin and living a moral lifestyle.

69
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,860
Here, it's less of that. A lot of people here

70
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,720
seem to have the attitude that

71
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,560
you can do whatever you want during the week,

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,200
but so long as you tell Jesus you love him,

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,420
He'll forgive you.

74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,560
There's a lot of influence from the native religions before Catholicism.

75
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,240
So animism has a lot of influence. A lot of influence from animism.

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,700
And other native things.

77
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,260
So you'll see people going to church,

78
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,800
lighting candles for sculptures and pictures,

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,520
touching pictures of saints or the Virgin Mary,

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,400
crying and stuff...

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,220
When you see that, it's a little hard to imagine

82
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,220
Americans doing something like that and being so dramatic.

83
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,120
Early Chinatown was filled with mostly Catholic Chinese, correct?

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,380
It was actually started by the Spanish.

85
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,780
Spanish leader started this for Chinese Catholics.

86
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,520
And it was kind of a way to separate things,

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,900
to kind of segregate things.

88
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,520
The Spanish can live over here, and the Chinese can live over here...

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,660
And they could have that separation.

90
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,360
I guess they weren't into multiculturalism.

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,860
I guess not.

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,640
Apparently, we came in the middle of the wet season, so it's raining now.

93
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,400
So were gonna hop into one of these, uh...

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
deathtraps,

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,140
And go to a nearby Taoist temple.

96
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,240
Allen gave me a camera so I'm gonna be the cameraman for a little bit.

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
Oh, it's vibrating...

98
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,500
This is quite tight and scary.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,880
This is just a motorcycle with a cage wrapped around it.

100
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,020
So how many people normally fit into one of these things?

101
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,940
Um, three people.

102
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,380
Most of them aren't our size, though.

103
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah, you lift weights, don't you, Travis?

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,380
A little bit.

105
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,240
So tell me more about the influence of China in the Philippines.

106
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
There's so much of a big impact

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,100
in terms of the food they eat here,

108
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,380
the holidays,

109
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,780
and Chinese people are very superstitious -

110
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,980
Filipinos very superstitious,

111
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,860
so there's a lot of crossover in terms of all of that.

112
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,900
So the cultures really have fused together - Oh my God!

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
Are we flipping upside down?

114
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
Travis, you're too big!

115
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,100
I'm gonna lean forward.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,080
It felt like the whole thing was almost flipping.

117
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,160
Well, welcome to the last episode of China Uncensored.

118
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
I'm here with Ima and Travis...

119
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,300
How do the Filipinos feel about the new relations Duterte is pushing with China?

120
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,800
Happy.

121
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,860
We get to talk to different people, from taxi drivers to professionals,

122
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,000
well-educated, not-so-educated,

123
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,040
Some people say that they're not really

124
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,560
okay with Duterte trying to partner with China,

125
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,820
because they don't want communism.

126
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,940
Some people say, "I think it's good,

127
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,700
let's just trust Duterte because maybe it's his strategy

128
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,720
to make everything better for the Philippines."

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,080
Ah, interesting...

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,720
This is madness.

131
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,460
So I can definitely appreciate why you would want public transit,

132
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,020
because I would not want to drive in this!

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,300
This isn't madness. This is Manila!

134
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,380
This is Manila!

135
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,620
They took us to a different temple. It was a long, pleasant drive.

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,440
Hey, a Buddhist temple!

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,940
You can tell by all of the swastikas.

138
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,660
You know, the swastika is an ancient symbol,

139
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,700
and should not be associated with the Nazis.

140
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:10,720
It's an ancient symbol that's been found in the relics of ancient Greece,

141
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,140
I've seen it in viking temples,

142
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,180
Indian culture, Buddhist culture...

143
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,320
It's a sacred symbol - take it back from the Nazis!

144
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,020
So it's amazing to see all the ways

145
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,180
over the hundreds of years to the present they've been here.

146
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,640
And continuing to impact it - well certainly moreso now.

147
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,900
There are many temples in Binondo,

148
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,400
but the number of Buddhists here is not really big.

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
It's because there are many Chinese here.

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,320
And there are many Chinese here who are Buddhist and, at the same time, Christian.

151
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,560
So they identify as Christian and Buddhist!

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,300
A Buddhist nun here told us that,

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,380
you can be both Buddhist and Christian at the same time

154
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,760
They don't really conflict with each other since Buddhism

155
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,540
is not about worshiping a god.

156
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,780
Buddha's not God.

157
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,400
The idea is that Buddha - and there's been many Buddhas -

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,520
but the one that we call the Buddha

159
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,740
-  he's attained enlightenment and ultimately

160
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,400
that's supposed to be our goal.

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,320
But that's a very difficult thing to do, and it might take the course of several lifetimes to do it,

162
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,140
but that's the goal. It's like a reminder when we look at the statues of Buddha.

163
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,540
We're supposed to attain to that perfection,

164
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,020
as elusive as it is.

165
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,900
Yep, I think I've gained enlightenment.

166
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,180
Shall we move onto the next place?

167
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,680
Okay, let's go.

168
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,860
Alright, great.

169
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,340
So the history of the Filipino Chinatown is pretty interesting in Manila.

170
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,220
I know at the beginning there was a lot of tension between the Spanish and colonial government.

171
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,400
There were issues of Chinese pirates who were unrelated to the

172
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,160
Filipino Chinese, but

173
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,140
that still creates tensions.

174
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,700
Then there was an uprising in the 1600s

175
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,200
which ended with the colonial government killing almost the entire 20,000

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,640
inhabitants of this Chinatown.

177
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
I sure am thirsty after all that exhaust I inhaled.

178
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,260
You can have some buko juice.

179
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,560
Wow, how perfect to have this right here!

180
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,780
So this is a coconut, right?

181
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,420
Less than a dollar!

182
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,820
Young coconut, that's what this is.

183
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,540
And he just pulled a machete outta nowhere.

184
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,780
It's kinda funny because

185
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,560
we're drinking out of coconuts

186
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,660
you would think we're in a tropical island paradise

187
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,420
but instead we're in this place.

188
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,340
Alright, cheers!

189
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,840
So where can I buy some nice Chinese souvenirs?

190
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,200
This is all made in China.

191
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,380
So for dinner,

192
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,060
is there any place we can go to

193
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,240
where they have something like Filipino food

194
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,160
and Chinese food together, all in one plate?

195
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,120
What an unplanned coincidence!

196
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,900
I'm so excited to try authentic Filipino Chinese food!

197
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,100
Well, we're here!

198
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,660
Oh. It's the Filipino Panda Express.

199
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,100
Okay, I got us some authentic Filipino Chinese buns.

200
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,400
It's kind of amazing how Filipino culture and Chinese culture have mixed together

201
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,100
to form something totally new.

202
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,520
And I hope you had a good time and learned some stuff.

203
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,140
How were we as your tour guides?

204
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,680
You guys were definitely the best tour guides I've ever had in the Philippines.

205
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,760
Alright let's dig in - uh, these look interesting...

206
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,400
It's filled with chocolate.

207
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,100
I think we're probably done for the day.

208
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,540
Well, thank you again.

209
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,100
Be sure to check out Travis's channel, it's called "Travis Kraft."

210
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,560
He's an actor and he gives you an inside look at the Philippines.

211
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,580
Ima is on there as well.

212
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,820
Once again, thank you for watching this episode of China Uncensored,

213
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,320
See you next time on our Pivot to Asia Tour.
