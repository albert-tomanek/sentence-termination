1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,840
ISIS.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,309
They’ve got lots and lots of guns.

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,139
And where did those guns come from?

5
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:09,139
You guessed it:

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,440
A lot of them came from China.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,500
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,750
It turns out ISIS—

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,529
the so-called Islamic State—

11
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,560
has been getting a lot of its weapons from
China.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,980
Almost half.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
The good news is,

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,189
ISIS has taken a real licking in Iraq.

15
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,390
“This is liberation day for Iraq”

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,430
ISIS has been nearly completely driven from
Iraq

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,040
and politicians say that victory

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,790
is close in the entire region.

19
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,050
“The Islamic State’s military organization
in the Levant

20
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,920
is nearly totally defeated.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,460
I am confident that in the coming weeks,

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,280
we can reach this military victory

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,340
on the ground.”

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
But not so fast, says Conflict Armament Research—

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
or CAR.

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,450
They’re an organization that uncovers

27
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,460
how terrorist groups like ISIS

28
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,199
get their weapons.

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,479
They say that ISIS terrorists still

30
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,649
“pose a grave threat to regional

31
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,270
and international security.”

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,850
One reason is that ISIS forces

33
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,499
“are in possession of advanced weapon systems,

34
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:18,509
which will pose a threat to

35
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,659
regional and international forces

36
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,060
in the years to come.”

37
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,109
And thanks to that,

38
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,170
ISIS still has the “capacity

39
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,630
to conduct insurgency and terrorism

40
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,829
well beyond the region” of the Middle East.

41
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,670
CAR has been investigating how weapons

42
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,149
are falling into the hands of terrorists,

43
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,539
because that helps identify weak links

44
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,979
in supply chains—

45
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,090
ideally, so that weak links can be fixed,

46
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,249
and guns kept away from the bad guys.

47
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,679
This guy with the baseball hat

48
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:49,720
is Damian Spleeters.

49
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
He may look more like

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,130
Freddie Mercury than Sherlock Holmes––

51
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,560
but he’s 100% weapons detective.

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,109
He looks for clues to find out

53
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,380
where weapons come from.

54
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,979
Nearly all military munitions—

55
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,619
from bullets to missiles—

56
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,140
are marked in some way.

57
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,080
Illegal suppliers often try to destroy

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,070
engravings or codes stamped into steel,

59
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,210
but you can still usually identify

60
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,680
where they came from.

61
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,350
And—according to the CAR report—

62
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,050
nearly half of the weapons in the hands

63
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,300
of ISIS fighters come from China.

64
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,040
Yes, 43.5 percent of munitions

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,910
documented in Iraq and Syria

66
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,640
were made in China.

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,350
They may not be the highest quality,

68
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,330
but far more than from any other country.

69
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,580
These are just some of the lethal toys

70
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,140
ISIS supposedly had its hands on.

71
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,630
“T-55 tanks”

72
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,120
“...122mm BM-21...

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
these systems can fire

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,140
multiple rockets per second

75
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,320
at a range of about 13 miles”

76
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,100
“Chinese HJ-8...

77
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,740
HJ-8s highly effective against armor,

78
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,810
bunkers, and fortifications.”

79
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,930
Now, it’s true that the country of origin—

80
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,470
where weapons are made—

81
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,160
is only half the story.

82
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,450
It’s also important as

83
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,610
how they get into the hands of terrorists.

84
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,110
And according to CAR,

85
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,240
the ones to blame for illegal weapons

86
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,940
getting into the hands of terrorists

87
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,680
aren’t always the ones that make them,

88
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,270
but often the ones that buy them legally

89
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,360
and then illegally supply them

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,220
to unauthorized users.

91
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,240
So, what’s crucial is not who makes it,

92
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,890
but how it gets spread around.

93
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,440
Take the US, for example.

94
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,990
Even though only 1.8 per cent of the weapons

95
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,650
in ISIS hands are US-made,

96
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,040
the United States has played a larger role.

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
According to the report,

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,930
the US bought weapons,

99
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,510
mostly from Eastern Europe,

100
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,530
and diverted them to Syrian rebels,

101
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,730
who were fighting against the dictator of
Syria.

102
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,590
And then ISIS got them from the Syrian rebels.

103
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,400
Our battlefield sleuths know this

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,480
because they ran a trace on these weapons.

105
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,650
Ok, this is how it works.

106
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,310
When Spleeters or another Sherlock

107
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,170
finds a gun used by ISIS fighters,

108
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,500
he checks the serial number

109
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,250
or other identifying features.

110
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,940
It’s like running the plates.

111
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,840
Say it was made in the US.

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,180
He sends the US government a trace request.

113
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,540
If the trace request gets approved—

114
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,959
bang—you can map out the supply chain

115
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,259
and find out where things went wrong.

116
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,169
Thanks to traces approved by governments

117
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,370
that are serious about keeping guns

118
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,360
out of the hands of terrorists,

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,860
we know that the United States

120
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,419
bought a bunch of weapons

121
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,990
and then diverted them to Syrian rebels.

122
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,509
It’s not always pretty,

123
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,210
because you sometimes get egg on your face.

124
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,759
But knowing the truth helps the US military

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,610
keep weapons out of terrorist hands.

126
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,550
Which is their goal.

127
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,879
But things look a little different

128
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,689
when it comes to a few other countries—

129
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,350
like China.

130
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,790
You see, even though China

131
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,999
made about half of the arms in ISIS hands,

132
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,910
CAR investigators only know how about

133
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,539
7% of these got there.

134
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,270
The Iraqi and Sudanese governments

135
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,229
bought them from China.

136
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,189
Then ISIS stole them.

137
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,889
But how the other 93% or so of Chinese guns

138
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,110
fell into ISIS hands...

139
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,400
that’s a mystery not even our

140
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,169
tattooed Sherlock could solve.

141
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,039
At least not until the Chinese government

142
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,220
agrees to run a trace.

143
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,199
And so far, according to CAR,

144
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,819
that just hasn’t happened.

145
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,569
I’m not saying the Chinese regime

146
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:27,479
is covering something up.

147
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,520
They would never do that!

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,499
I’m just saying the Chinese regime

149
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,930
has refused to cooperate.

150
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,930
So it’s nearly impossible to find out

151
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,199
how ISIS got most of its Chinese weapons.

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
Ah, the Chinese Communist Party:

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,590
Helping to make the world a safer place

154
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,240
by dodging the bullet when it comes to accountability.

155
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
And refuse to say where the bullet came from.

156
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,169
Of course, China’s not the only one.

157
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,700
Russia has also refused trace requests

158
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,949
and the United States has refused a few as
well.

159
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,259
But at the end of the day,

160
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,069
it’s guns made in China

161
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,689
far more than anywhere else

162
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,150
that are ending up in the hands of terrorists.

163
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,150
And coming up after the break,

164
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,150
if you think the Chinese regime loves guns,

165
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,150
well, wait till you see their new hypersonic
missiles.

166
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,150
So what do you think about China

167
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,150
refusing to provide critical information

168
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,979
about how ISIS got its guns?
