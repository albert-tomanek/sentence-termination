1
00:00:01,061 --> 00:00:07,645
Falun Gong, a meditation practice that attracted
hundreds of millions in China during the nineties

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:13,630
until they became pawns in a grab for power
by former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

3
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:18,998
To expand his control over the military and
security apparatus of the communist party,

4
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,382
Jiang launched a nation wide persecution to
wipe out Falun Gong.

5
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:27,978
Now, practitioners face imprisonment torture
and death

6
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:32,751
So you might wonder, mm, how can I get in
on that?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,151
yes, practicing Falun Gong sure sounds appealing
doesn't it?

8
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:40,182
So why would anyone want to practice? Good
question

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,982
but where am I gonna find Falun Gong practitioners
in New York?

10
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,027
May 13th is World Falun Dafa Day
which is apparently 'a thing'.

11
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:55,839
More than 8000 Falun Gong practitioners from
around the world made their way to New York

12
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:58,150
City last week to mark the occasion.

13
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:01,540
On May 15th thousands of Falun Gong practitioners

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,226
are marching in a parade from near the united
nations building to the other end of the city.

15
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:14,550
Passing right in front of the Chinese Consulate.
hehe he he he...

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,860
For some onlookers from mainland China, it
must have been a shock to see American police

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,709
protecting Falun Gong practitioners rather
than what their chinese counterparts would do.

18
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,509
They may have also been surprised at the number

19
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,479
of what appears to be non-chinese Falun Gong
practitioners.

20
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,420
After all part of the propaganda from the
communist party is that Falun Gong is not

21
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,791
accepted outside China either.
which doesn't look like it's true.

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,235
Uh, you don't happen to be Chinese.

23
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:52,865
No I'm not.

24
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:56,389
No.. so... what are you doing here?

25
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,180
doing here. well, I took part in the parade

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,320
because I've been practicing Falun Gong since
2002.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,360
And you are not Chinese, correct?
No, I'm not Chinese. I'm ethnically Finnish.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,689
I don't even speak Chinese, which I kind of
regret.

29
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:17,518
Finish? we haven't even started! haha

30
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:21,000
so, what happens when you meet a person from mainland China

31
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,558
and they find out you're a
Falun Gong practitioner?

32
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:28,520
They're always shocked. They're always shocked
or surprised.

33
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,840
they're like:"oh they're crazy people".

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,020
and one said: they try to tear out their guts to find

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,250
this thing in them because that's what their master tells them.

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,670
and I'm like: "wait, no no, I practice, that's
not at all, actually.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,440
so I can tell that they've been brainwashed
it's so weird ..."

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,340
some reactions you get are quite stark, and they run away.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,629
They actually run away? well, almost.

40
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,620
and we're getting along really good and i'll say a little bit in Chinese

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,440
and tell them I'm a Falun Gong practitioner.

42
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,840
and it's interesting because we're having
this really polite discourse and then all

43
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,810
of a sudden the hardwiring wants to fire but
they're conflicted because they're like:

44
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,170
I was just having a really nice time with this person and now I'm supposed to hate him..

45
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,751
How many self immolations have you witnessed?

46
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,140
None. That would be emphatically none.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,640
How much is the CIA paying you to say that?

48
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,100
Do I look like CIA? I would really...

49
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,084
How would I know what a CIA looks like?
What are you insinuating?

50
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,072
So how much are you being paid to be here?
Nothing

51
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:31,400
nothing. doesn't seem like a very good job
then.

52
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,113
it's a perfect job. it's a great job. I actually
lead classes in the UK, Falun Dafa classes, for free.

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,717
and i'm very happy to be here, for
free, to take part in this parade.

54
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:45,180
it's a great experience.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,500
Well, I started practicing Falun Gong before any persecution started in China

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,340
oh, so you've been practicing a long time

57
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,600
yeah.
so we were just happy people, giggling together

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,780
in the park about our attachments and about
becoming better people and doing meditation

59
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,971
and doing these exercises.

60
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:06,320
But it means always putting other people first,
and other people's interests first.

61
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,480
and no matter where you are, whether you know them or not.

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,380
I think that's a really base line if I had to think of something.

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,947
that sounds so dangerous and subversive.

64
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:23,280
it's a self cultivation practice after all
so I'm trying to improve my character and

65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
myself through the truth...

66
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,680
you've kinda got a shifty character I gotta say

67
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,140
(laughs) i'm not really that shifty

68
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,050
sinister laugh. oh really?
you're british. all the villains are british.

69
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,335
that's how americans make it out, isn't it?

70
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,669
and one more thing you said you sing opera.

71
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,460
I sing classical music which includes opera and art song and things like that

72
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,340
so that's what i studied concomitant with political science.

73
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,820
concomitant. wow. i've never heard that word before.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,139
and so what's the appeal of practicing Falun Gong concomitant

75
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,559
with the persecution that's happening?

76
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:05,288
uh, can you rephrase that?

77
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:09,870
well, how about we hear it?
what? you're kidding me.

78
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,530
gotta release tension.
go with the flow.

79
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,070
i just walked for 3 hours in the sun!

80
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,650
because i'm a student and studying all the time

81
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,490
I always feel I can think clear after
doing the meditation exercise.

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,960
this is in public. it's a nuisance.
no, it's not a nuisance. how bad are you? (laughs)

83
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,760
my experience being able to really filter

84
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:36,806
out all the anxieties, difficulties, vices
and what not that come with regular life.

85
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:43,609
which really helps me when I go do the actual exercises and then the energy flow is much stronger.

86
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,960
so that link between mind and body is very much a part of Falun Gong, and part

87
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,100
of what drew me too.

88
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:22,899
That was awesome!! that was better than when i was playing with the dragon earlier today.

89
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,400
actually that's not true. i'm sure i couldn't

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,440
play a dragon the way you play a dragon.
that's probably true.

91
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:33,729
so after speaking to so many Falun Gong practitioners
today I was inspired.

92
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,919
I genuinely wanna find some way to help out.
and then it hit me

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,520
okay guys it's time to storm the Chinese consulate.
who's with me?

94
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,225
we don't really do that kind of stuff

95
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,491
Fine. i'll do it myself.
