1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,490
China is testing President Biden

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,200
With the most aggressive action against Taiwan
yet

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,590
How will the Biden Administration Handle China?

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:19,539
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

It helps detect if your private information
has been leaked online, or is part of a data

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,349
breach.

8
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:37,160
So, just days into Biden’s Presidency, the
Chinese Communist Party issued its first military

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,340
challenge—by flying warplanes close to Taiwan.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,690
Just a few days after US President Joe Biden
took office, Washington and Beijing are battling

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:53,070
in a show of force in the South China Sea,
following reports from Taiwan of a large incursion

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,270
of Chinese warplanes for the second straight
day.\h

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,640
This weekend marked an escalation.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,030
China dispatched fighters and bombers, rather
than reconnaissance aircraft, as had generally

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,470
been the case.

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,390
This was a major challenge to Biden by the
Communist Party.\h

17
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,990
It comes after the Trump Administration offered
unprecedented US support for Taiwan,

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,990
from weapons sales

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,570
to high level diplomatic visits.

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,930
Pompeo even reframed the entire US Taiwan
relationship.

21
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,720
But was it really a trap for Biden?

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,690
In a sense, yes.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,250
The Trump Administration basically put Biden
in a position where he either carries on US

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:40,690
support for Taiwan, angering Chinese leaders,
or he changes course, and sends out signals

25
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,090
he’s going soft on the Chinese Communist
Party.\h

26
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,970
The Biden Administration started with an important
foreign policy signal by inviting Taiwan’s

27
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,900
de facto ambassador to the US to President
Biden’s inauguration.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,490
It was the first time that a Taiwanese official
had attended an inauguration since 1979.

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,870
The Chinese Communist Party also tested Biden
almost immediately with their aircraft incursions

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,360
over Taiwan.\h

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,070
And in response to the Chinese aircraft incursion,
Biden’s State Department said, “Our commitment

32
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,100
to Taiwan is rock-solid.”

33
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,150
And also this:

34
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,780
A U.S. aircraft carrier group has entered
the South China Sea, the U.S. military said

35
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,870
on Sunday...

36
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,350
The carriers entered the South China Sea on
Saturday, the same day Taiwan reported a large

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,770
incursion of Chinese bombers and fighter jets
into its air space in the vicinity of the

38
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,570
Pratas Islands.

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,390
This comes after more than a year of the Chinese
military ramping up pressure on Taiwan.

40
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:52,770
“Chinese jets violated Taiwan’s airspace
about 380 times in 2020 and have continued

41
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,670
to carry out such incursions on a nearly daily
basis this year, according to Taiwan’s Ministry

42
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,640
of National Defense.”

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,760
We did an episode a few weeks ago about how
these incursions are part of the Communist

44
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,830
Party’s “gray zone” war tactics against
Taiwan.\h

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,850
Those are tactics designed to exhaust the
Taiwanese military and make it harder for

46
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,360
Taiwan to defend itself against the Chinese
Communist Party.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,410
According to a former Pentagon policy chief,
Taiwan will be a flashpoint for the Biden

48
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,410
Administration.

49
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,760
Will the Biden administration continue to
stand up for Taiwan?

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,120
I hope so.

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,500
Because if Taiwan falls, where else am I going
to get those tasty little pineapple cakes?

52
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,880
Meanwhile, China’s Communist leader Xi Jinping
spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

53
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,700
Where he called for unity.

54
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,080
And global cooperation.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,110
Because if we don’t cooperate, there could
be a new cold war.

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:01,520
Of course, we’re already in a new cold war,
one that the Chinese Communist Party started.

57
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,940
But that’s not the point.\h

58
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:11,280
The point, according to Xi’s speech, is
that we should “all join hands and let multilateralism

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,269
light our way toward a community with a shared
future for mankind.”

60
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:22,279
That’s exactly the kind of message that
the World Economic Forum eats right up.

61
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:27,870
And it really worked last time Xi gave a similar
speech at Davos, back in 2017.

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,050
But now it’s 2021.

63
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,159
And no one can join hands to do anything anymore,
because of the coronavirus.

64
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:41,300
Which initially spread around the world thanks
to a coverup by the Chinese Communist Party.

65
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,460
So while Xi Jinping used all of the right
words at Davos, where people love to talk

66
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,139
about how great multilateralism and global
cooperation are, people are a little more

67
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,479
skeptical this time.

68
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,080
And they should be.

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,189
Because “Xi essentially proposed a multilateralism
with Chinese characteristics—designed to

70
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:08,490
ensure that international interactions be
conducted in accordance with China’s perspectives.”\h

71
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,834
Basically, Xi Jinping’s message was that
China is strong, and the rest of the world

72
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,199
had better cooperate.

73
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,059
Which is also what he said back in 2017, but
the rest of the world might actually be listening

74
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,689
now.

75
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:28,020
Speaking of Xi Jinping’s speech at Davos
back in 2017, guess who was listening in the

76
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
audience?

77
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,080
Then Vice-President Joe Biden!

78
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,879
Back in 2017, Xi might have still called Biden
an “old friend” as he did in 2013.

79
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,779
But are they still old friends in 2021?

80
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,539
Well, the Chinese Communist Party hopes so.

81
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,409
They’re using diplomatic back channels to
push for a high-level meeting to ease tensions

82
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,580
with the US.

83
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,270
They’re offering to cooperate with the US
on issues like climate change and the coronavirus

84
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,779
pandemic.\h

85
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,830
So where does the Biden Administration stand
on this?\h

86
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,939
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has said
that it’s possible the US and China could

87
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,069
cooperate on issues like climate change.\h

88
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:20,159
Although he also reaffirmed that he believed
that China is committing genocide against

89
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,159
the Uyghurs.

90
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,889
So, kind of mixed messages there.\h

91
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:29,490
Meanwhile, the Biden Administration has signaled
that they’re in no rush to meet with Chinese

92
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,809
officials.\h

93
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:36,129
At a press briefing over the weekend, White
House press secretary Jen Psaki announced

94
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:41,990
the Biden Administration China policy— “strategic
patience.”

95
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,729
I can hear Xi Jinping trembling.

96
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:47,509
Patiently.

97
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:53,960
If strategic patience isn’t entirely reassuring
to America’s allies in Asia, the new U.S.

98
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,229
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did reaffirm
the US commitment to Japan to defend islands

99
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:01,919
disputed with China.

100
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,759
In Japanese, these are called the Senkaku
Islands.

101
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,080
And if the US doesn’t defend its allies
from the Chinese Communist Party, those alliances

102
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,369
amount to Sen-kaka.

103
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:19,849
The Biden Administration is also under pressure
from Republican lawmakers to maintain a tough

104
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,930
on China approach.

105
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,379
Senators Marco Rubio, Ben Sasse, Tom Cotton,
and Mitt Romney even wrote a letter to Biden’s

106
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,460
Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen to
do just that.

107
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,889
The letter says, “As a key advisor to President
Biden on national security issues that involve

108
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,639
the most powerful and sophisticated tools
of economic statecraft, it is critical that

109
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,520
you demonstrate to Congress that your decisions
will be informed by a clear-eyed view of the

110
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,559
threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) to the United States.”

111
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,979
This comes after Yellen’s opening statement
at a confirmation hearing before the Senate

112
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,499
Finance Committee.

113
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:05,119
She did not mention China or the Chinese Communist
Party.

114
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,580
Republicans and Democrats then challenged
her on China.

115
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,879
She said the Biden Administration will address
China’s “illegal, unfair and abusive”

116
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,879
practices.

117
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,229
And said, “China is clearly our most important
strategic competitor.”

118
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:27,270
So in addition to strategic patience, the
Biden Administration seems to be carrying

119
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,550
on the Trump Administration's designation
of China as a strategic competitor.

120
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,169
Under Obama, China had been called a strategic
partner.

121
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,000
Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, also called

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,820
on Biden to stick to his promises to be tough
on Chinese social media companies like TikTok.\h

123
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,000
Biden did agree with the Trump Administration
that TikTok was a genuine concern.

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,620
So basically, between Chinese military incursions
in Taiwan and Republican pressure at home,

125
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,149
everyone wants to see how Biden handles China.

126
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,440
So far, so good.

127
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,930
But really, President Biden should just come
on China Uncensored and make his stance known.

128
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,139
The Philippines are protesting a new Chinese
law they’re calling a verbal threat of war.

129
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:28,080
“China’s Coast Guard Law, which was passed
on Friday, empowers the force to ‘take all

130
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,480
necessary measures, including the use of weapons,
when national sovereignty, sovereign rights,

131
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,899
and jurisdiction are being illegally infringed
upon by foreign organizations or individuals

132
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,329
at sea.’”

133
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:47,400
So... now the Chinese Coast Guard can just
shoot or capture foreign ships in disputed

134
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,709
waters.

135
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:54,770
Which sounds pretty scary, since the Philippines
and China have a lot of disputed waters.

136
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,569
But has the Philippines tried strategic patience?

137
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:04,779
I’m going to go out on a limb here and say
the South China Sea is about to need a whole

138
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,990
lot more patience.

139
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,579
And possibly more US aircraft carriers.

140
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:15,250
And this episode has been sponsored by Surfshark
Alert.

141
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,610
Big data breaches happen all the time.

142
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,639
Like the 2019 Capitol One breach that affected
100 million Americans.

143
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:29,790
Or the 2017 Equifax hack that exposed data
of nearly 150 million Americans.

144
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,250
Whether these hacks come from China or elsewhere,
your private information can be exposed—like

your credit card number, bank account balance,
social security number, and more.

146
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:47,810

identity theft, password leaks, or hackers,
