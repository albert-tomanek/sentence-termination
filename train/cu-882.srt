1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:02,420
Europe’s shipping ports

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,120
are a big part of the region’s economy.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,540
And guess who’s been buying them up?

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,800
China!

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,490
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,800
No one loves money and business

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,270
more than the Chinese Communist Party.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,390
For the past decade,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,380
they’ve been on a global investment spree.

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,960
In 2013,

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,289
Chinese leader Xi Jinping officially

13
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,070
wrapped China’s state-sponsored investments

14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,450
into what he called the Belt and Road Initiative.

15
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,399
Or, as it was initially known,

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,930
One Belt, One Road to Bring Them All,

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,690
and in the Darkness Bind Them.

18
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,200
Xi Jinping is a big Lord of the Rings fan.

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,210
Hilarious.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,350
Except that the taking over the world thing,

21
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,100
is not actually a joke.

22
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,230
“The Chinese are spending billions of dollars

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,250
to build the basic infrastructure of a world

24
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,780
they think they’re going to dominate.

25
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,879
They say it clearly.

26
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,730
2030-2050 we will be the dominant force,

27
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,740
so get ready for that.”

28
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,800
Get ready for that, because it’s already
underway.

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
In Europe,

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,630
Chinese companies have bought stakes in 13
ports—

31
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,680
all within the past decade.

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,430
And as of 2019,

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,320
Chinese state-controlled companies are handling

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,310
10 percent of Europe’s shipping container
traffic.

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,080
Why isn’t this big news?

36
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,070
Because—let’s be honest,

37
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,430
you haven’t even heard of some of these
port cities.

38
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,830
Like Le Havre—

39
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,180
which I think is type of cheese?

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,750
Or Bilbao,

41
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,560
which is definitely Spanish for Bilbo Baggins,

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
and Marsaxlokk?!

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,660
That can’t be a real place, can it?

44
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,860
Look, these cities aren’t exactly

45
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,110
making headline news every night.

46
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,130
And honestly, that’s kind of the point.

47
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,710
Chinese investment in European ports

48
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,710
has been a slow, quiet creep.

49
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,090
Like Slender Man.

50
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,610
But instead of abducting your children,

51
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,920
he’s abducting Europe’s infrastructure.

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,810
But what’s happening here is still im-port-ant.

53
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,740
I’ll give an example.

54
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,440
The port of Zeebrugge, in Bruges, Belgium.

55
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,290
Not super exciting, I know.

56
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,490
And that’s why very few people

57
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,920
were paying attention when—

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,970
in January 2018—

59
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,910
a Chinese state-owned shipping company

60
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,860
bought an 85% stake in Zeebrugge.

61
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,280
I’m talking about COSCO—

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
China Ocean Shipping Company.

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,750
Not to be confused with COSTCO—

64
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,840
where you go for groceries but end up buying

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,560
5 dozen pairs of Kirkland Signature underpants...

66
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,500
that were probably delivered from China

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,160
on a COSCO ship.

68
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,280
Anyway, COSCO’s Chief Executive

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,420
says the company has “big plans for Zeebrugge,”

70
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,490
adding that “with this and other ports like
Piraeus,

71
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,280
we want to build a bridge to Europe.”

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,190
Yes, a bridge.

73
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,350
Using ports.

74
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,660
But there's a problem with all that bridge
building:

75
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,450
It’s making EU leaders a little nervous.

76
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,080
In a 2017 state of the union speech,

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,540
European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker

78
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,070
expressed his concern about foreign takeovers.

79
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,630
Just a year and a half later—

80
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,240
that’s fast in European Union time—

81
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,620
the EU council approved a new set of rules

82
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,800
to screen foreign investments.

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,330
Including new investments from China.

84
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,430
But there are plenty of problems with the
investments

85
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,060
Chinese companies have already made.

86
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,470
Like how the Chinese regime is using Europe’s
ports

87
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,160
to expand its political control.

88
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,750
The author of “China’s Offensive in Europe”

89
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,830
Philippe Le Corre said in a congressional
testimony

90
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,150
that China’s Belt and Road Initiative

91
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,510
“is primarily a Chinese project that will
help China

92
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,280
expand its influence in the Eurasian region
and beyond.”

93
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,460
I mean, if a foreign authoritarian regime

94
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,280
controls your ability to import and export
goods,

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,800
it has enormous power over you.

96
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,560
Philippe Le Corre also noted that

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,110
as China’s investments in European infrastructure

98
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,150
have grown over the past few years,

99
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,430
“China has demonstrated its ability to divide
Europeans.”

100
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,569
For example, in 2016,

101
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,840
a struggling Greece accepted 300 million dollars—

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,000
in exchange for giving China’s state-owned
COSCO

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,510
a majority stake in its Piraeus port.

104
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,480
Piraeus is now the Chinese regime’s

105
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,890
most important port in Europe.

106
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,230
Less than a year later,

107
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,810
the EU wanted to pass a statement

108
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,690
condemning the Chinese regime’s

109
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,350
crackdown on dissidents.

110
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,540
And Greece was like,

111
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,660
“Haha, what?

112
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,060
China is so nice!

113
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,860
We’re gonna veto that statement.”

114
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,280
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
The Chinese Communist Party has created

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,120
a special group called 16+1.

117
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,200
That is, 16 countries in Central and Eastern
Europe

118
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,270
plus China.

119
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,040
These are the countries that are...ok,

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,300
what’s a nice way to say this...

121
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,760
not top travel destinations.

122
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
The countries that you’re not really sure

123
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,940
where they are on a map.

124
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,940
Like Serbia,

125
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,690
which we did a whole episode on a couple weeks
ago.

126
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,020
After I looked up where it was.

127
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,450
Anyway, the 16+1 group holds summits

128
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,280
and promotes business with China.

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,300
But according to the Financial Times,

130
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,150
EU leaders in *Western* Europe—

131
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,030
the travel destination countries—

132
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,870
they’re worried about 16+1.

133
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,850
Mostly about the +1 part.

134
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,740
The monthly journal Europe Now

135
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,590
reports that “16+1 could become a Trojan
horse

136
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,350
for China to shatter the bloc’s unity

137
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,280
in sensitive areas ranging from the single
market

138
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,490
to foreign investment vetting.”

139
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,100
The worry is China controls so many of Europe’s
ports—

140
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,230
as well as other stuff—

141
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,380
that it could use that as leverage

142
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,610
to play EU member countries against each other...

143
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,440
to change European laws it doesn’t like.

144
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,020
In fact, that’s already happened.

145
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,280
Remember how I said the EU approved a framework

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,750
to screen foreign direct investments?

147
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,510
Well guess what?

148
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,340
That framework doesn’t actually

149
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,040
have an enforcement mechanism.

150
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,490
After the screening process,

151
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,090
each country still gets to completely decide
on its own

152
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,889
if it wants to let Chinese investment in.

153
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,990
Which is a bit like having a police officer

154
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,260
ordering a suspect to

155
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,180
“Stop, or I’ll say stop again!”

156
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,130
Works every time.

157
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,550
And that weakness in the framework

158
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,730
is largely thanks to Chinese pressure.

159
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,260
According to the Financial Times,

160
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,870
“China’s lobbying has already proved effective

161
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,830
in diluting the proposed review process.”

162
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,889
And in a policy briefing last year,

163
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,500
the European Parliament Research Service noted
that

164
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,380
“China has made major inroads into the EU

165
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,600
by acquiring minority stakes in port infrastructure

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,030
of strategic relevance for China.

167
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,030
Hence, China is increasingly able to shape
outcomes

168
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,360
in its interest from within the EU.”

169
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Last year,

170
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,710
French President Emmanuel Macron said,

171
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,680
“China won’t respect a continent, a power,

172
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,160
when some member states let their doors freely
open.”

173
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,570
And like momma always said,

174
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,419
“Don’t ever be with a man who doesn’t
respect you.”

175
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,419
So what do you think about the Chinese regime

176
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,639
buying up strategic ports and building a bridge
to Europe?

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,650
Leave your comments below.

178
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,910
And if you’d like to learn more about

179
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,650
what happens after the Chinese regime

180
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,480
takes over your ports,

181
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,930
check out the episode we did on Greece and
Piraeus.

182
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,449
I’ll put a link to that episode in the description
below.

183
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,650
And before we go,

184
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,990
it’s time to answer a question

185
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,010
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

186
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,590
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

187
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,440
David Michael White asks:

188
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,250
“Chris, which film of the Back to the Future
trilogy

189
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,330
is your favorite?”

190
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,550
Well, David, it’s obviously the one

191
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,940
where they travel to the past:

192
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,650
October 21, 2015.

193
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,070
“You mean we’re in the future?”

194
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,400
It’s the past future

195
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
I always imagined we wouldn’t have.

196
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,780
Flying cars.

197
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,500
Jackets that dry themselves.

198
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,740
Nausea-inducing fashion trends.

199
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,800
Well, we do have that one.

200
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,490
But anyway, Back to the Future Part II

201
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,550
is definitely the best of the trilogy.

202
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,210
In fact, back in 2015,

203
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,210
my producer Matt and I actually did a video
about

204
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,120
10 things Back to the Future Part II got right

205
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
and posted it on our channel.

206
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,300
I know, you’re wondering what it had to
do with China.

207
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,350
And the answer is...absolutely nothing.

208
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,580
But we really,

209
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,639
really wanted to do that video for some reason.

210
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,260
And it got more views than this video ever
will.

211
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,600
I’ll put that link in the description below,
too.

212
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,580
I wonder which one people will watch:

213
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,370
An episode about Greek debt or Back to the
Future.

214
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,370
Hmmm.

215
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,810
Thanks for your question, David.

216
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,960

223
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,699
