1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,360
Tensions between Taiwan and China\h

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,920
are at an all time high.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,240
But Taiwan has extended an olive branch.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,000
How’d that turn out?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,280
Boy, tensions between China and Taiwan\h
have been getting really bad lately.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,520
All of China’s thinly veiled threats\h
after the US sold weapons to Taiwan.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,960
All those Chinese warplanes flying over Taiwan.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,080
I mean this is getting nuts. Even Japanese anime\h
celebrities can’t escape China’s campaign over\h\h

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:49,280
Taiwan. Uhh, Shelley, are we playing mad libs\h
with the script? Oh, no, it’s a real thing.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,160
This has all been in the lead up to\h
Taiwan's National Day, which was October 10.\h\h

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,200
National Day really upsets the Chinese\h
Communist Party, because it kind of gives\h\h

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,840
the impression that Taiwan is its own\h
country with its own national holiday.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,240
That’s why the Chinese Communist Party does\h
things that look crazy to normal countries,\h\h

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,240
like telling Indian media how to cover Taiwan’s\h
National Day. By not calling Taiwan a country.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
That kind of attitude leaves the\h
Party wide open to trolling.\h

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,280
And India really delivered. Indian politicians\h
wished Taiwan a happy national day.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
And Taiwan National Day started trending in India.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,160
One local Indian politician put up a Happy\h
National Day sign outside the Chinese embassy.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,000
And someone even commissioned\h
this Taiwan is not China cake.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Meanwhile the President of Taiwan\h\h

22
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,520
Tsai Ing-wen tweeted her thanks to\h
all of Taiwan’s dear friends in India.

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,560
And started talking about\h
her favorite Indian food.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,160
So, the Chinese Communist Party\h
tried to control Indian media,\h\h

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,240
leading to a national backlash in\h
India and an India-Taiwan lovefest.\h\h

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,520
Once again, the Chinese Communist\h
Party scores! Against itself.\h

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,360
Speaking of India, we just did an episode on our\h
other show, America Uncovered, about the Quad, an\h\h

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,360
alliance to counter China. And India is a big part\h
of that. I’ll put a link to that episode below.\h

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,760
But back to Taiwan’s National Day. In her\h
National Day speech, President Tsai extended\h\h

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,920
an olive branch to the Communist Party. She\h
called for meaningful dialogue with China.

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,640
That’s great! Authoritarian regimes always\h
respond well to talking things out. So\h\h

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,240
what was China’s response?

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,040
Well, just hours after her\h
speech, Chinese state-run CCTV\h\h

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,360
aired this video of China’s military\h
launching a simulated invasion of Taiwan.

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Well, I guess that’s a form of dialogue. But\h
perhaps they could make themselves clearer.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,760
“Taiwan denounced China for releasing a forced TV\h
confession of a Taiwanese businessman. The man has\h\h

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,720
been missing in China for over a year due to his\h
support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.”

38
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,040
Huh, so they’ve kidnapped a Taiwanese\h
citizen. But I think the Communist\h\h

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,320
Party’s actions could still really be open to\h
interpretation. Can they be a little clearer?

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
“In its annual work report this\h
year, the Chinese government\h\h

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,160
removed the word ‘peaceful’ from long-standing\h
references to ‘reunification’ with Taiwan.”

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,040
Okay, let me see if I can understand this dialogue\h
coming from communist China. They’re saying:\h\h

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
They are highly militarized, they\h
kidnap other countries’ citizens,\h\h

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,040
and they’re planning invade a democratic\h
country to murder their people.

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,760
Okay, the message is crystal clear.\h
There’s only one way to take that.\h\h

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,920
China’s bond market is incredible! Buy buy buy!!!

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,080
But surely the Chinese Communist Party\h
can at least appreciate the effort\h\h

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,360
by President Tsai Ing-wen\h
to deescalate the situation.

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,480
Recently Taiwan’s Foreign Minister\h
told NPR that Taiwan would not\h\h

50
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,440
seek formal ties with the US right now.

51
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,120
That’s got to make the CCP happy. So surely,\h
they’re willing to back down a bit, right?\h

52
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,320
Well, here’s Hu Xijin the editor in chief\h
of my favorite Chinese state run media,\h\h

53
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,680
the Global Times.

54
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
“The change of tone indicated\h
the Tsai administration\h\h

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,360
has fathomed the severity of a possible military\h
conflict with Beijing over its provocations.”

56
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,600
Hu added, “Beijing must not ‘be fooled\h
into believing the gesture of goodwill\h\h

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,440
of the ruling Democratic\h
Progressive Party of Taiwan’”\h\h

58
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,160
and that “continued military muscle-flexing\h
is the only answer to cross-strait stability.”

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,760
So...if Taiwan makes a move like it’s\h
going to seek formal ties with the US,\h\h

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,560
China will threaten to invade. If Taiwan\h
backs down and says we can resolve things\h\h

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,040
through dialogue, China will threaten to\h
invade. Well at least they have options.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,920
Ronny Ager-Wick asks, “Is there any way\h
that a country who has been tricked by\h\h

65
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,840
China's debt trap diplomacy can get out of it\h
without paying? What would happen if they just\h\h

66
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,200
stopped paying and defaulted on the loan?\h
Could they declare the "investment" illegal\h\h

67
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,480
and thus reject China's demands? Or could\h
they have a revolution, a new constitution,\h\h

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,600
and thus be regarded as a new country,\h
leaving China to collect from the old regime?”

69
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,480
Ohh, great question. This in fact has happened.\h\h

70
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,800
In Malaysia. Malaysia was hugely in debt to\h
China. To the tune of 34 billion dollars.

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
That was thanks to Najib Razak, who was\h
Malaysia’s prime minister for nearly a decade.

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Turns out he was very corrupt.

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,200
And a lot of that corruption had to do with\h
China. But before he got a 12 year jail term,\h\h

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,160
he lost the 2018 election to\h
this guy, Mahathir Mohamad.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,320
Part of his campaign was about standing up to\h
China, which gets more and more popular with time.

76
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,800
He was openly critical of\h
China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,240
“None of our people are employed\h
as workers. None of our companies\h\h

78
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,600
are used for designing and planning and\h
supervising, et cetera. We gain nothing.”\h

79
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
\h
And after being elected,\h\h

80
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,000
he suspended four Chinese linked projects\h
worth about a total of 23 billion dollars.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
That was worth about two-thirds of\h
all Malaysia’s Belt and Road projects.

82
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
Mahathir then began renegotiating those deals.

83
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,560
And it seemed to work. Some of those belt and\h
road projects restarted in 2019 after hiccups.

84
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,920
It follow[ed] “a rare agreement to cut its\h
cost by nearly a third to about $11 billion”

85
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,400
Great deal. Well, until those hiccups became a\h
gasping death wheeze because of the coronavirus.

86
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,680
Thanks for your question Ronny.\h

87
