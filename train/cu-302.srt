1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,240
South Korea was one of America’s closest allies

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,000
But now the country is\h
falling to Communist influence

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,720
From China…

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,920
And North Korea

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m\h
Chris Chappell. Before we start,\h\h

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,280
I want you to smash that like button because\h
that’s a big help with YouTube’s algorithms and\h\h

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,640
we need all the help we can get fighting it.\h
And if you like the show, please subscribe.\h

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,840
So, ever since taking office in 2017, the\h
president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in,\h\h

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,320
has been pushing for closer ties to\h
China, and unbelievably—North Korea.\h

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,560
That...kind of didn’t sit well with\h
a lot of South Koreans. You know,\h\h

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,240
what with that whole North Korea threatens to turn\h
South Korea’s capital into a sea of flames thing.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,480
But this April, Moon Jae-in’s party won a\h
landslide victory in the legislative election.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,600
That means President Moon has been able to\h
push through legislation like this—banning\h\h

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,200
people from sending leaflets into North\h
Korea with uncensored information.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,760
Kim Jong-Un really didn’t like North\h
Koreans reading those leaflets.\h\h

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,440
So Moon’s party did him a solid.\h

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,880
But that’s what the people of South Korea wanted,\h
right? After all, Moon’s party won in a landslide,\h\h

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,200
right? Well, as we talked about on this\h
episode of the China Unscripted podcast,\h\h

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,960
there have been widespread allegations of voter\h
fraud. And China may have had a hand in it.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,080
Joining me now is North Korean\h
defector and author Yeonmi Park.\h

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
Yeonmi, thanks for joining me again.\h
It's always a pleasure to have you on.

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
Thank you so much for having me. It's an honor.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,440
Well, so new legislation has been passed in South\h
Korea that makes it illegal for South Koreans to\h\h

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,640
send leaflets into North Korea. First, what did\h
those leaflets mean to the people in North Korea?

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,840
It just means a lot of things.\h
When I was in North Korea,\h\h

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,320
I actually didn't get to personally pick up a\h
leaflet, because I wasn’t living in the border\h\h

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,320
town. However, there are so many of the regime\h
warnings to us that if you ever see a leaflet,\h\h

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,000
the South Koreans put a poison in it, do\h
not pick it up. And we hear about stories\h\h

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
how people get to know the outside the\h
world through picking up these leaflets.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,560
So one, what this leaflet does is that\h
it providing truth, information to North\h\h

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,520
Korean people that they do not get from\h
the state government of media. The second\h\h

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,680
one is also a symbolic thing, that it reminding\h
North Koreans that they are not alone in this,\h\h

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,320
that people outside really care about them and\h
cheering for them. So it is so heartbreaking\h\h

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,680
how this most important thing that is being\h
banned in South Korean, in free democracy.

35
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,000
So, what impact do you think\h
banning these leaflets will have?

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,560
It will have a lot of things. The first thing,\h
the South Korean now, I don't want to even\h\h

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,160
call it government, the Moon administration, they\h
confirm that how they are treating North Korean\h\h

38
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,640
defectors in South Korea, which is treating us\h
like second citizens. When people talk about\h\h

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,480
systemic racism in the Western civilization,\h
but that is happening in South Korea.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,800
Actually the South Korean government systemically\h
discriminate North Korean defectors living there.\h\h

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,400
Even though we are South Korean citizens, we can\h
not hold certain positions in the government,\h\h

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,840
because they think we can be\h
a spy, we can be a terrorist,\h\h

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,880
and also this. We have freedom of speech. It\h
is under the constitution that is protected,\h\h

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,800
but because we are North Koreans, we do not\h
have a right to practice our freedom of speech,\h\h

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,720
which is sending leaflets to North Korea,\h
through balloon launches in the border towns.

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Well, why do you think Moon Jae-in's\h
government banned the leaflets?

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,920
Well, he's very known lover of communism\h
and Kim Jong-un for all his life. So the\h\h

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,000
reason why he chose to not do the right thing\h
and silencing defectors who are risking their\h\h

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,800
life to free their people. He chose to please\h
Kim Jong-un, which means that Kim Jong-un gets\h\h

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,840
really bothered by this information inflow.\h
This is how impactful this informations are.

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,960
Kim Jong-un doesn't want to start the war over\h
a lot of things, but whenever these balloons\h\h

52
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,120
going into North Korea, Kim Jong-un gets really\h
offended and demands South Korea to stop it,\h\h

53
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,920
and Moon Jae-in, of course, the puppet of Kim\h
Jong-un, so he's going to do that for Kim Jong-un.

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,600
You really think that situation is that\h
bad? That Moon Jae-in is just a puppet of\h\h

55
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,640
North Korea and possibly China?

56
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,400
Oh yes. Even before he became the\h
president, his whole career was\h\h

57
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,720
dedicated to help the dictator in North Korea.\h
He was serving the normal hand, the previous\h\h

58
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,040
Democrat laborer president before him was Kim\h
Dae-jung and Moon Jae-in whole dedicating his\h\h

59
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,840
life to bring socialism and communism to South\h
Korea and also, let the dictator to survive and\h\h

60
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,400
maintain his power in the North. That is\h
his whole entire career mission has been.

61
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,840
So how did it get to be that the president of\h
South Korea has such pro-North Korean feelings?

62
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,400
It is a mystery, kind of be for me too, how\h
this is possible the flourishing democracy.\h\h

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,160
It was the beacon of hope for a lot of\h
Asian countries in that region. Suddenly,\h\h

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
this guy who is so procommunism\h
and socialism and dictatorship.\h\h

65
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,960
I think that is the thing freedom is fragile.\h
The thing is that it's not even in South Korea,\h\h

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,720
a lot of developed economies in the world.\h
Once you are rich and comfortable for a while,\h\h

67
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,440
you can afford to be a dreamer and thinking\h
about socialism. This has been a global trend\h\h

68
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,280
in South Korea, in America, anywhere, I think.\h
Literally right now, it's a huge trend where\h\h

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,080
people are wanting something like socialism,\h
because they've been too comfortable, I think.

70
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,360
So how is the current government in South Korea\h
getting more friendly with China and North Korea?

71
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,440
But though now as Moon Jae-in is very looking\h
forward to having Biden in the office in America.\h\h

72
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,280
They did not really have a good relationship with\h
Trump before. Moon Jae-un is very pro Xi Jinping\h\h

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,640
and therefore pro Kim Jong-un as well. They didn't\h
like that much with Trump, but they're really\h\h

74
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,840
happy for Biden to be in the office and looking\h
forward to having a good relationship again.

75
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
So you mentioned North Koreans aren't\h
treated very well in South Korea.\h\h

76
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,560
Has it gotten worse over the\h
years or what's been going on?

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,480
It definitely got really, really worse by\h
Moon Jae-in. Before then, there was some\h\h

78
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,120
effort in South Korean government to try to\h
avoid that, so at some point they were even\h\h

79
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,680
letting North Korean men to go to military. Before\h
that it was illegal for us to go military in South\h\h

80
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Korea. But Moon Jae-in now, criminalizing\h
so many things that defectors cannot do.

81
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,480
For instance, Moon did, during the peace talks\h
with North Korea in the last couple of years,\h\h

82
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,600
and with America, there was one North\h
defector who was journalists from the major\h\h

83
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,000
newspaper. They were banning him because\h
just simply, he was North Korean defector,\h\h

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,880
so he couldn't go report about that piece\h
for something that he had with Kim Jong-un.

85
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,240
Yeah, he's talking about systemic racism,\h
this is what systemic racism looks like.\h\h

86
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,320
Even though with the same citizenship\h
we have, we can not hold the same jobs,\h\h

87
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,120
we're sent to prison for the same things\h
that South Koreans wouldn't go to jail for.

88
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
I guess I just really don't understand\h
it. What could possibly be the appeal\h\h

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,200
of being closer with a horrible\h
regime like North Korea?

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,520
I think it is why would some people were not like\h
socialism or communism have to do to get their\h\h

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,160
heads. I think initially in\h
the past that North Korea did\h\h

92
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,200
plant a lot of spies and feeding\h
this ideology and brainwashing them,\h\h

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,360
that North Korea is very, very good corrupt. Even\h
in today's world, like YouTube, you can see this\h\h

94
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,720
North Korea propaganda channels, like Echoes\h
of Truth and other places, that North Korea\h\h

95
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,840
has been doing this so much in South Korea\h
and they're planting their allies there.

96
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I think in college campuses, they studied\h
to the ideology that North Korea holds\h\h

97
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,160
as a more senior philosophy. So, I think Moon\h
was influenced by the ideology when he was young,\h\h

98
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,040
when he was in college and he was in this a\h
lot of the peaceful ... North, South Korea is\h\h

99
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,800
now for the much respect than he was looking\h
for some democracy, but I think he meant too\h\h

100
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:41,520
far with it. So, he became a communist. I didn't\h
know what's going on in his as actually really.

101
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
So, how do people in South Korea\h
in general feel about communism?

102
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,200
Young people really definitely like it. The\h
young people actually singing songs like the\h\h

103
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,440
true leader in North Korean peninsula like Kim\h
Jong-un and they are dreaming of becoming like\h\h

104
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:08,560
North Korea someday. They think America\h
is their enemy, sworn enemy, exactly what\h\h

105
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,280
North Korea preaches to North Koreans. They\h
demonize America, they demonize Japans, and\h\h

106
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:22,960
free democracy, then worship is ideological,\h
worshiping kings and Juche and socialism.

107
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:30,080
So, I wouldn't really say even like my ...\h
a lot of nation defectors after experiencing\h\h

108
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,360
this authoritarian dictatorship, they\h
still just fall into this promise of\h\h

109
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,720
the government. "We're going to take\h
care of your future, your happiness,\h\h

110
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,080
your college education, your healthcare." So,\h
even defectors falling into this first promise,\h\h

111
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,600
that government is god and can do everything\h
for you. So, I don't know, I feel so helpless\h\h

112
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
even after experiencing that much\h
oppression, they still fall for it.

113
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I know it must be difficult, you\h
fled North Korea and risked your life\h\h

114
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,240
to get to South Korea at one\h
point. So this must be shocking.

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,360
Yeah. I think also the thing that is\h
very lucky to me that I came to America,\h\h

116
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,320
so I have no much threat going to jail\h
for what I'm doing right now. I'm speaking\h\h

117
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,227
out against North Korean dictatorship and also\h
talking about South Korean government critically,\h\h

118
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:31,840
is going to get a lot of people in trouble now.\h
And I wouldn't dare to now go to South Korea. We\h\h

119
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,560
just South Korean citizenship, I'm waiting\h
to go back once I become American citizen,\h\h

120
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,720
because I might get arrested\h
there too in South Korea actually.

121
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,280
Well, speaking of that, I know there have\h
been accusations that in South Korea,\h\h

122
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,160
this year's legislative election was rigged. South\h
Korea also has some pretty insane liable laws that\h\h

123
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,840
make it almost impossible to talk\h
about that. But what are your thoughts?

124
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,200
I mean, the fact that Moon Jae-in as\h
soon as he got into office, he sent\h\h

125
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,480
to a previous president, who were not liberal,\h
who were in a more conservative party,\h\h

126
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,640
sent to prison. There were sentences\h
more than like 20 something years.\h\h

127
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,240
It's not like they were rapists or murders,\h
right? Is something is so awful about it,\h\h

128
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,680
she changed entire people in the intelligence\h
everywhere. And just switching up or entire people\h\h

129
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,800
is like, in North Korea, I saw a lot of purges\h
whenever a new king comes up, but, you know,\h\h

130
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,640
thankfully there was not much ... I will not say\h
thankfully, but you know, there were not too many\h\h

131
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,080
kings. When each one comes in, they hold power for\h
some time, but in South Korea every five years.

132
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,640
But whenever this labor's coming\h
in South Korea, they do this like\h\h

133
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,520
similar thing called a great purge. We remove\h
everybody that disagrees with them and has like\h\h

134
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,880
more free market views. And they went\h
to extreme to the part where they're\h\h

135
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,600
sentencing and sending their ex president into\h
jail and sentencing more than like 10, 20 years.\h\h

136
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,040
I think the words that they say the bad\h
idea like of [inaudible 00:11:49] and\h\h

137
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,960
freedom in South Korea, but definitely South\h
Korea is not free right now, we don't know.

138
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,120
Wow. Well, I'd like to at least end\h
on some good news. You've started\h\h

139
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,800
an amazing new channel about your experiences in\h
North Korea and the channel really is blowing up.\h\h

140
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,640
Why do you think people are\h
so fascinated by North Korea?

141
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,640
I think even though the governments,\h
even U.S. administration, the EU, UN,\h\h

142
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,640
what they are actually caring about just nukes,\h
right? They try to remove this security threat\h\h

143
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:57,360
parties to the U.S., Japan, South Korea. But\h
when it comes to individuals, I think people\h\h

144
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,080
have way more warmer heart\h
and care about human rights.

145
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,680
So, I think when governments, just their approach\h
to talk about North Korea has always been\h\h

146
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,080
talking about the nuclear threat and dictatorship.\h
And I think when I talk about the people's story\h\h

147
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,280
of North Korea, that's when I get the most\h
response from people. Think ultimately,\h\h

148
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,360
you know, we get touched by people's story, and I\h
think people really care about what is happening\h\h

149
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,800
to the 25 millions of North Korean people\h
now just need a new story maker Kim Jong-un.

150
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,840

always a pleasure talking to you and\h\h
