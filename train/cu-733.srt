00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,759
Santa has clearly done some 
outsourcing to China.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I'm your
host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,259
Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,720
And a very merry Christmas to the factory
workers in Yiwu,

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,699
a town in eastern China's Zhejiang province.

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,560
Because they've been working on Christmas
since January.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,800
The US imported more than a half a billion
dollars’ worth

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,980
of Christmas decorations from Yiwu just in
2015.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,149
It's is such an important exporter of cheap
products to Europe

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:39,090
that last year, China opened an 8,000-mile
rail line to Spain

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,870
that starts in Yiwu.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,230
Now you might think it's weird that a single
town makes so much of a specific product,

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,070
but in fact, that's a thing in China.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,500
For example, in the city of Songxia,

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,960
there are twelve hundred factories dedicated
just to making umbrellas—

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,539
1.3 billion dollars worth each year.

18
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,690
Qiaotou makes 60 percent of the world's buttons.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,320
And Datang cranks out 8 billion pairs of socks
every year.

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,380
Presumably to feed George Clooney's sock habit.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,049
And in Yiwu, they make 60 percent of the world's
Christmas decorations.

22
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,130
Peak season is July and August.

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,310
So it gets pretty hot in factories like this
one.

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,570
Somehow it doesn't seem like the healthiest
place to work.

25
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,159
And it's just one of more than 700 factories
in Yiwu.

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,009
Those photos were from Sina.com.

27
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,270
But for a happier look, here are some photos
from state-run Xinhua News.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,950
Wait, that one's creepy.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,399
Oh my gosh, are they building a clone army
of Santas?

30
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,409
Jango Fett, you've met your match.

31
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:47,430
But anyway, what's really amazing

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,979
is not just that China is the world's Christmas
factory,

33
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,600
but that Chinese people celebrate it too.

34
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
It's still a fairly new holiday in China.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,799
Remember, less than 40 years ago,

36
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,030
the Communist Party banned Western beliefs
and traditions,

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,579
calling them "mental poison."

38
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:07,950
And even today, the Chinese Christian church
is run by the Communist Party.

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,910
So unsurprisingly, Christmas is not a particularly
religious holiday in China.

40
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,739
But it has recently become China's second-biggest
holiday, after Chinese New Year.

41
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,520
Like in America, it's a time for crazy amounts
of shopping.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,590
But instead of Christmas Eve being family
time, it's more like

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,670
go-out-and-sing-karaoke-with-your-friends-and-drink-beer time.

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,000
Also, Santa playing the saxophone is a thing.

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,030
It's deeply disturbing—yet somehow I can't
get enough.

46
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,340
Anyway, as you know from my video last Christmas,

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,610
I try to avoid buying Christmas stuff made
in China.

48
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,879
But with most of the world's Christmas decorations
being made there,

49
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,160
and not in the North Pole, as some parental
figures tole me,

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,280
I want to give a shout-out to the hundreds
of thousands of people in China

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,400
who make Christmas come true.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,300
And a Merry Christmas,

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,239
and, you know, other holidays,

54
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
to China Uncensored fans like you who've supported
me this year.

55
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm off for a week, but I'll see you again
before New Years'.

56
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,319
I'm Chris Chappell. Thanks for watching.

57
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,810
The world enters what scientists call “the
post-antibiotic era.”

58
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,000
The BBC says this “could plunge medicine
back into the dark ages.”

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,879
If you've been watching this show for a while,

60
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,430
you know that China has plans for world domination.
