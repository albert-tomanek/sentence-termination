1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,400
A former government official

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,400
Has a controversial idea

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,480
About how to deal with China

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:16,080
Should the US take his advice?\h

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,480
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,520
Today I’m going to talk about a bad\h
idea. It’s the kind of bad idea that\h\h

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,840
sounds like a good idea...at least to some people.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,720
Like the time that my roommate Carl decided\h
to go skinny dipping...in the neighbor’s pool.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,400
At least this bad idea comes with less jail time.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,760
What’s the bad idea? Last\h
week, the Atlantic Council,\h\h

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,560
a prestigious think tank, published an\h
anonymous report called The Longer Telegram.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,720
It was “written by a former senior\h
government official with deep expertise\h\h

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,200
and experience dealing with China.”

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Oh, so you know this is going to be good.\h

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,360
Why is it called the Longer Telegram?\h
The anonymous author wants to compare\h\h

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,440
his report to the “Long Telegram,” an\h
actual telegram sent by George Kennan,\h\h

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,400
an American diplomat in Moscow\h
to the State Department in 1946.

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Kennan’s telegram presented a\h
clear-eyed view of the Soviet Union\h\h

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,520
and correctly predicted what the communist\h
government would do during the Cold War.\h

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,160
Kennan called the Soviet Union “highly\h
sensitive to logic of force.” And said\h\h

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,800
that it would withdraw “when strong\h
resistance is encountered at any point.”\h\h

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,720
And he said that the Western world\h
needed to provide that resistance.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,280
Kennan’s telegram dramatically\h
changed how the US government\h\h

24
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
dealt with the Soviet Union,\h
by essentially proposing what\h\h

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,440
became known as the containment strategy\h
that the US used during the Cold War.

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,080
So now in the Longer Telegram, this anonymous\h\h

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:09,200
former senior government official is proposing\h
his own strategy for the US to deal with China.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,640
I’m not going to go through the whole thing.\h
When this guy said it was a longer telegram,\h\h

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,240
he wasn’t kidding. The original\h
Long Telegram is 8,000 words long.\h\h

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,880
The Longer Telegram is almost 30,000 words long.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,160
And you don’t watch China Uncensored\h
to see a 3-hour dissection\h\h

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
of a think tank policy paper.\h
This isn’t Reports Unread.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,960
Welcome to Reports Unread, I’m Chris\h
Chappell. Today I’ll be talking about...Wait,\h\h

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,680
how long is this thing? I’m not reading this!

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,320
The real show I need to make\h
is Content Undemonetized.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
Anyway, back to the longest telegram ever.\h

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Don’t get me wrong, the anonymous\h
author gets some stuff right.\h\h

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,720
Like when he says that “The single most\h
important challenge facing the United States\h\h

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,080
in the twenty-first century is the rise\h
of an increasingly authoritarian China.”

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,320
And when he says that the US urgently needs\h
to “develop an integrated, operational, and\h\h

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:26,800
bipartisan national strategy to guide the content\h
and implementation of US policy toward Xi’s China”

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
But the biggest problem with this\h
report is his central strategic\h\h

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,560
idea of how to deal with the Chinese Communist\h
Party. The anonymous author spells that out in\h\h

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,920
this opinion piece he wrote for Politico. The\h
US should focus on Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,400
That’s the idea: The US needs\h
to get rid of Xi Jinping.\h

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,360
I know what you’re thinking: The US is\h
bad at regime change. But don’t worry!\h\h

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,200
This is not regime change. Because\h
we’re going to get rid of Xi Jinping,\h\h

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,600
but we’re going to keep the\h
Chinese Communist Party.

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, let that sink in for a moment.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
Why are we keeping the Communist Party?\h

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,640
According to the Longer Telegram, treating\h
the Chinese Communist Party the way we\h\h

52
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,080
treated the Soviet Union, what he calls\h
“containment with Chinese characteristics,”\h\h

53
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,760
is too blunt of an instrument. And\h
CCP collapse is just a dream.\h\h

54
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,840
“By contrast, a strategy that focuses more\h
narrowly on Xi, rather than the CCP as a whole,\h\h

55
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
presents a more achievable objective.”

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,200
That’s right, it’s not regime change. It’s\h
leadership change. Totally different.\h

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,760
This is a bad idea. This isn’t just\h
skinny dipping in your neighbor’s pool.\h\h

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,560
It’s diving off Niagara Falls naked. In a canoe.

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,760
And I’ll explain why after the break.

60
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,960
Welcome back. The strategy\h
to get rid of Xi Jinping,\h\h

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,400
while keeping the Chinese Communist\h
Party is a really bad idea.

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,760
And I say that even though\h
I’m no fan of Xi Jinping.\h\h

63
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,800
He’s never responded even once\h
to any of my interview requests.

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,680
So it’s not a bad idea because Xi Jinping is\h
somehow a good guy who should stay in power.\h\h

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,960
It’s a bad idea because it’s a fundamental\h
misunderstanding of the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

66
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,320
One that is dangerous for the\h
US and the rest of the world.

67
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,560
The anonymous author believes that\h
“if leadership change were to occur,\h\h

68
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,920
it would be more likely to\h
move in the direction of a more\h\h

69
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,440
moderate collective leadership, given that\h
the burden of the internal critique of Xi\h\h

70
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,120
so far has been that he has been too\h
leftist at home and too assertive abroad.”

71
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,160
And how would leadership change occur?\h
Well, did you know that there’s this\h\h

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,160
thing called factional infighting going\h
on within the Chinese Communist Party?

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,960
It’s always nice when more people find out about\h
my favorite factional infighting soap opera,\h\h

74
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,080
General Hostility.

75
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,880
But the Longer Telegram says that since\h
there is infighting, “The central focus\h\h

76
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,920
of an effective US and allied China strategy\h
must be directed at the internal fault lines\h\h

77
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,000
of domestic Chinese politics in general and\h
concerning Xi’s leadership in particular.”

78
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,560
On China Uncensored, we differentiate between\h
the Chinese Communist Party and China as a whole.\h\h

79
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,680
But the Longer Telegram argues that just like\h
attacking “China” in general is an error,\h\h

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,840
it’s just as significant of an error to crudely\h
attack the Chinese Communist Party itself.\h

81
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,000
It’s simply an unsophisticated strategy\h
when fault lines exist between Xi Jinping\h\h

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,480
and other senior Party officials.

83
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,880
So what’s the sophisticated strategy?\h
“The mission for US China strategy\h\h

84
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:27,440
should be to see China return to its pre-2013\h
path—i.e., the pre-Xi strategic status quo.”

85
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,240
And how would we know that the strategy has been\h
successful? According to the Longer Telegram,\h\h

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,640
one of the indicators would be that “Xi has been\h
replaced by a more moderate party leadership.”

87
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
I know that’s a lot to take in, so\h\h

88
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,840
let me summarize in a way that\h
the internet can understand.

89
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,680
Broke: Nuke China.
Woke: Take down the CCP.\h

90
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,240
Bespoke: Leverage factional infighting\h
within the CCP to take down Xi Jinping\h\h

91
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,600
and ensure that a “moderate”\h
CCP leader replaces him.\h

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,880
Sounds great! Except this is exactly how we\h
got into this situation in the first place.\h

93
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I’ll explain after the break.

94
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,640
Welcome back. A lot of people in the west\h
are completely clueless about the Chinese\h\h

95
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,720
Communist Party. They think the CCP is just\h
a bunch of benign moderate technocrats.

96
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,680
Oh, Chairman Xi Jinping is a\h
bad guy, so let’s get rid of him\h\h

97
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,520
so the good guys can take over? Yeah, right.

98
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,360
The problem is, there are no good guys at\h
the top levels of the Chinese Communist\h\h

99
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Party leadership. They’ve all had to\h
do terrible things to get to where\h\h

100
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,680
they are today. It’s a classic deal with\h
the devil, and the Party gets your soul.\h

101
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,200
Look at what happened to former\h
Chinese leader Hu Jintao.

102
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,400
He used to be an actual human being\h
who experienced actual emotions:

103
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,840
And by the end of his term he looked like\h
this. Although it can’t be easy having to\h\h

104
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,920
sit next to the guy who’s stabbing you\h
in the back and twisting the knife.\h

105
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,200
Speaking of former Chinese leader and\h
toadfish Jiang Zemin, this guy and his minions\h\h

106
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,920
are on the other side of the factional\h
struggle against Xi Jinping.\h

107
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,120
If Xi Jinping goes down, he’s just\h
going to be replaced by another bad guy,\h\h

108
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,160
probably someone from Jiang Zemin’s faction.

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
The Longer Telegram imagines that there’s some\h
moderate leader in the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

110
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,840
that can take over and make it\h
better, the way it used to be.\h

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,080
And it uses former leaders like Deng\h
Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao as\h\h

112
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,560
examples of the former, status quo moderate\h
leaders—you know, from the good old days.

113
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Except, the good old days weren’t that good.

114
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,560
Like how in 1989, Deng Xiaoping\h
ordered the Tiananmen Square massacre.

115
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:10,560
And then in the 90s, Jiang Zemin rose to power\h
by supporting that massacre. He also started the\h\h

116
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,240
campaign to crush Falun Gong, which included\h
things like killing people for their organs.\h

117
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,520
Hu Jintao used to be Party chief of\h
Tibet. He was indicted in a Spanish court\h\h

118
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,200
for genocide because of his policies in Tibet.

119
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,640
These top Party leaders were all killing people\h\h

120
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,640
way before Xi Jinping was in power. There were\h
no good old days of the Chinese Communist Party.

121
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,120
But the Longer Telegram treats these former\h
Party leaders as more moderate because they\h\h

122
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,880
seemed to have a less aggressive stance towards\h
the US and changing the international order.

123
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,640
But that’s wrong. The Communist Party always\h
had an aggressive stance towards the US.\h\h

124
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,040
It was already going down the same road it\h
is currently under Xi Jinping. The Party\h\h

125
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,040
just wasn’t as rich or powerful back then as it\h
is now, so a lot of people just didn’t see it.\h

126
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,920
Here’s the problem: The Longer Telegram\h
isn’t about getting a better CCP leader.\h\h

127
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,560
It’s about getting a CCP leader that\h
makes the West feel better about the CCP.

128
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,080
Once we get rid of Xi Jinping and go back to those\h
benign moderate technocrats, we can work together.\h\h

129
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
And by work together, I mean, we\h
can keep making money together.

130
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,200
This is wrong. The Chinese Communist Party is\h
engaged in an ideological struggle with the West.\h

131
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,840
To its credit, the Longer Telegram realizes\h
this, and says the West must fight back.

132
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,400
But it makes the mistake of thinking that\h
the Communist Party leaders can pull back on\h\h

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,240
the ideological struggle if we appeal to their\h
self interests by helping them get rid of Xi.\h\h

134
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,000
That’s not how it works. The Chinese Communist\h
Party needs the ideological struggle against the\h\h

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,760
West in order to survive. They’ve always had\h
it, and they’re never going to give that up.

136
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,200
Fundamentally, blaming all of\h
CCP’s actions on just Xi Jinping\h\h

137
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,920
is...unsophisticated. It’s the CCP not the XiXiP.

138
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
Everything that the Longer Telegram blames Xi for\h\h

139
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,040
can be traced back to policies that were in place\h
before Xi. Did Xi make things more aggressive and\h\h

140
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,080
worse? Sure. But that’s no guarantee that\h
the next CCP leader won’t do the same.

141
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
And here’s another problem:\h\h

142
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,400
The US government does not understand the\h
factional struggle within the Communist Party.\h\h

143
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,680
Remember in 2013, when everyone thought that Xi\h
Jinping was going to be some liberal reformer?

144
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
The Longer Telegram suggests\h
that the US can somehow pressure\h\h

145
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,240
Party leaders to choose a moderate leader\h
*this* time. This is a joke. And it’s not funny.

146
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,760
The danger in getting involved the\h
way that the Longer Telegram suggests\h\h

147
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,480
is that the US government accidentally ends\h
up doing the dirty work in the factional\h\h

148
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,680
struggle. And strengthening\h
the Chinese Communist Party.\h

149
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,520
No matter how moderate the next leader may\h
appear to be, they’re not going to change\h\h

150
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,840
the fundamental nature of the Communist Party.\h
Unless they get rid of the Party completely.

151
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,280
No matter who is in charge, the Party\h
will continue the genocide in Xinjiang,\h\h

152
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:46,000
crushing Hong Kong, militarizing the South\h
China Sea, getting ready to invade Taiwan.\h\h

153
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,240
They’re not going to stop.\h

154
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,560
So in the end, the Longer\h
Telegram’s main idea doesn’t work.

155
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,080
The US would basically be saying that we\h
don’t care if the CCP oppresses people,\h\h

156
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,760
as long as they do it quietly. And hey, can\h
we buy some more of those Chinese bonds?

157
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,840
I guess we’ll just have to see\h
what happens on General Hostility.

158
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,360
Next time on General Hostility...Xi Jinping\h
appears to be winning the factional struggle\h\h

159
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,760
for the Chinese people’s\h
hearts. But he’s lost the love\h\h

160
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,560
of the West. Could the West betray\h
Xi by sleeping with his mortal enemy,\h\h

161
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,480
Jiang Zemin? Does the West really believe Jiang\h
will treat her better than Xi? Or is the West\h\h

162
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,400
just doing it for the money? Find out\h
next time...on General Hostility.\h\h

163
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,160
And now it’s time for me to answer a question\h
from a China Uncensored fan who supports the show\h\h

164
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,960
on the crowd-funding website Patreon. We could\h
always use more support at patreon.com/China\h\h

165
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,840
Uncensored. It makes a huge\h
difference for our team.\h\h

166
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,480
Charlie Badge says, Chris my question is, if\h
places like Sansha city on the paracel islands\h\h

167
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,080
are just normal parts of\h
China, can anyone visit them?

168
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,160
Well Charlie, as far as I know foreigners\h
aren’t really visiting Sansha city yet.\h\h

169
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,960
Although Chinese officials definitely\h
want to develop tourism in the area\h\h

170
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,000
as a way of further staking their\h
claim on the South China Sea.\h

171
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Since 2016, there have been “patriotic cruises”\h\h

172
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,880
running to Sansha from Hainan island in\h
southern China. What is a patriotic cruise?

173
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,520
“Aside from sightseeing, tourists will sign\h
a long paper scroll to show their support for\h\h

174
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,280
China’s territory sovereignty and sing China’s\h
national anthem on the disputed islands.”

175
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:54,240
Sounds fun! But obviously that’s geared at Chinese\h
tourists. The artificial islands themselves don’t\h\h

176
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,200
have a lot of tourism infrastructure yet. But\h
that’s definitely a possibility for the future.\h

177
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,680
Back in 2018, the Hainan government started\h
offering visa waivers to foreign travelers.\h\h

178
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,520
But I haven’t seen reports of\h
foreigners going to Sansha yet.

179
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,200
I for one recommend going to the South China Sea\h
the old-fashioned way. On a Filipino fishing boat.

180
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,480
Thanks for your question, Charlie.\h

181
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,840
And thanks for watching. I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
