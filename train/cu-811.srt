1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,020
The Communist Party has a plan to destroy
religion

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,360
And it begins with the “Red Market”

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,060
Can religion in China survive?

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,740
I’m Chris Chappell

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,550
The Chinese Communist Party has a clever plan

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,130
to destroy religion in China.

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,890
It doesn’t just attack religion from the
outside.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,019
It also tries to subvert it from within.

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,289
Shelley Zhang is back with part two

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,699
of her interview with Marco Respinti,

12
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,160
the Director-in-Charge of Bitter Winter—

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,780
who’s exposing this issue.

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,920
Mr. Respinti,

15
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,590
thank you for joining us in this park in Milan.

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,590
Thank you.

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,550
I do have to say that a lot of the things

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,040
that you report on in Bitter Winter

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,530
I really haven't seen reported anywhere else.

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,690
For example, last year the Chinese government

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,710
passed this new regulations on religious affairs.Could
you talk a little bit about that

22
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,410
and the impact that it's had?

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,410
Yeah.

24
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,440
The regulation was published

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,460
officially in February 1st, 2018,

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,410
but it was in the air for some before.

27
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:11,890
That was a really turning point in the attitude
of the CCP

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,350
towered religion because it's a very strict
law

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,000
that almost forbids every kind of religion
public manifestation.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,850
The CCP has been convinced since years,

31
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,980
and when I say years I mead decades,

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,740
that from the Mao Zedong times on, that religion

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,030
is an unnatural thing and that naturally

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,460
it will go extinct someday.

35
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,880
Also, they show that that didn't happen so
fast so

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,520
they managed to help the extinction of religion.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,470
Why they still think that religion will die
out naturally.

38
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,869
Sometimes they help this process

39
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,350
and the new regulation on religion affair

40
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,619
have been designed just for that.

41
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:15,209
To help in a very effective way the extinction
of religion.

42
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,620
Today, the religious markets of landscapes

43
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,790
can be divided into three main area.

44
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,400
According to some Chinese sociologist

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,269
who studied religion in China,

46
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:32,430
they can be divided into the gray market,

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,349
black market, red market.

48
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:41,219
The red market is the attempt by the CCP to
tame

49
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,719
and domesticate religion.

50
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,170
Trying to infiltrate

51
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,200
and control them and so this is why

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,430
they've created five patriotic circle,

53
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,129
patriotic association back in the 50s

54
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:58,519
to control Protestant, Catholics,

55
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,330
Taoists, Buddhist and Muslim.

56
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,430
This is the red market, the official religion.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,389
Then we have the gray market,

58
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,980
which is kind of mixed area

59
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,579
in which religion is not permitted,

60
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,959
but it is tolerated at some extent

61
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,919
because the religious group populating this
gray area

62
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,739
also huge are connected to some ...

63
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,040
What would these groups be?

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,810
For example the Catholic church for many time

65
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,180
or the Protestant and non patriarchal church

66
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,279
called the house church.

67
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:45,090
It's a huge network of protestants churches.

68
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,140
Very difficult to control and to infiltrate.

69
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,879
Even if they are considered enemy of the state

70
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
like every kind of religious group,

71
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,430
they are tolerated because they cannot be
repressed directly.

72
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,730
They are expecting them to die out.

73
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,049
Helping them, but tolerating them to some
extent.

74
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,730
Then we have the black market

75
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:16,239
where the groups belonging to these area called
xie jiao,

76
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,859
meaning unorthodox, heterodox.

77
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,009
Heterodox.

78
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,159
Heterodox.

79
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:28,680
Teaching, it's an old expression

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,030
used by the Chinese power back in the old
days

81
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,509
which has been resurrected by the CCP to mean,
cults.

82
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,650
This is a level for which they condemn

83
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,900
these groups like criminals

84
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,590
for just belonging to one of these groups

85
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,990
is one of the most awful crime that you can
do in China.

86
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,370
These people belonging to the black market

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,240
are persecuted directly.

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
The other groups are infiltrated, controlled,

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,340
but this is not because the CCP is good toward
them,

90
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:09,090
but because it doesn't have enough power yet

91
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,230
to repress directly all of them.

92
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,740
He tries to infiltrate and to control them
in an indirect way.

93
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,690
The black market would be which groups?

94
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,470
Falun Gong for example who has been exterminated

95
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,210
literally in huge numbers.

96
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,690
The Church of the Almighty God which is noteworthy

97
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,050
because it's the youngest new religious group
in China

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,949
and the one who is growing at a faster pace.

99
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,460
It's very huge and it's persecuted.

100
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,240
It has been called the new Falun Gong.

101
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,600
Not because of theology.

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,250
They have a completely different theology,

103
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,389
but because of the persecution there, their
suffering.

104
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,349
Groups like the Shouters where a new religious
movement

105
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,150
coming out of the Protestant universe so of
speak.

106
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,949
Many groups who are considered cults which
by the way,

107
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,969
it's an expression that scholars don't use

108
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,030
because it's a way of labeling,

109
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,169
giving names to your opponent

110
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,759
and it's not very scholarly to use that.

111
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,750
The CCP is condemning directly these people

112
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,699
and persecuting directly these people.

113
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:34,700
To the gray market, middle of the road place,

114
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:43,330
one thing which is worth it to say is that

115
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,360
they try as I said to control,

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,139
infiltrate them because they don't have the
power

117
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,430
to repress them directly

118
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,419
or because they have a connection internationally.

119
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,860
For example the Catholic church.

120
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,630
One thing is to say the Catholic church

121
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,849
is my enemy and the CCP is not using

122
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:04,470
any more of that language.

123
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,940
Another thing is trying to repress that.

124
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,750
How can you repress a thing like the Vatican,

125
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,469
the Catholic church which is all over the
world

126
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:15,410
powerful at some extent.

127
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,599
It's not the matter sometimes of the size
of the group,

128
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,199
but the connection they have.

129
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,219
For example, the Falun Gong was persecuted
the first time,

130
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,400
it didn't have so much connection abroad

131
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,330
so it was kind of an internal affair for China.

132
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,069
Then the Church of the Almighty God

133
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:38,550
is another persecuted group who had no connection

134
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,610
before they escaped China or the connections
they have now

135
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,020
is not so strong, huge and recognized publicly

136
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,620
as the Catholic church or the Protestant church

137
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:55,610
so it's easier for the CCP to go and repress
them in the dark.

138
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,599
Yes, and like you said, to use xie jiao

139
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,449
which does not mean cult in Chinese,

140
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,120
but to translate that as cult

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,509
and use that label on these groups.

142
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,509
Yeah.

143
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,199
Where would Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims

144
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
or Kazakh Muslims fall in this hierarchy?

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Yeah.

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,639
This is a good question because officially
Islam

147
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,500
could at some extent belong to the first area,

148
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,880
the red market because there is the Islamic
Chinese Association

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,070
which is the patriarchic triangle of controlling
them.

150
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,980
If you must belong or comply to that association,

151
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,160
you're tolerated officially.

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,900
If you don't, you are persecuted,

153
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,900
but what group do you belong?

154
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,260
I would say the middle of the road because
they can not define,

155
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,640
even if some try to define even Christianity
as cult,

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,000
they can not define Islam as a cult.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,190
Islam will not belong to the black market.

158
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,210
It would belong to the gray market theoretically.

159
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,940
You understand that these divisions are very
important

160
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,790
for scholars to try to figure the situation
out.

161
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,070
On the ground, the boundaries between these
groups

162
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,830
can easily be overlapped

163
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,680
and become depending on some officially,

164
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,820
they can be completely ignored.

165
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,900
As a matter of fact, in Xinjiang,

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,410
Islam is persecuted as such.

167
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:52,140
Uighur's or Muslim are persecuted because
they are know

168
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,250
Han Chinese because they belong to a different
minority.

169
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,820
Some people would think that this belongs
to some political,

170
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,410
not religious reason,

171
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,510
but this is not true

172
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,830
because alongside the Uighurs in Xinjiang,

173
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,980
all the Turkey people and Muslim people are
persecuted —

174
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,690
Kazaks, Uzbeks, Tatars,

175
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,820
these people—so they are persecuted

176
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,020
because they are minorities and Muslim.

177
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,440
Again, we have some Muslim who are not,

178
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,270
who don't belong to,

179
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,940
who are not part of any ethnic group

180
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,870
like the Hui Muslim.

181
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,710
They are Han Chinese being Muslim

182
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,350
and they were once the good Muslim,

183
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,390
but this is the words of the CCP

184
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,540
against the bad Muslim in Xinjiang.

185
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,230
We know and we have reported so much about
the persecution

186
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,160
and the CCP is waging against them today.

187
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
They are not belonging to any ethnic minority

188
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,780
so it's a war against Islam because it's a
war against religion.

189
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,740
The same happens to the Tibetan Buddhists.

190
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,770
Tibetan Buddhists,

191
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:14,740
officially again Buddhism cannot be labeled
as a cult,

192
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,060
but we know that it's strictly forbidden

193
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,200
especially in Tibet were there is also political
problem

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,140
and we don't deal with that as Bitter Winter,

195
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,930
but we know that.

196
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,050
Tibet Buddhism isn't repressed as such.

197
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,260
Practically, you could look at Tibetan Buddhism

198
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,970
as belonging to the black market.

199
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,130
Maybe the scholars would react to these

200
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,320
because it's not technically true,

201
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,450
but practically all of them are segregated.

202
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,850
All of them are denied in their rights,

203
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,740
religious and human rights so this is the
situation.

204
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,950
Are there a lot of religious believers in
China?

205
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,950
Yes.

206
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,880
I remember some studies dating back to some
10 years,

207
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,480
maybe 15 years ago something called Guarding
the Party.

208
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,490
Not meaning defaced, but meaning the CCP.

209
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,400
Meaning that the reasoning,

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:22,330
crazing religious attention at least also
within the party.

211
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,230
We know for sure and some scholars have studied

212
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,920
the unwanted effect of the Tiananmen Massacre

213
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,230
exactly 30 years ago.

214
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,830
This is in two levels.

215
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,190
First of all the CCP at that time,

216
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,000
30 years ago was convinced that what was happening

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,630
in Soviet Russia and in the East

218
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,600
meaning the crumbling of the Soviet Empire
and communism,

219
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,220
they thought that it was the effect of some
religious groups.

220
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,720
They studied carefully what was happening
there

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,950
in order to avoid that happening in China.

222
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,620
The Tiananmen Massacre can be also, not only,

223
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,290
but also explain in the way of repressing

224
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,040
potential enemies in China

225
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,600
what they did in Europe and that potential
enemies

226
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,790
are religious groups.

227
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,300
Scholars have studied that.

228
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,850
They are not convinced that the CCP was right
saying that

229
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,430
religious groups were effective in destroying
the Soviet Empire.

230
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,710
I mean, they had a role, but the role

231
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,850
was also something else in political economic
reason,

232
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,460
but the CCP has been convinced since then

233
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,380
at that time that that was the truth.

234
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,410
This explains why religion became the first
enemy of the CCP

235
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,210
because they see the potential in the religious
groups

236
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,260
of destroying China just like they think that
religious groups

237
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,650
destroyed Soviet Russia.

238
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,100
What brought them to this understanding

239
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,360
regarding China specifically

240
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,460
is that also before,

241
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,760
I mean 30 years ago before the Tiananmen Massacre,

242
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,980
people got disillusioned by the ideology

243
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,510
and they started turning to religion.

244
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:30,280
We saw the growing of an important new religious
movement

245
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,580
and also, main line religions

246
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,730
having new believers and some of them,

247
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,500
many of them, I will not say most,

248
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
but many of them belonged also to the party.

249
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,480
The growing after the Tiananmen Massacre,

250
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,230
the growing of some new religious movement

251
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,550
like the Falun Gong and others,

252
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,130
but also main line Christianity and Buddhism
and Islam

253
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,610
can be explained saying that in face of the
massacre,

254
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,780
of that massacre,

255
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,620
people got even more disillusioned by communism

256
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,940
and these effect also some official within
the CCP.

257
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,540
So what you're saying is that the CCP's

258
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,910
fear of religious organizations

259
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,820
or that they could somehow present

260
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,730
an ideological challenge to the CCP

261
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,880
goes back 30 years?

262
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,170
Yes.

263
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,970
From what you were saying about the religious
affairs,

264
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,190
regulations,

265
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,810
it could seem like the CCP's repression of
religion

266
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,250
is very new.

267
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,070
Well, if we studied history,

268
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:48,300
we see that religion has always been persecuted
as such.

269
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,380
Of course, there are up and downs.

270
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,240
This belong of course to different personality

271
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,810
of the leaders of the CCP,

272
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,680
but also depends on the strength that they
have.

273
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,920
As I said, I think that Xi Jinping now either
has

274
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,420
or think to have the strength to go back to

275
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,040
the old days of direct persecution.

276
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,370
I also see that Xi Jinping thinks of himself

277
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,970
as a kind of new Mao Zedong and I explain
why.

278
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,420
Even if there are differences,

279
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,220
huge differences in terms of history,

280
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,240
circumstances and ideology also,

281
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,970
he made himself president for life.

282
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,650
He inserted his own thinking within the constitution

283
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,740
ust like Mao Zedong did.

284
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,100
He thinks of himself as being the real leader
of the church,

285
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,260
maybe the new God.

286
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,490
I'm not making it up.

287
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,260
We know when we published the attempt of some
CCP official

288
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,910
to go into churches, mosques

289
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,360
and even families tearing down religious pictures
of Jesus

290
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,410
or of Buddhist signs, Islamic signs,

291
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,930
substituting them with two portraits,

292
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,100
Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping.

293
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,910
Then going back to the families one week later

294
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,430
to check out if they were praying actively

295
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,480
to those two portraits.

296
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,180
Even if it's a secular atheistic ideology,

297
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,730
communism and the CCP know how much important

298
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,480
is religion for the people.

299
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,380
They are trying to substitute themselves to
God

300
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,110
because they fear God or they fear religious
people.

301
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,880
Yes, there is an increase in direct persecution

302
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,100
from last year on,

303
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:59,220
but up and downs not withstanding,

304
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,030
persecution has been around always in different
ways.

305
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,930
Again, this depends on the strength.

306
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,630
It depends on some of the context.

307
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,520
China today is in the news.

308
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,560
It has many ties, political and economically

309
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,310
with many, many, many nations.

310
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,970
I think that that is my opinion.

311
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,250
I think that Xi Jinping and his officials

312
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,070
think that people will not pay too much attention

313
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,470
to human rights if they do something wrong

314
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,540
because they have other interests, economic
and political.

315
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,740
I think that it is the right moment for them

316
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,810
to repress directly religion.

317
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,320
Maybe 10 years ago, 20 years ago, they were
not.

318
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,010
The CCP I mean were not in the position to
do that,

319
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,280
but the cast of mind of thinking that religion

320
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,200
is unnatural and that will naturally die out

321
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,880
never abandoned the CCP.

322
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,100
One thing that I noticed from Bitter Winter’s
reporting is,

323
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,780
seems like a lot of the things that the Chinese
Communist Party

324
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,740
is doing to repress religion affect all Chinese
people,

325
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,820
not just religious believers.

326
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,860
Things like having the turning churches

327
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,180
or religious buildings into these ...

328
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,780
what are they called?

329
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,850
The civil [crosstalk] leader

330
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,720
or it was civilization practice centers.

331
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,880
Yeah, civilization practice center

332
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,220
to sinicize religion and groups.

333
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,500
So to kind of replace that with kind of communist
party ideology

334
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,590
where instead of going to church on Sunday,

335
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,100
now everybody in the village has to come and
do something else,

336
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,310
listen to operas, talk about the CCP or something

337
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:52,220
or the district people who have to kin of
monitor everybody

338
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,240
and know whether people in their neighborhood

339
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,250
are practicing religions or other things about
this

340
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,430
because it's something is spreading

341
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:03,190
to even people who are not active religious
believers.

342
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,320
Yeah, I strongly think so and this is fact

343
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,811
because I mean, attacking and destroying religious
group

344
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:19,030
or religion as such don't effect only religious
people.

345
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,650
For good or for bad, if we like it or not,
believers or not,

346
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,780
religion is part of the cultural landscape
of humankind

347
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,100
that's been around since forever.

348
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,260
It will never die out even if the CCP thinks
differently.

349
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,010
We in fact see spreading of a new spring for
religion.

350
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,450
Many growths, many new growths,

351
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,990
many different persuasion, many phase, many
creeds.

352
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,710
It's part of the world.

353
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,420
To think that you can eliminate completely

354
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:04,210
religion from human culture and human civilization,

355
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,430
it's a crazy thing to do.

356
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,590
If you eliminate religion in many groups in
people,

357
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,360
you will not have art, music, whatever.

358
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,840
Even if you're not a believer,

359
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,160
if you're not a church goer,

360
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,480
if you don't go to the mass,

361
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
if you don't practice religion,

362
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,120
religion comes to you in terms of culture.

363
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,490
Music, art, literature, whatever you want.

364
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,660
You name it.

365
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,960
It's not possible to separate one or the other.

366
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,360
If you attack religion,

367
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,990
you will end up in attacking normal people,

368
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,010
also non believers.

369
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,920
This is one thing.

370
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,420
The second thing is that in order to repress
a religion,

371
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,970
the CCP is establishing a way of controlling
society

372
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,060
in every little corner.

373
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:01,150
There are facial recognition machines.

374
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,370
There are people who want to go abroad

375
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,190
and have a passport and that's proof some
questions.

376
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,930
If you enroll in university,

377
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,550
they will ask you if you are a believer

378
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,290
and if your parents.

379
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,910
There is a control on the life of the people.

380
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,860
I can imagine one non believer being annoying

381
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,690
by seeing his son going to the university

382
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,710
and being questioned if he's a believer or
not.

383
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:36,360
This is a violation of your rights and freedom.

384
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,590
Thirdly, China is becoming very repressive

385
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,670
or is already a very repressive society.

386
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,420
Some people say that regarding Xinjiang for
example,

387
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,080
yes, we know the tragedy of the camps.

388
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,430
Some scholars who visited Xinjiang says okay,

389
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,520
we have the camps,

390
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,290
but Xinjiang as such has become

391
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,450
an open air huge detention camp.

392
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,810
Meaning that people are repressing

393
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,230
their own fundamental freedoms, liberties.

394
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,350
Yes, attacking religion is affecting also
non believers.

395
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,840
This is bad for the whole society.

396
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,590
What would you say that Bitter Winter

397
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,130
has been reporting that's not getting enough
attention

398
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,380
in international media?

399
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,700
Well unfortunately,

400
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,059
many of the things that we publish

401
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,600
don't get enough attention.

402
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,140
We Uighurs, we deal a lot with Uighurs,

403
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,470
and they are in the news at some extent,

404
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,830
because the US, the US congress passed laws,
bills,

405
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,380
and there was much attention in the US on
Uighurs,

406
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,620
also because the Uighurs are lobbying very
well, in the US.

407
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,150
But there is much more than that,

408
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,230
I mean there are many more countries in the
world,

409
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,260
and there are many more problems in China

410
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,450
that don't get the same attention.

411
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,990
Out of many, I just mentioned one,

412
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,010
and the problem is refugees.

413
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,330
The persecution in China gets many Chinese
to escape.

414
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,850
They come to the West, they go to many countries.

415
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,809
They have the problem of being accepted, as
full citizens.

416
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,010
There is a lot of rhetoric these days on immigration.

417
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,650
I don't justify all that rhetoric,

418
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,740
but I understand when people are saying

419
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,070
that sometimes immigration can cause problems.

420
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,450
But one thing is to send lawfully back some,

421
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:42,130
unlawful immigrants because of economic reason.

422
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,210
It's a bad thing if he is poor,

423
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,540
but we need to cope with that.

424
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,760
A totally different thing is to get back on
the spot

425
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,179
some Chinese exiles who has been persecuted

426
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:59,390
for his religious or her religious faith

427
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,910
and these people get arrested, detained, tortured,

428
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,230
and even killed right away.

429
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,510
So we have a responsibility toward those people.

430
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,310
And if we don't cope with that we will be,

431
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,330
some extent,

432
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,110
aiding the CCP in its crimes.

433
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,630
Thank you so much for joining us today.

434
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,500
Thank you.

435
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
And that's it for today's China Uncensored.

436
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
Make sure to check out part one of this interview

437
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,740
which we published last week.

438
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,920
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell.

439
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,880
See you next time.
