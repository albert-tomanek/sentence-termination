00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:01,830
On this episode of China Uncensored,

00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,900
5 Ways China Plans to Dominate SpaceHi,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,160
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
Space.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,640
The final frontier...

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,850
for China’s enterprising space program.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,150
Its continuing mission:

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,199
to explore places

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,390
where NASA probes have already gone,

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,509
to dominate other civilizations,

12
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:27,849
and to boldly steal US space technology.

13
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:30,920
China truly does have ambitious space plans.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,610
And if you watched Valerian,

15
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,840
which you probably didn’t,

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,270
you’d know that the Chinese government

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,570
sees its own future in space.

18
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,670
And with NASA funding having leveled off in
recent years,

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,960
China hopes it can be the new space sheriff
in town.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
So what, exactly,

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,920
are China’s plans to dominate space?

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,620
Here are five of them.

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,220
Number 5: Moon Rover

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,400
But not just any moon rover.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,040
This one will land on the dark side of the
moon.

26
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,900
Presumably, to make contact with the Decepticons,

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,250
hoping to ally with them and dominate the
Earth.

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,340
What they don’t realize is that the Decepticons

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,510
would never team up with the Chinese Communist
Party.

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,570
Even Decepticons have standards.

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,230
China has a mission to land a rover

32
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,490
on the dark side of the moon

33
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,980
at end of 2018.

34
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,790
It’s a technical challenge because communications

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,880
are harder to handle with a probe on the dark
side.

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,130
The mission is called Chang’e-4,

37
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,910
named after the Chinese goddess

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,870
who lives on the moon.

39
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,390
The point of the Chinese rover mission

40
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,940
is to study the moon’s geology—

41
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,630
and to prove once and for all

42
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,840
that the moon has been part of China’s territory

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,390
since ancient times.

44
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,659
Number 4: Mars Rover

45
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,950
Not content with sending a rover just to the
moon,

46
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,130
China also wants to send a rover to Mars.

47
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,680
I mean, it’s called the Red Planet.

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,000
It’s just asking to be conquered by communists!

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,659
The mission is set to launch in 2020.

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,710
It will land a rover that will collect important
data

51
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,590
on temperature, atmosphere, and surface conditions.

52
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,310
I guess no one told them that NASA

53
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,369
has been landing rovers on Mars since 1997.

54
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,270
Wouldn’t it be easier for the Chinese military

55
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,260
to just hack that temperature data from the
US?

56
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,940
Actually, they can just Google it.

57
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Oh, wait.

58
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,260
Google’s blocked in China.

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,790
Number 3: Asteroid Moonification

60
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,930
A Chinese space official said earlier this
year

61
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,830
that China plans to launch several

62
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,900
asteroid exploration spacecraft

63
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,680
starting in 2020.

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
The ultimate goal:

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,580
“to ‘capture’ an asteroid

66
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,470
and try to fire it into the moon’s orbit.”

67
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,130
The idea would be to land a spacecraft

68
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,780
on the asteroid’s surface, and then—

69
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,200
not kidding here—

70
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,330
use rockets to change its trajectory

71
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,209
and propel it into orbit around the moon,

72
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,240
creating a moon moon.

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Also called moonception.

74
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,430
Sure, sending a spaceship to an asteroid

75
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,930
may sound like the plot of a bad 90s movie

76
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,020
starring Bruce Willis and Steven Tyler’s
screaming.

77
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,510
But as outlandish as this idea sounds,

78
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,620
the Chinese are giving it serious consideration.

79
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,340
And there’s a practical purpose here:

80
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,099
A single asteroid can contain

81
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,239
more than a trillion dollars in precious metals.

82
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,239
In addition,

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,520
China’s space officials suggest that an
asteroid

84
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,690
could even maybe become a base for a future
space station.

85
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,690
Low gravity,

86
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,140
and lots of metal for construction.

87
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,959
And speaking of space stations...

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,050
Number 2: Regular Space Station

89
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,410
This one is much more realistic

90
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,629
than capturing an asteroid.

91
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,500
China wants to have the dominant space station

92
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
in low earth orbit.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right now,

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,870
the International Space Station is pretty
much

95
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,879
the go-to place for hanging out in space

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,030
and making brushing your teeth look fun.

97
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,560
China already has a couple of space stations:

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,209
Tiangong-2, which is in orbit

99
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,629
but currently floating around unmanned;

100
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:51,640
and Tiangong-1

101
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,489
which is done with its mission

102
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,550
and is about to crash land on Earth somewhere

103
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,720
and hopefully not kill anybody.

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,430
Now China wants to launch Tiangong-3 in 2022.

105
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,020
It will be a permanently manned modular space
station,

106
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,930
meaning it can be expanded.

107
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,650
The International Space Station is set to
be

108
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,330
decommissioned in 2024.

109
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,690
So if Tiangong-3 is successful,

110
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,500
it could become the world’s dominant

111
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,959
zero-gravity research facility

112
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,780
for astronauts brushing their teeth.

113
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,199
And number 1: Space Weapons

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,830
Because an authoritarian regime’s

115
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,970
ambitious space plans

116
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,830
couldn’t be complete without space weapons.

117
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,600
Researchers from China’s top laser research
institute

118
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,620
have proposed building a 5-ton spacecraft

119
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,120
that would orbit the Earth,

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
and could be used to shoot down other satellites

121
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,330
with chemical lasers.

122
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,330
They wrote that

123
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,270
“the space-based laser weapon system

124
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,440
will be one of the major [anti-satellite]
development projects.”

125
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,830
This is a big deal,

126
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,830
because such a weapon,

127
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,360
if it actually gets funded,

128
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,870
could destroy the communications

129
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,060
and monitoring equipment of an enemy.

130
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,060
For example,

131
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
Canada.

132
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,960
And that could also blind this country

133
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,000
to China’s launch of various missiles

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,580
or other combat satellites.

135
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,250
But don’t worry,

136
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,620
Chinese state media assures us

137
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,550
that China’s space program,

138
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,500
which is run by the Chinese military,

139
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,760
is all about peace.

140
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,140
The way China’s urban management police

141
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,320
are all about social harmony.

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,810
Hey, elderly people are a serious threat

143
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,580
and need to be harmonized.

144
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,060
And coming up after the break,

145
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,560
something smells rotten in Australia.

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,360
And, no,

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,380
it’s not a Vegemite sandwich.

148
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,800
