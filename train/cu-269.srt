00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,890
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,820
Oh oh! It’s a party!

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,560
A Communist Party!

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,010
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,430
Today is the 50th anniversary

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,190
of China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,410
Just how great was it?

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,300
Well, it was such a disaster that

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,100
even the state-run Global Times called it,

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,920
“painful,”

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,740
“chaotic,”

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,160
and “a devastating decade of political turmoil.”

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,859
Even the Communist Party itself admits that

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,219
the Great Helmsman Mao Zedong’s Cultural
Revolution was

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,600
“a serious mistake,” and that

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,620
Mao was “70 percent right and 30 percent
wrong.”

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,899
Part of that 30 percent wrong is

19
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,510
presumably killing two million people during
that time.

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,940
Mao began the Cultural Revolution in May 1966

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,629
to purge his enemies and restore ideological
purity to the Communist Party.

22
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:01,469
The revolution raged out of control,

23
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,910
only coming to an end because Mao died in
1976.

24
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,830
Not only was it a period of good old fashioned
book burning,

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,940
temple smashing,

26
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,300
and people yelling—

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,420
but also pure political chaos.

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,140
You could be a model member of the Communist
Party one day,

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,050
and the next—purged—

30
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,210
only to later find yourself back on top.

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,820
In fact, that’s what happened

32
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,480
to Mao’s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Twice.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,460
The human cost of the Cultural Revolution
was immense.

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,580
Groups of violent young people known as the
Red Guards

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,740
denounced, beat, and even killed people

37
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,490
who were branded "counter-revolutionaries."

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,450
In some areas the political frenzy was so
insane

39
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,550
that people literally ate these so-called
enemies.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,100
People were encouraged to report their neighbors,

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,180
friends, even family members.

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,400
In 1970, 16-year-old Zhang Hongbing

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,560
heard his mother criticize Mao for starting
the Cultural Revolution.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,780
He reported her to the police and recommended
that she should be shot.

45
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,099
She was beaten and executed.

46
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,439
Now Zhang is trying to tell his story

47
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,619
in hopes that the Cultural Revolution will
never happen again.

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,980
It's not so easy,

49
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,620
because the Communist Party,

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,689
while acknowledging that the Cultural Revolution
was a mistake,

51
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:27,099
doesn't really want people talking about what
happened.

52
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,679
So it was a little surprising to suddenly
see this:

53
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,599
A massive "patriotic" concert

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,859
featuring songs and imagery from the Cultural
Revolution.

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,200
Complete with slogans like

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,730
“People of the world unite and defeat the
American invaders and their running dogs.”

57
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,719
Which kind of raises the question:

58
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,819
Who’s idea was this concert?

59
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,799
Amazingly, no one really seems to know.

60
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:00,099
The performance was put on by the patriotic
girl band 56 Flowers

61
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,489
and the China National Opera and Dance Drama
Theatre.

62
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,450
According to the South China Morning Post,

63
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,650
the second group said,

64
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,279
“It had been deceived by its partner,

65
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:13,999
which claimed to be from an office under the
Party’s Central Publicity ­Department.”

66
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,609
That would be “the Central Propaganda Department
Office

67
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:19,609
for the Promotion of Socialist Core Values,”

68
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,009
which apparently does not exist.

69
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,680
State-run Global Times said,

70
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:28,009
“We do not believe the show has any official
backing.”

71
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,020
But it was held in the Great Hall of the People.

72
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:34,849
That would be like saying a concert at the
US Capitol building

73
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,499
had no official backing.

74
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,400
Plus, several officials from the

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,120
Central Propaganda Department were in the
audience.

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,019
And state-run media published articles about
the concert.

77
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,579
Until they were deleted.

78
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,000
But here’s a hint at what’s behind it:

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,580
Giant picture of Mao Zedong,

80
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,400
giant picture of Xi Jinping.

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,640
Giant picture of Mao Zedong,

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
giant picture of Xi Jinping.

83
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,560
Hmm, if I didn’t know any better,

84
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,149
I’d say someone is trying to make a comparison.

85
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:01,660
And for Xi Jinping,

86
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,220
that’s a dangerous comparison for people
to make.

87
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,239
Ever since Mao,

88
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,430
the Party has been terrified of the thrall
of a personality cult.

89
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,919
Remember the last guy that tried to start
one?

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,240
Bo Xilai.

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,720
He’s now in jail for life.

92
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,140
And yet it seems like the same kind of cult

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,580
is being built up around Xi Jinping.

94
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,220
From memorabilia,

95
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,900
to songs and dance,

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,940
to totally impromptu praise from foreign students
put out by Chinese media.

97
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,480
"A very humble leader."

98
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,510
"Powerful Chinese leader."

99
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,930
"A wise and resolute president."

100
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,060
"Handsome, yah!"

101
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,230
So this concert can’t actually be good for
Xi, right?

102
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,220
Well, that may be the point.

103
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,680
The day after the Cultural Revolution concert,

104
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,380
Xi just so happened to give a speech warning

105
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,980
about “cabals and cliques” within the
Communist Party.

106
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,740
He said, “There are careerists and conspirators

107
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,670
existing in our Party and undermining the
Party’s governance.”

108
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,830
And by governance he most likely means himself.

109
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,380
Since Xi stepped onto the stage in 2012,

110
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,000
there’s been a constant power struggle between
Xi

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,140
and the people who used to hold the reins
within the Communist Party:

112
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,380
a faction—or “cabal”, if you will—

113
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,620
affiliated with former Chinese leader Jiang
Zemin.

114
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,710
And it just so happens that many of the most
powerful members of

115
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,210
Jiang’s old guard have been purged in Xi’s
so-called anti-corruption campaign.

116
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,240
But hey, as Xi said,

117
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,250
the “fight against corruption is...not a
‘House of Cards’ power struggle.”

118
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,600
So I was right!

119
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,770
Xi Jinping does watch House of Cards.

120
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,700
Anyway, Xi has been amassing power and titles.

121
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,560
He just appointed himself as China’s first
ever Commander-in-Chief.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,490
So is he the next Mao?

123
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,900
Well, as Roderick MacFarquhar,

124
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,780
an expert in elite Communist Party politics,
put it,

125
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,570
“Chairman Mao never needed titles.

126
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,070
Everyone knew who was in charge.”

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,800
So was this Cultural Revolution concert

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,460
just a way for Xi’s rivals to compare him
to Mao,

129
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,250
so they could criticize him and take him down?

130
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,080
Might not be as far fetched as it sounds.

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,460
Liu Yunshan—the official in charge of China’s
propaganda—

132
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,880
is one of Xi Jinping’s big rivals.

133
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,240
So, there’s a mysterious concert

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,310
It appears to have been approved in some way

136
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,290
by the Propaganda Department.

137
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,580
And it could make Xi Jinping look like a dangerous
leader

138
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,560
of a personality cult on the anniversary of
the Cultural Revolution.

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,950
Then, outrage over the concert,

140
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,190
people blame a fake propaganda agency,

141
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,950
censorship ensues.

142
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,540
Evidence of a power struggle?

143
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,260
Or inept political blundering?

144
