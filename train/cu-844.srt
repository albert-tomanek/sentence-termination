00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,540
China: home of shiny high-speed trains,

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,040
and gleaming skyscrapers,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,400
and...

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,940
also, really poor people.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,120
So is China a rich developed country or still developing country

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,240
I mean potato potato, does it even matter what you call it?

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,500
Well as it turns out, yes!

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,520
Welcome back to China Uncensored. I'm Chris Chappell

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,300
International trade what a beautiful thing!

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
Thanks to it. We enjoy

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,620
exotic products like bananas or coffee or Raisinets.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,720
Or everyday low prices at Walmart

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,440
as long as you don't think too hard about where those low prices come from

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,800
But behind the scenes

15
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,600
international trade is a competitive game.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,060
Think of it like mixed martial arts

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,640
You know, everyone has their different styles of trading.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,380
This guy definitely seems like a protectionist.

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,880
And though it may not always seem like it,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,080
there are rules you have to follow

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,560
like no biting or eye gouging.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,920
Who makes the rules?

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,760
Well in MMA

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,100
it's the UFC.

25
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,900
And if you break the rules in the ring, there are consequences.

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,640
In international trade, there's no UFC, but there is the WTO or the World Trade Organization.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,760
Like an octagon where bureaucrats in suits thrash out their differences on trade issues

28
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Unfortunately. they actually do it seated at conference tables and not in the Octagon.

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,940
I would pay to watch that, though.

30
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,780
But settling disputes about whether countries are playing by the rules isn't the only thing the WTO does.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:45,580
Its main function is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly predictably and freely as possible.

32
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,260
And besides settling disputes and reducing trade tensions it also helps poor countries develop,

33
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,180
and gives the weaker countries a stronger voice

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,220
That means weaker or developing countries get preferential treatment.

35
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,120
Imagine a UFC match where the weaker opponent gets all kinds of handicaps.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,140
For example,

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,560
He's allowed to occasionally eye gouge you.

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,240
President Trump,

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,000
who's an expert at complaining about things on Twitter, put it this way:

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,040
China is a great economic power?

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,060
but it's considered a developing nation by the WTO.

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,200
They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages.

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,760
That's essentially true.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,320
According to the WTO

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,820
there are special provisions

46
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,320
Which give developing countries special rights.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,660
And for the Chinese government being able to claim

48
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,220
developing country status has been a pretty sweet deal.

49
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,700
Like in the area of government procurement.

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,740
When the Chinese government buys stuff it's allowed to

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,820
discriminate against foreign companies by favoring higher priced and lower quality

52
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,000
domestic providers over lower priced and higher quality foreign providers.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,640
The US government is not allowed to do that and

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,440
developed countries like the US are supposed to give developing countries special breaks

55
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,360
like setting low tariffs on goods from developing countries.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,920
But developing countries can set high tariffs on goods from developed countries.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,760
That means for example that US companies have a harder time selling their stuff in China

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,820
The WTO also encourages developed countries like the U.S.

59
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,860
to share technology with developing countries.

60
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,140
What's called technology transfer.

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,120
That doesn't mean China is allowed to just steal intellectual property.

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
But it does mean the WTO often turns a blind eye to it.

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,580
So basically when China steps into the Octagon against the US or Europe the WTO refs

64
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,480
Let China wear body armor and they look the other way when China gets in one of those eye gouges.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,160
Some of these WTO advantages really do make sense for developing countries like Jamaica.

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,660
It would be unfair if big foreign companies came in and just totally dominate that Jamaican economy.

67
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,640
To make it ought to be given the time to develop its own industries like sugar and coffee and Bob Marley.

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,380
But China's economy is a thousand times bigger.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,160
In fact, China's economy is larger than the economy of every single developed country except the US

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,800
So does it still make sense to treat China as a developing country?

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,460
Well guess what: it's complicated.

72
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,400
When China started applying to join the WTO back in 1986, it was poor.

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,440
the average gross domestic product or GDP was about

74
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,560
$700 per person per year

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,780
Compare that to nineteen thousand per person for the U.S. at the time.

76
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,000
But that's all changed.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,420
According to the International Monetary Fund

78
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,960
China's per capita GDP is now 25 times bigger

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,820
So China's developed now, right?

80
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,580
Well, not exactly...

81
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,180
Jeremy Wallace a professor at Cornell University says China is complicated.

82
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,240
In many ways China is both a developed and a developing country.

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,140
The vast majority of Chinese people are poor and yet because China is such a huge country

84
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,940
it is still the case that there are a huge number of rich people in China.

85
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,400
In fact, there are kind of more rich people in China than there are

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,340
people in the United Kingdom

87
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,800
Bjorn Conrad vice president of the Mercator Institute for China studies breaks it down like this:

88
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,060
It's a...

89
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,300
developed country if you look at number of Starbucks or

90
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,120
literacy rate.

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,940
It's a developing country if you look at the numbers of doctors per capita or

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,280
percentage of the workforce that works in agriculture

93
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,040
Okay, China, has lots of Starbucks, but not enough doctors.

94
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,540
So is China developing or developed?

95
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,920
Since the WTO gives certain advantages only to developing countries,

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,460
surely the WTO has a strict set of criteria to make this distinction, right?

97
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,360
Turns out, nope, the WTO has no official definition

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,420
Members announce for themselves whether they are developed or developing countries.

99
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,920
Which is like letting each UFC fighter decide for themselves whether they're allowed to eye gouge their opponent.

100
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,660
And which do you think that Chinese Communist Party chose?

101
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:29,860
Since it joined the WTO in 2001, it's been calling China a developing nation, and it's gotten all the cool perks.

102
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:37,280
China was the world's fifth biggest economy back then but within a decade it has pulled into second place.

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,740
Now the US and Europe are both calling, China out,

104
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,440
Arguing it's a big enough player that it has to start playing by the rules of developed countries

105
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,620
But the Chinese authorities are pretty sure that China is still developing

106
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,240
So what do you think about the preferential treatment at the World Trade Organization?

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,860
Is it time China got a status upgrade?
