00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,600
welcome to the arm show.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,560
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,880
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,480
the US and China are in an arms race.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,020
A hypersonic missile arms race.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,040
Oh, and Russia is involved too.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,030
And China is winning.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,789
An anonymous US government source

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,430
told the Diplomat that in November,

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,820
China conducted two tests

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,070
of a hypersonic glide vehicle,

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,890
or HGV.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,090
That makes it, “the first HGV test in the
world

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,880
using a system intended to be fielded operationally.”

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,220
It’s called the Dong Feng, or Eastern Wind,
17.

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,480
And it’s estimated to be ready to deploy
by 2020.

18
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,000
The DF-17 is the first missile system

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,059
that uses a hypersonic glide vehicle.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,059
The United States and Russia

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,579
have both conducted developmental tests, too—

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,199
but neither country is known to have taken

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,020
concrete steps towards deploying these systems.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,080
So how fast is the DF-17?

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,890
Well, in a China test flight on November 1,

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,390
it flew 870 miles in 11 minutes.

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,820
That would be like going from New York

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,950
to St. Louis in 11 minutes.

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,510
Although why anyone would be in

30
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,990
such a hurry to get to St. Louis is beyond
me.

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,990
But anyway,

32
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,650
the missile they tested traveled at Mach 6—

33
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,560
or 6 times the speed of sound.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,570
And three times the speed of the Mach 3 razor.

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,040
Oh, and by the way,

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,130
this kind of missile can theoretically be
designed

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,060
to carry a nuclear bomb.

38
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,619
That’s a big concern for US defense officials.

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,450
Doug Wise of the Defense Intelligence Agency
points out that while the US has focused

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,870
its military attention on the Middle East,

41
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,640
ISIS probably won’t be able to

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,689
actually destroy America.

43
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,840
“You want to talk about an existential threat?

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,450
How about China’s hypersonic glide missile,

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,450
which can travel at

46
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,270
multiple times the speed of sound

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,179
and could take out an aircraft carrier

48
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,289
before you could even blink?

49
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,809
If the entire Pacific Fleet was at

50
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:13,840
the bottom of the Pacific Ocean,

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,090
that would pose an existential threat.”

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,319
Hypersonic missiles work differently

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,189
than conventional ballistic ones.

54
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:21,830
These don’t enter space.

55
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,579
Instead, they fly low at high speeds,

56
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,319
allowing them to hide from traditional radar
scans.

57
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,150
There’s a lot more complicated to design,
though,

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,650
because aerodynamics are different

59
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,779
at ultra-high speeds.

60
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,989
And it seems China may

61
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,719
surpass the United States

62
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,879
in hypersonic missile testing facilities.

63
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,819
According to the South China Morning Post,

64
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,209
“China is building the world’s fastest
wind tunnel

65
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,620
to simulate hypersonic flight at speeds

66
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,139
of up to 7 and half miles per second”—

67
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,150
or Mach 35.

68
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,080
Which is the kind of razor that I use.

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,949
It’s very manly.

70
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:57,949
Just to give you an idea,

71
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:01,359
Mach 35 is nearly six times faster

72
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,339
than the hypersonic missile China built

73
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,560
and tested in November.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,589
But it gives you a really close shave.

75
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,709
A missile traveling at Mach 35

76
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,870
could reach the west coast of the United States

77
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,040
from China in less than 14 minutes.

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,450
Don’t worry; this one’s still just

79
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,689
a prototype in a wind tunnel.

80
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:23,949
But here’s how it gets to Mach 35:

81
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,419
It explodes tubes of oxygen, hydrogen,

82
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,260
and nitrogen gases.

83
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,510
That not only produces incredible speed,

84
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,439
but also incredible heat.

85
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,900
Prototype vehicles placed in the new wind
tunnel

86
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,089
reach temperatures, “nearly 50 percent hotter

87
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,599
than the surface of the sun.”

88
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,010
After China, the second-fasted wind tunnel

89
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,010
is in the US.

90
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,400
It’s called the LENS-X.

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,719
But it can only simulate speeds

92
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,469
up to Mach 28—

93
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,290
compared to China’s Mach 35.

94
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,390
It’s like Chinese engineers

95
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,639
are just mocking us.

96
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,379
China’s state-run CCTV recently released

97
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,909
this footage of their current wind tunnel

98
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,540
and hypersonic glider,

99
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,560
the JF-12 Hyper Dragon.

100
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,859
Yes, Hyper Dragon.

101
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,790
Coming soon to Nintendo Switch.

102
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,339
You’ll need really fast reflexes.

103
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:15,290
Of course the main fear is not so much

104
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,560
that the Chinese Communist Party

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,379
will nuke the United States.

106
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,879
It’s that if China is the first to successfully
develop

107
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,639
these super-hypersonic missiles,

108
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,720
it will change the balance of power

109
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,320
in the Asia Pacific region.

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,439
Because of their incredible speed

111
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,430
and lower flight path,

112
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,819
hypersonic missiles could get through

113
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,360
US missile defense systems in Asia—

114
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,159
like THAAD in South Korea.

115
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,520
“Once the THAAD radars fail to

116
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,400
function in the first stage,

117
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,580
it could reduce the window

118
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,610
to raise the alarm

119
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,360
about the PLA’s intercontinental ballistic
missiles

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,590
leaving the U.S. without enough time to intercept.”

121
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,590
But don’t worry,

122
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,000
there would still be plenty of time

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,919
for the State of Hawaii to issue an alert...

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,620
that everyone ignores this time.

125
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,979
Fortunately, US weapons maker Lockheed Martin

126
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,250
is already talking about an update to THAAD

127
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,910
to handle hypersonic missiles.

128
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,020
The bigger concern is the proliferation

129
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,380
of hypersonic weapons in the 21st century.

130
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,689
The Rand Corporation,

131
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,110
not be confused with Rand Enterprises

132
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,930
from everyone’s least favorite Netflix Marvel
show,

133
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,189
Iron Fist,

134
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,909
warns it could lead to countries

135
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:25,360
adopting a “launch on warning” defense
policy.

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,690
That’s when a counter strike is launched

137
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,360
before incoming missiles reach their targets.

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,789
Next month, the Trump Administration

139
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:36,230
will release a new Nuclear Posture Review.

140
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,919
Will the administration tackle the issue

141
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,060
of hypersonic proliferation?

142
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
What do you think?

143
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,380
Leave your comments below.

144
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,580
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

145
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,320
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

146
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
See you next time.

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759
Hypersonic missiles sure move fast.

148
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,759
But don’t worry,

149
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,150
you still have plenty of time

150
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,050
to get to your underground bunker

151
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,830
and switch on your favorite episodes

152
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,830
of China Uncensored.

153
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,659
You can even watch the full half-hour versions

154
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,710
on our website, ChinaUncensored.tv.

155
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,630
How else would you want to spend your time

156
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,300
before the missiles hit?
