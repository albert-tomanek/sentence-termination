1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,580
Teaching English in China

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,069
Some say the risk

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:05,760
Is greater than the reward

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,420
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,910
We’ve all been there.

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,940
You worked hard to get your expensive college
degree...

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,260
only to realize it’s left you

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,869
desperately unprepared for the real world.

10
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,610
So what do you do?

11
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,500
Obviously the answer is take out student loans

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,340
to go back to school and get another expensive
degree.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,700
Don’t try this at home, kids.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,960
Trust me.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,280
But for others who don’t go to grad school,

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,320
the answer could be teaching English overseas.

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,850
Now I often get asked:

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,940
Is it a good idea to teach English in China?

19
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,180
To which I say,

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,140
teaching English in an authoritarian surveillance
state

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,960
that arrests people in the middle of the night

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,079
and sends them to labor camps?

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,530
What could possibly go wrong?

24
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,720
There are about 400,000 foreigners

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,850
working in the Chinese education system.

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,020
But, oddly enough,

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,960
things are going wrong.

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
According to Reuters,

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,400
there’s been a surge of arrests of foreign
teachers in China.

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,520
In fact, one American lawyer

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,230
whose firm has been handling many of the cases,
said,

32
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,780
“The risks of going to China to teach far
outweigh the rewards.”

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,840
They’ve written extensively about it on
their own website.

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,310
The risks are serious.

35
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,850
Education First is a Swiss company

36
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,330
that operates 300 schools in China.

37
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,450
They’ve seen a “significant” increase
in detentions in China

38
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,810
for alleged offenses including drugs,

39
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,720
fighting and cybersecurity violations.

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,729
Mainly these detentions have resulted in docked
pay or deportation.

41
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,790
But some of those crimes, especially drug
crimes,

42
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,320
can be met with severe punishment in China.

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
Especially if, for instance, the country you’re
from

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,020
might be having a political dispute with China.

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,470
But Chris, you say, Chinese authorities should
crack down

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,990
on foreign teachers guilty of drug offenses.

47
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,829
Well, they’re not just going after teachers

48
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,380
who committed drug offenses *in China.*

49
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,840
According to Education First,

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,039
staff have been “picked up by police at
their home and work

51
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,930
as well as in bars and nightclubs and have
been questioned

52
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,389
and brought in for drug testing.”

53
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,879
That drug testing involves using hair samples.

54
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,069
Hair samples can contain traces of cannabis
for up to three months.

55
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,609
That can be a problem for teachers who come
from countries

56
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:27,879
where cannabis is legal.

57
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,090
Like parts of the United States.

58
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,699
Or all of Canada.

59
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,379
Now is generally not a great time to be Canadian
in China.

60
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,319
In fact, Canadians in China might want to

61
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,370
just pretend to be Americans.

62
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,000
It’s only fair.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,430
Americans abroad have been pretending to be
Canadians for years.

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,189
Anyway, China’s Ministry of Education is
using these drug “scandals”

65
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:51,590
to make a push for dealing with foreign teachers

66
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,200
“in a serious manner with no appeasement.”

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,650
But don’t worry.

68
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,590
It’s not that the Chinese Communist Party

69
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,239
simply hates foreign English teachers.

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,309
They hate foreigners in general!

71
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,969
See, this latest crackdown on foreign teachers

72
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:09,589
seems to be part of a broader rise in anti-foreign
sentiment.

73
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,120
And of course, the Communist Party

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,989
wants the education system to be ideologically
pure.

75
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,010
And a lot of those those misguided foreigners

76
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,430
are not particularly helpful when it comes
to pushing

77
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,870
“core socliast values.”

78
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,560
The problem, when it comes to education,

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,430
is Chinese intellectuals.

80
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,030
“Intellectuals expect more toward democracy

81
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,709
and the rule of law from globalization.

82
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,290
Some of them express unrealistic dissatisfaction

83
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,650
toward the country.”

84
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,510
Lousy intellectuals.

85
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,920
Complaining about the country just because

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
it doesn’t have democracy or the rule of
law,

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,530
or because the government kills its own citizens
for meditating.

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,349
Intellectuals make such unreasonable demands!

89
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,250
The Communist Party has always made schools

90
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,919
the front line in ideological indoctrination.

91
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,099
It comes in waves.

92
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:56,569
Chairman Mao hated intellectuals.

93
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,650
His Cultural Revolution forced students

94
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,809
to denounce their teachers for backwards thinking

95
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,269
and holding Western sympathies.

96
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,849
There was more freedom in the 80s.

97
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,090
But after the mass student protests in 1989

98
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,819
that ended with the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

99
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,869
the Communist Party realized that the people

100
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,760
had been allowed to think a little too freely.

101
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,459
So they launched another wave of patriotic
education.

102
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,300
And after current Chinese leader Xi Jinping
took power,

103
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,130
he stressed so-called “core socialist values”

104
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,810
and socialist education.

105
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,699
Xi gave a speech last year saying

106
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,289
“it’s imperative to uphold Marxism as
a guiding ideology

107
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,780
and stick to the path of socialist education

108
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,400
with Chinese characteristics.”

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,789
Obviously, it’s not imperative to uphold
the parts of Marxism

110
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:43,080
that say you shouldn’t allow giant corporations.

111
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,849
Or let rich elites play around with millions...

112
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,900
while the masses are dirt poor.

113
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,990
Or frankly, let any private individual own
the means of production.

114
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,990
Especially Jack Ma.

115
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,990
But, you know,

116
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,550
the people ought to uphold the *other* parts
of Marxism.

117
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,300
Like the “conquest of political power by
the working class.”

118
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,210
Uh, wait, don’t do that either.

119
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,300
Anyway, according to Reuters,

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,169
“Last September, China launched a wide-reaching
campaign

121
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,970
to remove foreign influences from education,

122
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,030
including efforts to ban foreign history courses,

123
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,180
outlaw self-taught material and revise textbooks

124
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,849
to focus on core Communist Party ideology.”

125
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,000
Which means less time for teaching useless
things like English,

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,830
and more time for Xi Jinping thought!

127
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,900
And state-run media have been a big part of

128
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,350
the demonization of foreign teachers.

129
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,500
The most tasteful being my favorite,

130
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,319
the Global Times.

131
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,460
Take for instance this lovely article,

132
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,270
Guests of China need to deserve what they
get,

133
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,120
with a close up of a black student for some
reason.

134
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
It complains “Foreigners in China have been
granted

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,430
‘super-national treatment’

136
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,550
and even extra-legal privileges.”

137
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,550
We’ll look at that special treatment

138
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,910
foreigners are getting in a moment.

139
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,030
And this article calls for “a crackdown
on ‘unqualified’

140
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,199
and ‘immoral’ foreign teachers in the
country.”

141
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,610
And this article uses a scandal involving
2 people

142
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,580
to drum up anti-foreign sentiment

143
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,139
against the other 400,000 foreign teachers.

144
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,819
It also criticizes parents who believe foreigners

145
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,690
can teach English better than Chinese teachers.

146
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,749
What a crazy thing for parents to believe!

147
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:18,439
Which is why this article says its a crime
for parents

148
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,699
to deprive their children of the right to
patriotic education.

149
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,479
All this means foreign teachers in China

150
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,759
are increasingly vulnerable and easily taken
advantage of.

151
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,750
So what happens to a bright eyed foreigner

152
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,189
who comes to China to teach English?

153
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,819
I asked fans of China Uncensored to send me
their stories.

154
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,439
I’ve altered their names to protect their
identities.

155
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,840
MP wrote to me that while in China,

156
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,409
“We must notify our bosses with where we
were going,

157
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,879
who we were going with,

158
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,490
for how long, and why.”

159
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,490
DB said,

160
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,580
“The bathrooms were never cleaned and really
disgusting

161
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,979
since the school did not have janitors.

162
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,070
I had to clean my own room after every class.

163
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,400
The students were great.”

164
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,689
SD said, “We were given rules to follow
on campus

165
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,150
and in the surrounding community.

166
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,240
I was also informed that we will be watched
closely at all times.”

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,150
That person also said they were punched by
a student,

168
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,370
who got off because the parents were wealthy.

169
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,389
Foreign textbooks with content counter to
the official Party line

170
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,750
were also seized... and burned.

171
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,520
Yeah, book burning is always a good sign of
progress.

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,419
TB told me, “The ‘Us vs. them’ mentality

173
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,639
was prevalent everywhere I went,

174
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,009
even in Shanghai.

175
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:35,069
The extra paperwork we have to do every year
for the visa,

176
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:36,770
the stares, the looks;

177
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,719
what’s the point of learning the culture
and language

178
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:41,379
if that is how we get treated?”

LDH said,

180
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,319
“I had local police come monthly to check
to see

181
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,150
if I still live at the same apartment.”

182
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,060
He also mentioned,

183
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,400
“not getting paid at all or them

184
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,710
finding every single excuse in the book

185
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,160
to deduct your salary that would make your
jaw drop”

186
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,780
ISB said, “Apart from teaching English,

187
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,040
we were told to teach PE,

188
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,099
clean the school,

189
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,090
serve food and wipe up butts.”

190
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,479
BQ said, “Workers here have no rights whatsoever.

191
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,960
Unpaid overtime is expected of everyone, including
me.

192
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
I’m paid for 20 hours of work per week,

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,539
but the school has tried to get me to work
40.”

194
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,370
KN said, “I was followed by two plain clothes
police

195
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,110
and basically assaulted at my front door.

196
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,999
They claimed we were harboring a fugitive.”

197
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,400
And here’s my personal favorite:

198
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,430
MW said, “Another thing was being ‘corrected’

199
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,360
by Chinese coworkers on English grammar.

200
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,959
Being told the origin of Christmas was an
orphan boy

201
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,579
wandering the woods in December

202
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:42,099
who then found shelter under a pine tree.

203
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,990
That the plural of peanut, (

204
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,949
peanuts) is pronounced ‘penis.’”

205
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,282
Which means those students are going to have

206
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:50,980
a really interesting time if they ever order
snacks

207
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,380
at a baseball game.

208
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,410
There were other stories viewers told me,
too.

209
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,410
Things like dealing with propaganda,

210
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,779
brainwashing, corruption, and even sexual
harassment.

211
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,120
Also finding out that they were hired illegally
by the school

212
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,660
and having the police take their passports
away.

213
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,040
But not all the stories were negative.

214
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,410
A lot of people had positive experiences,
too.

215
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,050
Many said despite all the craziness they had
to deal with,

216
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,389
they had an amazing time, met many great people—

217
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:19,620
students and adults,

218
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,280
and made friends for life.

219
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,410
Some people even met their spouses in China.

220
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,710
But in the current environment, is the risk
worth the reward?

221
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,850
Let me know what you think in the comments
below.

222
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,300
If you’re seriously thinking of teaching
English in China,

223
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,180
make sure you do your research first.

224
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,370
And if you’ve taught in China,

225
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,430
share your story below!

226
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,950
And before you go,

227
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,560
now is the time when I answer a question

228
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,350
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 cent
army—

229
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,650
fans who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon!

230
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,970
Shelley floryd asks,

231
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,800
“think there's a considerable threat

232
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,360
of the Chinese/American trade war

233
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,329
escalating into actual military warfare

234
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,149
(like how people feared the Russian/American
Cold War

235
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:00,149
would escalate to nuclear war)?”

236
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,480
A great question!

237
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,820
There certainly is cause for concern.

238
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,959
As I mentioned in a recent episode,

239
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,300
the gap in ability between the US

240
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,800
and the Chinese Communist Party’s military
is shrinking.

241
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,480
This recent report by the Council on Foreign
Relations

242
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,149
says China could soon rival the US in fields
like AI,

243
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,199
robotics, 5G, and possibly biotechnology.

244
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,160
So a war between the United States and China

245
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,510
could be very bad for both sides.

246
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,490
However, I don’t think it will come to that.

247
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,209
At least not because of the trade war.

248
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,720
China’s economy is suffering from it.

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,120
That’s an existential threat to the Chinese
regime.

250
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,230
The last thing the Communist Party can manage

251
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,980
is throwing itself into an actual armed conflict
with the US.

252
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,329
Even though the military tech might be improving,
remember,

253
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,649
China has not been in an armed conflict

254
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,760
since a brief war with Vietnam in the 70’s.

255
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,759
It has essentially no experienced leadership.

256
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,980
So even more so than in the Cold War,

257
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,660
I think the chance of a physical military
confrontation

258
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,260
with China is low.

259
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,080
Thanks for you question and your support.

260
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,130
And if you have a question for me

261
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,040
you want to hear answered on the show,

262
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,540
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

263
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,300
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

264
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,060
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

265
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,450
we would have to shut down the show

266
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,690
if it weren’t for your support.

267
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,519
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

268
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,080
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

269
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,800
See you next time.
