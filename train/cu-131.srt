1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:03,980
China is threatening to invade Taiwan

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,260
Will the US defend the only Chinese Democracy?

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,560
Or should Taiwan have Nuclear weapons?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,860
This is China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,200
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,020
The United States has promised to come to
Taiwan’s aid

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,160
if China ever invaded.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
In the 1950’s,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,760
the Chinese Communist Party put that to the
test,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,250
in the First and Second Taiwan Strait crises.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,530
But the United States does not have a formal

12
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,249
mutual defense treaty with Taiwan—

13
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:37,379
unlike with Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines.

14
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,940
Some people are worried that Taiwan

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,370
needs either greater US support,

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,749
or a little something more in their corner—

17
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:45,749
nuclear weapons.

18
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:49,629
I sat down with Ian Easton of the Project
2049 Research Institute

19
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,040
to find out more.

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,600
Ian, it's great to have you back on the show.

21
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,639
Chris, it is a great pleasure to be here.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,460
Thank you for having me back.

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
Absolutely.

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,900
So right now the president of the United States

25
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,190
is able to meet with the leader of North Korea,

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,860
but he can't meet with the president of Taiwan.

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,190
What does that say about the US-Taiwan policy?

28
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,700
I think it says that this policy is deeply
troubled.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,350
That in many ways it's hypocritical that we
treat a vibrant,

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,510
thriving democracy like a pariah state that
our diplomats

31
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:28,110
are not allowed to recognize the Taiwanese
flag

32
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,910
or call the Taiwanese government or people
by their proper names,

33
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,090
but we can recognize the flag of an enemy
like North Korea

34
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,910
or a strategic competitor like The People's
Republic of China.

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:46,190
And what makes this particularly absurd is
in this case

36
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,550
the US government policy is actually serving
to legitimize

37
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,220
a very very oppressive and troubling authoritarian
state

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,380
run by the Chinese Communist Party and the
PRC

39
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,440
and delegitimize a thriving pro-American democracy

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,780
and actually weakening Taiwan's national security
situation

41
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,190
and then by extension weakening our own national
security.

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,560
So I know the United States has mutual defense
treaties

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
with a couple of countries in Asia

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,860
like The Philippines and Japan.

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,830
I know the US has certain military obligations
to Taiwan,

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,530
but how close is that to the mutual defense
treaties

47
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,930
of these other countries?

48
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,330
Well there's a huge gap that's there.

49
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,420
And what is troubling about that is the fact
that

50
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,470
the Taiwan Strait flashpoint is actually

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,050
a far more dangerous and unstable flashpoint.

52
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,610
It's far more dangerous for long-term

53
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,140
US national security interests.

54
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,800
If you compare the defensive Taiwan, for example,

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,790
to the defensive South Korea

56
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,910
or the defensive Japan or The Philippines

57
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,460
or Australia or even Thailand or other treaty
allies in Asia,

58
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,430
it's clear that Taiwan is far more difficult
for us to defend.

59
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,150
It's a far tougher war plan for us.

60
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,110
And it's far more dangerous because it could
very quickly escalate,

61
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,320
and the Chinese have many,

62
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,530
many advantages that they would not have

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,160
in any other potential scenarios that we would
worry about.

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,470
And so by not having iron clad security guarantees,

65
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,470
and actually putting Taiwan inside of our
security umbrella

66
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,430
the way we do with other democracies in East
Asia

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,730
and some countries that are actually not even
democracies,

68
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,940
not allowing Taiwan also to have a nuclear
deterrent.

69
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,000
So for example, Israel is another small nation

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,400
that faces an existential threat from its
neighbors

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,850
in the way that Taiwan faces an existential
threat

72
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,420
from The People's Republic of China.

73
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,550
Israel, though, will never be taken over

74
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,340
not only because they have a great military

75
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,250
and they have very strong US support

76
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,170
but also because they have nuclear weapons,

77
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,190
and only a nation that has completely lost
its mind

78
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,550
and is suicidal is ever going to invade another
nation

79
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,330
that is armed with nuclear weapons.

80
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,950
And so what this in effect does is

81
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,070
it creates at the strategic level,

82
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,310
which is where all of the most important

83
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,790
historic decisions get made,

84
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,720
the decisions that either make or break world
order right?

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,770
That's becoming increasingly destabilized

86
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,470
because we have a thriving democracy of 23
million people

87
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,230
facing off against a deeply authoritarian
country

88
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,770
of 1.3 billion people.

89
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,750
That authoritarian nation has nuclear weapons.

90
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,830
They have a very impressive and growing military
force,

91
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,130
and they also have ambitions,

92
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,790
and they actually covet their neighbor's territory.

93
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,470
In this case, they want to annex Taiwan,

94
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,290
and you have Chairman Xi Jinping

95
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,169
going on TV just a couple months ago

96
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,260
making it crystal clear for

97
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,130
everybody in the Chinese Communist Party

98
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,699
who works for him and the armed wing of the
party,

99
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,000
the people's liberation army,

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,690
will also of course work for him.

101
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,070
Then his intentions are to retake Taiwan and
The United States

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,650
is not well-equipped to deal with this

103
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,460
because we don't have troops in Taiwan,

104
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,010
we don't provide Taiwan with iron clad security
commitments.

105
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,220
We have the Taiwan relations act which is
domestic law.

106
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,270
It was passed in 1979 and signed by President
Carter.

107
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,730
That is a very rough substitute for an alliance,

108
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,700
but there's a huge gap there.

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,440
And that gap is growing in time as Chinese
power grows.

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,010
And so what that does is it creates a destabilizing
situation,

111
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,090
and ultimately as we get into the 2020s,

112
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,550
what they could mean for us is that the probability

113
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,030
for a really horrific war is actually increasing
over time,

114
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,150
and I think that is something we should all
worry about.

115
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,790
Well as you say, China has nukes.

116
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,280
Taiwan has some F16s.

117
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,360
What possible deterrence can Taiwan have?

118
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Exactly.

119
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
And so right now their deterrence

120
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,419
is based on a loose idea that the United States

121
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,110
is going to come to the rescue.

122
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,092
And of course the US military ...

123
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:32,419
The Taiwan Relations Act says that the US
military

124
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,980
has to prepare for this contingency,

125
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,800
for defending Taiwan,

126
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
and that by law the US military,

127
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,950
and specifically the Indo-Pacific command
in Hawaii,

128
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,590
which controls all of our forces in the Pacific,

129
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,449
that they have to maintain the capacity to
respond

130
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,460
not only to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,

131
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,150
but also to Chinese intimidation or coercion
of Taiwan.

132
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,060
So these would be less-stressful scenarios

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,460
like blockades or air and missile operations,

134
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,500
things of that nature,

135
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,010
that we have to maintain the capacity to respond,

136
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,330
but it doesn't guarantee that we will respond.

137
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,670
So that's the difference between these

138
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,750
other mutual defense treaties we have.

139
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,750
Exactly.

140
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,600
And the other big difference is the other
defense treaties

141
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,020
are linked to our strategic nuclear forces
where this is not.

142
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,450
And for our other allies,

143
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,160
we actually have US troops stationed there
as a trip line.

144
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,250
So for example,

145
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,090
right now if you look at NATO and you look
at the Baltic states,

146
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,539
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia,

147
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,289
they're very vulnerable to a potential Russian
invasion.

148
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,160
And Putin has made clear that this is something
that

149
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,180
might happen to them if they're not careful.

150
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,930
But of course it's not gonna happen.

151
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,930
Because we have a thousand NATO troops deployed

152
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,370
to each of those three countries as a trip
line.

153
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,449
Now could those troops actually defeat an
invading army?

154
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,210
The answer of course is no.

155
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,360
Could the Berlin Brigade,

156
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,610
during the Cold War,

157
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,590
have actually defended Berlin from a Soviet
invasion?

158
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,210
Of course the answer is no,

159
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,169
but they serve as a deterrent because a potential
enemy

160
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,330
has to know that if they do invade,

161
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,690
they're going to end up killing American troops

162
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,140
that we have skin in the game.

163
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,159
And that means that we then become willing
to escalate

164
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,089
horizontally and potentially vertically

165
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:43,200
to a very dangerous level if the enemy attacks,

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,650
and because of that they don't.

167
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,710
And so we know from history of great power
competition

168
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,160
that this is a very healthy thing to do,

169
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,100
but we're not doing that with Taiwan,

170
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,970
and Taiwan because of its size

171
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,590
no matter how hard they train,

172
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,740
no matter how much military equipment and
training

173
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,990
they can get from The United States,

174
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,060
in my view it's not going to be sufficient
for them

175
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,670
to maintain a credible self defense force.

176
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,440
That there has to be something more.

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm not advocating for Taiwan to get nuclear
weapons.

178
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,060
I'm not necessarily advocating for The United
States

179
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,300
to rush to provide nuclear guarantees to Taiwan,

180
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,370
but I do think we need to think

181
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,800
much more carefully about deterrents,

182
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,010
and there may be conventional means of deterrents.

183
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,580
There may be economic or political or trade

184
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,820
or other measures that we could use,

185
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,740
but at the end of the day we have to come
up with

186
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,070
some substitute for nuclear weapons.

187
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,550
Otherwise, the Chinese can just escalate their
way

188
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,040
out of this problem

189
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,160
and end up taking over Taiwan,

190
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,690
which would really undermine our national
security interests.

191
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,920
So China says it wants a peaceful resolution
to the One China policy.

192
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,030
Is that the same as peace?

193
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,670
Well they absolutely do want a peaceful resolution.

194
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,010
The problem is they have a different definition
for peace.

195
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,240
Their definition for peace is they subvert
the enemy.

196
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,510
They undermine the enemy.

197
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,510
They intimidate the enemy.

198
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,870
They use psychological warfare and political
warfare,

199
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,350
legal warfare.

200
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,190
They get in the hearts and minds of the enemy,

201
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,220
and they get the enemy to surrender

202
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,050
without actually putting up a physical fight.

203
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,450
So they use a form of violence.

204
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,570
Now is it really peaceful?

205
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,570
No.

206
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,570
Because intimidation and coercion

207
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,130
is still a type of violence.

208
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,910
It's just a form of violence

209
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,519
that's much more mental and psychological

210
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,440
and much less kinetic,

211
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,680
much less physical.

212
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,550
And so that's what their ideal end-state is.

213
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,630
Is for the Taiwanese and the Americans

214
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,850
to surrender without actually fighting.

215
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,640
That's certainly what they're trying to do.

216
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,390
Thank you again for joining us.

217
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,740
This was absolutely terrifying as it is

218
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,970
every time I have you on.

219
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,220
Chris, it's a great pleasure.

220
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,810
I also feel your terror.

221
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,010
And I look forward to hopefully being able
to

222
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,940
continue the conversation in the future.

223
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Thanks again.

224
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Absolutely.

225
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
We could also just, you know,

226
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,519
get together and like huddle in a ball together.

227
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,860
That would make me feel a little uncomfortable,
to be honest.

228
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Okay.

229
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
I'd feel reassured myself.

230
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,019
But I will give you a hug after we turn the
cameras off.

231
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,019
Wonderful.

232
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,860
You know, four hugs a day is just the minimum.

233
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,360
Good policy.

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,340
Good policy.
