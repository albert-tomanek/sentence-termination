1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
It’s been a year of conflict.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,240
A new Cold War.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,760
And a virus that changed everything.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,920
Here are the ten biggest China stories of 2020.\h

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,640
Welcome back to China Uncensored, I’m\h
Chris Chappell. Be sure to hit the like\h\h

us with YouTube’s algorithm. And in 2020\h\h

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,760
we need all the help we can get.\h

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,560
Well, everyone. We’ve almost made it. We’re\h
so close. Just one more day of 2020 to go. And\h\h

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:45,280
you know what that means. One last chance\h
to win-slash-lose 2020 disaster bingo.\h

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,040
Come on, alien invasion. It’s not too late.\h

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,960
But while this year didn’t have a\h
bigfoot attack or a smallfoot attack,\h\h

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
there was a bigfoot amount of China news.\h
Look, it’s been a long year, I’m tired.\h

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,800
So let’s get right to the\h
biggest China stories of 2020.\h

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,920
Starting with number 10.\h
China punishes Australia.\h

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,560
This year, the Chinese Communist Party\h
put Australia on its naughty list.\h

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,440
Yes, they actually made a list. Of 14\h
reasons why they’re mad at Australia.\h

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,840
I assume number one was Vegemite.\h

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,480
And for getting on the naughty list, Australia\h
got lots of coal in their stocking. That is, 7 to\h\h

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,640
10 million tons of Australian coal that Chinese\h
authorities are not allowing into the country.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,360
And it’s not just coal. The Chinese Communist\h
Party is using trade to punish Australia.\h\h

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
It’s effectively banned\h
imports of Australian barley,\h\h

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,560
wine, beef, cotton, timber,\h
and even rock lobsters.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,440
But in a sense, they’re also punishing\h
themselves. Like by banning Australian\h\h

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,720
coal when China is suffering the worst power\h
blackouts in a decade because of a coal shortage.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,240
But that’s a small price to pay\h
to get Australia to surrender.\h\h

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,480
Because if Australia doesn’t\h
surrender, other countries\h\h

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,280
might get the idea that hey, we could stand\h
up to the Chinese Communist Party, too.

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
That would be awful. For the Communist Party.\h

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,840
And that brings us to number 9. The Chinese\h
Communist Party’s subversion gets exposed.\h

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,480
The Chinese Communist Party\h
loves to subvert other countries,\h\h

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,880
including Western democracies.\h
It’s been happening for decades.\h\h

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,400
But in 2020, it’s getting a lot harder\h
to pretend we’re not seeing the problem.

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,880
The Chinese Communist Party uses unrestricted\h
warfare to subvert every element of society,\h\h

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,000
from pop culture to business to politics.\h

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,720
And that’s clear when you see how Disney’s\h
Mulan filmed scenes in Xinjiang...\h

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,960
...known for its breathtaking desert landscapes\h
and awe-inspiring concentration camps.

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,200
Disney also thanked four\h
Chinese propaganda departments\h\h

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,680
and a public security bureau that’s responsible\h
for persecuting Uyghur Muslims in China.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,160
You can also see the Communist Party’s\h
unrestricted warfare in how TikTok,\h\h

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,120
a Chinese-owned company, sends\h
American user data to China.

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,040
Or when Zoom, a US company,\h
worked with the Chinese government\h\h

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
to surveil and censor video calls.

43
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,320
And when it comes to politics,\h
no politician is too small for\h\h

44
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,320
the Chinese Communist Party to subvert. As\h
you saw when alleged Chinese spy Fang Fang\h\h

45
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,280
targeted city councilmembers and mayors, including\h
Eric Swalwell, who’s now a US Congressman.

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,760
And family members of powerful politicians\h
are also a huge target. Like Hunter Biden’s\h\h

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,240
numerous business deals, including\h
with Chinese state-owned companies.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
Those business deals are now\h
being investigated by the FBI.

49
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,840
I’m sure everything is fine\h
and totally aboveboard.\h

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,920
Speaking of totally aboveboard\h
business dealings with China,\h\h

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,840
nobody does it better than Wall\h
Street. More on that after the break.

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,680
Welcome back. Top 10 China stories,\h
number 8: Wall Street Doubles Down

53
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,240
Back in January, the US and China\h
signed a phase 1 trade deal.\h

54
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,360
It was a deal that Wall Street\h
had urgently lobbied for.\h\h

55
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,720
But it’s not working out\h
as well as they had hoped.\h\h

56
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,800
And now as the US-China relationship continues\h
to get worse, you know what that means…

57
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,240
It’s a great time to invest in China!\h
At least according to US companies like\h\h

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan Chase.\h

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Sure, China is run by an authoritarian\h
regime that subverts American democracy\h\h

60
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,360
while persecuting its own people, but\h
have you seen their high-speed trains?

61
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,000
Now is especially a great time\h
to invest in China’s bond market.\h\h

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,760
You wouldn’t want to miss out!\h

63
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,920
After all, if we stopped giving\h
the Chinese Communist Party money,\h\h

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
how would they fund all of their\h
unrestricted warfare against us?\h

65
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,520
And if there’s one country that’s all too\h
familiar with the Party’s unrestricted warfare,\h\h

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,840
it’s Taiwan. Which brings us to\h
number 7: China Threatens Taiwan.\h

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,640
Back in January, we traveled to Taiwan\h
to cover their presidential election.

68
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,040
The Chinese Communist Party ran a\h
massive disinformation campaign.

69
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,520
But despite that, President Tsai Ing-wen of the\h
Democratic Progressive Party won another term.\h

70
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Tsai and her party stood\h
firm on Taiwan’s sovereignty,\h\h

71
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,840
and stood up to the Chinese Communist Party.

72
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,560
And in response, the Communist Party has been\h
escalating its military threats to Taiwan.\h

73
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,320
The PLA has launched a form of gray zone warfare.\h
It stops short of an actual shooting war, but\h\h

74
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,080
“the aim is to subdue the foe through exhaustion.”

75
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,640
Exhaustion seems to be the theme of 2020.\h

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Since mid-September, Chinese warplanes have flown\h
more than 100 missions around Taiwan’s airspace.

77
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,640
The PLA can’t launch a full-scale\h
invasion of Taiwan yet,\h\h

78
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,760
but they’re still basically attacking Taiwan’s\h
military—by forcing them to respond each time.

79
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,480
The good news is that Taiwan is\h
getting more international support.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,440
The US is selling billions of\h
dollars of weapons to Taiwan.\h\h

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,400
And the Trump administration sent Health\h
and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\h\h

82
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,840
to Taiwan. He’s the highest-ranking US\h
official to go to Taiwan in decades.

83
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,480
It was great for diplomacy,\h\h

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:16,240
but bad for him. Because he’ll never be\h
as popular in the US as he was in Taiwan.

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,280
And now, number 6: Massive floods

86
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,280
Over the summer, China experienced\h
months of record-breaking flooding.

87
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
The flooding led to a lot of\h
concern about the Three Gorges Dam,\h\h

88
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
especially since the dam had to\h
release floodwaters several times.\h

89
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,360
But don’t worry, Chinese authorities say\h
the Three Gorges Dam is deformed but safe!

90
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,840
I feel much better now.\h

91
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
The flooding could lead to more\h
long-term problems as well,\h\h

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
like rising food prices and\h
a possible food shortage.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,840
But don’t worry, the Chinese Communist Party\h
knows how to deal with any internal unrest.

94
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,600
Which brings us to number 5: The\h
Party is still persecuting people.

95
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Yes, in 2020, the Chinese Communist\h
Party is still persecuting the Uyghurs.

96
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,840
And the Falun Gong.

97
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,520
And the Tibetans.

98
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
And the Mongolians.

99
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
And the Christians.

100
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,440
And the Jews.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
And the human rights lawyers.

102
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,840
And the...ok, let’s just go with everyone.\h
They’re still persecuting pretty much everyone.\h

103
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,200
Speaking of Communist Party persecution,\h
Hong Kong. More on that after a short break.

104
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,480
Welcome back to the top 10 China stories of 2020.\h

105
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,760
Now, number 4: Hong Kong becomes China.

106
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,960
After a year of ongoing\h
protests against the CCP...

107
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,440
...on June 30th the Chinese regime imposed\h
a national security law on Hong Kong.\h

108
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,640
It has basically turned Hong\h
Kong into mainland China.

109
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,440
Permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong\h
Kong can now be imprisoned for up to life\h\h

110
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,120
for crimes of secession, subversion,\h
terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.\h

111
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,800
To enforce the measures a new\h
security agency has been set up,\h\h

112
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,080
which isn’t under the jurisdiction of the local\h
government. It will be the first official presence\h\h

113
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,920
of mainland security and intelligence agents in\h
Hong Kong, whose powers will go beyond local laws.

114
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
It also allows for serious and complex\h
cases to go to mainland courts.

115
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
So it’s everything that Hong Kongers\h
were afraid was going to happen,\h\h

116
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,160
and worse. And the Chinese Communist Party\h
wasted no time using the national security law,\h\h

117
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,360
along with other laws, to crack down on dissent.\h

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
From raiding newspapers.

119
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,440
To jailing activists.

120
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,960
To postponing elections.

121
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,080
To forcing out opposition lawmakers.

122
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
It’s just all bad.\h

123
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,000
And the exodus has also begun,\h
with prominent activists and\h\h

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
ordinary Hong Kongers leaving the city.

125
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,360
One group of activists who\h
tried to escape in a speedboat\h\h

126
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,520
were imprisoned in mainland China,\h
where they’re being put on trial.\h

127
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,480
But Hong Kong activists say that although\h
things are grim, they aren’t giving up.

128
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:24,240
Speaking of not giving up, number\h
3: the India-China border conflict.

129
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,320
Starting back in May, there\h
was a series of skirmishes\h\h

130
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,840
along the disputed border between India and China.

131
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,000
In some cases involving\h
fistfights and stone throwing.

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,720
In the most violent clash, 20 Indian soldiers,\h
and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers, died.\h

133
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,960
India accused Chinese soldiers of\h
using nail-studded rods in that fight.\h

134
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,360
The border clashes were the result of\h
China’s strategy of salami-slicing,\h\h

135
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,360
that is, trying to take over pieces of\h
territory, one thin slice at a time.\h

136
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,720
“China has chipped away at territory along the\h
disputed frontier—seizing about 23 square miles.”

137
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,080
Salami slicing worked for\h
China in the South China Sea.\h\h

138
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,320
But it’s not working out as\h
well on the Indian border.\h

139
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,400
In one of the latest clashes, Indian soldiers\h
recaptured land that the PLA had taken.\h

140
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,440
And the border fights have also led\h
India to stand up to China in other ways.\h\h

141
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,640
Like by banning dozens of Chinese\h
apps, including TikTok and WeChat.

142
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Plus India has become one of the\h
driving forces behind the Quad.\h\h

143
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,720
That’s the group set up to counter China. It\h
includes India, Japan, Australia, and the US.\h

144
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:52,080
And that brings us to, number 2: The US\h
calls out the Chinese Communist Party

145
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,600
Earlier this year, a lot of US media\h
were panicking over the “new Cold War.”\h

146
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,720
What most of them didn’t point out is that\h
the new Cold War actually started in Beijing.

147
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,680
It’s the result of decades of the Communist\h
Party’s unrestricted warfare against the US.\h\h

148
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
And now the US government\h
is doing something about it.

149
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,640
Back in May, the Trump administration released\h\h

150
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,920
a strategic approach to the\h
People’s Republic of China.\h

151
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
In it, they clearly spell out\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s\h\h

152
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
ideological struggle against the United States.\h\h

153
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,640
They also lay out how the Party’s actions\h
threaten America’s economy, security, and values.

154
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,640
And they say the US government\h
is taking a new approach.

155
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
“When quiet diplomacy proves futile,\h
the United States will increase public\h\h

156
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,000
pressure on the PRC government and take\h
action to protect United States interests\h\h

157
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
by leveraging proportional costs when necessary.”

158
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,320
And the Trump administration\h
has followed through. Bigly.

159
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,840
Administration officials started directly\h
calling out the Chinese Communist Party.\h

160
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,200
“We must start by changing how our\h
people and our partners perceive\h\h

161
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
the Chinese Communist Party.\h
We have to tell the truth.\h\h

162
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,840
We can’t treat this incarnation of China\h
as a normal country, just like any other.”

163
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,520
The State Department started sanctioning\h
Chinese officials for human rights abuses.

164
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,200
The Commerce Department\h
blacklisted Chinese companies.

165
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
The Trump administration closed\h
the Chinese Consulate in Houston,\h\h

166
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
because they said it was a center for spying.

167
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,040
The FBI started arresting\h
alleged Chinese agents in the US.

168
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,000
And proving that China remains one of the few\h
bipartisan issues in the US government, Congress\h\h

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,840
passed several China-related bills, including\h
the Hong Kong Autonomy Act and the Uyghur Human\h\h

170
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,400
Rights Policy Act. The Trump administration\h
then used them to sanction Chinese officials.

171
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
Ah, teamwork.\h

172
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,600
There’s a lot more that the US\h
government has done this year\h\h

173
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
to call out the Chinese Communist Party.\h
Too much for me to mention it all here.\h

174
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:16,320
So let’s move on to the number one China story\h
of 2020. Right after this final commercial break.

175
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,880
Welcome back.

176
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:27,200
It’s time for the number 1 China story of 2020.\h
Because nothing says 2020 like the CCP Virus.

177
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,760
Back in January of 2020, we ran our\h
first episode about the coronavirus.\h\h

178
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,040
It was so long ago, we hadn’t even\h
started calling it the CCP virus yet.

179
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
A new virus is spreading in China.

180
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,280
Are Chinese authorities covering it up?

181
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,120
And do you need to be worried?

182
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,760
Turns out the answer was yes, yes, and yes.\h

183
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,240
What a different year this might have\h
been if the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

184
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,200
hadn’t responded to the coronavirus\h
with a massive initial cover up.\h

185
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,280
Or if the World Health Organization had\h
stood up to China and gotten the data faster.

186
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,080
I guess we’ll have to wait for the alternate\h
reality sci-fi movie that depicts 2020 as a year\h\h

187
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,560
when we could do amazing things like\h
eat at restaurants and hug people.

188
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,720
But the Chinese Communist Party’s initial\h
harsh lockdown had a huge effect on how\h\h

189
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
the rest of the world’s governments\h
treated the coronavirus as well.\h

190
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:35,680
Would so many other countries have locked down\h
so severely if China hadn’t done it first?\h

191
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:43,920
Even the WHO now says lockdowns should not be\h
the primary way to deal with the CCP virus.

192
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,160
The story of the CCP virus is\h
basically the story of the CCP.\h

193
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,600
How the CCP hid the truth, and\h
punished those who revealed it.

194
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,920
How the CCP tried to influence other countries\h
with mask diplomacy. Which then backfired.

195
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,240
And most of all, how the\h
CCP controls the narrative.\h\h

196
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Even now, the Chinese Communist Party is still\h
trying to blame the virus on another country.

197
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,400
Like the US.\h

198
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Or India.

199
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,320
Or Italy.\h

200
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,240
The latest propaganda campaign is about blaming\h
the coronavirus transmission on frozen foods.\h

201
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,160
Which Chinese state-run media is currently\h
trying to tie to the initial outbreak in Wuhan.\h

202
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,920
It wasn’t a lab leak! It\h
was the frozen pizza rolls!

203
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,600
Mystery solved.

204
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,480
And with many countries now going\h
into another round of lockdowns,\h\h

205
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,280
and as a possibly more contagious\h
version of the CCP Virus spreads,\h\h

206
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,840
this is one story that is going\h
to carry over well into 2021.

207
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,120
So those were the top 10\h
China news stories of 2020.\h

208
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,360
China had a huge effect on the world this\h
year. What will next year bring? Hopefully more\h\h

209
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,960
countries standing up to the Chinese Communist\h
Party. Or, there’s always 2021 Disaster Bingo.\h

210
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,160
And now, the final question of the year—from a\h
fan who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.\h\h

211
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,200
If you join the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army on\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon, you’ll have a\h\h

212
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,440
chance to ask me questions on the show, too. Check\h
out patreon.com/chinauncensored to learn more.

213
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,320
Steve Gonzalez asks:\h

214
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
“Hi Chris, have you considered doing an\h
episode on China's relationship with Mexico?\h\h

215
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,400
My understanding is China provides\h
the chemicals for cartels in Mexico.”

216
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,560
Great question, Steve. Two years ago I did an\h\h

217
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,320
America Uncovered episode about\h
China’s Drug War Against the US.

218
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,000
I talk a little bit about how China supplies\h
Mexican cartels with ingredients to make meth, and\h\h

219
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
has been a source of some of\h
Mexico’s illegal firearms as well.\h\h

220
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
But I haven’t looked into Mexico’s\h
wider relationship with China.\h\h

221
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,840
That could be a pretty interesting\h
episode. Thanks for the suggestion, Steve.

222
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,880
And thank you for watching this episode\h
of China Uncensored. Remember to like,\h\h
