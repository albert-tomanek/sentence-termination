1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,300
China and North Korea may no longer be BFFs,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,940
but Kim Jong-Un has a new best friend, so
there.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,620
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,180
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,430
For decades, North Korea and China were besties.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,920
Together like peas and carrots.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,380
Like rice and gochujang.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,939
But recently, China has been spending

10
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:27,650
a bit too much time with the US,

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,070
and they keep talking about North Korea

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,520
behind its back,

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,300
about how it’s been getting all nuclear lately.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,660
And now China’s telling North Korea

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,800
that maybe they can't even be friends anymore.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,700
Poor Kim Jong-Un must be so sad!

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,399
But fortunately, he might have made a new
friend.

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,079
A big, strong, manly friend.

19
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,309
No, not me!

20
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,309
Vladamir Putin!

21
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:50,829
They have so much in common!

22
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:51,829
Think about it.

23
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,610
Putin’s an outdoorsman...

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,489
...a friend to the animals...

25
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,090
...and beloved by children.

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,559
That’s a perfect match for Kim!

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,340
He’s an outdoorsman...

28
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,820
...friend to the animals...-ish

29
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,700
...and the children, they...

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,930
Hey, how come they’re not smiling?

31
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,110
Maybe because they were told they're

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,860
all going to summer re-education camp.

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,860
Don't worry kids,

34
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,090
it'll be great.

35
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,020
Talent shows!

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,430
Archery!

37
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,120
Making arts and crafts for export

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,170
in exchange for food!

39
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,170
And don't forget

40
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,820
that classic summer re-education camp tradition,

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,820
staying up after curfew

42
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,800
to try to sneak across the river into China.

43
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,330
Makes me miss my summer camp days.

44
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,330
But anyway, back to Russia.

45
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,530
As ties between China and North Korea deteriorate,

46
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,380
Russia has been stepping in to fill the void.

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,320
And it’s not so unusual.

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,890
After the Second World War, Russia—

49
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,680
well, the Soviet Union—

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,930
was North Korea’s sugar daddy.

51
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,930
With its support,

52
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,040
North Korea became strong,

53
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,300
with an economy that was even stronger

54
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,440
than US-backed South Korea.

55
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,180
But that relationship fell apart

56
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,000
after the Soviet Union had a big breakdown

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,810
in the early ’90s.

58
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,250
And without Soviet subsidies,

59
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,900
the North Korean economy collapsed,

60
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,580
and they kind of stopped being able to feed
everyone.

61
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,140
That’s when China came in

62
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,920
and their relationship became close.

63
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,480
Like, really close.

64
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,810
But now that China’s new leader

65
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,660
is making new friends,

66
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,550
Russia’s back for the friendship rebound.

67
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,840
Actually, Russia's been trying for a few years
now.

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,630
In 2014, Russia forgave North Korea

69
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,860
about $10 billion dollars of debt.

70
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,740
Proving that authoritarian regimes can be
more forgiving

71
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,050
than your average student loan provider.

72
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,750
I probably should have gotten Russia

73
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,400
to finance my Master's degree.

74
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Moving on,

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,440
then Russia and North Korea declared 2015
to be

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,740
the “Year of Friendship.”

77
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,130
And in 2017,

78
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,840
for the third year in a row,

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,120
Russia beat out China as North Korea’s bestie.

80
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,030
When Kim sent out New Years greeting cards,

81
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,460
“At the top of the list was Russia,

82
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,140
followed by China.”

83
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,140
“Dear Putin, Happy New Year.

84
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,970
I like your horse.

85
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,040
Love, Kim.”

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,520
Of course it’s not just a show of friendship.

87
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,250
Russia is again providing real economic benefits

88
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,120
that help prop up the North Korean regime

89
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,020
in the face of declining support from China.

90
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,150
According to the US political intelligence
firm, Stratfor,

91
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,670
“When China recently threatened

92
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,790
to cut off fuel exports to North Korea

93
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,920
if it conducted its sixth nuclear weapons
test,

94
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Russia hinted it could replace

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,690
at least some of that supply.”

96
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,730
And according to Reuters,

97
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,390
“Russia has already taken over

98
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,780
the supply of jet fuel to North Korea

99
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,520
after China halted exports two years ago.”

100
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,800
Now state-run North Korean airline Air Koryo

101
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,410
will have fuel again.

102
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,410
New tagline:

103
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,040
We’re not the worst airline anymore!

104
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,890
And the Kremlin isn't just helping North Korea

105
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,190
with air travel.

106
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,190
Later this month,

107
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,740
a new ferry service between these two cities

108
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,200
is scheduled to launch,

109
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,690
carrying potentially 200 passengers

110
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,090
and 1000 tons of cargo

111
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,470
six times a month.

112
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,480
Now you might be wondering,

113
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,990
what kind of passengers go between

114
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,810
North Korea and Russia?

115
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,070
Well, slaves might be a more accurate term.

116
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,890
There’s an estimated 30,000 North Korean

117
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,200
“workers” in Russia,

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,810
and almost all of their earnings

119
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,209
go to the North Korean regime.

120
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,530
It’s one of the few sources of income

121
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,030
for North Korea.

122
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,630
That, and selling drugs out of its embassies,

123
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,660
which is a real thing.

124
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,400
So why is Russia moving closer to North Korea?

125
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,230
What can there possibly be in it for them?

126
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,820
Well, Russia wants to take over China’s
role,

127
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,570
holding North Korea’s leash.

128
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,730
For over a decade,

129
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,710
China presented itself as the only country

130
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,170
that had any possible sway over North Korea.

131
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,070
If the global community had any illusions

132
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,850
about forcing a change there,

133
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,270
they’d have to go through China.

134
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,290
That gave the Chinese regime

135
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,810
a lot of international leverage.

136
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,340
Russia would love to be able to expand its
influence

137
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,240
in the Asia-Pacific region.

138
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,169
And if by getting close to North Korea,

139
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:58,280
Russia could do that,

140
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,130
well, wouldn’t that just be grand?

141
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,130
There’s one hitch.

142
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,330
It didn’t work for China—

143
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,350
because ultimately,

144
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,520
North Korea did whatever it wanted.

145
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Russia may also find that

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,490
despite all its good will,

147
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,530
North Korea will continue to do what it wants.

148
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,850
Ouch.

149
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,860
And what does China think about all this?

150
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,450
Well, you know how it is sometimes

151
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,449
in international relations.

152
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,300
You're best friends with a neighboring country,

153
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,570
mostly because the two of you grew up together,

154
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,250
fought wars together,

155
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,301
but now that your best friend

156
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,669
is getting totally obsessed

157
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,430
with launching nuclear weapons,

158
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,760
you're not sure you have

159
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,160
all that much in common anymore.

160
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,730
You're making new friends,

161
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,070
and there's only so much room for crazy in
your life.

162
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,330
But now Russia is moving in

163
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,350
and trying to be even better friends

164
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,169
than you were with North Korea.

165
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,320
And that hurts a little.

166
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,610
Not that you and Russia were super close.

167
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,720
But you always stood together

168
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,460
against the United States,

169
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,200
like on the UN Security Council.

170
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,070
And now everything is getting complicated.

171
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,320
And North Korea...

172
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,040
well, you're never going to be that close
again.

173
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,230
But maybe there's still a way

174
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,680
to save some part of the friendship.

175
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,570
At least for international leverage purposes.

176
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,310
So you know what -

177
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,160
next time you have a party,

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Russia and North Korea are invited.

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
So what do you think of Russia

180
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,540
trying to replace China as North Korea’s
BFF?

181
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,229
Leave your comments below.

182
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,430
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

183
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,990
Once again I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

184
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,220
See you next time.
