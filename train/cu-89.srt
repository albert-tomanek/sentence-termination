00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,520
In this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,110
behind the scenes of Looper.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,840
Hi, I'm Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,380
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,280
Now you've probably heard of this movie

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,500
that came out last weekend: Looper.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,860
But here's something from behind the scenes that

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,120
you might not have heard.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,420
And it has to do with China

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,750
Don't worry, no spoilers.

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,710
First of all let me tell you a bit about China's
movie industry.

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,240
It's crazy.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,800
They have all these bizarre rules like

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,109
you can't make a movie or TV show that has
time travel.

15
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,620
There goes my dream of "Bill and Ted 3: Adventures in China"!

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,390
But they also make it incredibly difficult
for foreign films.

17
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,790
Only 34 are allowed a year inside China.

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,680
So how does a foreign film about time travel

19
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,969
end up not only getting into China,

20
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,309
but making more money on its opening weekend
there than the US?

21
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,440
Easy!

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,660
Just get co-produced by a Chinese company,

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,720
like Beijing-based DMG Entertainment.

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,000
You see, originally director Ryan Johnson

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,149
wanted the dystopian sci-fi tale to be held
in Paris

26
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,239
until he found out that China would give him
a lot more money

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,360
if he set it in Shanghai.

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,390
And so naturally,

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,450
according to the dialogue in the final version
of the film,

30
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,640
China is the place to be in the year 2074.

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,170
Which is funny because I thought China was

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,340
so polluted that the rivers are turning red.

33
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,159
But, hey, it's the future.

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,459
So, anyways, you wanna know how the movie ends?

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,430
Bruce Willis is his own father!
