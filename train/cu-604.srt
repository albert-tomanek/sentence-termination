00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,110
if you're invited to participate in a Chinese
marathon...

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,820
RUN!!!

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,679
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,750
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,620
As the Financial Times put it,

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,240
“Running is the new religion of the Chinese
middle class.”

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,160
I guess because the old religion was wiped
out by the Red Guards.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,859
And as anyone who’s a runner knows,

10
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,430
this religion requires blood sacrifice!

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,570
Aches and pains, swelling and inflammation,

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,450
cuts and bruises from having to dodge chainsaw
wielding motorcyclists...

13
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,690
But seriously, running can be dangerous.

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,559
Especially in China.

15
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,859
“More and more events are unfolding from
the Guangdong Marathon Fiasco.

16
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,059
There were close to 20,000 participants,

17
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:54,959
including 12,208 incidents of injury and sickness.”

18
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:55,989
Now don’t worry,

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,389
it’s not that over half the participants
were injured.

20
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:02,299
Some people just had multiple injuries.

21
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,199
The Guangdong Marathon Fiasco, as it’s being
called,

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,420
was, well, kind of a fiasco.

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,869
And if you think that's a crazy amount of
injuries and illness, get this.

24
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,770
Some of the incidents were completely preventable—were it not

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,880
for this.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,229
Orchard Fruity Soap.

27
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:22,649
Now with extra moisturizer.

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,960
Those are the kind of things that probably
should have been written in Chinese,

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
so that when they were handed out to people
who just finished running a marathon,

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,359
they wouldn’t mistake them for energy bars

31
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,079
which they did.

32
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,869
Clearly, there were some major organizational
fails at this particular marathon.

33
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,890
Like, not having wide enough roads for the
20,000 participants

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,869
Or a serious lack of trash cans.

35
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,890
Just look all those banana peels!

36
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,039
No wonder so many people got injured!

37
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,210
But as state-run China daily puts it,

38
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,789
“Running is in, and the latest fashion is
sweeping China.”

39
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,409
And who do we have to thank?

40
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,539
Why the Communist Party, of course!

41
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:06,630
Now the Chinese have always been a health-conscious
people.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,009
In parks throughout China you’ll see people
doing all kinds of exercise

43
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,319
Taichi, Qigong, Square Dancing.

44
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,500
Oh man, you do not want to get on the bad
side of China’s Square Dancing Grannies.

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,040
But running is a relatively new thing.

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
And not just among billionaire social media
moguls.

47
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,340
As the economy has developed,

48
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,349
China’s growing middle class is dealing
with a growing middle class problem. Namely…

49
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,790
office butt.

50
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,760
So running is the new thing.

51
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,730
There are even themed running groups.

52
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,030
Like the Beijing-based Mama Running, for new
mothers.

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,920
It has nearly more than 800 members.

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,510
People also use running as a way to celebrate
important occasions.

55
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,299
Like Mao’s 122 birthday

56
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,810
People got sick from the smog.

57
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,099
There’s even a “Half Naked Marathon”.

58
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,620
And the "Beijing Undie Run".

59
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,739
Which does not look healthy.

60
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,180
Anyway, according to the Chinese Athletics
Association,

61
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,560
there were 134 marathons held in 2015,

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,909
more than double the previous year.

63
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,439
And if Party Mouthpiece Xinhua News is right,

64
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,290
which it ALWAYS IS,

65
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,830
this year will see more than 200 marathons
in China.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
Marathons have become so popular that in many
big cities,

67
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,470
runners have to win lotteries to enter.

68
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,340
All this running has Western sportswear companies
running for the Chinese market.

69
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,610
In 2014, Adidas made more than 270 million
dollars in China,

70
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,750
and has sponsored the Beijing marathon and
Shanghai Half Marathon.

71
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,329
Adidas is so successful,

72
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:40,829
they’ve inspired not just one,

73
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,280
but at least two knockoffs!

74
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,989
And of course,

75
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,879
it’s a great market for fruity soap.

76
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,969
So what do you think about the Guangdong marathon
fiasco?

77
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,269
And what’s your best, or worst marathon
experience.

78
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,799
My answer to both is North Korea’s Pyongyang
Marathon.
