1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,819
China’s military is being shaken up!

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,760
And Xi helped!

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,460
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,310
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,310
Chinese leader,

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,279
Head of the Chinese Communist Party,

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,550
Chair of the Central Military Commission,

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,009
and Commander in Xi-ief of the People’s
Liberation Army,

10
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,910
Xi Jinping, is a military mastermind.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,239
He’s bringing change to the military.

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,130
With groundbreaking ideas.

13
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,550
He’s decided that he wants the military
to be

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,480
“combat ready.”

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,680
Imagine!

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,700
A military ready to fight.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,489
Certainly a break from tradition.

18
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,079
According to state-run China Daily,

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,609
in a meeting with commanding officers this
week,

20
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,570
Xi said he wants the army to focus on

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,559
“building ‘new-type’ fighting capabilities.”

22
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,219
I know “new type”

23
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,280
is kind of an odd way to put it,

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,370
but remember,

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,230
Xi Jinping is in his 60s.

26
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,100
Imagine him like your grandpa

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,750
talking about all this “newfangled technology”

28
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,479
you young people have.

29
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,830
I bet Xi calls Twitter "Bird Talk."

30
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,750
And he probably calls Facebook

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,710
"that stalker thing started by the guy

32
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,659
who awkwardly tried to get me to name

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,210
his unborn child."

34
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,380
Look, it sounds much better in Chinese.

35
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,670
Anyway, what Xi Jinping is really talking
about

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,710
is the military’s electronic,

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,820
information and space operations.

38
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,350
Militarizing space.

39
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,630
What could go wrong?

40
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,869
But the main purpose of his meeting

41
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,520
with PLA commanders this week

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,299
was this:

43
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,909
reshuffling the military into

44
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,829
“a new, condensed structure

45
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,790
of 84 military units”

46
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,790
The military,

47
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,880
as you may imagine,

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,810
is kind of a big deal.

49
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,840
An even bigger deal

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
is who controls it.

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,409
And Xi Jinping has been wrestling former Chinese
leader

52
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:56,700
Jiang Zemin for it.

53
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,899
Xi has purged several top generals

54
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:00,390
loyal to Jiang.

55
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,100
And even granted himself

56
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,409
the new title of commander in chief,

57
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,759
something that, yes,

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,700
the Chinese military did not have before.

59
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,800
He also is streamlining the military,

60
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,379
laying off 300,000 soldiers

61
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,709
in favor of cutting-edge technology.

62
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,209
Those high tech weapons will be a bit more
loyal.

63
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,320
And maybe, even love him.

64
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,790
This is just the latest restructuring,

65
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,660
and there’s more to come.

66
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
China Daily points out that

67
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,350
“The previous four top PLA departments－

68
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,940
staff, politics, logistics and armaments－

69
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,209
were dismantled.”

70
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,860
This shake up will help Xi break

71
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,470
Jiang Zemin’s grip on the military.

72
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,340
But it might also net him a few more

73
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,970
enemies in the armed forces.

74
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,970
Not to worry.

75
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,190
Xi’s got that covered.

76
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,610
Because the restructuring

77
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,780
also means promotions!

78
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,909
“All 84 of the new units’ commanders

79
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,780
have or soon will be promoted

80
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,060
to a rank of either major general in the Ground
Force,

81
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,620
Air Force and Rocket Force,

82
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,569
or rear admiral in the Navy.”

83
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,959
You get a promotion!

84
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,050
You get a promotion!

85
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,409
Everybody gets a promotion!

86
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,640
But one thing the restructuring didn't change
-

87
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,400
everybody still has to remain loyal

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,690
to the Chinese Communist Party.

89
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,819
And according to this totally unexpected

90
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,190
article from Xinhua,

91
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,400
"Chinese military servicemen have unanimously
voiced

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,150
strong support for President Xi Jinping's
instruction"

93
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,170
and pledged to "build an indestructible army"

94
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,860
In fact, the PLA Army said they would

95
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,790
"uphold the leadership of the CPC Central
Committee

96
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,510
with Xi as the core."

97
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,030
The PLA Navy said they would

98
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,930
"build a powerful force to protect

99
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,129
China's maritime rights."

100
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:49,100
The PLA Air Force said they would

101
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,079
"strive to become a force of integrated air
and space capacities

102
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,629
competent for both offensive and defensive
missions."

103
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:57,629


104
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,720
And the PLA Rocket Force said they would

105
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,519
"denounce the evils of truth and love,

106
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,209
and extend our reach to the stars above!"

107
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,450
What's that Shelley?

108
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,450
Oh.

109
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,450
Sorry.

110
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,870
That was PLA Team Rocket.

111
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,209
My mistake.

112
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,659
The Rocket Force said they would

113
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,330
"eradicate the influence" of those

114
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,460
corrupt guys from Jiang's faction

115
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,310
and "concentrate on building an invincible
army."

116
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,970
And finally, the PLA Strategic Support Force

117
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,090
said they would "make major innovation breakthroughs

118
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,100
and cultivate a high-end talent pool."

119
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,650
Well, I guess we all know which is the lamest
force

120
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,240
in the PLA.

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,140
Come on, Strategic Support Force.

122
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,240
Other PLA forces are pledging to be invincible.

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,910
Step it up.

124
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,200
Anyway, judging from these heartfelt,

125
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,310
unforced statements,

126
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,210
I think Xi may just have himself

127
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,720
a much more loyal military now.

128
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,940
Just in time for heightened regional tensions!

129
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,220
I'm sure that "super-mighty preemptive strike"

130
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,640
sounds much better in Korean.

131
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
So what do you think of

132
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,010
Xi’s promotional military tactics?

133
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,760
Leave your comments below.

134
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,730
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

135
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,710
I hope you’re also checking us out on

136
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,490
Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV.

137
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,630
Yes, China Uncensored is now on

138
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,380
all those platforms.

139
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,620
Well, except for Apple TV in Hong Kong and
Taiwan.

140
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,980
Apple seems to be so afraid of offending

141
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,130
the Chinese regime,

142
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,520
they removed the China Uncensored app there.

143
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,150
If you think that sucks,

144
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,650
please sign our petition.

146
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,340
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

147
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,480
see you next time.
