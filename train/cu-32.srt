00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,650
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,340
Donald Trump and the One China Policy…

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,740
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:14,440
Did you hear what President Trump did?

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,920
Uhhh, okay let me narrow that down a bit.

7
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,160
Did you hear what President Trump did specifically

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,070
with regards to China’s One China Policy?

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,550
He called the entire policy into question!

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,280
Oh no no.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,960
Sorry.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,599
That was from two months ago.

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,410
I meant to talk about the latest development.

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,079
He agreed to uphold the One China Policy!

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,890
How dare he do the same thing every US president
has done

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,160
since the 1970s!

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,239
So what does that mean?

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,280
Well according to the “analysts”

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,489
in this The New York Times article,

20
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,700
this proves that Trump is a weak leader.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,120
Look, I know how it goes.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,359
You're supposed to write an article

23
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,350
about what "experts" think about Trump's decision.

24
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,500
You're in Beijing, on deadline,

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,879
and no one's answering your calls,

26
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,750
so you end up with an article with eight paragraphs
of quotes

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,570
from two Chinese professors who are more than willing

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,480
to talk about how the US is weak.

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,980
Unfortunately,

30
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,840
that plays right into the Communist Party's
hands.

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,350
You see,

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,100
according to this Pentagon study on “China:
Three Warfares,”

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,990
the Party specifically uses “Media Warfare,”

34
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,920
to shape international public opinion on China

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,840
and "Psychological Warfare" to “foment anti-leadership
sentiments.”

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,140
But that's a whole ’nother episode.

37
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,860
Anyway, what actually happened

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,660
with Trump and the One China Policy?

39
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,220
First, a brief recap of the One China Policy.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,320
Basically,

41
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,300
after the Communist Party seized control of
China

42
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,590
in 1949,

43
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,290
the previous Chinese government fled to Taiwan—

44
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,759
a government in exile.

45
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,579
Both sides claimed they were the true captain.

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,780
I'm your captain, Spock - can't you tell?!

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,660
Shoot!

48
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Shoot!

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,760
And by captain,

50
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,220
I mean the legitimate government of China.

51
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,460
But rather than shooting,

52
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,680
the two Chinas came to a collective agreement

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,760
called the One China policy.

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
“Yeah, there’s only one China,

55
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,950
but we’re not going to say whether it’s
the one in Taiwan

56
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,450
or the one in the mainland.”

57
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,510
Vague diplomatic ambiguity is the key

58
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,720
to successful international relations.

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,700
But it is kind of awkward—

60
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,500
because it’s forced the US and most other
countries

61
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,890
to have official diplomatic relations

62
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,200
with only one of the two Chinas.

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,610
Kind of like when your two best friends in
elementary school

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,780
made you pick which one was your real best
friend.

65
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,660
No, Bobby, you can't have two best friends!

66
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,300
Pick me or pick him!

67
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,630
Most countries, including the US,

68
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,140
eventually picked mainland China, and not
Taiwan.

69
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,040
Even though the US stills sells weapons to
Taiwan every year.

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,880
But that’s a whole ’nother, ’nother
episode.

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Anyway,

72
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,310
Trump tossed the One China Policy into the
air in December

73
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,090
when he spoke with Taiwanese president Tsai
Ing-wen

74
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,340
over the phone.

75
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,780
The first time a US president has done so

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,340
since the 70’s.

77
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,530
Then, he further shook the beehive by saying
this.

78
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,900
I fully understand the One China Policy,

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,340
but I don’t know why we have to be bound

80
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,680
by a One China Policy

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,090
unless we make a deal with China having to
do with other things,

82
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,560
including trade…

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,760
To which Chinese state run media responded
with,

84
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,010
he’s “playing with fire.”

85
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,350
Western media jumped on Trump for using Taiwan,

86
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,100
America’s ally,

87
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,940
as a bargaining chip with Beijing.

88
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,240
Fun fact:

89
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,810
Hillary Clinton had also considered using
Taiwan

90
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,790
as a bargaining chip.

91
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,180
So Trump wasn't that different from Clinton
here,

92
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,980
he was just more confrontational about it.

93
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,850
Because if you’re the US president,

94
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,620
you bargain with Taiwan's future.

95
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,180
It’s what you do.

96
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,400
But last week,

97
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,710
had a phone call.

99
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,710
And it was,

100
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,230
according to the White House,

101
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,300
“extremely cordial”—

102
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,530
and since it was over the phone,

103
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,380
presumably less awkward than this moment

104
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,800
with Japan’s prime minister.

105
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,740
Please, look at me.

106
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,360
Anyway, on the call Trump agreed

107
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,870
“to honor our ‘one China policy.’”

108
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,780
So Trump dropped his hardline stance.

109
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,430
Does that mean Trump is backing down?

110
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,250
Is he caving in?

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,440
Or is he giving China the upper hand?

112
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,200
Or maybe none of those.

113
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,260
As J Michael Cole,

114
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,080
editor in chief of Taiwan Sentinel, points out,

115
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,340
the White House statement says the US will

116
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,630
“honor our one China Policy.”

117
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,500
As I've pointed out in previous episodes,

118
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,220
America's One China Policy

119
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,700
is a bit different from China's One China
policy.

120
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,310
America’s is that

121
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,790
“the U.S. acknowledges Beijing’s position

122
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,200
that there is only one China.”

123
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,700
Yeah,

124
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,760
the US acknowledges that Beijing

125
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,220
has that position.

126
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,300
It’s like me telling these guys,

127
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,500
“Yes, I acknowledge that you believe

128
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
that you’re a superhero.”

129
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,550
Once again,

130
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,750
vague diplomatic ambiguity saves the day.

131
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,530
This is a huge win for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, though.

132
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,420
This means that instead of fighting with Trump

133
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,330
over the One China issue,

134
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,040
he has more time to kick back, relax,

135
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,570
and continue his life-or-death struggle

136
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,940
to purge his political rivals.

137
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,260
In fact, Ming Chu-cheng,

138
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,850
a professor of political science

139
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,000
at National Taiwan University,

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,320
believes that the United States

141
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,670
has been quietly supportive of Xi Jinping

142
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,150
over the years,

143
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,910
and that “Donald Trump may, in honoring
the ‘one China’ policy,

144
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,380
be reverting to the status quo.”

145
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,300
Trump?

146
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,360
Reverting to the status quo?

147
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,560
What’s going on in this crazy mixed-up world?

148
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Well, lately the Trump family

149
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,560
has been trying to strengthen its China ties.

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,750
No, not those ties.

151
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,750
Before Trump was elected,

152
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,090
his son-in-law met with a major Chinese business
tycoon

153
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,700
to discuss property development.

154
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,100
For the Chinese New Year,

155
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,950
Ivanka Trump and her 5-year-old daughter

156
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,840
paid a visit to the Chinese embassy.

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,860
Aww, she’s scared of the Chinese ambassador.

158
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,280
Then Trump’s national security advisor

159
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,900
hand delivers a letter from Trump to China’s
ambassador

160
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,950
with new year’s wishes.

161
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,580
It said “he looks forward to working with
President Xi

162
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,830
to develop a constructive relationship that
benefits

163
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,210
both the United States and China.”

164
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,180
So maybe that US-China war isn’t “a practical
reality” just yet.

165
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,000
So what do you think of Trump’s so-called

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,740
“caving in to the Chinese”?

167
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,460
Is that what’s happening?

168
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,990
Leave your comments below.

169
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,060
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

170
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

171
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,180
See you next time.
