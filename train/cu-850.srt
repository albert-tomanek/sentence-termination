1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,909
NBA star Lebron James blunders on Hong Kong

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:06,910
While US Lawmakers pass landmark legislation

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,510
And a breakthrough in the US-China Trade War?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,760
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,180
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,640
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,519
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,519
Hong Kong.

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,060
The city version of the “this is fine”
dog.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,740
Protests have continued there for 131 days.

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,890
Hongkongers are upset about the Chinese Communist
Party

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,680
trying to annihilate their freedoms.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,980
And how the Hong Kong government and police
force

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,610
are being pawns of the Communist Party.

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,750
And definitely the police brutality.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,190
And pro-democracy legislators made very clear
what they think

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,960
about Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,120
at her annual policy address this week.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,080
Hong Kong's protests moved inside

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,080
the city's legislature on Wednesday.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,930
The city's least popular post-colonial leader

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,500
had her annual policy address adjourned

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,070
after some lawmakers stood on desks,

24
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,380
chanted protest slogans and held up banners
of Carrie Lam

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,409
with blood on her hands.

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,490
Hey, that’s Tanya Chan.

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,829
I just interviewed her!

28
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:16,069
I’m glad to see she’s doing well.

29
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:18,649
The lawmakers were also chanting the popular
slogan

30
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:21,490
“5 demands, not one less.”

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,310
The protesters have 5 demands of the Hong
Kong government,

32
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,219
including an investigation into police brutality.

33
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,689
Carrie Lam had to cancel her speech and do

34
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,229
a pre recorded broadcast later in the day.

35
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,759
But don’t feel too bad for her.

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,030
Feel bad for Jimmy Sham.

37
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,420
He’s the head of the Civil Human Rights
Front.

38
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,439
They’re an umbrella group that’s organized

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,100
some of the biggest rallies over the past
few months,

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,330
including this one from June 16,

41
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,630
with 2 million people,

42
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,199
in a city of only 7 million.

43
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,829
The Civil Human Rights Front has always made

44
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,789
a point of keeping their rallies and marches

45
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,859
peaceful and non violent.

46
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:58,219
Something the four men who attacked Jimmy
Sham with hammers,

47
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,869
clearly do not value.

48
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,990
That was the second attack on him in less
than two months.

49
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,560
And do you know what Jimmy Sham said

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,229
as they put him in the ambulance?

51
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,489
Five demands, not one less.

52
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,410
Sham had head wounds and is still in the hospital,

53
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,360
but he’s going to be ok.

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,300
Meanwhile the Civil Human Rights Front

55
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,220
is planning another march on Sunday,

56
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,129
for which they posted this upbeat slogan:

57
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,769
You can’t kill us all.

58
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:24,629
Historically speaking, that hasn’t stopped

59
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,610
the Communist Party from trying.

60
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,209
Of course, the protests in Hong Kong

61
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,769
have caught the attention of the American
public as well.

62
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,020
Especially thanks to the NBA.

63
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,209
Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey

64
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,470
tweeted this image supporting the Hong Kong
protests.

65
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,829
And then the entire NBA attacked him,

66
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,400
because the NBA has 4 billion dollars on the
line in China.

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,680
And the Lakers and Brooklyn Nets were also
about to play

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,959
an exhibition game there.

69
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,659
Just as the controversy was dying down,

70
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,150
LeBron James also criticized the original
tweet.

71
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,190
We all do have freedom of speech,

72
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,140
but at times there are ramifications

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,549
for the negative that can happen

74
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,630
when you’re not thinking of others.

75
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,990
When you’re only thinking of yourself.

76
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,750
I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation
at hand and he spoke.”

77
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,480
Then there was a huge public backlash.

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,500
Protesters in Hong Kong burned and trampled
his jersey,

79
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,969
while here at home, critics piled on,

80
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,030
and LeBron James memes are trending on twitter.

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,150
Then LeBron said that it was very hard

82
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,080
for the Lakers in China that week,

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,849
so Morey should have waited a week to send
the tweet.

84
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,500
Yes, *he’s* had a difficult week.

85
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,200
Meanwhile, the people of Hong Kong

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,049
enjoyed sunshine and rainbows

87
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,940
and the police handed bought everyone ice
cream.

88
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,370
But I personally think we’re being too hard
on LeBron James.

89
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,230
After all, he’s single-handedly kept this
story in the news,

90
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,069
giving more people the chance to learn about

91
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,359
what’s happening in Hong Kong

92
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:52,130
and how repressive the Chinese regime is.

93
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,590
Plus, Lebron has overcome a lot of challenges
in his life

94
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,060
to get where he is.

95
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,700
He is truly an inspiration.

96
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,439
I mean, can you imagine how hard it must be

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,689
to play professional basketball without a
spine?

98
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,150
Meanwhile, and I can’t believe I’m saying
this,

99
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,609
American politicians have shown that they
do have a spine.

100
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,760
The US House of Representatives has passed

101
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,150
the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

102
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,789
Hong Kong has special trading status with
the US.

103
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:23,210
It’s not treated like the rest of Mainland
China,

104
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,270
because it supposedly has rule of law.

105
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,160
But this bill would allow for an annual review

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,680
to see if Hong Kong’s legal system

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,389
is really autonomous from the rest of China.

108
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:35,389
And if not,

109
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,569
the US will take Hong Kong’s special trade
status away.

110
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,660
It would also lay out a process for the President

111
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,400
to impose sanctions and travel restrictions
on Hong Kong authorities

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,919
who are responsible for arbitrary detention
and torture.

113
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,480
And it makes sure that Hongkongers

114
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,310
who have been arrested for protesting

115
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,470
would still be able to get visas to the US.

116
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,889
The House also passed the PROTECT Hong Kong
Act,

117
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,000
which would ban the export of things like
tear gas to Hong Kong police.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,699
Both bills still have to pass the Senate.

119
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,889
Carrie Lam was not too excited.

120
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,759
“I would like to express extreme regret
that

121
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,520
the U.S. House of Representatives approved
legislation

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,750
of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act this morning.

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,789
A foreign government or a foreign parliament

124
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:21,509
is meddling in Hong Kong's internal affair.”

125
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,170
Aww, that’s so cute.

126
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,919
She’s learned to speak exactly like her
masters in Beijing.

127
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,150
But there is some good news for Carrie Lam
in all this.

128
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,370
The Hong Kong people have been nominated for
a Nobel peace prize!

129
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,660
And technically, she’s a Hong Kong people.

130
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,310
Of course the Chinese Communist Party is none
too pleased

131
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,610
by all the attention it’s getting over Hong
Kong.

132
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,180
“Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman
Geng Shuang

133
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,340
warned American lawmakers to stop meddling
in China’s internal affairs

134
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,520
‘before falling off the edge of the cliff.’”

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,139
To be fair he’s been watching a lot of Looney
Toons lately.

136
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,410
While Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been reading

137
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,690
a lot of fairy tales lately.

138
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,949
On a recent trip to Nepal, he warned,

139
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,810
“Anyone who attempts to split any region
from China will perish,

140
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,370
with their bodies smashed and bones ground
to powder.”

141
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,360
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of rebellion.

142
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
So the question on everyone’s mind

143
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,680
is whether the new Hong Kong legislation

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,190
will affect the US-China Trade War.

145
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,759
There does seem to be some movement on that.

146
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,460
A preliminary deal has been agreed on that
includes

147
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,860
“a commitment by China to buy $40 billion
to $50 billion

148
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,889
of American agricultural products per year.”

149
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:39,100
That would be much more than before the trade
war.

150
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,410
And President Trump was modest about his success
as usual.

151
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,850
“The deal I just made with China is, by
far,

152
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,569
the greatest and biggest deal

153
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,680
ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers

154
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,020
in the history of our Country.”

155
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,460
Now there’s the question that Trump

156
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,659
even acknowledges about whether US farmers

157
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,259
can even produce that much.

158
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,410
Though I’m sure that problem can be solved
with a little science,

159
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,260
and a little moral flexibility.

160
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,900
Genetically engineered spider corn anyone?

161
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,180
However, the preliminary deal hasn’t been
signed...

162
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,870
and there’s a whole bunch of other things
it doesn’t address.

163
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,830
So the trade war is still not over.

164
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,250
But it could be the start of the human-spider
corn wars.

165
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,080
But it’s not just Hong Kong the US is worried
about.

166
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,620
The White House is also warning about

167
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,320
untrackable Chinese ships carrying Iranian
oil.

168
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,240
The US has imposed oil sanctions on Iran

169
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,409
to tackle the country’s nuclear program.

170
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,460
And any country that buys Iranian oil faces
sanctions too.

171
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,259
But China was the largest importer of Iranian
oil.

172
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,060
Now there’s concerns China will continue
to buy Iranian oil,

173
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,980
but smuggled on untrackable ships.

174
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,770
Of course, when has the Communist Party

175
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,669
ever done anything deceitful?

176
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,449
Accusations have emerged that Apple’s Safari
browser

177
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,880
is sending some user data to the Chinese company
Tencent.

178
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,060
Apparently, Safari has privacy feature

179
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,580
called Fraudulent Website Warning.

180
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,169
And Safari would send information

181
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,789
to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent Safe Browsing.

182
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:07,919
Oh.

183
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,050
Good.

184
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,050
But Apple responded saying

185
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,750
they don’t share the website of the URL,

186
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,560
and plus it only applies to Mainland China.

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,680
So don’t worry.

188
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,730
Apple would never lie to you.

189
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,150
DreamWorks’ latest film Abominable

190
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,530
is being kicked out of theaters in Vietnam.

191
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,400
That’s because of this.

192
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,189
A map used in the movie showing China’s
9-dash line,

193
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,820
China’s territorial claim to the entire
South China Sea.

194
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,719
Apparently even including Taiwan.

195
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,370
Now a Filipino official is calling for that
scene

196
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,450
to be cut in their country.

197
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,000
Which really isn’t fair.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,029
After all, Hollywood has been a part of China
since ancient times.

199
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,550
But don’t worry, it’s not just Hollywood.

200
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,960
Why, ESPN, reporting on the NBA China controversy,

201
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,120
used this graphic.

202
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,050
“Now let’s switch to the NBA,

203
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,339
Lebron and the Lakers arrived in Shanghai
China...”

204
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,690
Yeah, let’s take a look at this.

205
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,290
Not only does this have the 9 dash line,

206
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,180
it also has Taiwan,

207
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,170
and disputed territory with India

208
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,190
called Arunachal Pradesh as part of China.

209
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,440
Now, it’s possible someone might have corrected
this obvious blunder

210
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,950
before it ever aired,

211
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,269
but then again ESPN did tell employees not
to discuss China,

212
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,040
Hong Kong politics in an internal memo.

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,790
And now you know why I’ve spent seven years
of my life

214
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,339
making a show warning Americans

215
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:29,760
about the Chinese Communist Party.

216
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,890
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

217
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,170
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

218
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,060
a fan who support China Uncensored

219
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,170
with a dollar or more per episode,

220
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,959
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

221
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,390
Logan asks,

222
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,480
Do you feel the South Park Episode “band
in China”

223
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,140
did a good job highlighting a lot of these
issues?

224
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,490
Logan is talking about a recent episode of
South Park

225
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,800
about US companies and Hollywood self censoring

226
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,010
and generally selling out to appease Chinese
censors.

227
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,430
I think they did a great job with that episode.

228
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,071
There’s a reason why people in Hong Kong

229
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,810
are playing it on the streets.

230
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,300
It felt like the episode touched on

231
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,540
the personal experiences of the writers

232
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,600
having to deal with all the Hollywood censorship

233
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,430
to appease the Chinese Communist Party.

234
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,250
And they didn’t pull their punches.

235
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,329
I mean, they even brought up organ harvesting.

236
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:19,290
That’s about as third rail an issue as you
can get with China.

237
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,380
Really, I think South Park,

238
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,589
combined with the NBA scandal,

239
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,940
did a great job of helping more Americans
than ever

240
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,709
realize that the Chinese Communist Party

241
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:31,170
is a horrible authoritarian regime,

242
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,000
and just how much control they have in the
United States,

243
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,310
all because of money.

244
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,420
The episode even showed the NBA and Lebron
James—

245
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,410
and this was before the NBA scandal happened
later that week.

246
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,410
Thanks for your question, Logan.

247
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,410
And if you have a question for me

248
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,209
you want to hear answered on the show,

249
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,639
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

250
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,550
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

251
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,339
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

252
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,089
we would have to shut down the show

253
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,060
if it weren’t for your support.

254
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,910
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

255
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,480
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

256
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,300
See you next time.
