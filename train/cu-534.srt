1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,190
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,580
does the CCP support ethnic cleansing in Myanmar?

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,380
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,380
Myanmar:

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,960
The country formerly-and-sometimes-still known
as Burma.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
It's one of the 14 countries that share a
border with China.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,850
It's also one of dozens of countries that
share

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,539
economic development projects with China.

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,920
Myanmar is part of China's One Belt, One Road
Initiative--

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,990
which has nothing to do with how high Xi Jinping's
pants are.

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,271
The One Belt, One Road Initiative

13
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,770
is actually Xi Jinping's multi-trillion dollar
plan

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,560
to build giant infrastructure projects in
countries around the world,

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,550
mostly docks, airports, train lines--that
sort of thing.

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,890
The countries pay for it using money that
is often

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,020
borrowed from Chinese banks,

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,540
and then they will either pay it back if the
project is a success,

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,600
or be in debt to China forever.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,160
You know, win-win.

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,070
Just like my student loans.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,280
The Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,100
is behind a huge set of infrastructure projects
in Myanmar.

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,520
They've recently completed a deep water port
in the Bay of Bengal,

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,770
plus oil and gas pipelines connecting that
port with China.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,520
All this development has cost Myanmar

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,280
more than 10 billion dollars.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,470
Most of the construction has taken place in
Myanmar's Rakhine State.

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,040
Which is the poorest state in Myanmar.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,680
And it's full of ethnic minorities known as
the Rohingyas.

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,530
But there've been some problems.

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,530
Since August,

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,320
more than 480,000 Rohingyas have fled the
region.

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,350
Most of them to neighboring Bangladesh.

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,440
So why are they fleeing?

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,770
Well, it's complicated.

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,540
But recently Rohingyas have been facing persecution

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,530
from a group of violent religious extremists:

39
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,530
Buddhist monks!

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,650
It turns out,

41
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,780
regardless of race, religion, or creed,

42
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,920
all people have the capacity to be huge jerks.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,730
It's what binds us all together.

44
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,190
Myanmar is a predominantly Buddhist country,

45
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,950
and it has seen a rise of extremism following
the end

46
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,800
of 50 years of authoritarian rule by a military
junta in 2011.

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,130
And radical Buddhist monks have incited killings

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,350
of Myanmar's Muslim minority--the Rohingyas.

49
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,030
Yes, you heard that right.

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,030
Sword-wielding Buddhist extremists

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,860
are killing impoverished Muslim minorities,

52
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,550
including women and children.

53
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,450
According to the International Crisis Group,

54
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,530
"Myanmar has been troubled by an upsurge

55
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,140
in extreme Buddhist nationalism,

56
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,500
anti-Muslim hate speech

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,940
and deadly communal violence."

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,570
This tension between Buddhists and Muslims
in Myanmar

59
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,620
goes back decades.

60
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,510
Only 4 percent of the country is Muslim,

61
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,200
and the Rohingyas were heavily persecuted

62
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,220
by the ruling military junta, too,

63
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,070
back when it was in power.

64
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,830
But even after Myanmar's transition to sort
of democracy,

65
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,630
the issues continued.

66
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,640
Two years ago,

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,720
President Obama condemned the discrimination
against the Rohingyas,

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,319
even as he praised Myanmar's budding democracy.

69
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:57,209
But there's an ongoing cycle of violence that
leaves no one blameless.

70
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,959
For example, last October,

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,470
Islamic extremists killed 9 police.

72
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,521
That led to a military crackdown on the entire
Rakhine state

73
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,569
that ended only in February.

74
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,130
The United Nations said the military

75
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,970
may have committed crimes against humanity

76
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,319
and ethnic cleansing.

77
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,319
Then in August,

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
a group of Rohingya Muslims again attacked
police,

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,320
and the army cracked down on Rohingyas again
in a big way.

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,240
And so did the Buddhists.

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,250
More than 1,000 Rohingyas have been killed
in recent months,

82
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,300
and as I mentioned,

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,830
more than 480,000 have fled to Bangladesh--

84
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,170
which, by the way, doesn't really want them
either,

85
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,830
but they are letting them in.

86
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,140
More than 60 percent of the refugees are children.

87
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,540
And once again, the United Nations

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,750
is calling the violence in Myanmar "ethnic
cleansing."

89
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,580
"The situation remains, or seems, a textbook
example of ethnic cleansing."

90
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,620
Which, if you think about it, "ethnic cleansing"
is a pretty weird euphemism.

91
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,030
The US Trump administration has also condemned

92
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,760
the violence against Rohingya Muslims.

93
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,220
"President Trump and I also call on the Security
Council

94
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,720
and the United Nations to take strong and
swift action

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,740
to bring this crisis to an end.

96
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,590
And give hope and help to the Rohingya people

97
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,910
in their hour of need."

98
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,219
So just a quick recap,

99
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,939
violent extremist Buddhists and the Myanmar
army

100
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,099
have been attacking Muslims.

101
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,889
And now the Trump administration is defending

102
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,999
the persecuted Muslims.

103
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:30,449
I'm not sure I know what's going on anymore.

104
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,490
Is there any firm reality I can grab onto?

105
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,439
What's that, Shelley?

106
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,740
Ah good,

107
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,779
the Chinese regime endorses the crackdown.

108
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,990
And they're saying the rest of the world

109
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,520
should just butt out of Myanmar's internal
affairs.

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,449
Good old predictable Chinese Communist Party.

111
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,229
You are my rock in this turbulent world.

112
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:55,009
Once again the Chinese regime is blocking
international efforts

113
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,099
to butt into the affairs of another country,

114
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,850
like it did with the violence in Sudan,

115
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,979
or the nuclear weapons development in North
Korea for years,

116
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,599
or any of a dozen other countries.

117
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,020
And it's a pretty common strategy of the Chinese
regime.

118
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,469
Because while the rest of the world wags its
collective finger,

119
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:14,909
the Chinese Communist Party is there to be
like,

120
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:15,909
don't worry,

121
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,259
what you do behind closed doors is your own
business.

122
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,220
And when it comes time to make large-scale
infrastructure deals,

123
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,479
just remember who's got your back in the UN.

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,500
As The American Interest puts it,

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,909
"Unencumbered by considerations of values,

126
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:34,080
Beijing can make friends with all kinds of
unsavory regimes

127
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,960
that the United States or the European Union
prefers to scold or sanction."

128
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,839
And China has big political interests in Myanmar.

129
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,839
For one,

130
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,139
China is battling the United States over influence
there.

131
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,389
Following the end of the military junta in
2011,

132
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,159
the US eased up on sanctions

133
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,729
that had been in place for two decades.

134
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:54,699
Obama became the first US president

135
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,469
to visit Myanmar while in office.

136
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:01,740
And the first US president to hug Myanmar's
new leader while in office.

137
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,629
That was a bit worrisome to Beijing.

138
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,870
Especially the hugging part.

139
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,990
Xi Jinping only got a handshake.

140
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,689
The last thing the Chinese regime wants

141
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,879
is another US ally right on its border.

142
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,139
The solution?

143
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,629
Drive a wedge between the US and Myanmar.

144
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,620
China has worked to build ties with Myanmar

145
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,629
for economic reasons, too.

146
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,750
Like easy access to the Indian Ocean,

147
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,979
without the trouble of going around the Malaysian
peninsula.

148
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,289
That's not to say the Chinese regime

149
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,830
is unconcerned about violence in Myanmar.

150
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,539
I mean, it might interfere with that oil pipeline.

151
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,289
Now China did back a UN Security Council resolution

152
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,839
"expressing concern" about the violence.

153
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,759
Oh yes, so much concern.

154
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
But China then blocked harsher language from
being added to it.

155
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,259
To the West, the CCP acts like it's playing
along,

156
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,490
while assuring Myanmar that it won't really
put the screws on them.

157
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,490
And let's not forget,

158
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,770
if China really were to criticize Myanmar

159
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,039
for its treatment of the Muslim minority,

160
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,259
it would sound a bit hypocritical,

161
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,949
considering the CCP's treatment of its own
Muslim minority,

162
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:03,999
the Uighurs.

163
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:08,719
And gosh, the CCP would hate to sound hypocritical
on something.

164
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,710
But the Trump administration doesn't really
want

165
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,569
to be too harsh on the Myanmar government,
either,

166
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,439
and supports the no-sanctions policy started
by Obama.

167
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,139
That's because the US has supported

168
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,300
the democratic developments in Myanmar

169
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,099
under its new leader.

170
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,789
And the US's overriding concern

171
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,339
is to keep Myanmar as a US ally,

172
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,879
and not alienate them--

173
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,990
because that might push them closer to the
Chinese regime.

174
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,199
So to sum up:

175
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,330
In Myanmar,

176
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,189
violent Buddhists extremists are persecuting
Muslims

177
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,210
and forcing them to flee the country.

178
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,580
Trump actually agrees with Obama

179
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,629
that persecuting these Muslims is wrong

180
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,409
and should stop.

181
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,029
But the US government also doesn't want to
push too hard

182
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,339
and alienate Myanmar's government.

183
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,139
And finally, the Chinese regime agrees

184
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,330
that the US shouldn't interfere,

185
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,599
since that would be against China's interests,

186
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,349
and also no country should interfere

187
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,839
with another country's internal affairs.

188
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,719
Unless we're talking about China trying to
interfere

189
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,909
in the internal affairs of New Zealand.

190
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,759
But that's a whole 'nother episode.

191
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,360

Uncensored.
