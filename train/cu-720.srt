00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,480
some really anti-China things are being said,
by...

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,820
China?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,299
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:13,080
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
What do you think of when you hear “China”?

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,670
Hopefully—China Uncensored, starring Chris
Chappell.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,599
But our budget is a long way from what the
Chinese Communist Party spends.

9
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:28,109
They’re spending $10 billion dollars a year
to make sure that you love China.

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,460
What are they buying with those 10 billion
dollars?

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,390
Why, all sorts of things!

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,750
Especially articles and videos that help you

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,690
focus on all the amazing things China’s
glorious leaders have accomplished,

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,629
because, you know, China gets things done.

15
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:47,309
For example, they have this newspaper section
called China Watch

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,270
that looks like articles, but is actually
paid propaganda.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,719
And then they pay American newspapers

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,520
to put them in as advertisements.

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,809
And combine things like that with operating
American TV News channels,

20
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,109
and buying influence in Hollywood, and eventually
you get

21
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,500
American media publishing their own articles
praising the China model.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,410
But right now, it seems the Communist Party
wants you to hold on a sec,

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,660
because China isn’t really all that great.

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,260
You see, Americans have been seeing all the
propaganda for years,

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,051
and a lot of them are now really worried that
China

26
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:23,240
is some kind of super powerful,

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,440
existential threat to the world.

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,040
That it’s flooding the US with spies.

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,060
Or secretly building up the largest military
in the world.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,170
Or that China is a strategic competitor of
the US.

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,350
Haha, couldn’t be further from the truth.

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,200
Really, there’s no way China could be doing
all that.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,410
I mean, the US is still number one, China
can’t compete.

34
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,220
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,770
is the new message from the Chinese regime’s
propaganda machine.

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,210
This People’s Daily editorial says calling
China “the world’s first”

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,460
or “number one in the world”

38
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,250
“could easily make people misunderstand
or even misjudge” China.

39
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,630
China’s US Ambassador Cui Tiankai said at
a recent meeting,

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,170
“China has no intention to challenge the
international standing

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,110
and interests of any other country

42
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,850
or the existing international order and system.”

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,540
A professor at a top Chinese University said,

44
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,310
“The trade war has made China more humble.

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,800
We should keep a low profile.”

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,310
And my favorite state-run media the Global
Times ran this story.

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,720
Tsinghua is another top Chinese university.

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,890
Apparently one professor there had said in
a speech,

49
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,260
“China has overtaken the US in all respects.”

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,710
And so then over 500 alumni signed a petition
to have him fired.

51
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,850
Why?

52
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,460
Well, the petition said his view “opposed
common sense.”

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,390
Are you surprised by this new tone?

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,910
Don’t be.

55
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,880
Because as that alumni letter said,

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,690
the problem with all the “China is number
one” talk,

57
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,960
is it “raises the vigilance of other countries.”

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,400
The US has been kind of catching on to the
fact the Chinese regime

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,250
is actively engaged in a variety of tactics

60
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,280
to infiltrate and undermine the West.

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,020
And that’s a problem for the Communist Party

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,950
because it means the US might start doing
things like,

63
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,020
oh I don’t know...starting a trade war.

64
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,600
So China’s Propaganda Department had switched
tactics.

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,230
At least, externally.

66
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,430
Instead of articles like this from the People’s
Daily in 2015...

67
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,490
Now, we’re seeing articles like this.

68
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,020
It’s a strategy more like something former
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping

69
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,470
once said: “Hide your strength, bide your
time.”

70
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,540
It’s like, if there’s an arm wrestling
contest coming up,

71
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,130
you don’t want to start walking around without
a shirt if you’re this guy.

72
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,850
So depending on what the strategy of the day
is,

73
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,440
state-run media can do a complete 180 on the
image of China.

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,620
For instance, at the beginning of the year,

75
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,620
China said it was battling to become a top
economic power.

76
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,530
But now, China is still a developing economy…

77
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,200
And it “has a long way to go before it becomes
a ‘developed economy.’”

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,770
Wow, what a difference a few months make!

79
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,160
You see, the Chinese Communist Party likes
to make itself look all powerful.

80
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,859
Except when it wants to make itself look weaker
than it actually is.

81
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,639
Because as the People’s Daily also recently
put it,

82
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,790
“China has returned to the center of the
world stage...

83
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,620
Such a large size, such a heavy thing,

84
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,370
can’t be hidden by ‘being low key,’

85
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,350
...just like an elephant can’t hide behind
a sapling.”

86
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,720
And that’s the message state-run media wants
Chinese people to hear.

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,550
Because while the Chinese Communist Party
is starting to

88
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,640
downplay its ambitions to the outside world,

89
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,090
inside China, it’s actively promoting nationalism

90
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,910
in a way that would make Mussolini blush.

91
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,760
Like this recent documentary,

92
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,810
translated in English as “Amazing China”,

93
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,160
but actually is closer to “my country is
awesome.”

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
See?!

95
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
See how awesome?!

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,570
Endless hours of footage awesome!

97
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,310
And it was a smash hit!

98
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,790
Brought in 42 million dollars.

99
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,560
Biggest documentary in China ever.

100
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,470
Partly because people were required to watch
it.

101
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,000
That is one way to boost ticket sales.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,250
Although it didn’t do quite as well as the
American documentary

103
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,310
about how America is awesome.

104
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,190
Which made 52 million dollars.

105
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,760
That was a documentary, right?

106
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,230
Anyway, besides telling Chinese people how
awesome China is,

107
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,980
the internal propaganda has another message:

108
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,211
If China can’t compete, that’s because

109
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,150
“China [has] suffered a century of humiliation

110
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,620
at the hands of foreign powers.”

111
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,320
But if Chinese state-run media is changing
their tone,

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,560
does that mean that the Chinese leadership

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,030
is actually changing their strategy?

114
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,210
Do they care more now about international
cooperation

115
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,389
than becoming a top economic power?

116
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,950
I’m going to go with no.

117
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,870
So what do you think about the Communist Party’s
propaganda about-face?

118
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,340
Leave your comments below.

119
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,090
And before you go, now is the time when we
answer questions

120
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,150
from fans who support China Uncensored

121
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,870
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

122
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,870
Largezo asks,

123
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,570
“If nothing is done to curtail China’s
influence

124
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,080
and intellectual property theft will the PRC
rule the world

125
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
come mid-century?”

126
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,949
I mean, what gave you the idea that the PRC

127
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,620
was looking to become a global superpower?

128
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,540
It can’t compete.

129
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,900
But if it were, it might start doing things
like,

130
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,870
make their own computer chips.

131
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,949
Or build their own Internet

132
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,680
And compete with America’s GPS network.

133
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,870
All the core tech components a super power
needs that China...

134
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,050
didn’t really have a few years ago,

135
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,380
but in a very short time, suddenly, they do…

136
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,950
Strange.

137
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,870
So the People’s Republic of China definitely

138
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,220
wants to rule the world by mid century.

139
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,979
But will they?

140
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:58,979
Well Largezo,

141
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,180
you asked “if nothing is done to curtail
China’s influence”

142
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,220
and I think what we’re definitely seeing
is the beginning of

143
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,540
other countries trying to curtail China’s
influence.

144
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,800
Or at least waking up to it.

145
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,140
So I don’t think it’s going to be as easy

146
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,449
for the Chinese Communist Party

147
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,240
as it has been so far.

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,460
But whether they will succeed in ruling the
world largely depends on

149
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,160
how quickly other countries will act.

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
Thanks for you question.

151
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,380
