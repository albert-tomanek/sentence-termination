00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,750
Trump’s inauguration means change!

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,770
And not just for that Chinese Obama impersonator

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,050
who's about to be out of a job.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,400
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,400
This Friday,

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,341
Donald Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th
president

9
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,320
of the United States.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,180
Now Trump has repeatedly said he’ll be hard
on China

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,930
when he enters office.

12
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,090
Exact details are a bit sparse,

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,090
but hey,

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,380
how could you not trust this guy?

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,380
You know,

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,380
it used to be politicians just needed to wear
a flag pin

17
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,300
to prove they loved America.

18
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,410
Anyway,

19
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,390
it's clear that the relationship between China
and the US

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,610
will never be the same.

21
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,170
But what’s gonna change?

22
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,170
I mean,

23
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,740
China already built a wall and paid for it—

24
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,600
but that was ages ago.

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,670
So let’s take a look at 5 YUUUGE ways Trump’s
inauguration

26
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,550
is going to change US-China relations.

27
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,880
Number 5

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,430
Currency Manipulation

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,750
Donald Trump has promised to label China

30
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,350
a “currency manipulator.”

31
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,560
I’m going to instruct my Treasury Secretary

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,560
to label China a currency manipulator,

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,400
which should have been done years ago.

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,100
Yes, it should have been done years ago.

35
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,700
For much of the last 20 years,

36
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,710
the Chinese regime manipulated its currency

37
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,140
to keep it weak,

38
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,740
so that China could become the world leader
in cheap labor,

39
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,840
cheap goods,

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,950
and confused childhoods.

41
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,159
That made China’s economy grow.

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,619
But it’s also one of many reasons

43
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,630
why the US lost millions of manufacturing
jobs.

44
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,940
It also helped create a huge trade imbalance

45
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,940
with China.

46
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,500
But more recently,

47
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,580
the Chinese regime has the opposite problem.

48
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,670
China’s economy is slowing down.

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,680
And wealthy Chinese are moving their money
out of the country.

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,050
These are two reasons why the Chinese currency

51
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,190
is weak to the point of being unhealthy.

52
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,330
So now the regime has been manipulating their
currency

53
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,869
the other way,

54
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:03,729
trying to keep it strong.

55
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:04,729
In other words,

56
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,810
the Chinese regime is now manipulating their
currency

57
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,869
in a way that helps the US.

58
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,829
So even if Trump could force China

59
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:15,209
to stop manipulating its currency now...

60
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,279
it wouldn’t really benefit the US.

61
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:21,109
Of course, labeling China a “currency manipulator”

62
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:24,389
doesn't actually force them to do anything.

63
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,689
So Trump has another idea:

64
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,079
Slap tariffs on China.

65
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,879
But that could lead to...

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,230
Number 4

67
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,230
Trade War

68
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,349
Ah, the kind of war whose greatest weapon

69
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,129
is how boring it is to talk about.

70
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:41,109
This really deserves its own episode.

71
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:44,139
But Trump has been criticizing trade with
China

72
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,700
since the Republican primaries.

73
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,090
China is ripping us on trade,

74
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,670
devaluing their currency

75
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,859
and killing our companies.

76
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,569
Of course it’s always important to remember

77
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,909
what presidents say on the campaign trail

78
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,329
and what they actually do

79
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,449
are two very different things.

80
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,849
When Bill Clinton first ran,

81
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,680
he criticized George Bush Senior

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,909
for being soft on the “butchers of Beijing.”

83
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:08,909
And then…

84
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,370
well, that’s sort of the reason why we’re
where we are now.

85
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,760
Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese
imports.

86
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,510
That’s going to be challenging,

87
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,779
because legally, you can only put tariffs
on specific goods,

88
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:24,890
not on an entire country.

89
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,180
And I mean you can’t.

90
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,889
Trump will probably decide he can do anything
he wants.

91
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,459
Even it it means flying in the face of international
trade laws.

92
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,650
And starting a trade war.

93
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,040
And the loser in that...

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,549
would be the Chinese regime.

95
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,120
China’s economy is slowing,

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,239
and the regime has maintained its grip on
power

97
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,099
by promising economic stability.

98
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,950
Anything that poses a risk to that poses a
risk

99
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,629
to the Communist Party’s leadership.

100
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:52,629
As for the US,

101
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,449
a trade war would hurt,

102
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,739
but not as much as it would hurt China.

103
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,739
China could lose millions of jobs,

104
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:07,760
while the US could always buy its cheap nightmare
toys

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,650
from Malaysia, Vietnam, and so on.

106
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,030
So what does Xi Jinping think about this?

107
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,230
It's hard to tell.

108
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,560
Ok, actually, I guess it's pretty clear.

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,470
Speaking of unwinnable wars...

110
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,590
Number 3

111
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,630
North Korea

112
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,310
Remember this fun little prediction

113
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,720
back in September last year?

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,190
Probably by the end of the first term

115
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,090
of the person we’re electing this November,

116
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,700
they are going to have the ability

117
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,660
to put nuclear warheads on missiles

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,110
that can reach the West Coast of the United
States.

119
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,470
Well, we now know that person is Trump.

120
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,770
The Hermit Kingdom is,

121
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,650
well, kind of in everyone’s face right now.

122
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,750
North Korea now has enough plutonium

123
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,690
to make 10 nuclear bombs.

124
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,990
Thanks, Obama.

125
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,230
Sorry, I know that doesn’t make any sense
here,

126
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,520
but it's basically the last time I can use
that.

127
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,180
Really, we have this guy to thank,

128
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,100
walking hemorrhoid and former Chinese leader,

129
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,110
Jiang Zemin.

130
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,060
According to this Radio Free Asia report,

131
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,880
he started giving nuclear material to North
Korea

132
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,450
after he took office in 1989.

133
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,570
Anyway, Trump holds China partly responsible

134
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,270
for the North Korean nuclear problem.

135
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,461
So China should get involved,

136
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,650
and China should solve that problem,

137
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,740
and we should put pressure on China

138
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,090
to solve the problem.

139
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,490
But Trump doesn’t want to just rely on China.

140
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,360
Maybe it’s a lot better for us,

141
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,900
if Japan pays its own way,

142
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,700
they arm and they take care of North Korea

143
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,040
instead of us taking care of it.

144
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,340
And he’s said similar things about South
Korea.

145
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,280
But South Korea should pay us,

146
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,750
and pay us very substantially,

147
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,010
for protecting them.

148
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,790
Or else they can just protect themselves.

149
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,060
So Trump’s solution to a nuclear North Korea

150
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,380
is a nuclear South Korea

151
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,910
and a nuclear Japan.

152
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,210
Which will go down so well with nuclear China.

153
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,790
One big nuclear family.

154
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,170
Let’s just hope they don’t go hugging
each other

155
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,810
with nuclear arms.

156
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,710
But what happens to the children of divorce?

157
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,590
Well, that brings us to...

158
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,800
Number 2

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,390
Taiwan

160
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,830
Trump was changing US-Taiwan relations

161
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,580
even before becoming president.

162
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,820
China considers Taiwan a breakaway province

163
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,720
and is committed to reunification.

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,690
And by reunification they mean conquest.

165
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,860
But the Chinese regime has been kind enough

166
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,900
to hold off invasion plans

167
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,300
as long as everyone agrees

168
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,620
to the One China policy—

169
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,630
where everyone collectively pretends that
Taiwan

170
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,570
is not a country.

171
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,910
So they weren’t happy when Trump

172
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,510
became the first president in over 40 years

173
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,910
to accept a phone call

174
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,020
from the president of Taiwan—

175
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,220
and then say the entire One China Policy is
negotiable.

176
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,350
Now, state-run media China Daily is saying

177
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,760
“China will take off the gloves,”

178
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,790
if Trump continues.

179
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,640
What does that mean?

180
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,940
Well according to hardcore state-run media,

181
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,160
the Global Times,

182
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,480
that means merciless reunification.

183
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
And they really mean it.

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
No, seriously.

185
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,170
Seriously.

186
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,910
And speaking of disputed territories

187
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,110
that I have personally been to...

188
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,110
Number 1

189
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,110
The South China Sea

190
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,740
Well, if Taiwan is the region

191
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,470
that China doesn’t really want to go to
war over,

192
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,230
the South China Sea is the US’s war bluff.

193
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,889
The Chinese military has been aggressively
expanding

194
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,750
in disputed territorial waters there.

195
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,900
China may or may not have historical claims
to that region,

196
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,820
but man—does the Communist Party

197
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,160
have to be such jerks about it?

198
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,190
Attacking fishermen?

199
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,740
Building military bases?

200
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,374
I mean, what ever happened to “sharing is
caring,” people?

201
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:48,080
Sharing is something you can do

202
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,919
whenever you want to.

203
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,450
Do they even have Care Bears in China?

204
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,050
Ok, sort of.

205
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,300
Back to the South China Sea.

206
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,650
In the last few years under President Obama,

207
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,800
US naval presence flooded the region,

208
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,270
intimidating China so much that...

209
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,419
they would steal a research drone right in
front of them.

210
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,700
But according to Trump’s new Secretary of
State,

211
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,890
that’s going to change.

212
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,370
We’re going to have to send China a clear
signal

213
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,420
that first the island-building stops

214
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,200
and second your access to those islands

215
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,750
is also not going to be allowed.”

216
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,860
Using the US military to blockade China from
the region

217
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,110
would be a big change.

218
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,639
It would also put Chinese leader Xi Jinping
at risk.

219
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,099
He’s locked in a massive battle for power

220
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,919
over the Communist Party.

221
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,889
Xi can’t afford to look weak,

222
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,449
especially against the US

223
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:44,949
on issues like Taiwan and the South China
Sea.

224
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:47,300
If Trump has an aggressive China policy,

225
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,129
Xi may be forced to take a more aggressive
stance

226
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,889
against the US to maintain his position.

227
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,499
Trump has been...unpredictable.

228
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,600
At first,

229
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,990
many thought Trump’s isolationist policies

230
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,009
would pull the US out of Asia

231
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,040
and let China sweep the South China Sea.

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,069
But it’s looking like that’s not going
to happen.

233
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,220
So as we move forward

234
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,019
into the beginning of the Trump Presidency,

235
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,790
may it be huge and everlasting,

236
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,110
what do you think is in store for the US?

237
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,319
And China?

238
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:18,839
Leave your comments below.

239
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,399
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

240
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,500
and you know what,

241
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,740
why the heck not,

242
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,010
one last time!

243
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,340
Thanks, Obama.
