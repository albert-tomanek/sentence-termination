1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Two million people took to the streets of Hong Kong.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,080
They're calling for Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam to resign.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,460
Have these protesters changed the future of Hong Kong?

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,920
This is China Uncensored, I'm Chris Chappell here in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,520
On Saturday, Carrie Lam said the Hong Kong government

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,420
was going to postpone the controversial extradition bill.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,900
But as you can see by the massive protests all around me,

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,600
that may not have been enough for the people of Hong Kong.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,760
What you're looking at is a lot of very, very mad Hong Kongers.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,980
It's over a proposed extradition bill.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,200
If passed, it could allow the Hong Kong government

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,400
to extradite people in Hong Kong

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,480
to mainland China for trial.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,400
And Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive,

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,320
did not seem to understand how upset people were.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,580
This is what she said a day before the protest:

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,220
I feel deep sorrow and regret

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,400
that the deficiencies in our work

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,280
and various other factors

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,340
have stirred up substantial controversies.

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,160
But she didn't stop at that stunning apology.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,960
She also said the Hong Kong government would postpone voting on the extradition bill.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,160
But is that enough for the people of Hong Kong?

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,340
Well, let's ask them!

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,180
Uh, not quite, because

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,240
she still said that people do not understand

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,160
why this bill has to be passed.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,900
But I don't think so.

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,940
I think it is

30
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,660
a difference in value.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,440
I think it's a wise decision to postpone and review the ordinance

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,980
and make more of a social awareness that the people of Hong Kong need.

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,720
Also extremely important, it's the lack of faith in Beijing.

34
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,280
Beijing must show more good faith

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,500
not just to Hong Kong but Taiwan, the Philippines

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,040
and the general neighborhood.

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,020
As you can see, Carrie Lam is kind of screwed.

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,260
Lam had called previous protests over the extradition bill "organized riots."

39
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,080
And called this a very "restrained" response by police.

40
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,380
Police used 150 cans of tear gas in a single night.

41
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,960
By comparison,

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,640
in the entire 79 days of the 2014 umbrella movement,

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,300
they only used 87 cans of tear gas.

44
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,420
I guess Carrie Lam isn't good at saying "stop."

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,360
One of the themes of today's protest was "suspend your mother,"

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
referring to Carrie Lam.

47
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,100
It's sort of a Cantonese pun that invovles lots of swearing.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Any way, protesters were demanding Lam stop labeling the protests as "riots,"

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,780
and release students who were arrested.

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,220
They also wanted her to fully withdraw the extradition bill.

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,400
And, oh yeah, resign.

52
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,340
But since the protest was on Father's Day

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,100
it was also a fun event for the whole family.

54
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,180
Why did you choose to spend your Father's Day like this?

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,880
It's not my choice. It's the government's choice to push us together to do the protesting.

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,800
And I think we're doing the right thing, definitely.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,740
We think this is a good sign to show that we support

58
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,260
the students and the rest of the protesters.

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,180
How do you feel being here with your whole family?

60
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,100
I'm proud of them because I think they understand

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,360
what to do, why they should be here,

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
and what they are fighting for.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,520
It's a nice feeling to be here with my dad

64
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,240
and to know that I'm not the only one

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,900
the only part of my family that agrees with me on these things, these ideals

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,580
Why'd you come out here with your family today?

67
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,200
Because it's important to let the other

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,600
the next generation know about these events.

69
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,820
This law has to be cancelled.

70
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,340
Because I want my next generation to have a better life and more freedom.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
And how do you feel to be here?

72
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,140
I'll interview you again in a couple years.

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,140
Protesters came from all parts of Hong Kong society.

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,900
There were so many of them, they spilled over into other streets.

75
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,220
Organizers said there were almost 2 million protesters.

76
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,820
Double last Sunday's protest.

77
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,740
Hong Kong only has 7 million people.

78
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,420
Which would make this the largest protest in Hong Kong history.

79
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,300
But police said there were just over 300,000 people.

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,760
Maybe the police need some help with counting.

81
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,560
Nobody expected this many people.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,980
And in response to this unprecedented protest,

83
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,560
Carrie Lam issued an apology.

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,620
...written in the third person.

85
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:47,020
"The chief executive apologizes to the public, and promises that she will accept criticism in the most sincere and humble way."

86
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,840
Problem solved...

87
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,620
After one of the biggest protests in Hong Kong history,

88
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,600
clearly, the people of Hong Kong have woken up.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,300
They will not go quietly into that good night.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,140
Well, except for these people. It has been a long day.

91
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,480
Once again, Chris Chappell here in Hong Kong.
