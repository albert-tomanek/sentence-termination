1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,080
Is China run

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,120
By a Transnational Criminal Organization?

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,920
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,240
In China today, there are concentration camps.\h

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,160
Minorities are used for slave\h
labor—after getting forcibly sterilized.\h

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,160
People of faith get their organs\h
harvested in state-run hospitals.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,440
And yet, Wall Street elite keep pushing investment\h
in this same government. Here’s a recent article\h\h

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,840
from JP Morgan Chase, “Focused on opportunities:\h
Why invest in Chinese Government Bonds now?”

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,720
And human rights concerns didn’t stop\h
a major EU-China investment agreement.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
The Chinese Communist Party has\h
repeatedly broken international promises:\h\h

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,880
Like its agreement with the\h
World Trade Organization.\h\h

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
And its agreement with the UK that Hong\h
Kong would get to keep its freedoms.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,720
The problem is, governments\h
and countries around the world\h\h

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,320
treat the Chinese Communist Party\h
like a legitimate government.\h

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,440
But that may change. There’s an effort going on\h
right now to label the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,400
a Transnational Criminal Organization.\h\h

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,840
For more on that, I spoke with Hong Kong\h
businessman and political commentator Elmer\h\h

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
Yuen about how the world can hold the Chinese\h
Communist Party accountable for their actions.\h

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,000
Mr. Yuen, thank you for joining me today.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,160
All right. So thank you for inviting me.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,960
Of course, you initially came to the\h
US to advocate for Hong Kong before\h\h

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
Beijing passed the National Security Law.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,600
Yes.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,800
What do you think of what the\h
US government has done so far\h\h

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
to counter the Chinese Communist\h
Party's actions in Hong Kong?

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,200
When I arrived back in middle of June,\h
they were not really prepared. I mean,\h\h

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,040
[inaudible 00:00:51] spoke a lot\h
about standing with Hong Kong,\h\h

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,240
but that's only words. In action, they are totally\h
unprepared, and the overall, the State Department,\h\h

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:18,720
as you know, is not very anti-China at all, they\h
are pro-China overall, over the years. It's always\h\h

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,680
been, they, after most of these guys retire,\h
they look to have some business with China.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,680
China is a big business market. So\h
anyway, nobody's quite prepared,\h\h

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,240
and it's more spoken support instead of\h\h

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,920
action. I hear these words about measured\h
response against China, against CCP.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,320
You've proposed that the US government\h
should label the Chinese Communist\h\h

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,320
Party as a transnational criminal\h
organization. What does that mean?

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,800
Everybody says China is a big country, big nation.\h
In fact, the nation itself, the word, "Nation,"\h\h

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:07,040
is really a facade. In essence, it's the CCP in\h
total control, complete control. It's really not a\h\h

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,800
nation. Almost behind every government official or\h
even behind every business, even small business,\h\h

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:23,920
you can see the CCP controlling behind. As you\h
know, China has over 90 million CCP members,\h\h

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,440
over 90 million. Then you have lots\h
of young people after kindergarten,\h\h

41
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:38,080
they start joining this Young Pioneers. So,\h
yet they have unlimited supply of a very\h\h

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,200
well educated, the best they have, the\h
brightest they have, to join the party.\h\h

43
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,440
So overall, the CCP is very much like\h
the mafia, the mafia organization, right?

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,520
On top, you have about 50 families, very\h
powerful families, from the Long March,\h\h

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,640
or from the high officials. We call them The\h
Red, second generation or third generation,\h\h

46
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:14,160
and then The Official, second or third generation.\h
They have accumulated huge amount of wealth.

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,360
As you can see in all the major cities, the\h
most expensive apartments or properties,\h\h

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,040
bought up by them, the prime real estate.\h\h

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,000
They have been using companies, shell companies,\h
investing in all kinds of Fortune 500 companies.

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,400
You don't know them, because they use company\h
name. So they are really controlling this\h\h

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,880
company behind the scene, and also working\h
with them. All right, China is working with\h\h

52
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,040
all of these big corporations on the\h
surface. So this, as you can see.\h\h

53
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,960
But the control behind the back, the equity\h
control is something people don't talk about.

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,160
So this is the organization, 50 families,\h
90 million members, which are like gangs in\h\h

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:07,040
the mafia. Then they have 1.3 trillion people to\h
exploit. Very much like, you remember the New York\h\h

56
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,640
movies? You have the mafia families, and then you\h
have the gangsters, and then you have the people\h\h

57
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,280
on the street, that they go and collect protection\h
money. Very much, that's the system. It works.\h\h

58
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,440
So the word, "Nation," it's really, we always\h
consider it as nation, as the legal nation. So\h\h

59
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,760
we deal with them, with the policy, and then make\h
contracts with them. Then the British ruled this,\h\h

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,160
Sino-British Joint Declaration, about\h
Hong Kong, treating them like a nation.

61
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,640
But as you know, criminals have no understanding\h
of law, right? The minute they can break, they\h\h

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,920
will break. As long as they are making money, they\h
let it go on, and as long as they don't make any\h\h

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:56,160
money, they will break the contract, any contract.\h
So Hong Kong is a typical example. They find that\h\h

64
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,840
Hong Kong people want too much freedom,\h
rule of law and democracy, so they have\h\h

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,560
decided to take over Hong Kong. And then forget\h
about the Joint Declaration, British-Chinese\h\h

66
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,680
declaration. So they've decided to do that, and\h
suddenly Hong Kong become part of China. So Donald\h\h

67
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,840
Trump says, "It's no longer a one country, two\h
system, it's become one country, one system."

68
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,400
So what happened to me, I've really not been\h
involved with politics. I realized, but I know all\h\h

69
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,280
about China, because I deal with every level of\h
them. I lived in China 20 years, I live in US 20\h\h

70
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,640
years and Hong Kong 20 years. So I know all these\h
countries quite well. So I've decided I know what\h\h

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,880
all the crimes they've committed in the last\h
71 years, where the People's Republic of China,\h\h

72
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,000
they named the country, which is really not, they\h
don't respect it. There's no people, you never see\h\h

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,640
the people. It's not a Republic, and it's really\h
not Chinese culture. What they are exercising,\h\h

74
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:05,440
is very much like the Soviet, no, even more\h
closer to the Fascist-behavior. Chinese are not\h\h

75
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,280
Fascism, even though we have emperors, but\h
the emperor normally leaves the people alone.

76
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:19,360
So, anyway, I decided to come to expose\h
their crimes. Over, I mean, at least 70\h\h

77
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:29,200
million people died of abnormal death, since 1949,\h
from starvation, from cultural revolution, people\h\h

78
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:38,160
committing suicide and all kinds of political\h
struggle. Every family has been, has suffered\h\h

79
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,920
from the political persecution. So I\h
decided to come to the States, to lobby\h\h

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,400
your Congress about the Chinese being a criminal\h
organization. In the beginning, I was thinking\h\h

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,160
about using the RICO law. I'm sure you know about\h
the RICO law against a gangster. And which means\h\h

82
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:06,080
every party member is in fact, the criminal,\h
if you belong to this criminal organization.\h\h

83
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,320
Then we discovered, there's even a better law,\h
called the Transnational Criminal Organization.\h\h

84
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,200
They use that law against South American drug\h
cartels, and also use it against the Hezbollah.

85
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,760
And of course, China is a much bigger scale of\h
criminal organization, so that suits very well. So\h\h

86
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,840
we have Congressman Scott Perry, he is combining\h
three different laws. One is the transnational\h\h

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,560
criminal organization, one is the RICO and\h
also as you know, there was old McCarthy law,\h\h

88
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,080
the Communist Control Act. So he's combining all\h
three, and he is trying to legislate and designate\h\h

89
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:59,760
the CCP as the TCO, and also a RICO, violation\h
of the RICO and the Communist Act. These laws are\h\h

90
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,120
already in place, so we don't need to go through\h
legislation. It's only a matter of designation.

91
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,400
Well, so practically speaking, what\h
would it mean for the international\h\h

92
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,560
community and businesses if the CCP\h
were labeled a criminal organization?

93
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,760
If you are a businessman, would you sign\h
a contract with a criminal organization?

94
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,520
Would you sign a contract with a\h
mafia organization? It's exactly that.\h\h

95
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,600
I wouldn't even shake hands. If you're normally in\h
US, a legitimate company, you normally have your\h\h

96
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,240
lawyer to check the other side, to see how good\h
is it? The minute you discover it's a criminal\h\h

97
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,600
organization, no executive in their right\h
mind would sign a contract or even negotiate.\h\h

98
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,400
So suddenly you have to isolate it. You force\h
them, takes time, right? You force them to give up\h\h

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,360
this CCP and become a normal country. This is\h
in long-term, this is what I expect. But step\h\h

100
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,440
number one, you must label them, because\h
most people don't know. They think, "Oh,\h\h

101
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to China. It's a huge market, 1.4\h
billion people. I can make a lot of money."

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,640
That's everybody. Same thing with the\h
Ivy League or the professor, "Oh, Chinese\h\h

103
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,440
great culture. They are inviting me there,\h
pay for my tickets and hotel, everything."\h\h

104
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,920
And then, "Oh, I must go. There's is a lot to\h
study. And I can write paper and write books."\h\h

105
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,200
This is what happened to the corporatists, to\h
Hollywood, "Wow, how can I let go of 1.4 billion\h\h

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,760
movie tickets, for a good movie?"\h
So all NBA, everybody, is really,\h\h

107
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,240
they thought about this huge market and forgot who\h
they are dealing with. They're not dealing with\h\h

108
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,000
the people, they're dealing with the communist\h
party. That is the problem. So I want to label\h\h

109
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,760
them. So people are aware of who they are dealing\h
with. Criminals, they're dealing with criminals.

110
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,280
It's very important, and you cannot expect them\h
to keep their promise. In the end, they will\h\h

111
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,800
do anything, because criminals obviously have no\h
sense of law. They will do anything, for their own\h\h

112
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,560
good. And communism means they want to take over\h
all the private ownership. Global, not only China,\h\h

113
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,240
global, that's what One Belt, One Road. That's\h
why they're in US. They have infiltrated, almost\h\h

114
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,600
everything, including your White House,\h
your state department and your presidency.

115
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,200
So you were basically saying that the US should\h
sanction the entire Chinese Communist Party?\h\h

116
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
But the CCP is already fighting US sanctions by\h\h

117
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
saying that if international\h
companies follow US sanctions,\h\h

118
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,800
they're going to get in trouble in China. So\h
does that mean US sanctions wouldn't work.

119
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,040
You'll have to decouple with them,\h
and forget about the near-term profit,\h\h

120
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,840
honestly. Because if you still want to do\h
business with them, then the trouble would\h\h

121
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:01,600
never end. Right now, of course, if you look at\h
Wall Street and Silicon Valley and Hollywood,\h\h

122
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,960
NBA, and the Ivy leagues, they love to do business\h
with China, right? Because China treat them well,\h\h

123
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,520
they know how to take care of them. So\h
they don't want to cut off. But in reality,\h\h

124
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,480
we know we've been dealing with them,\h
from Hong Kong, we know how they behave.\h\h

125
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:28,160
They always win, in the end, they always win. So\h
I believe that you have to decouple with them, and\h\h

126
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,120
not only US, the whole world has to isolate them\h
and make sure they change back to a normal nation.

127
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,960
Then you can deal with them, China\h
business will be five times better,\h\h

128
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,840
if you're dealing with a normal nation. Right now,\h
they're stealing your technology, they're stealing\h\h

129
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,120
everything. And they have very cheap labor,\h
cheap land and cheap executive. So they can\h\h

130
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,920
undercut the price. Basically you can't\h
compete with that. They have the mass,\h\h

131
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,600
they have their domestic market to have\h
the scale, economy of scale. So in a way,\h\h

132
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,280
you cannot compete with them fairly,\h
unless they become private enterprises.

133
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,080
So you're arguing that it is\h
in the economic interest of\h\h

134
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,800
the international community, Hollywood, Wall\h
Street, to actually view China, the Chinese\h\h

135
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,440
Communist Party as a criminal organization?\h
That that is in the long run, better for them?

136
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,880
In the long run, but I think people should also\h
try to understand the evilness of this whole\h\h

137
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,640
regime of this party and that what's happening in\h
Xinjiang is more serious than what the Nazis have\h\h

138
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,640
done to the Jews, more serious in Xinjiang.\h
And people can also compare Hong Kong now,\h\h

139
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,160
with Hong Kong before. Everybody loves\h
Hong Kong, whoever has been to Hong Kong,\h\h

140
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,480
they love Hong Kong. Now suddenly you can talk\h
to any Hong Kong people coming out of Hong Kong,\h\h

141
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,160
and they will tell you, "It's disaster." It's\h
basically, it's like taken over by the fascists,\h\h

142
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,200
and that they are arresting people. They don't\h
go by the law, they give them whatever sentence\h\h

143
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,280
they want, and they don't care about the charges.\h
Suddenly our whole ecosystem is out of the window.

144
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,640
Well, thank you very much for joining me today,\h
Mr. Yuen, it's a fascinating thing to try and\h\h

145
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,560
label the Chinese Communist Party as\h
a transnational criminal organization.

146
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,880
As they understand more about CCP, and as the\h
personal damage from the COVID and economics,\h\h

147
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,040
and also the cyber-warfare that they are\h
attacking US, I think, I hope people will wake up\h\h

148
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,120
and it takes time. It may take time, but\h
this is what they are. Thank you, Chris.

149
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,520
Thank you.

150
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,360
And thank you for watching. Do you think the\h
CCP should be labeled a Transnational Criminal\h\h

151
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:57,840
Organization? Let me know in the comments below.\h
Once again I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
