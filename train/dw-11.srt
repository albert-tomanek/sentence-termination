1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,389
These are dramatic images.

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,570
Images that cause fear and panic: This video
was watched on Telegram and Twitter tens of

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,009
thousands of times.

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:15,209
The dam named Wuppertalsperre is said to have
broken.

5
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:16,610
But that is false.

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,070
I'm standing in front of the dam and as you
can see it is not broken.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,490
The video actually shows a flooded mine in
Inden, more than 100 kilometers from here.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,739
There were reports of other broken dams as
well but most of them were wrong.

9
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,760
This was the case in Sinzig.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,440
The fire brigade had to drive through the
town and calm people down.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,300
Even the police were warning online against
the fake messages.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,019
And that despite the catastrophe being bad
enough already.

13
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:56,870
More than 170 people lost their lives in Germany
alone.

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,399
Many more are still missing, and the damage
is in the millions.

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,250
The fake news caused further damage.

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,420
It panicked people and stirred up anger.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,050
We will show you some examples but above all
how to spot them.

18
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,580
For example, this image that went viral on
social media.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,610
A car is drowning in the floods, and in the
back window there is a sticker with a curse

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,530
word directed at Greta Thunberg.

21
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,890
If you look closely, you can see the image
is manipulated.

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,260
While zooming in, the sticker looks odd.

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,450
A reverse image search reveals the truth.

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,210
The photograph was originally published in
the German newspaper BILD – without a sticker

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,630
on the car.

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,530
Photographer David Young confirms: the sticker
is a fake.

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,710
Many people were fooled by it, even a big
environmental protection movement.

28
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,310
So be careful with the content you share.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,890
Many were speechless in this case: A fake
police car was making its rounds through the

30
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,910
flooded area.

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,790
We could locate the area: Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,439
A lot has been destroyed there, and in the
chaos of the situation many confused the car

33
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,200
for a real police team.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,629
It made announcements that the number of rescue
workers were being reduced.

35
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:23,060
False, as was confirmed by the police in Koblenz.

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,549
According to our research there are several
such fake police cars in Germany.

37
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:31,940
And these appear again and again in connection
with the lateral thinker scenes in Germany,

38
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,709
which is actually known for protests against
the COVID restrictions.

39
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:44,250
Or the case of the hydroelectric power station
Braunau-Simbach at the Austrian-German border.

40
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,400
Here a user was claiming that all the locks
had been opened and masses of water were flowing

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,990
towards the southern German city of Passau.

42
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,450
Misleading.

43
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,549
The video actually does show the hydroelectric
power station Braunau-Simbach.

44
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,999
The clip reached a lot of people on Telegram
– and caused worry.

45
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:09,030
But fact is, the hydroelectric power station
does not have the function of a dam.

46
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,680
In case of rising water level, the water just
has to flow through it.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,330
So, the locks were not just opened recklessly
in this case.

48
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:30,129
"The tidal wave was not getting stronger.

49
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:36,599
For the city of Passau the situation was not
getting worse".

50
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,099
And these fakes even went a step further:
With calls for donations, imposters misused

51
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,420
the willingness to help by the population.

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Unfortunately, some were wrong.

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
"The Cologne police have opened an investigation
against suspected fraudsters.

54
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,430
They allegedly copied the photo of a user
affected by the floods from Facebook and misused

55
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,150
it for their own purposes and asked for donations."

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,129
So how do we know if a call for donation is
trustworthy?

57
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:05,840
Watch out for an official stamp of approval,
like this one in Germany.

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,230
And also look at the person and organization
very carefully.

59
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,529
Have you spotted fakes regarding the flooding
in Germany?
