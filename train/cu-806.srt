1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,960
who knew selling out could feel so cheap?

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,740
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,080
The Chinese regime just held

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,900
its annual World Internet Conference.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,900
This year’s theme was

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,439
“Developing digital economy

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,130
for openness and shared benefits—

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,739
building a community of common future in cyberspace.”

11
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:28,099
I’m sure it made a great float.

12
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:29,099
And if you were lucky enough

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,919
to make it past the “tight security checkpoints

14
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,480
with facial recognition” technology,

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,780
the “Chinese armed police”,

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,180
and the ever-present glow of

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,870
“the red lights of closed-circuit cameras”,
plus whatever these guys were ready for,

18
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,870
you would have experienced

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,250
all the joys of openness

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,100
China’s internet has to offer.

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,690
Mainly because the conference had special
wifi

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,620
that let attendees jump over the firewall

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,850
and access the real Internet.

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,500
Yes, the country ranked worst in the world

25
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,010
for Internet freedom three years running

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,420
knows a thing or two about openness.

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,360
Why, just ask the keynote speaker,

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,390
Tim Cook!

29
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,820
Yes, the CEO of your beloved Apple said,

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,810
“The theme of this conference—

31
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,150
developing a digital economy

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,190
for openness and shared benefits—

33
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,400
is a vision we at Apple share.”

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
I wonder if maybe he wandered

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,030
into the wrong conference.

36
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,800
Because a little later in the day,

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,940
one of the most powerful men in China,

38
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,480
“called for more aggressive

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,530
government involvement online

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,640
to combat terrorism and criminals.”

41
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,520
And yes,

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
he wants China’s internet regulations

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
to extend beyond China’s borders.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,790
Now I know, you’re shocked.

45
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,950
Not that Tim Cook praised

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,580
the world’s most internet-censored nation.

47
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,580
After all,

48
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,369
Apple has spent the past few years

49
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,479
desperately trying to grab a piece of the
China market

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,100
by bending over backwards for the Chinese
regime—

51
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,590
doing things like banning the New York Times
app,

52
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,970
removing VPNs,

53
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,330
even briefly blocking the China Uncensored

54
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,730
Apple TV app.

55
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,540
No, you’re probably shocked that there weren’t
more

56
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,869
Western tech giants there

57
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,550
doing some good old fashioned bootlicking.

58
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,950
Well, no need to worry.

59
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,660
They were there.

60
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,360
And not just Apple and Google.

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,750
The vice president of Facebook

62
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,990
was there as well.

63
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,040
He said,

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,069
“I’d compliment the Chinese government

65
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,700
in terms of leadership on using data.”

66
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,780
I bet you would.

67
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,980
As Reuters put it,

68
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,880
“The tacit endorsement of the event

69
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,450
by top U.S. tech executives

70
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,860
comes as China introduces strict new rules

71
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,160
on censorship and data storage.”

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
Does this all seem a little hypocritical?

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,610
Well, it wasn’t lost on Chinese netizens
either.

74
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,660
They came up with fun phrases to

75
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,690
describe-slash-mock the World Internet Conference,

76
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,320
like: “World 404 Conference,”

77
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
“World Satire Conference,”

78
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,360
and “Beggars Conference.”

79
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,239
Wow, those are really good!

80
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,700
Chinese netizens are on it.

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,230
I wish I had come up with some of those.

82
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,720
The CCP, of course,

83
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,410
did not think netizens were so clever.

84
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,050
They issued a censorship directive

85
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,530
to stop Internet users from talking about

86
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,580
the Internet conference.

87
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,510
“Intercept, find, and delete content attacking

88
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,500
the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen

89
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,360
on interactive platforms such as Weibo, blogs

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,860
public WeChat accounts,

91
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,600
forums, and bulletin boards.”

92
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,520
Now the Chinese regime’s goal

93
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,200
is not to censor the Internet

94
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,430
in the rest of the world.

95
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,050
At least not right away.

96
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,099
What it wants is the rest of the world,

97
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,760
including its tech leaders,

98
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,629
buying into the China model—

99
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,770
where governments have the right

100
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,280
to police the Internet within their countries

101
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,080
however they feel fit.

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,260
Each country will rule

103
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,390
its own mini Internet,

104
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,760
and the idea of a free and open Internet

105
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
will be history.

106
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,680
It’s called internet sovereignty.

107
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,160
And they’ll use Chinese software

108
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,920
and Chinese firewall methods to do it.

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,350
Because as everyone knows,

110
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,879
the Internet has been part of Chinese territory

111
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,940
since ancient times.

112
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,560
What do you think about China’s plans

113
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,440
and how the Western tech world is responding?

114

Leave your comments below.

115
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

116
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,460
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

117
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,860
See you next time.

118
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,520
So, umm, since Google owns YouTube,

119
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,800
and Google is trying to make nice with China
again,

120
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,880
maybe you should head on over to ChinaUncensored.tv.

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,360
