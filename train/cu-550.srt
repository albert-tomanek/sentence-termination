1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,250
Chinese citizens are boycotting Xinjiang cotton

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,700
But not for the reasons you think

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:15,020
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,030
Over the last couple of years, the world has
finally started speaking out against the Chinese

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,040
Communist Party’s treatment of the Uyghurs.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,560
Including the concentration camps, the forced
labor, and oh yeah, the genocide.\h

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,730
Two weeks ago, both the US and the EU imposed
sanctions on China over the treatment of Uyghur

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,600
Muslims.\h

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,470
And now that Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang
is in the spotlight, international companies

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,470
are also responding.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,830
Especially the world’s apparel brands.\h

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,370
That’s because “The region [of Xinjiang]
accounts for 85% of China’s and 20% of the

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,920
world’s cotton...and it is ‘very likely’
that any cotton from Xinjiang may involve

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,629
coerced labour.”

15
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,960
Fashion companies don’t want to be caught
selling slave-labor cotton.

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,310
That look is so 1860s.

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,870
That’s why organizations like the Better
Cotton Initiative started pulling out of Xinjiang

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,070
last year.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,220
And companies like Under Armour implemented
controls to guard against cotton from Xinjiang

20
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,780
being used in their products.\h

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,180
Last September, H&M announced it was cutting
ties with their Chinese supplier because of

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,860
accusations of forced labor in Xinjiang.\h

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,920
And in January, one of the Trump administration’s
last China-related policies was a total ban

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,729
on cotton produced in Xinjiang.\h

25
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,850
As a result, “a multibillion-dollar supply
chain splintered almost overnight over a human

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,460
rights issue.”

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,320
Which is a good thing.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,850
Unless you’re the Chinese Communist Party.

29
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,270
Because the whole genociding the Uyghurs thing
is starting to become a problem for the Party.

30
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,409
I mean, they’re not going to stop the genocide.

31
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,580
But what they really want is to be able to
commit genocide quietly, while the rest of

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,879
the world ignores what’s happening.\h

33
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,409
That worked for them so well before with Falun
Gong!

34
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:19,879
But now with the Uyghurs, foreign governments
and companies are starting to acknowledge

35
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,489
what’s happening and even worse, take action
against it.

36
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:29,310
The Chinese regime can’t let itself become
a pariah state, like Iran or North Korea.\h

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,620
So if you’re an authoritarian regime looking
to punish foreign companies for making you

38
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,669
look bad, what do you do?

39
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:41,840
I’ll tell you after the break.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,480
Welcome back.

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,370
So the Chinese Communist Party had an image
problem.

42
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,519
But they found the solution: nationalism!\h

43
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,499
Yes, Chinese state-run media has managed to
turn this Xinjiang cotton ban to their advantage,

44
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:59,359
by using Chinese nationalism.

45
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:05,249
They did this by portraying the rejection
of Xinjiang cotton as an insult to the Chinese

46
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,010
people.

47
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,499
It started with this Weibo post from the official
account of the Communist Youth League.

48
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:19,329
It says “Trying to make money in China while
spreading rumors and boycotting Xinjiang cotton,

49
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,510
wishful thinking!”\h

50
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,620
Separately, the Communist Youth League posted
a picture of black slaves working on a US

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,599
cotton plantation.\h

52
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,249
This would become the two prongs of the Chinese
propaganda attack: foreign brands are lying

53
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:42,950
and hurting the feelings of the Chinese people,
and America is the country with slaves.\h

54
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,290
And this message spread through both the propaganda
apparatus and directly through the Chinese

55
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,290
government.

56
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,559
Here’s state-run Xinhua News Agency, publishing
a cartoon about the Better Cotton Initiative

57
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:57,519
being a puppet of the US.

58
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,730
And Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying
even brought a picture of black slaves picking

59
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,239
cotton to show at her daily press conference.

60
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,730
Within hours of the first Communist Youth
League post, it became a full nationalistic

61
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,310
blowout online.

62
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,220
Because it wouldn’t be a mass campaign if
the masses didn’t get involved.\h

63
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,980
Chinese fashion designers talked about how
much they loved Xinjiang cotton.

64
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,020
More than 30 Chinese stars rushed to cut ties
with brands that had stopped using Xinjiang

65
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,210
cotton.\h

66
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,840
The celebrities shared this post that reads
“I support Xinjiang Cotton.”

67
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,699
Mian Hua is Cotton in Chinese.

68
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:47,820
Notice how the M and H are the M and H in
H&M.

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,090
I guess saying you support Xinjiang cotton
sounds a lot better than saying you support

70
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,240
Xinjiang genocide.\h

71
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,080
Anyway, Television shows that were set to
air had to be changed at the last minute,

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,979
with several episodes showing actors with
blurred out shoes!\h

73
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:12,849
This screenshot is from the trailer of a TV
episode set to release last week

74
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:16,360
And this is a screenshot from when the episode
aired.

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,550
Yup.

76
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,080
No Prada here!

77
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,610
Yeah, they actually pulled a Stalin on fashion
brands—airbrushing out the undesirables.

78
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,969
These brands practically stopped existing
in China.\h

79
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:37,860
You can’t even find an H&M store, because
they no longer appear on China’s map apps.

80
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,840
H&M has even been removed from Apple Maps
in China.

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,430
So H&M is just gone.

82
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,460
Cancelled.

83
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,870
Memory-holed.

84
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,569
Like it never even existed.\h

85
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:52,169
And it didn’t end there.

86
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,999
Rappers even released diss tracks against
these fashion brands.

87
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:59,610
“Nike Fxxk\h
Adidas Shit

88
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,580
China So Dope”

89
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,039
Pure poetry.\h

90
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,160
But the point is, hating Nike is hip!

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,490
I say Nike, you say Stupid, Nike, Stupid,
Nike, Stupid!)

92
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,689
Remember, if you don’t hate foreign brands
with all your guts, then you’re not really

93
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:21,669
Chinese!

94
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,870
Videos of people burning their Nike shoes
became a trend...

95
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,749
because their love burns for China.

96
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,229
Ripping up shirts has also gone viral.

97
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,060
“You’re Tshirt so sexy a”

98
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:46,969
Hold on, aren’t these products they’re
ripping up and burning Made in China?

99
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:52,759
But there are also concerns that all of this
performative patriotism could go too far.\h

100
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,380
Here’s a video of customers storming and
trashing Nike store inventory.

101
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,460
And this video shows a woman taking her voice
to the streets with a sign that reads “I

102
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,150
support Xinjiang cotton, Boycott H&M”.

103
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:20,520
And the security officers had a hard time
diffusing the public disturbance.

104
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,290
In the end they just grabbed her and took
her away.

105
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,430
“Everyone should join me and support Xinjiang
cotton!”

106
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,999
“Ok, ok, Support support!”

107
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,319
People have also been harassing people who
work for these stores.

108
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,990
Like this person who told an H&M worker to
quit their job because they’re selling out

109
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,229
China.\h

110
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,419
￼
And people also harassed store staff on live

111
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,419
streams.

112
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,849
Flooding the live chat with comments like\h
“Cut The Stream”, “Quit”, “Get Out

113
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,279
of China”.\h

114
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,370
The good news is it hasn’t gotten as bad
as the anti-Japan protests back in 2012, that

115
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,650
caused 100 million dollars in damage.

116
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,370
But I wouldn’t want you to think that all
Chinese people are joining in the anger.

117
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,999
Some actually said things like, “don’t
just support Xinjiang cotton, support Xinjiang

118
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,069
people.”

119
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,439
Those people had their accounts banned.

120
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,770
Which is yet another reminder of how the Chinese
Communist Party is always watching.

121
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,229
“According to tests conducted by China Digital
Times, internet platforms have been diligently

122
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:33,450
controlling search results and comments related
to Xinjiang and H&M since last week.”

123
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:40,360
As I mentioned earlier, brands like H&M announced
they were not using Xinjiang cotton last fall.

124
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,070
So why is the Chinese regime encouraging this
outraged behavior now?\h

125
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:53,720
Well, it probably has something to do with
how the US, Canada, the EU, and UK are sanctioning

126
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,370
Chinese officials over Xinjiang.

127
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,680
In addition to directly retaliating against
these countries, the Chinese Communist Party

128
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,730
is trying to punish foreign companies economically.

129
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,190
Because that’s always worked before.\h

130
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,190
And don’t forget, while there might be genuine
patriotic rage going on, it’s being orchestrated

131
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,470
by the Party.\h

132
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,740
“After the Communist Youth League ignited
the outrage on Wednesday, other government-backed

133
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,120
groups and state news outlets fanned the flames.”

134
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,681
They’re literally triggering people in order
to foment this kind of anger.

135
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,500
And they’re really good at it.\h

136
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,510
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent

137
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,399
Army, fans who support the show on Patreon.

138
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:48,680
Hungry Hunter asks, “Question: What is holding
back the USA and others to also build bases

139
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,370
on these islands?

140
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,470
If I were the Philippines, I would ask other
nations for a 10 year plan to build tons of

141
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,510
bases there just to piss China off.

142
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,540
What they gonna do?

143
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,050
Complain in the UN that will have to punish
them too?

144
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,290
Wow, Hungry Hunter, you might have just come
up with an amazing solution to the South China

145
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,009
Sea dispute.

146
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,050
Or possibly the beginning of World War 3.\h

147
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:18,779
If you don’t know, China claims the entire
South China Sea as Chinese territory, with

148
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,010
their Nine Dash Line.

149
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,800
And to bolster that claim, they’ve been
building artificial islands and establishing

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,050
settlements on them, including these 7 reefs
in the Spratlys.

151
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,680
Some of those islands now have missile launchers
on them.

152
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,050
And even though the UN has told China to stop,
they just ignore that.\h

153
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,410
So what if all the other countries in the
region just got together and agreed to do

154
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,709
the same?

155
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:51,100
Or in the case of the Philippines, lease it
out to the US to build missiles on?

156
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,480
Beat the Chinese Communist Party at its own
game.\h

157
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,800
