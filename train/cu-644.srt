00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,829
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,160
I would not have wanted to be in China this
week.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,320
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,260
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,460
Super typhoon Mangkhut hit Southeast Asia
earlier this week.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,320
First, it devastated parts of the Philippines,

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,570
leaving more than 80 people dead and dozens
missing.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,570
Then the storm passed through Hong Kong

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,660
and the nearby Chinese city of Shenzhen,

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,469
where at least 5 people were killed.

11
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,249
Destruction is everywhere.

12
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,409
And this natural disaster has also left behind

13
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:42,309
a destructive trail of...vertical video.

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,899
But at least we have images of

15
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,489
some of the worst devastation as it was happening.

16
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,270
Like this giant crane falling off

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,940
the top of a skyscraper under construction.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,379
The footage from this Category 5 typhoon is
mind blowing.

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,499
Here’s another crane, this time swinging
around and...

20
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:01,069
barely missing the window.

21
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:05,390
Yeah, the winds were a little on the strong
side.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,320
Strong enough to take down anyone attempting
to venture outside.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,049
Including the poor food delivery guy.

24
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:17,259
Ok, what kind of a jerk orders delivery during
a typhoon!?

25
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,700
On the plus side, it looks like that jerk
won’t be getting any food.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,409
Even the toilets weren’t safe from the typhoon.

27
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:29,000
And boy am I glad I wasn’t staying at the
Sheraton in Shenzhen.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,609
At least this one’s not vertical video.

29
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:32,609
As you can see,

30
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,700
a lot of people’s homes and businesses in
the Philippines

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,049
and China have been destroyed.

32
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,530
So be sure to keep the people in the typhoon’s
path

33
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,590
in your thoughts and prayers.

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,740
And before we go,

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,969
it’s time when I answer a questions from
a Patreon supporter—

36
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:48,850
someone who contributes a dollar or more per
episode

37
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,130
to keep this show going.

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,440
Coralline Algae asks,

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,840
“A few years ago there were many news stories

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,369
about more male babies being born than female
babies.

41
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,430
It was reported that this caused difficulty

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,590
for some Chinese men looking to find a wife.

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,270
Is this still an ongoing problem?

44
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,049
Has it been getting worse,

45
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,229
or was the issue overblown by western media?

46
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,989
No, that’s a real problem.

47
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,350
“Out of China’s population of 1.4 billion,

48
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,879
there are nearly 34 million more males than
females –

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,040
more than the entire population of Malaysia.”

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,870
And this is a problem for many reasons.

51
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,430
When you have that many single young men,

52
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,740
often who also struggle to earn a basic income,

53
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,560
well, the situation is ripe for violence.

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,689
It’s also fueling sex trafficking from other
parts of Asia.

55
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,710
That’s why China earned the spot

56
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,890
of one of the world’s worst human trafficking
offenders,

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,299
according to the US State Department.

58
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,629
There are actually lots of issues

59
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,519
that the Chinese Communist Party’s “family
planning” policies

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,640
have caused, so many that it could be an entire
episode.

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,879
