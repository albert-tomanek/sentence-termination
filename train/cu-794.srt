00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,190
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,790
The Chinese military has landed this bomber
plane

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,380
in the South China Sea.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,080
And China’s neighbors are not happy.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,580
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,889
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:17,840
The South China Sea.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,830
More than 5 trillion dollars worth of trade

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,330
flows through here each year.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,330
And underneath,

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,550
there’s an estimated 11 billion barrels
of oil to tap.

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,260
No wonder it’s a powder keg—

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,410
or oil barrel—

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,989
of competing territorial claims.

15
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,770
But not to worry,

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,219
because the People’s Liberation Army Air
Force

17
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,379
has just landed one of its state-of-the-art

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,499
nuclear-capable long-range bombers

19
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:47,000
on a disputed island deep in the South China
Sea.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,690
China’s Ministry of Defense said they were
practicing

21
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,769
simulated air attacks.

22
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,409
Because practice makes perfect.

23
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:55,590
And with the move,

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,059
“Beijing’s annexation of the South China
Sea

25
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,739
appears complete,”

26
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:02,480
without firing a single shot.

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,509
At least according to News.com.au,

28
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,380
which is owned by News Corp.

29
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,090
They also say the move is

30
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,439
a “clear signal that Beijing considers

31
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,780
its ownership of the contested waterways

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,740
and illegally-reclaimed islands

33
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,250
complete and uncontested”.

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,939
Although I have to say...uncontested?

35
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,800
A lot of countries are still contesting

36
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,689
the Chinese regime’s claims.

37
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,790
Just not very effectively.

38
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,060
Anyway, last Friday the Chinese air force
released

39
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,810
this video of its newest heavy bomber

40
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,950
landing and taking off from Woody Island.

41
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,700
Woody Island is one of the natural islands

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,200
that make up the Paracel island chain.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
It’s also... contested.

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,109
Both Taiwan and Vietnam lay claim to it,

45
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,109
but clearly,

46
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:47,140
it’s occupied and militarized

47
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,549
by the People’s Republic of China.

48
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,140
Openly turning Woody into a military outpost

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,920
for long-range bombers is an important step

50
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,249
in the Chinese Communist Party’s takeover

51
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,350
of the South China Sea.

52
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,210
See this nine-dash line?

53
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,740
The Communist Party says everything inside
it

54
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,330
belongs to them.

55
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,710
An international arbitration court disagrees,

56
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,810
but the Communist Party can just ignore

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,350
a court decision it doesn’t like.

58
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,970
They’ve built artificial islands on coral
reefs

59
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,709
and tidal rocky outcrops,

60
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,459
then turned these islands

61
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,370
into weaponized fortresses.

62
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,269
It’s just like playing Fortnite.

63
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,550
Well, minus the monsters.

64
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,620
Wait a second...I know what’s going on.

65
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,819
The whole reason the Communist Party

66
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,010
is militarizing the South China Sea

67
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,670
is to stop giant monsters from invading China!

68
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,720
It makes sense.

69
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,150
As we know from this historical documentary,

70
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,560
giant monsters once tried to invade China

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
from across the Great Wall

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,680
during the Song Dynasty.

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,390
True story.

74
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,890
But while giant monsters may be a serious
threat,

75
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,530
Xi Jinping had actually promised in 2015

76
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,260
that China would not militarize the islands.

77
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,720
But you can’t see his hands!

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,040
His fingers are definitely crossed.

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,920
Now, three years later,

80
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,280
the only thing missing from the Chinese military’s

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,269
total domination of the South China Sea,

82
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,860
in the words of US Admiral Philip Davidson,

83
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,660
is “deployed forces.”

84
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,320
But that may be approaching soon.

85
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,590
The Chinese military deployed their first
missiles

86
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,150
a few weeks ago in the South China Sea.

87
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,659
And now these warplanes on Woody Island

88
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,780
change everything.

89
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,700
I guess Missiles for Peace was so successful,

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,530
they decided to start Bombers for Peace too.

91
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,700
Don’t worry,

92
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,329
I’m sure they’re just defensive bombers.

93
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,980
But with facilities that can handle bomber
planes,

94
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,110
the Chinese military is now capable of challenging

95
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,600
any of its neighbors in the region.

96
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,890
And “any forces deployed to the islands

97
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,510
would easily overwhelm the military forces

98
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,670
of any other South China Sea-claimants.”

99
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,780
And the capability to launch long-range

100
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,049
military operations from Woody Island

101
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,400
means China’s military reach extends

102
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,130
way beyond the nine dash line.

103
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,330
How far?

104
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,219
China’s less advanced combat bombers

105
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,969
can reach all five Philippine military bases

106
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,519
where the US military has troops and facilities.

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,750
And China’s new top-of-the-line H-6K bomber

108
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
that just landed on Woody Island

109
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,579
has a range of more than 2,000 miles.

110
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,270
So the Chinese military now has most of Southeast
Asia

111
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,280
within combat flight range.

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,060
Defensive combat flight range, obviously.

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,460
And that’s just the beginning,

114
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,020
according to the Asia Maritime Transparency
Initiative.

115
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,210
They say the military base on Woody Island

116
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,280
is a blueprint for other land formations further
south.

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
In particular,

118
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,740
the islands China built on top of three contested
reefs:

119
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,180
the Subi Reef, Mischief Reef, and Fiery Cross
Reefs,

120
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,740
part of the Spratly Island archipelago.

121
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,150
Satellite images of the reefs

122
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,960
already show airfields and hangers

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,000
that “can accommodate bombers like the H-6
series.”

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,060
And from there,

125
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,620
China’s combat planes could potentially
reach

126
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,000
northern Australia and the US island of Guam.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,940
That’s why the White House has some thoughts
about this.

128
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,860
“We’re well aware of China’s militarization
of the South China Sea.

129
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,400
We’ve raised concerns directly with the
Chinese about this.

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,060
And there will be near-term and long-term
consequences.”

131
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,960
But the “Chinese don’t fear they are provoking
a crisis,"

132
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,229
says Bonnie Glaser, director of the China
Power Project

133
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,690
at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington...

134
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,370
...because the US has already lost

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,910
its “capability to shape events” in the
South China Sea.

136
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,210
Since obviously we don’t want to have

137
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,280
a full-on war with China...

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
Right?

139
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,729
There’s just one hope, says Admiral Davidson:

140
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,199
Recovering a technological advantage.

141
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,889
“Hypersonic and directed energy weapons,

142
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,650
resilient space, cyber and network-capabilities,”

143
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,720
he says, “will be crucial to our ability
to fight and win.”

144
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,389
So if there’s a war,

145
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,069
it will be fought with hypersonic and energy
weapons.

146
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:05,410
Welcome to our dystopian future.

147
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,410
And until then,

148
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,280
the Chinese military will probably continue

149
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,729
to build up its own capacity.

150
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,200
And on that happy note,

151
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,650
it’s time for a question from one of our
fans

152
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,370
who supports China Uncensored

153
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,940
through our Patreon website.

154
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,540
Jonathan Swanberg asks:

155
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,940
“How afraid should you/we be

156
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,449
that China is focusing on creating AI

157
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,220
without the necessary oversight?

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,880
Like are we talking terminator level scared?”

159
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,200
Oh Jonathan,

160
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,849
we should be Terminator 2 level scared.

161
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,080
Because China doesn’t approach science

162
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,050
in the way most countries around the world
do.

163
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,830
Take the United States for example.

164
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,460
The public has a say.

165
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,140
There’s debate online and in the media.

166
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,940
That means moral considerations are taken
into account.

167
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,949
The Communist Party doesn’t work that way.

168
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,539
It doesn’t have to answer to anyone.

169
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,639
And what it does for the sake of short term
control

170
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,340
could have long term consequences.

171
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,740
Elon Musk has made the point that

172
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,419
any evil dictator will eventually die.

173
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,620
But AI could create an immortal dictator.

174
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,880
So, in the Communist Party’s rush to create
AI,

175
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,000
we may all end up slaves to the machines.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,020
And really, would that be so bad?

177
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Remember, you can leave your questions for
me, too.

the Chinese military’s expansion in the
South China Sea

182
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400

China Uncensored is supported mainly through

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
contributions from viewers like you.

189
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
Without our viewer support,

190
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,379
we’d have to stop the show.

191
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,110
