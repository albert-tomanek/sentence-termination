00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,850
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,389
it’s the 100-year anniversary

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:04,920
of the Bolshevik Revolution!

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,770
Let’s have a Party!

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,870
A Communist Party.

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,770
Leave your money at home, though.

7
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,450
Also your means of production.

8
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,540
Really, anything you want to keep.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,890
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,289
The relentless March of History carries on.

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,980
Until it reaches its inevitable end with Communism.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,980
Or Democracy.

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,960
I’m pretty sure it’s one of those.

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,999
Or robot domination.

16
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,380
OK, it's definitely one of those three.

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,940
So...communism, as we all know,

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,239
has been a smashing success.

19
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,739
Well, maybe not in any of these places.

20
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,200
But at least in these places.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,719
Yes, visit beautiful North Korea!

22
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,339
You’ll never leave.

23
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:54,629
Seriously, you might not be allowed to leave.

24
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,760
So communism:

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
a smashing success.

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,469
At least if you’re talking about smashing
stuff.

27
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,789
Anyway, 2017 marks the 100-year anniversary

28
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,670
of the Bolshevik Revolution,

29
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,860
the first Communist uprising

30
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,770
that didn’t immediately fail.

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,869
In fact, it led to the creation

32
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,619
of the Soviet Union,

33
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:17,759
which took a full 70 years to fail.

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,780
Nonetheless, there are still some

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,689
who wonder whether communism can

36
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,880
“rise like a phoenix from the ash heap of
history.”

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,970
In looking back at communist history,

38
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,509
this opinion article conveniently omits

39
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,170
the death and destruction that

40
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,829
happened under communism,

41
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,649
while wondering whether it can have a rebirth.

42
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:37,649


43
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,179
You know, not like the old gulag kind of communism.

44
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,609
But a new, cool communism.

45
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,180
I think that article came out the same week

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,619
the New York Times Style section featured

47
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,060
the “Return of the Mullet.”

48
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,810
So in honor of the momentous 100-year anniversary

49
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,999
of Russia’s Bolshevik Revolution,

50
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:57,180
let’s take a look back at some of the things

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,119
that the New York Times Opinion Section

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,340
so quickly glossed over—

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,729
with a brief history of the Communist Party.

54
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,600
Marx and the Origins of Communism

55
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,729
The ideas of communism

56
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,360
can be traced back a long time.

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,170
But communism as we know it today

58
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,120
began in 1848 with the Communist Manifesto,

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,220
written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

60
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,810
The original hipsters.

61
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,330
Just look at those beards.

62
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,530
Karl Marx saw history from the perspective

63
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,080
of a 19th century European man.

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,850
Namely, he didn’t like Mexicans.

65
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,350
Or Black people.

66
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,600
Or Jews.

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,450
Least woke hipster ever.

68
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,580
Anyway, in the Communist Manifesto,

69
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,680
Marx and Engels—

70
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,450
Um, this Marx and Engels—

71
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,680
laid out their ideas for a heaven on earth
where,

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,210
“Communism abolishes eternal truths,

73
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,780
it abolishes all religion,

74
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,860
and all morality.”

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,930
Abolishing morality!

76
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,930
Great!

77
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,790
Now we can all club baby seals again!

78
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,980
I mean, for the first time!

79
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,020
I mean, nooo…

80
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,640
The Paris Commune

81
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,730
Karl Marx thought it was only a matter of
time

82
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,180
before the workers of the world would unite,

83
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,180
tear down society,

84
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,600
and establish communism the world over.

85
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
And obviously hoist him and his ideas up

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,430
on a pedestal.

87
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,130
Uhh, an equal pedestal!

88
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,820
But nothing happened.

89
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,760
For 23 years.

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,300
The first uprising that even remotely resembled

91
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,280
what Marx and Engels were talking about

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,310
was the Paris Commune of 1871.

93
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,750
Marxists.org describes it as

94
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,670
“the first successful workers revolution.”

95
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,880
It lasted all of 10 weeks.

96
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,920
Even Firefly lasted longer than that!

97
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,270
But in those 10 weeks,

98
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,920
the communist insurrection was very productive.

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,890
They killed tons of people,

100
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,430
burned down a quarter of Paris,

101
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,710
and destroyed countless artistic treasures.

102
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,130
Though at least the smoke covered up

103
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,730
Paris's urine smell.

104
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,150
And like Firefly,

105
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,880
this brief season of communism

106
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,750
gained a small cult following.

107
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,230
The Soviet Union

108
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,250
One of communism's early fanboys

109
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,940
was the guy who started Communist Russia.

110
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Lennon.

111
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,690
Um, this Lenin.

112
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,190
Although Back in the U.S.S.R. was a great
song.

113
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,190
In 1917,

114
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,760
the Russian Czar was overthrown

115
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,910
in the February Revolution.

116
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,130
Then eight months later,

117
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,370
that government was overthrown

118
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,370
by the Bolshevik Revolution,

119
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,250
led by Lenin.

120
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,820
This Lenin.

121
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,150
Lenin also began the Red Terror,

122
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,030
a campaign of mass murder and torture

123
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,970
that killed up to 1.5 million people.

124
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,310
What's that, Shelley?

125
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,060
What do you mean, I have to hurry it up?

126
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,330
Yes, I know this is a brief history.

127
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,940
Ok so Lenin killed a bunch of people and stole
their stuff.

128
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,090
Then he died.

129
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,420
Then Stalin took over.

130
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,220
He invented the gulag system of forced labor
camps,

131
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,740
killed like 20 million people,

132
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,690
and stole way more stuff.

133
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,130
Then he died.

134
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,290
Then these guys ran the country for a while.

135
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,520
Meanwhile, there was an arms race,

136
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
a space race,

137
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,490
and the golden age of James Bond movies.

138
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,490
After World War II,

139
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,420
the Soviets set up communist governments

140
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,270
in satellite states like Poland and East Germany.

141
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,840
I see, no time for Poland.

142
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
What about East Germany?

143
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Too bad, the Stasi did some really weird stuff.

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,200
Ok, then the Soviets also helped start

145
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,050
a bunch of Marxist-Leninist revolutions

146
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,360
in Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Borat parts
of Asia.

147
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,370
Anyway, eventually the guy with the thing
on his face

148
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,440
came to power,

149
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,650
David Hasselhoff sang a song on the Berlin
Wall,

150
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,150
and the Soviet Union collapsed.

151
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,940
And when the Soviet Union fell,

152
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
so did the rest of the Soviet bloc.

153
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,950
Like Nirvana, after Kurt Cobain.

154
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,460
Moving on to Asia.

155
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,630
The People’s Republic of China

156
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,660
After sitting out most of World War II,

157
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,460
the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong

158
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,740
was in a prime position to “liberate”
the war-ravaged country

159
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,350
from the ruling Nationalist Party.

160
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,180
Mao set out to prove how good of a communist
he was

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,400
by killing way more people than anyone, ever.

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,440
And taking their stuff.

163
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,110
And then he died.

164
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,110
After that,

165
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,110
the Chinese Communist Party realized

166
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,600
it should also fix China’s economy,

167
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,710
or what was left of it.

168
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,180
So it gradually added some capitalist things
back in.

169
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,200
And then the Communist Party reformed.

170
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
See?

171
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,980
According to state-run media,

172
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,100
the soldiers were just getting

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,520
moo shu pork delivery.

174
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,050
So the Communist Party ditched communism.

175
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,770
Well, just the economic parts.

176
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,449
They kept the heart of communism:

177
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,550
mass surveillance, labor camps, brainwashing,

178
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,820
corruption, and of course—

179
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,250
lots and lots of killing.

180
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,700
Even today in China,

181
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,730
you can be tortured to death for doing this.

182
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,730
Or this.

183
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,850
Or this.

184
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,020
But hey,

185
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,370
why worry about that when your business

186
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,190
can make money there?!

187
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,419
Just don’t pray for profits.

188
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:16,610
Speaking of no profits…

189
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,870
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea

190
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,170
Following World War II,

191
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,220
the Americans and the Soviets split Korea

192
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,730
along an arbitrary straight line.

193
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,120
But the North and South had some... disagreements.

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,390
They eventually resolved them by

195
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,710
turning the straight border into a squiggly
border.

196
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,000
5 million deaths later.

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,980
North Korea is officially run by the Workers'
Party,

198
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,090
but it's actually run by a bizarre cult

199
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,639
that surrounds the Kim family.

200
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,360
Like Kim Jong-Il.

201
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,580
According to his official biography,

202
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,680
he wrote six full operas that

203
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,340
“are better than any in the history of music.”

204
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,919
Unfortunately not available on iTunes.

205
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,060
North Korea is also the second happiest

206
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,080
country on Earth,

207
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,810
right behind China.

208
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,090
That’s according to North Korea,

209
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,090
which calls itself the

210
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,250
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea—

211
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,270
a country where men can choose between

212
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,330
10 officially approved hairstyles.

213
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,960
Ah, the world of choice.

214
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,389
Khmer Rouge

215
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,330
Next in our brief history: The Khmer Rouge.

216
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,270
Not a film by Baz Luhrmann.

217
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,380
The Khmer Rouge was the communist regime

218
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,709
that carried out the Cambodian Genocide

219
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,749
in the 1970s.

220
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,029
It did not have any good songs.

221
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,360
Pole pot—um, this Pol Pot —

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,079
is the guy who ran the Khmer Rouge.

223
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,970
And he was a huge fanboy of Mao Zedong.

224
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,519
“Oh my gosh, I just want to say,

225
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,920
I loved your Great Leap Forward.

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,110
It was killer.”

227
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,579
And Pol Pot followed Mao’s example.

228
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,180
In just four years,

229
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,819
his regime killed 2 million people.

230
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:04,589
That’s a quarter of Cambodia’s population.

231
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:07,170
He especially targeted people who wore glasses,

232
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,220
or spoke a foreign language,

233
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,610
or smiled too much.

234
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,930
Wow, he sounds like a psychopathic

235
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,369
high school bully.

236
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,730
Did steal their lunch money too?

237
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,550
Yeah, probably.

238
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,170
Luckily for the remaining three-quarters of
Cambodia,

239
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,880
the Khmer Rouge government was toppled

240
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
after just four years,

241
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,220
when Cambodia was invaded by

242
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,560
the next country on our list.

243
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,340
Communist Vietnam:

244
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,559
Optimistically called the Democratic Republic
of Vietnam.

245
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,519
It was formed by the communist revolutionary

246
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,339
Ho Chi Minh in 1945.

247
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,220
After nearly a decade of war,

248
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,610
he and his army finally defeated the French,

249
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,220
stole their baguettes,

250
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,810
and made some amazing sandwiches.

251
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,889
Ho Chi Minh doesn’t get nearly enough credit

252
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,869
for his accomplishments.

253
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,110
In particular, he’s responsible for the
deaths

254
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,660
of about 2 million Vietnamese.

255
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,639
Meanwhile, the US decided that it had so much fun

256
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,089
in the Korean War,

257
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,069
it wanted to do a spin-off in Vietnam.

258
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,490
But in a surprise twist,

259
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,980
this Communist north eventually conquered
the south.

260
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,850
It was a horrible tragedy,

261
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,389
but it did provide an iconic scene for Miss
Saigon.

262
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,199
Next up, Laos.

263
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,180
Never mind, we don't have time for Laos.

264
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,949
Moving along.

265
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:24,949
Cuba

266
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,320
Cuba, you’ve got some ’splaining to do.

267
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,540
In 1959,

268
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,829
the US government initially supported the
coup

269
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,540
by Fidel Castro and the guy from the T-shirt.

270
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,939
But like a bad date,

271
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:40,899
the US soon realized it should not have swiped
right

272
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,689
on Castro.

273
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,930
So the US tried to overthrow him.

274
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,259
And failed.

275
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,819
Eventually the CIA gave up.

276
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:50,819
Just kidding.

277
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,389
They tried to assassinate Castro like 600
times.

278
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,119
At different times, they attempted to poison

279
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,310
Castro's milkshakes,

280
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,310
his face cream,

281
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,660
and his handkerchief.

282
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,369
They even hatched a plan to make his beard
fall out

283
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:04,480
so people wouldn't take him seriously."

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Really?

285
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
The beard?

286
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,209
That’s low, even for the CIA.

287
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,869
Oh, and there was that time when the Soviets

288
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,459
tried to install nuclear missiles in Cuba,

289
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:16,199
and the world almost ended.

290
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,629
It didn’t, but the premise made an iconic
scene

291
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:21,600
for Planet of the Apes.

292
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,100
Over the last 60-plus years,

293
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,519
Cuba has not been particularly kind to its
own citizens.

294
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
But somehow, this T-shirt of a mass-murdering
communist

295
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,619
is still super popular.

296
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:33,749
Buy it now on Amazon.com!

297
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:36,410
Ironically, it’s not free.

298
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,149
And speaking of Che Guevara,

299
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,499
in Latin America…ah forget it.

300
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,240
And now, today…

301
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
At this point,

302
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,589
communist governments have mostly gone

303
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,720
the way of the dinosaurs.

304
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,879
But like dinosaurs,

305
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,129
there are people today who find them

306
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,619
immensely fascinating.

307
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:56,619
All over the world,

308
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:58,309
there are registered Communist parties.

309
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,329
You’ll meet people who say things like,

310
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,300
“Well Communism is great, man,

311
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,689
it’s just never been done right before.

312
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,089
If we could just do it without killing 100
million people,

313
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,040
it’d be totally awesome!”

314
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Which is why,

315
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,869
to celebrate the aforementioned 100th anniversary

316
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,660
of the Bolshevik Revolution,

317
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,319
China Uncensored will be making a special

318
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,400
series of videos taking a look back at all
the

319
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,769
“awesome” memories we have of Communism.

320
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:28,550
So will communism “rise like a phoenix

321
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,960
from the ash heap of history”?

322
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
And if it does, how will the world respond?

323
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,560
I have one idea.

324
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,040
Thanks for watching this, um,

325
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,740
brief history of the Communist Party.

326
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,730
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

327
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,000
See you next time.
