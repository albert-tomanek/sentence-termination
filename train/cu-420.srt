1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,760
China’s vast commercial fishing fleet

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,769
Plunders the oceans

3
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:07,410
And wrecks local economies

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,710
And it’s all part of the plan

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:18,990
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,820
This episode is sponsored by MOVA Globes.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,120
These are really amazing globes that spin
on their own—without cords or batteries.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,210
And whether you get this Black and Silver
model...

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,730
...or one of the other great world map designs—you
can appreciate the beauty of continents and

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,190
the vastness of the oceans.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,710
Ocean life is essential to the ecology of
the planet.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,469
Unfortunately, humanity has been destroying
the oceans—and one of the big culprits is

13
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,370
overfishing from commercial vessels.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,810
No country understands this better than China.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,350
China has fishing vessels spread across the
world.

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,720
Not just in the South China Sea, but also
in Africa and South America.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,950
And China is truly number one…

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,520
...on the index of Illegal, Unreported, and
Unregulated fishing.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,250
This is from the Global Initiative Against
Transnational Organized Crime.

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,450
China is also number one in that its distant-water
fishing fleet is by far the largest in the

21
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:28,260
world—with an estimated 17,000 vessels,
according to the British Overseas Development

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,920
Institute.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,100
And at least 183 vessels in China’s fleet
are suspected of involvement in Illegal, Unreported,

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
and Unregulated fishing.

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,549
And that’s just the ones we know about.

26
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,770
It’s extremely hard to track and monitor
what China’s fishing fleet is doing globally.

27
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,340
They often turn off transponders.

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,270
They don’t fill out mandated log records.

29
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,299
They create fake joint ventures with local
boats.

30
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,700
. Or they fly another country’s flag—called
a “flag of convenience”.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,000
What I’m saying is that the Chinese Communist
Party has Fish Pirates.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,119
No, not like that.

33
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,849
Actually, in some ways, it’s more like a
fish mafia.

34
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,250
Because China’s commercial fishing in a
lot of parts of the world amounts to organized

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,309
crime.

36
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:23,260
It dominates fishing off the coast of many
developing countries, stripping locals of

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,660
their economic livelihood.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,900
The trail of environmental destrustruction
in its wake...is just a bonus.

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,099
Here are just a few examples.

40
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,620
In the African country of Mozambique,

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,299
locals have relied on fishing to survive for
centuries.

42
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,189
But now, Chinese commercial boats are dominating.

43
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:51,310
In 2017, the Chinese effectively took over
a major port, doubling its capacity so it

44
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,209
could accommodate over 100 trawlers.

45
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,040
You might think, great, Chinese investment
is expanding local fishing capacity!

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,309
But they’re not doing it for the locals.

47
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:11,269
Since 2017, Chinese trawlers have caught more
than 60,000 tons of fish a year in the area.

48
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:17,089
This extreme overfishing depletes the adult
fish, so there aren’t as many fish born

49
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:18,980
the next season.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,889
On top of that, trawlers wreck the sea bed,
making it harder to support the ecosystem

51
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,969
that fish need.

52
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:31,459
Chinese boats in Mozambique have simply pillaged
the waters.

53
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,569
Local fisherman are seeing their fish stocks
dwindle.

54
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,299
Why is the leadership of Mozambique allowing
Chinese ships to do this?

55
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,939
It’s hard to say.

56
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,239
In unrelated news, Mozambique's president
has been caught up in a massive corruption

57
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,790
scandal—involving 2 billion dollars that
was supposed to pay for a coastal-protection

58
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,819
system and a local fishing fleet.

59
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,779
More after the break.

60
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,779
Welcome back.

61
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,889
Let’s move on to The Gambia.

62
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:04,109
That’s right, it’s called THE Gambia.

63
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:09,319
Ian Urbina , director of The Outlaw Ocean
Project , joined a team that was inspecting

64
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,449
potential illegal fishing off the Gambian
coast.

65
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,150
They boarded this Chinese trawler.

66
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:23,509
It had 7 Chinese officers on board, plus a
crew of 39—all Africans, most of them below

67
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,330
deck on a dirty, cramped production line.

68
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,449
The Gambian Navy lieutenant he was with discovered
the Chinese ship’s fishing log book was

69
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,110
blank.

70
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,071
All captains are required to keep records
of where they go, how long they work, what

71
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,060
gear they use, and what they catch.

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,689
Not having those records makes it harder for
scientists to survey fish stocks.

73
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:54,130
Also in the Gambia, a microbiologist found
in 2017 that Golden Lead, a Chinese-owned

74
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,680
fishmeal plant, was dumping waste into this
local lagoon.

75
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,469
Which, by the way, is not supposed to be this
color.

76
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:08,349
“The water [in the lagoon] contained double
the amount of arsenic and 40 times the amount

77
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,409
of phosphates and nitrates deemed safe.”

78
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:14,569
Similar problems are happening in neighboring
Senegal.

79
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:21,610
The state-owned China National Fisheries Company
“jointly” owns 12 Senegalese-flagged vessels

80
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,590
but in fact owns 100% of the shares.

81
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,919
That suggests China takes home the majority
of the profits.

82
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,130
But it’s not just about sucking out profit.

83
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,800
It’s about illegal activities depleting
fish stocks.

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,449
And “failing to hold true owners to account
prevents the dismantling of networks behind

85
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,830
illegal fishing operations.”

86
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,669
Over in Ghana…

87
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:51,810
Chinese companies have manipulated records
by using local front companies to get fishing

88
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,810
licenses.

89
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,740
“Ghanaian law requires that all trawlers
operating in its waters are owned by Ghanaians,

90
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,599
but right now there are more than 100 Chinese
trawlers plundering waters normally fished

91
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,340
by local boats.”

92
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,270
Each Chinese trawler can catch up to 26 tons
of fish in a day.

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,419
That’s 400 times more than a local boat
can bring in.

94
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,849
According to the Environmental Justice Foundation,
at least 90% of the trawler fleet in Ghana’s

95
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,590
waters is actually Chinese-owned.

96
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,719
This is despite the fact that Ghana forbids
foreign ownership of trawlers.

97
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,229
Surely local officials know what’s going
on.

98
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:35,710
So why aren’t they stopping it?

99
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,120
It’s hard to say.

100
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,289
In unrelated news, Ghana loses 3 billion dollars
to corruption each year.

101
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,960
Over in Latin America, it’s not much better.

102
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,229
China is rapidly expanding its maritime presence
there.

103
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:55,770
Back in 2001, there were only 22 Chinese squid
fishing vessels in the region.

104
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,539
By 2019 there were more than 500.

105
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:02,810
You’d be surprised at how many people really
want to eat squid.

106
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,879
China’s South Atlantic fishing fleet is
based in Montevideo, the capital and main

107
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,030
port of Uruguay.

108
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,930
According to Milko Schvartzman of Greenpeace
, “absolutely no real controls are made

109
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,620
of any foreign fishing boat” there.

110
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,300
And “[China] effectively created a... pirate
port in Montevideo.”

111
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,650
Again, they’re not the fun kind of pirates.

112
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:30,280
They’re the kind that destroys local fish
habitats and sometimes enslaves their crew.

113
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,729
To get more squid.

114
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:34,520
Now let’s look at Peru.

115
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,690
The president of the Humboldt Squid Committee
of the South Pacific estimates “that the

116
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:47,229
Chinese fleet may be illegally fishing 50,000
tonnes of [squid] in Peruvian waters every

117
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,229
year.”

118
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,379
This represents 85 million US dollars a year.

119
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:54,400
Of squid.

120
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,419
People really love squid.

121
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,580
But just wait till we get to Chinese fishing
in the Galápagos Islands.

122
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,219
More after the break.

123
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,910
Welcome back.

124
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,449
Off the coast of Ecuador lie the Galápagos
Islands—famously visited by Charles Darwin

125
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,680
nearly 200 years ago.

126
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,479
The area is home to rich and unique sea life.

127
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,949
That’s why Ecuador designated the area a
protected marine reserve in 1998.

128
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,110
But to unscrupulous Chinese fishing companies,
it’s a bonanza!

129
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:33,339
Last year, an armada of more than 300 Chinese
vessels was caught plundering the waters around

130
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:35,050
the Galápagos.

131
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,270
Ecuador said that almost half of the vessels
turned off their transponders.

132
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,070
What were they fishing?

133
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,789
You guessed it.

134
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,990
Squid.

135
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,580
Chinese fishermen also love catching sharks—just
for the fins that get used in soup.

136
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,790
Back in 2017, the Ecuadorian Navy stopped
a Chinese ship carrying more than 5,000 sharks,

137
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,550
including newborns and endangered species.

138
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:08,779
In 2020, authorities in Hong Kong seized 26
tons of shark fins from Ecuador, equivalent

139
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,040
to thirty-eight and a half thousand sharks.

140
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,320
Now that all sounds pretty bad.

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,339
But don’t worry, because according to Reuters,
“China has promised a ‘zero tolerance’

142
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,720
policy toward illegal fishing.”

143
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,560
Which sounds good.

144
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,660
Because around the world, “China’s fishing
fleet appears engaged, often illegally, in

145
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,850
the effort to haul in as much seafood as it
can, as fast as it can, in as many places

146
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,510
as it can—with little regard for how its
practices affect malnourished people or diminish

147
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,820
the stocks of their fish.”

148
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,449
But the Chinese government’s ‘zero tolerance’
policy is actually a lie.

149
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:51,130
What a surprise.

150
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,010
In fact, it’s a worse lie than you think
it is.

151
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,400
Because all this global illegal fishing is
not simply the Chinese government’s negligence,

152
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,810
or refusing to crack down on it.

153
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,180
No, the Chinese government is specifically
backing it.

154
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,490
“It is government policy, because most vessels
are in effect paid to fish by the Chinese

155
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,600
government, which covers the fleet’s main
operating expense: fuel.”

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,529
China spends 5.9 billion dollars each year
subsidizing fuel.

157
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:34,779
“That’s about 347,000 dollars per vessel
per year, far more than any other major fishing

158
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:35,779
country.”

159
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:41,730
To put that into perspective, “European
Union vessels, also considered highly subsidized,

160
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,800
receive only about 23,000 dollars a year.”

161
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,820
So why is the Chinese government subsidizing
all of this illegal and environmentally destructive

162
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,850
fishing?

163
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,360
Is it because Xi Jinping is auditioning for
the role of evil villian in the next Captain

164
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Planet reboot?

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,709
Maybe.

166
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,670
But there are other—more likely—reasons,
too.

167
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,950
One is, China needs seafood.

168
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,670
China already consumes more seafood than any
other country, and it’s on track to consume

169
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,850
38% of all global fish by 2030.

170
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,980
China’s own coastal waters were once the
richest in the world.

171
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,970
Now, they’ve been depleted by more than
85% after decades of overfishing.

172
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,270
But the Chinese Communist Party also has a
political reason for these distant-water fishing

173
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,100
fleets: to establish its maritime claims.

174
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,449
Especially in the South China Sea.

175
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,480
For the Chinese fishing vessels in those disputed
waters, some of them are normal, subsidized

176
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
fishermen.

177
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,690
But others are part of China’s maritime
militia, “which means they never fish—they

178
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,700
just use fishing boats to monitor other fleets,
run supplies, or ram other boats.”

179
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,300
That’s certainly what’s happening in places
like the Spratly Islands.

180
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,700
We covered that in this recent episode of
China Uncensored.

181
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,320
Chinese fishing boats there are just occupying
territory until the military can build another

182
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,819
island.

183
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,360
Is that what’s happening in other parts
of the world?

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
No.

185
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,329
Or at least...not yet.

186
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:22,520
For now, they’re just depleting fish populations,
impoverishing local economies, and destroying

187
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,480
ecosystems for decades to come.

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,459
China is certainly not the only country involved
in damaging and illegal commercial fishing.

189
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:36,899
But it’s by far the biggest, with the most
wide-ranging economic and environmental impact.

190
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,550
Like I said, China number one.

191
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,380
So as you celebrate Earth Day this week, let
people know what the Chinese Communist Party

192
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,850
is doing—so we can protect our oceans.

193
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,470
And speaking of protecting the oceans, this
episode has been sponsored by MOVA Globes.

194
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,920
I’ve talked about MOVA Globes before.

195
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,779
I love the technology.

196
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,090
It spins automatically, powered by ambient
sunlight.

197
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,660
When you pick it up, it keeps spinning.

198
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,130
And when you put it back on its base, it corrects
its motion.

199
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,610
MOVA has dozens of other cool designs, too.
