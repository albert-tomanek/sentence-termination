1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,150
China has more than a billion people...

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,670
And Communist Party officials came up with
a brilliant plan...

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,080
to use them to make money.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,770
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,080
The People’s Republic of China has the world’s
second biggest economy.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,250
It wasn’t always like that.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,240
But over the last several decades,

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,869
Chinese communist officials have gotten really
good at making money.

10
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:30,869
See, back in the 1950s,

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,550
Chairman Mao Zedong told his officials

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,109
to kill rich people and take their stuff.

13
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,809
But that only went so far, because eventually,

14
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:40,089
China ran out of rich people to kill.

15
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,699
So in the early 2000s,

16
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:44,679
three-legged money toad and Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:47,539
led a brilliant new scheme.

18
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,479
It combined the best elements of communism

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,659
AND cut-throat capitalism:

20
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,550
Kill *dissidents,* and take their *organs.*

21
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,710
And then sell those organs to rich people
at state-run hospitals,

22
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,889
like this one.

23
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:04,420
And it turns out that you can make some *serious*
money this way.

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,390
You know, they say you can’t put a value
on human life.

25
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,600
But in communist China, that value is up to
$852,000.

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,049
Now this money-making scheme looks too horrible
to be true.

27
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,310
And that’s one reason why people don’t
believe it’s happening.

28
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,270
But the proof keeps coming out.

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,939
There have been investigations into organ
harvesting since 2006.

30
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,009
But they didn’t get much attention.

31
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,289
Then a group called the China Tribunal

32
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:34,149
held a series of hearings about it starting
in 2018.

33
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:36,219
They asked for evidence and testimony

34
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,490
on whether forced organ harvesting was happening
in China.

35
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,840
And in particular, they looked at whether
Falun Gong practitioners

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,659
and Uighurs were being targeted.

37
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,619
Falun Gong is based on an ancient Chinese
spiritual practice.

38
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,210
It has exercises that look a bit like Tai-Chi.

39
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,479
And its core philosophy is “Truthfulness,
Compassion, and Tolerance.”

40
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,409
Falun Gong became super popular in China in
the 1990s,

41
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,109
until Jiang Zemin realized there were like
100 million people practicing.

42
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,969
And so he remedied that with this.

43
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:07,969
And this.

44
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,259
And this.

45
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,209
Take that “Compassion”!

46
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,349
The Uighurs are a Turkic ethnic minority

47
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,629
who live mostly in China’s far west Xinjiang
region.

48
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,930
There are about 10 million Uighurs,

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,790
and they’re mostly Muslim.

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,010
Islam is unrelated to Falun Gong spiritually.

51
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,319
But from the Communist Party’s perspective,

52
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,350
it’s the same problem:

53
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,840
There are lots of Uighurs,

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,060
and they believe in something other than the
Comminist Party.

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,080
So the Party remedied that with this:

56
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,340
Concentration camps.

57
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,370
I bring that up because on March 1, 2020,

58
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,140
the China Tribunal issued a final judgment

59
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,909
about whether the Chinese regime organ harvesting

60
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,650
from these two groups of people: Falun Gong
and Uighurs.

61
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,970
It came after two long years of personal testimony

62
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,220
and pouring through evidence.

63
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,200
And long hearings that practically nobody
watched...

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,530
...and statements hardly anyone read about

65
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,409
because Western media like the New York Times

66
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:05,890
were too busy getting paid by Chinese state-run
media

67
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,209
to run advertisements that look like articles.

68
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,079
Anyway, on March 1,

69
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:16,540
the China Tribunal issued this 562-page Judgement

70
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,599
that *we* read through so you don’t have
to.

71
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,300
It concluded, among other things,

72
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,939
that “Forced organ harvesting has happened
in multiple places

73
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,860
in the [People’s Republic of China]

74
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,409
and on multiple occasions for a period of
at least 20 years...

75
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,540
AND continues to this day.”

76
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,590
It says the victims are mostly Falun Gong
practitioners.

77
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,340
And that Uighurs are also sometimes victims,

78
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,439
and could be China’s living organ bank for
the future.

79
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,900
That’s the Chinese Communist Party for you.

80
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,480
Always thinking ahead.

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,599
It finally makes sense why Chinese authorities

82
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,400
have been collecting DNA from all the residents
of Xinjiang.

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
I’ll note, by the way,

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,010
that the China Tribunal was led by a panel
of 7 experts

85
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,599
from several countries.

86
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,819
It was chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice.

87
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,099
He’s the attorney who led the prosecution

88
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,519
of the former Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević

89
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,439
for war crimes back in the 1990s.

90
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,049
And none of the people on the panel

91
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,859
were Falun Gong practitioners or Uighurs.

92
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,310
Nor were any of them YouTube celebrities

93
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,230
who could have told them that nobody wants

94
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,290
to read a 562-page report about mass murder!

95
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,480
So I’ll just give you the highlights of
the mass murder.

96
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,310
Here are some of the reasons the China Tribunal

97
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,520
concluded that the Chinese Communist Party

98
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,720
really is killing people for their organs.

99
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,210
One: There are extraordinarily short waiting
times for organs.

100
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,010
You can literally schedule an organ transplant
in two weeks,

101
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,430
to take place on a certain day.

102
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,990
In America, you might wait months or years
for some guy

103
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,410
to die in a motorcycle crash.

104
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,950
In China, the doctors just kill him for you.

105
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,990
Two: The Communist party routinely tortures

106
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,030
Falun Gong practitioners and Uighurs.

107
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,300
It’s not a big leap from torturing people
to simply killing them.

108
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,130
And if you also sell their organs,

109
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,150
it’s a great way to make money.

110
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,880
Three: China built a massive organ transplant
infrastructure

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,410
starting in 2001.

112
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,870
That’s when the number of annual transplants
began to boom.

113
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,600
So they were building new hospitals and training
new transplant doctors...

114
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,620
but China didn’t create its *voluntary*
organ donation system until 2010.

115
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,610
So... that’s super weird.

116
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,930
And even today,

117
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,020
there are very few voluntary organ donors
in China.

118
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,310
And that’s tied to number four:

119
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,990
Chinese authorities don’t execute enough
criminals

120
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,840
to account for the number of transplants.

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,170
The data suggests that Chinese hospitals

122
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,990
do between 60,000 and 100,000 organ transplants
per year.

123
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,830
But China only carries out fewer than

124
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,670
4,000 court-ordered death sentences each year.

125
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,320
So: There aren’t enough criminals to execute,

126
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,160
and China’s voluntary organ system only
started nine years

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,240
after the transplant boom,

128
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,630
and is still really small.

129
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,760
That leads to only one conclusion:

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,620
Chinese hospitals have been killing

131
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,200
tens of thousands of additional people every
year

132
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,150
who aren’t criminals OR voluntary donors.

133
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,540
The China Tribunal did, by the way,

134
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,930
invite the Chinese government to join in

135
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,320
and present their own testimony.

136
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,130
The Chinese government did not respond

137
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,200
at any point during the two years.

138
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,010
But one of the interesting things about having
a formal,

139
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,220
open process like the China Tribunal is that
it’s a forum

140
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,450
for people to submit testimony,

141
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,610
who otherwise might not have their voices
heard.

142
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,350
One person who submitted testimony was Didi
Kirsten Tatlow—

143
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,270
a former New York Times reporter.

144
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,520
Tatlow had tried to do a series of investigations

145
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,340
into China’s forced organ harvesting—

146
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,460
but her editors shut her down.

147
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,300
As a New York Times reporter in 2016,

148
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,150
she was invited to an event held at Beijing
Hospital,

149
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,210
where state health officials talked about

150
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,080
China’s organ donation program.

151
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,200
Over lunch, she overheard a conversation

152
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,060
between two Chinese transplant doctors,

153
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,290
which suggested they were being told they

154
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,280
could no longer use prisoners of conscience
for organ harvesting.

155
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,550
But when she told her editors she wanted to
investigate further,

156
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,220
and do a series of stories about Chinese hospitals

157
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,730
using prisoners of conscience for organ translpants,

158
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,070
it became clear to her that

159
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,770
“the issue was unwelcome” at the New York
Times.

160
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,340
Now on top of the conclusions from the China
Tribunal,

161
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,440
there’s this very long, very detailed,

162
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,630
and frankly kind of boring report published
last November

163
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,730
in a fancy peer-reviewed medical journal.

164
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,630
It says “a variety of evidence points to
what the authors believe

165
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,880
can only be plausibly explained by systematic
falsification

166
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,820
and manipulation of official organ transplant
datasets in China.”

167
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,900
And that “[This] is often incentivized by
large cash payments.”

168
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,120
And you wonder why forced organ harvesting

169
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,490
isn’t getting much media attention.

170
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,220
All the smart people who research this stuff

171
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,710
make it sound super complicated.

172
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,750
So let me put it simply—

173
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,220
because this video is not made for just graduate
school students:

174
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,740
The Chinese Communist Party is lying about
the data.

175
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,040
They’re killing people for their organs.

176
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,240
And they’re making lots of money.

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
And if you think,

178
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,669
“Maybe this stuff happened before,

179
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,050
but it couldn’t possibly still be happening,”

180
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,450
consider this:

181
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,089
even amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak,

182
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,720
Chinese hospitals are still doing suspicious
organ transplants.

183
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,189
“The CCP ask for applause for its double
lung transplant on a coronavirus victim.

184
00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:00,009
But the fact that two matching lungs were
found in a few days

185
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:03,600
raises new suspicions of organ harvesting.”

186
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,510
So at this point, there’s really no other
conclusion you can make.

187
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,860
Unless you’re the New York Times,

188
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,379
and just quash the reporting.

189
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,379
So what do you think?

190
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,689
Leave your comments below.

191
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:16,500
And now I’ll answer a question from one
of our Patreon supporters

192
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,050
who contributes so we can keep making episodes
like this.

193
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,900
Mike Murphy asks:

194
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,350
“President Trump issued an edict that all
Covid-19 information

195
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,560
be channeled through Mike Pence.

196
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,810
Mr Pence advocates prayer power as one defense
tactic.

197
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,689
Will you consider creating a YouTube channel

198
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:37,079
called USA Uncensored?”

199
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,339
Thanks for your question, Mike!

200
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,430
Because it allows me to plug my other TV show,

201
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,670
America Uncovered.

202
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,199
Yes, every week I do another entire show,

203
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,710
just like China Uncensored,

204
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,949
but about topics related to America.

205
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:50,949
And last Thursday,

206
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:54,010
I published an episode that should answer
your question.

207
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,310
It’s called “Coronavirus:

208
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,180
Did Trump Make the US Less Safe?”

209
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,190
So watch that episode,

210
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,180
and tell me what you think.

211
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,329
Thanks Mike.

212
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,149
And thank you to everyone watching.

213
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:07,029
