1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,090
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,299
with China playing a bigger role,

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,119
what will the Internet become?

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,580
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,480
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,619
The Internet!

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,119
Some of you watching may not have even been alive

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,369
at a time when the Internet wasn’t everywhere.

9
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:30,330
But I remember such a time.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,260
When computers were mysterious novelties,

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,860
completely misunderstood by popular media.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,440
What’s your preference?

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,680
Apple, Pear, Wang?

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,460
Oh listen, I don’t know anything about computers?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,760
Nobody does!

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,070
Electric Dreams was popular, right?

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,050
Anyway, the world has now changed in weird, wild ways.

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,540
Because Internet.

19
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,580
But at the beginning,

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,640
no one really knew what to do with computers.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,460
Other than, you know

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,960
designing your own woman.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,140
Okay, look.

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,640
You know how you’re always talking about
how you can

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,190
simulate all that stuff on your computer?

26
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,190
You know?

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,240
What’s the difference,

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,060
why can’t we simulate a girl?

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,850
The 80s were magnificent.

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,400
But clearly at that time,

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,770
no one really could predict

32
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,740
where this whole Internet thing was going.

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,580
Although it is largely still about finding
the perfect woman.

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,329
Anyway, the point is, 20 years ago,

35
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,479
the Internet was still developing.

36
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,909
And so in 1998

37
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,600
the US government helped create the Los Angeles based non-profit,

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
ICANN.

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,060
To put it very simply,

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,530
there’s a department of ICANN that’s in charge

41
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,090
of the Internet’s address book.

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,149
It makes sure users get to the website

43
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,869
they intend to visit.

44
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,319
Like when you type in YouTube.com,

45
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,729
it sends you to YouTube’s website

46
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,539
so you don’t have to type in the long string
of numbers

47
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,440
which is YouTube’s actual IP address.

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,490
It’s like how you don’t bother remembering

49
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,240
your mom’s phone number anymore

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,660
because you can just go to your phone’s
Contacts

51
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,800
and click her name.

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,580
But you use ICANN way more than you call your
mother.

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,920
ICANN is like if the entire world shared Contacts

54
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
for Internet addresses.

55
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,600
That’s really important because

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,130
whoever controls the Internet’s address
book

57
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,740
also has the ability to censor the Internet.

58
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,460
Let’s say ICANN removes the domain name
youtube.com.

59
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,480
YouTube itself may still exist,

60
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
but would you know what numbers to type in

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,060
to get there?

62
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,860
99.9% of people wouldn't be able to access
it.

63
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,300
So ICANN is really important.

64
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,730
As the Economist puts it,

65
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,730
“That is why,

66
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,970
as the internet grew up,

67
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,390
America decided not to hand control to the
United Nations

68
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,540
or another international body steered by governments.”

69
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,790
But for the most part,

70
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,930
the US government has been pretty much hands off,

71
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,270
which let the Internet thrive

72
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,810
as the global depository of cat videos

73
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,620
we know today.

74
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,470
But something changed this past Saturday.

75
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,690
Because the US let its contract with ICANN
expire.

76
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,200
As of October 1,

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,560
it will be run on a “multi-stakeholder model.”

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
In other words,

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,360
a “mix of corporate interests, government
officials,

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,850
activists and experts

81
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,650
spread across four international bodies.”

82
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,280
Whew, this is getting complicated!

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,440
Can we go back to the old days for a bit?

84
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
Much better

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,900
You see,

86
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,380
the Internet was never meant to have a central
authority.

87
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,210
And the less say that governments have,

88
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,000
the more free the Internet, right?

89
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,100
After all,

90
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,460
there are 3.6 billion Internet users,

91
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,460
so of course

92
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,240
the vast majority are outside the US.

93
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,440
And after Edward Snowden revealed

94
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,230
that the NSA was spying on the global Internet,

95
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,330
a lot of people called for the US

96
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,230
to give up control.

97
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:08,770
So did a lot of

98
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,300
major technology and telecommunication companies.

99
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,500
So the US did give up control.

100
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,040
Well, not completely.

101
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,260
the US will still have one seat

102
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,199
on ICANN’s 171-member Governmental Advisory
Committee.

103
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,199
In other words,

104
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,590
the US’s position on the committee

105
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,900
will be theoretically equal

106
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,759
to a country like Barbados,

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,020
a country you think about so little,

108
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,139
that you didn’t even notice that’s not
Barbados.

109
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:35,879
This is Barbados.

110
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,660
Oh, that is fun! No wonder John Oliver can't stop doing it

111
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,460
No wonder John Oliver can't stop doing it!

112
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,020
But just because Barbados has a population
smaller than Wichita, Kansas

113
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,039
doesn’t mean it shouldn’t have an equal
say

114
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:49,810
over how the Internet gets run.

115
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,370
But that’s not the whole picture,

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,569
since in reality,

117
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,169
not all countries have equally small stakes

118
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,460
in how the Internet will be run.

119
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Actually,

120
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,310
the US will still have lots of sway.

121
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,949
But you know who else does?

122
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:03,949
China.

123
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,189
A country I talk about so much,

124
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,560
you were wondering when I was going to get
to it.

125
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,070
You see, China—

126
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,330
or Chinese authorities to be precise—

127
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,520
are very happy about the US giving up its
control.

128
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,020
As one Chinese cyber security professor said,

129
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,840
“China has the capability now

130
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,800
to set up international rules for cyberspace

131
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,180
and use our strategy and our rules

132
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,129
to influence the world.”

133
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,120
I mean,

134
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,620
who wouldn’t want China’s Internet rules

135
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,250
to apply to the entire world?

136
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,070
I mean, first of all,

137
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,870
we'd get actual Internet police.

138
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,370
But that’s just some professor

139
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,939
saying that’s the plan.

140
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,939
I mean,

141
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,550
it’s paranoid delusion to imagine

142
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,379
that China is actually considering setting
up

143
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,499
its own rules in cyberspace.

144
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,499
Except that,

145
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,970
according to another guy,

146
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,849
“China is considering setting up

147
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,260
its own rules in cyberspace.”

148
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,090
And that other guy is the Premier of China,

149
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,409
Li Keqiang.

150
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,849
So, maybe there is something to the idea

151
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,749
that the Communist Party might be trying to
influence

152
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:06,279
the global Internet.

153
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,020
It’s pretty well known the Chinese regime

154
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,830
has kept a tight grip on China’s Internet—

155
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,009
with two million people employed to police it,

156
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:18,059
so they can monitor what Chinese citizens do and say.

157
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:19,870
They also block access to websites

158
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,900
they consider subversive.

159
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,639
Like YouTube.

160
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,990
But over the past few years,

161
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,309
the Chinese regime been pushing to control
the world’s Internet—

162
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:31,770
by filling the void left by the United States

163
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,120
as it steps back from ICANN.

164
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
But how?

165
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,009
Isn’t there that “multi-stakeholder model?”

166
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,779
Well, the Chinese regime has gotten pretty
good

167
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,039
at manipulating international bodies

168
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,870
and foreign tech companies,

169
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,229
like the ones that will now oversee ICANN.

170
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,940
Take, for instance,

171
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,430
China’s Technical Committee 260,

172
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,360
or TC260.

173
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,050
It was founded in 2002.

174
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,050
Yeah,

175
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,139
so they’ve been secretly planning this

176
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:58,349
for a long time.

177
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,340
China has been using the TC260 in part

178
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,099
to “actively participate

179
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:06,749
in international rules and standards making
in cyberspace,

180
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:09,559
so as to improve discourse and China's influence

181
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:14,150
and increase international adoption of China's standards.”

182
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,820
Now if the name TC260 sounds a bit like ED-209
from RoboCop,

183
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,320
well,

184
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,750
that’s a not too far off.

185
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,439
Think of it like an ED-209

186
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,839
designed to make internet policy

187
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,579
instead of “urban pacification.”

188
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,020
The TC260 helps draft laws that focus on encryption,

189
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
big data,

190
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,400
and other cybersecurity issues.

191
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,759
And as the Wall Street Journal says,

192
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,039
it makes sure technology is “secure and
controllable.”

193
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,319
Secure and controllable?

194
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,020
By the CCP?

195
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,490
That doesn’t sound too good.

196
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,770
But wait!

197
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,610
The TC260 is not just the CCP.

198
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,680
It’s a committee.

199
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,460
Foreign tech companies like Microsoft, Cisco,
Intel, and IBM

200
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,590
are members.

201
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,590
Surely,

202
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,909
they will help China move in the right direction

203
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,069
in terms of Internet freedom.

204
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,180
Except,

205
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,180
many companies in the West

206
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,819
get a little funny when access to the Chinese market

207
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,919
is dangled in front of them.

208
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,479
Like when IBM caved to pressure from the Chinese regime

209
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,379
and gave one of the world’s biggest violators
of Intellectual Property

210
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,650
access to their source code.

211
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,969
Or when Cisco sold routers to China

212
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,669
with the intention of helping the regime censor
its citizens.

213
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,190
So my guess is these companies

214
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,800
aren’t really going to change China,

215
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,089
as much as China is going to change them.

216
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,080
Anyway,

217
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,310
if you’re worried about the TC260

218
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,229
drafting scary big brother Internet regulations—

219
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,310
well, yeah.

220
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,949
But those regulations only apply to people
inside China.

221
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:50,949
However,

222
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,750
the TC260 is also part of a broader plan

223
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,440
by Chinese authorities to exert control over
the world’s Internet.

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,180
The TC260 reports directly to the Cyberspace
Administration of China.

225
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,100
And the Cyberspace Administration of China

226
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,341
just happens to report directly to report
directly

227
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,540
to the Leading Small Group for Network Security
and Information,

228
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,580
which is chaired by the leader of the Chinese
Communist Party,

229
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,519
Xi Jinping.

230
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,239
In other words,

231
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,720
the TC260 ultimately reports to the head of
the Communist Party.

232
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,220
And its goal is to influence international
rules and standards for the Internet.

233
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,889
And that’s just one example

234
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,320
of how the CCP is trying to influence Internet policy.

235
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,080
There’s also a sort of related organization

236
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,990
called the CyberSecurity Association of China.

237
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,170
Its goal is to strengthen the CCP’s control
over China’s Internet,

238
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,860
including how foreign companies can operate
in China.

239
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,839
But while the CyberSecurity Association

240
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,329
has representatives from Chinese companies
like Alibaba,

241
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,480
it has no foreign companies among its members.

242
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Oh,

243
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,600
and its chairman is this guy—

244
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,589
who created the Great Firewall of China.

245
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:02,769
So suffice it to say,

246
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,149
it’s not pro-Internet freedom.

247
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,580
And its Secretary General is Li Yuxiao,

248
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,000
who once said this:

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,440
“Now is the time for China

250
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,640
to realize its responsibilities.

251
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,800
If the United States is willing to give up
its running of the internet sphere,

252
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,709
the question comes as to who will take the
baton

253
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,070
and how it would be run.”

254
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,730
So if all of this seems a bit complicated,

255
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,730
it is.

256
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,290
That’s the point.

257
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,110
The Chinese regime doesn’t want people figuring
it out.

258
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,199
And that’s how,

259
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,440
under the radar,

260
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,000
the Chinese regime has spent a long time

261
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,699
carefully designing ways to influence the
groups

262
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,709
that will be overseeing ICANN,

263
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,110
the world’s Internet address book

264
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,720
that all of us use everyday.

265
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,860
Does the Chinese regime control the global
Internet now?

266
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
No.

267
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,240
But they want to.

268
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
And if eventually they do,

269
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,780
they could write the rules over how you're allowed to use the internet!

270
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,040
So the Chinese regime has  been planning this for a long time,

271
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,820
and exerting their influence little by little.

272
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,320
And now,

273
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,079
as the United States steps back from ICANN,

274
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,149
the Chinese regime sees this as a perfect
time

275
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,710
to fill the void.

276
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,000
And guess what?

277
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,709
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

278
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,620
If you’d like to learn more,

279
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,569
I highly recommend you read this article

280
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:16,790
by Joshua Philipp,

281
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,890
whom I’ve interviewed before on this show.

282
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,550
This story has not been getting

283
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,690
nearly the media attention it deserves.

284
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,690
So please, share this video with everyone you know...

285
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,690
...while you're still able to!

286
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,320
So what do you think is in store

287
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,040
for the future of the Internet?

288
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,580
Leave your comments below.

289
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,640
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

290
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

291
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,300
