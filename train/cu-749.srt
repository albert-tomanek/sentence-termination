1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,600
More Americans view China as an enemy

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,760
As the CCP prepares for war

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
Plus an odd affection for Trump in China.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,440
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,360
After decades of the Chinese Communist\h
Party’s unrestricted warfare against the US,\h\h

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,840
a lot of Americans have come\h
to view China as the enemy.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,160
That’s according to this new\h
poll by the Pew Research Center.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,040
“Roughly nine-in-ten U.S. adults consider China\h
a competitor or enemy, rather than a partner.”

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,680
However, while 53% of conservatives\h
describe China specifically as an enemy,\h\h

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,400
only 20% of liberals say the same.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,080
“Concerns about China’s aggressive\h
behavior are not new—U.S.\h\h

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,000
military and intelligence officials repeatedly\h
warned about Chinese military investment,\h\h

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,600
disinformation, and espionage\h
and cyber operations.”

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
I think someone else has been warning Americans\h
about the Chinese Communist Party, too.\h\h

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,240
Yeah, someone.\h

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,680
This week, Admiral Philip Davidson,\h
commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,\h\h

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
testified before members of the\h
Senate Armed Services Committee.\h

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,240
He said China plans to overtake\h
the US on the world stage.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,960
Well all the world’s a stage.\h
Someone's gotta be the villain.\h

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,560
And China is putting big money behind that.\h\h

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,400
According to Chinese state-run media,\h
China is ramping up military funding.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,160
This was a big topic at the recent meeting of\h
top Communist officials, called the Two Sessions.\h\h

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,160
Premier Li Keqiang said\h
“[We should] comprehensively\h\h

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,920
strengthen the military exercises\h
and fully prepare for war.”

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,360
Do they have a particular target in mind?\h

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,800
Well it just so happens they\h
do. Admiral Philip Davidson\h\h

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,160
also said he expects China\h
to invade Taiwan by 2027.

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
Now China says the US admiral is only\h
hyping up the threat of a Taiwan invasion.

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
After all, the Chinese Communist Party has\h
been promising to invade Taiwan for decades.\h\h

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,240
Let’s just hope this is one\h
of those promises they break.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
But Chinese officials are\h
also telling President Biden\h\h

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
to stop the dangerous\h
practice of supporting Taiwan.

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,400
It is dangerous. Dangerous for the CCP.\h
They don’t want to fight the US military.\h

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Speaking of US action against\h
China, Biden’s Commerce Chief,\h\h

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,080
Gina Raimondo, has said Trump’s steel\h
and aluminum tariffs were effective.

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,480
President Biden has never been clear about what he\h
intends to do with the Trump-era tariffs on China.\h\h

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
But this might be a sign tariffs will continue.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,920
That being said, a lot of\h
Trump policies have been frozen\h\h

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,480
as the Biden administration reviews them.\h
For instance, the WeChat ban. In February,\h\h

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,880
Biden temporarily paused the ban so\h
his administration could review it.\h

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,240
But it has now come out that\h
Commerce Secretary Raimondo\h\h

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,240
and her husband own a stake\h
in WeChat’s parent company.

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,320
That parent company is Tencent, one of\h
several Chinese tech companies the US\h\h

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,760
considers a national security threat\h
and potential vector for espionage.

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,320
How could she do that?! Well, the same way\h
most Americans are invested in potentially\h\h

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,480
dangerous Chinese companies. Through\h
Emerging Market Funds. She and her husband\h\h

48
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,280
“jointly own shares of two emerging\h
markets exchange-traded funds,\h\h

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,920
which are composed of several foreign\h
stocks including Tencent Holdings.”

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,680
Of course, as Commerce Secretary, I hope\h
Raimondo learns about all the ways Americans\h\h

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,040
end up supporting an authoritarian regime that\h
kills their own citizens for their organs.

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
And after the break, China’s\h
National People’s Congress\h\h

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,480
has approved new rules to make sure Hong Kong’s\h
democracy is firmly within their control.

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,840
Welcome back

55
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,800
This week, China’s National\h
People’s Congress approved\h\h

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,160
sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
What are the changes?\h

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,920
One change is about how Hong Kong’s\h
Chief Executive gets selected.\h\h

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
The Chief Executive is like a governor.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,000
In the past, there’s been a 1,200 member\h
committee that elects the Chief Executive.\h\h

61
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,760
It’s made up of four equally sized sectors. The\h
fourth sector includes elected members of Hong\h\h

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,080
Kong’s legislative council and district councils,\h
plus some unelected members from mainland China.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,240
But that’s not enough for the CCP.\h
Under the new rules passed this week,\h\h

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,000
the election committee will be expanded by\h
adding a new group of 300 communist officials.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
So with the election committee\h
increased from 1,200 members\h\h

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,000
to 1,500 members, I think it’s safe to\h
say: Hong Kong is now 25% more democratic.\h

67
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,040
And in case that doesn’t pack the\h
Hong Kong government with enough\h\h

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,400
pro-Beijing officials, they’re also\h
expanding Hong Kong’s Legislative Council.\h\h

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,240
In the past it had 70 seats, 35 of\h
which are elected by the people.\h

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,320
Now the Chinese government will be adding\h
20 more seats, and filling them with its\h\h

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,440
own people. So elected representatives\h
will now always be in the minority.

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,440
And in case *that* doesn’t pack the Hong Kong\h
government with enough pro-Beijing officials,\h\h

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
a new vetting committee\h
will be established to block\h\h

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,160
any of those potential candidates\h
not deemed sufficiently “patriotic.”

75
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,320
This is what Chinese officials call\h
“democracy with Hong Kong characteristics.”

76
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,840
Yeah, that’s not a joke. And according to\h
this report, members of the NPC “applauded\h\h

77
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,960
for the longest period after the Hong\h
Kong electoral proposal was passed.”

78
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
I feel like there’s some kind\h
of quote about liberty dying\h\h

79
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,760
and thunderous applause that might apply here.

80
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,120
On the plus side, State\h
Department Spokesman Ned Price\h\h

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,440
says the US condemns China’s actions in\h
Hong Kong. And the US is also working to\h\h

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,120
galvanize action over the CCP’s abuses\h
of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.\h

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,480
Price said, “I don’t think anyone is satisfied\h
yet, with the international response to what\h\h

84
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,600
has taken place in Xinjiang. And that’s precisely\h
why we are, in many ways, galvanizing the world,\h\h

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,360
galvanizing collective action, to make clear\h
that these sort of abuses against human rights\h\h

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
in Xinjiang and elsewhere will not be tolerated.”

87
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,520
Wait, what actions has the Biden Administration\h
taken? Who’s being galvanized? They’re still\h\h

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,840
“reviewing” whether to call what’s\h
happening in Xinjiang a genocide.

89
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,120
Hopefully they’ll get to that in the US’s\h
upcoming high level meeting with China.

90
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,840
And I’ll get to that meeting, after the break.

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,640
Welcome back.

92
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,960
Next Thursday, top Biden officials will meet with\h
their Chinese counterparts for the first time.

93
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,920
And they’re meeting in Alaska, for some reason.\h

94
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,200
According to a senior administration\h
official, they will discuss everything\h\h

95
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,920
from Covid-19 to climate change, Hong Kong,\h
Taiwan, and China’s trade war with Australia.\h

96
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,480
“The U.S. will also discuss Chinese practices\h
seen as damaging to American workers and farmers,\h\h

97
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,360
as well as intellectual property theft,\h
forced technology transfer and human rights”

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,480
Ok, holding the meeting in\h
Alaska makes more sense now.\h\h

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,240
Because both sides will be\h
expecting a chilly reception.\h

100
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,520
A bipartisan group of US lawmakers have introduced\h
a bill to fight forced organ harvesting.

101
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,760
It’s called the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act,\h\h

102
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,160
otherwise known as the I CAN’T\h
BELIEVE WE HAVE TO SAY THIS act.

103
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,760
According to the bill’s sponsor, Representative\h
Chris Smith, “We must do more to put an end to\h\h

104
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,680
the horrific abuse by international human\h
trafficking gangs, terrorist organizations,\h\h

105
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,800
and even some governments—China’s\h
Communist regime in particular—who\h\h

106
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,240
kill innocent people and sell\h
their organs for profit.”

107
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,840
Specifically calling out the Chinese Communist\h
Party for organ harvesting is a huge move.\h

108
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,600
One of the victims of forced organ harvesting\h
in China are the Ugyhur Muslims. The CCP denies\h\h

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:09,440
there’s any genocide happening in Xinjiang\h
and has welcomed investigations. Well, the\h\h

110
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,360
first independent report has come out and it says\h
Beijing is intent to destroy the Uyghur people.

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,880
In fact, according to the report, “The Chinese\h
government’s alleged actions in Xinjiang\h\h

112
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,080
have violated every single provision in\h
the United Nations’ Genocide Convention.”

113
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,920
You hear that Joe?

114
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
And finally, this image has gone viral in China.

115
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
The listing says it was made\h
by a Chinese furniture company.\h\h

116
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,680
The listing says you should buy this\h
statue to “Make your company great again!”

117
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
And it features “Trump, who knows\h
Buddhism better than anyone.”

118
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,680
“I’m so enlightened. I’m the most\h
enlightened being. So much humility.”

119
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,240
What I get from this though, is that inner\h
peace comes from being banned on social media.

120
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
And now it’s time for me to answer a\h
question from a member of the China\h\h

121
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Uncensored 50 cent army, fans\h
who support the show on Patreon.

122
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,720
Today’s question comes from:

123
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,760
Jason. “Does bear spray work on tiny Pandas?\h
Please there must be something i can do to\h\h

124
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,560
protect myself! Can pandas swim? I know!\h
I will move my entire house onto a boat,\h\h

125
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
that will show those tiny pandas who's the boss.”

126
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,640
Your fears are entirely justified, Jason.\h
But I’m sorry to say, according to the WWF,\h\h

127
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,000
which I believe is the World Wrestling\h
Federation, “They can also swim and,\h\h

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,800
unlike most other bears, do not hibernate\h
for months at [a] time during winter.”

129
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,200
Which means they will never rest until they’ve\h
killed you and everyone you ever cared about. A\h\h

130
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,760
house boat isn’t going to cut it. Fortunately\h
Pandas are very dumb. I mean, look at them.

131
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,720
They can easily be fooled and tricked.\h
I recommend booby trapping your house,\h\h

132
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,240
with a large pile of bamboo. Then the\h
pandas will get distracted and start eating.\h\h

133
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,160
And since they spend like 14 hours a day eating\h
bamboo, you can use that time to run away.\h

134
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
Thanks for your question Jason.

135
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:27,840
And thank you for watching. I’m\h
Chris Chappell. See you next time.
