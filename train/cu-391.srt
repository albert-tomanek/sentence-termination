00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,779
when sharing high-level government intelligence,

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:06,640
keep your friends close,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,680
but your enemies closer.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,060
Wait, that’s a terrible idea.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,240
Who came up with that?

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,800
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,580
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,850
In our top story,

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,780
there could be major ongoing intelligence
leaks

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,160
among English-speaking countries.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
And guess who’s to blame?

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,360
There’s something called the Five Eyes.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,000
No, it’s not a group of exotic Batman villains
from the 1970s.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,620
Or a terrible ’90s boy band.

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,820
It’s actually an intelligence network that
was set up

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
in 1955 between the United States, Canada,

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,120
the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,800
These five countries routinely share sensitive
intelligence—

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,820
on everything from [BLEEP] to [BLEEP]

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,210
What’d you expect?

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,960
It’s highly sensitive information!

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,980
But there could be a leak...

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,579
from within New Zealand.

25
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,420
And I’m not talking about it’s delicious
dairy.

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,929
The leak is what former CIA China expert Peter
Mattis

27
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,780
talked about when he testified last month

28
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,789
before the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Commission.

29
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:17,350
He suggest that maybe New Zealand

30
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,259
ought to be kicked out of the boy band

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,270
formerly known as the Five Eyes.

32
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,439
Then terrorists and evil regimes would be
left to tremble

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,189
before the might...of the Four Eyes intelligence
network.

34
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,100
Just try and take our lunch money.

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,590
So what’s the possible leak within New Zealand
intelligence?

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,329
Well, this is China Uncensored, so you guessed
it:

37
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:41,329
It’s Russia.

38
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,799
Haha, no, it’s the Chinese Communist Party.

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,770
They’ve gotten very close to

40
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,229
or inside New Zealand’s political core.

41
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,130
One example is Jian Yang,

42
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,060
a New Zealand Member of Parliament.

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,539
He’s a New Zealand citizen now,

44
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,450
but when he lived in China,

45
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,880
he just so happened to train Chinese spies

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,499
at a top military university.

47
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:07,740
Don’t worry, he’s totally not a spy himself.

48
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,450
Now when that story broke last year...

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,269
well, the New Zealand government did nothing.

50
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,459
Jian Yang remained a member of parliament.

51
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,870
And China expert Peter Mattis is concerned

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,989
New Zealand’s former prime minister Bill
English

53
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,790
routinely briefed Jian Yang

54
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,900
on sensitive China-related intelligence—

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,290
intel that may have ended up on the desks

56
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,000
of Chinese Communist Party officials.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,500
As for current Prime Minister,

58
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,090
her party has accepted donations that may
be

59
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,459
linked to the Communist Party.

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,120
Mattis points out the level of Communist Party

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,280
infiltration in Australia is also similar
to New Zealand.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,230
But he did not recommend Australia be kicked
out.

63
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,579
That’s because Australia has been responding
to the problem,

64
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,340
while New Zealand has denied there’s any
problem at all.

65
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,489
Don’t worry,

66
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,610
we might not be stuck with four-eyed intelligence.

67
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,530
Mattis suggests that New Zealand could be
replaced by Japan.

68
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,370
And they’d bring to the table giant robots.

69
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,370
And tentacles.

70
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,310
Hmmm...maybe let’s skip the tentacles.

71
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,290
Speaking of giving sensitive information

72
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,680
to the Chinese Communist Party—

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Facebook.

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,269
At this point it should come as no surprise
that

75
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,780
Facebook sells an incredible amount of user
data.

76
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,989
But it may surprise you that Facebook even
went so far

77
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,370
as sharing that data with at least four Chinese
companies.

78
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,079
One of them is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications
firm

79
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,430
owned by a former engineer in the People’s
Liberation Army,

80
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,650
and that gets billions of dollars from the
Chinese Communist Party.

81
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,159
US Intelligence agencies have been very concerned

82
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,650
about Huawei and the security risk they pose.

83
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,459
Since at least 2012 in fact.

84
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,000
Facebook, though: Not very concerned.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Their data sharing agreements with Chinese
companies

86
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,900
have been in place since at least 2010.

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,459
And apparently, are still in place.

88
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,510
“The four partnerships remain in effect,

89
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,900
but Facebook officials said in an interview

90
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,499
that the company would wind down the Huawei
deal

91
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,489
by the end of the week.”

92
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:14,489
Well that’s good.

93
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,769
You got to commend Facebook

94
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,600
for doing what’s right...after getting caught.

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,730
And it’s time for another fan question!

96
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,470
Jordan Laramore asks:

97
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,730
“I have a question in regard to the South
China Sea.

98
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,980
We know that the dispute has soured the view
of China

99
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,640
in some countries but how about relations
with Taiwan,

100
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,860
seeing as they claim the same area

101
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,800
and occupy an island in the sea?”

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,100
Great question, Jordan.

103
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,230
You’re right.

104
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,430
This is one of those weird things that both

105
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,030
the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan
agree on:

106
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,389
that everything within the Nine-Dash Line
belongs to China.

107
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,940
Though obviously they don’t agree on which
China that is.

108
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,980
As you pointed out,

109
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,340
Taiwan has had its own small island

110
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,130
in the South China Sea for decades.

111
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,520
It’s called Itu Aba.

112
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,910
But Taiwan’s Coast Guard uses it mainly

113
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,280
for search and rescue in the area—

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,770
like to help a fishing boat that capsizes,

115
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,870
no matter what country it’s from.

116
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,950
See, when you build hospitals instead of missile
silos,

117
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,750
your neighbors react a little differently.

118
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,010
Basically, the problem other countries have

119
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,440
isn’t China’s historical claims to the
South China Sea.

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,430
It’s the Chinese Communist Party being extremely
aggressive

121
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,460
about building up islands for military use.

122
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,990
Also, of course, we trust Taiwan because it’s
everyone’s ally.

123
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,710
Whereas the PRC is, at best, a frenemy.

124
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,750
So what do you think?

125
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,130
Leave your comments below.

126
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,510
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

127
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,720
See you next time.

128
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,020
Thanks for watching.

129
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,560
it's hard for a controversial show like China Uncensored to get advertisers.

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,620
And a lot of our YouTube videos get demonetized.

131
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,280
That's why we rely mainly on your support.
