1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,460
it don’t matter if you’re black or white.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,160
Unless you’re a panda.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,340
Then its pandamonium.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,219
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,540
You know I’ve been hosting this show for
four years.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,820
And people often ask me,

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,060
“Chris, do you ever have to deal with interference
from China

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,700
when making the show?”

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,620
And the answer is, I do.

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,820
The first year of making the show was great!

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,469
And then, three years ago,

14
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,080
this little monster stole my limelight.

15
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,160
No, that’s not a naked mole rat.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,120
It’s Bao Bao, the baby panda.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,359
Ever since Bao Bao was born,

18
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,859
she’s been on a non-stop panda cam

19
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,940
that people have been watching instead of
me

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,100
on China Uncensored.

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,800
Sometimes people say that pandas get too much attention, right?

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,220
Yes, thank you!

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,500
I mean, why do people like pandas so much?

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,639
Oh look, she can hardly walk without falling down

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,620
into a cute little tumble.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,340
How adorable.

27
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,300
Oh look, she’s got her head stuck in a box.

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,659
Look at me, everyone!

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,080
I’m so freaking special.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,800
And now, Bao Bao’s getting a free flight

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,689
from Washington, D.C. to China.

32
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,210
With even more legroom than first class.

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,790
That thing is six and a half feet long.

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,460
And honestly, I’d rather eat bamboo

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,450
than most airline food.

36
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,060
Stupid pandas.

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Although I guess since she’s flying Federal
Express,

38
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,760
you could call it “panda express.”

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,840
Oh, they even beat me to that joke?!

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Honestly.

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,250
Everyone’s all like, pandas are so great,

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,310
pandas are endangered,

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,280
pandas are sooo cute!

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,160
Fine.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,200
They’re cute.

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,460
But there’s a bunch of them,

47
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,630
and only only one of me!

48
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,729
Wait a minute.

49
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,479
Why is a panda born in the US flying to China

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,920
in the first place?

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,840
So we knew before she was even born

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,479
that one day she would have to go back to
be a part

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,340
of the breeding population in China.

54
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,200
Oh right, it has to do with a little something called

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,590
panda diplomacy.

56
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,599
You may not know this,

57
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,870
but every panda in the world,

58
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,120
even one born in the United States,

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,850
belongs to the Chinese government.

60
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,569
So in the rare instance a panda couple in
a foreign zoo

61
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,360
has a baby,

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,689
that panda cub has to be sent back to China

63
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,209
before it turns 4.

64
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,319
This panda control is a way for China

65
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,709
to spread its soft power.

66
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,170
And it actually dates back to the Tang Dynasty,

67
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,439
when Wu Zetian, China’s first and only female emperor,

68
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,460
sent a pair of pandas to the Japanese emperor,

69
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,620
thereby locking down a peaceful relationship

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,420
between China and Japan for all time.

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,799
I think.

72
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,280
But the modern day incarnation of panda diplomacy

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,060
began in the 1950s.

74
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,920
China gave 23 pandas to 9 different countries

75
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,090
in just three decades.

76
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,379
The highest profile being two given by Mao
Zedong

77
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,159
to Richard Nixon after his historic visit
to China

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,330
in 1972.

79
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,570
But then Chinese officials realized,

80
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,280
why give pandas as gifts when you can just

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,079
rent them out instead.

82
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,170
Yes, now other countries can rent a panda
from China,

83
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,370
with a maximum lease of 10 years.

84
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,190
Or 50,000 miles.

85
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,910
And the terms of agreement on those things
is killer:

86
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,880
You need to pay the Chinese government

87
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,760
one million dollars per year for each pair
of pandas.

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,860
Plus, if they have a baby,

89
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,370
you have to pay the Chinese government

90
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,030
a baby tax of $600,000—

91
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,489
not including the expenses related to actually

92
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,650
getting the pandas to breed,

93
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,010
since they have the libido of 100-year-old
sea turtles.

94
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,629
Then there’s the cost of round-the-clock
care,

95
00:03:58,629 --> 00:03:59,629
bamboo,

96
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,849
and web-hosting for your panda cam.

97
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,540
And if a panda dies in your care,

98
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,640
you’ll owe the Chinese government another
$400,000.

99
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,939
That’s crazy!

100
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:11,939
According to the Guardian,

101
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,720
Having a panda can be ruinous, say some zoos,

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,230
and could even take money away

103
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,580
from other conservation work.

104
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,080
Pandas are actively making the world

105
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,830
a worse place.

106
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,210
So why all the fuss?

107
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,570
Well, there are only about 1,800 pandas left
in the wild,

108
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,960
according to the World Wrestling Federation,

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
or whatever.

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,910
Frankly, I think the Chinese government

111
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,960
should be paying us

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,400
to take care of their pandas.

113
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,860
But the Chinese government has never listened

114
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,750
to my policy suggestions before,

115
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,500
so they’re probably not going to start now.

116
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,700
So how did this whole panda cash farm thing
get started?

117
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
For that,

118
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,760
we can thank former Chinese paramount leader,

119
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,540
Deng Xiaoping.

120
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,970
In the late 1970s,

121
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,310
as he began moving China’s farms and industry

122
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,900
towards capitalism,

123
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,190
he decided that pandas should be put to use

124
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,060
for the nation’s economy too.

125
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,980
Little known fact, by the way:

126
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,310
Instead of panda diplomacy,

127
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,380
Deng Xiaoping initially wanted to use dragon
diplomacy.

128
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,210
But while dragons were warm,

129
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,860
they were not so cuddly.

130
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,120
Also, for some reason, Deng found it hard

131
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,490
to ship them to zoos overseas.

132
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,650
Sorry Dragon Express.

133
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,360
You’ll just have to stay a restaurant.

134
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,720
But anyway, China’s rent-a-panda program

135
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,890
really took off in 2008.

136
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,230
During the Sichuan Earthquake,

137
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,700
China’s main panda sanctuary was devastated,

138
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,510
and all 60 pandas living there

139
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,280
needed a new home.

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,930
And it's much more profitable to

141
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,690
loan pandas out to foreign countries

142
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,470
than to care for them in China, anyway!

143
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,750
So profit is one motive for panda diplomacy,

144
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,270
but there are at least two more.

145
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,570
Another one is, obviously, diplomacy.

146
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,950
Pandas are used on one hand

147
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,920
as a way to sort of sweeten the pot for countries

148
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,910
“that have signed free-trade agreements
with China,

149
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,600
or with nations supplying China with natural
resources

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,890
and advanced technologies.”

151
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,960
And on the other hand,

152
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,400
if a country crosses the Chinese regime,

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,030
it could affect future panda opportunities.

154
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,360
But pandas are not just a reward or threat.

155
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,580
They’re also used as part of China’s soft
power...

156
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,970
propa-panda.

157
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,870
Like the two pandas exchanged with Taiwan

158
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,870
back in 2008,

159
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,180
Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan.

160
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,820
Together, their names mean "reunion" in Chinese.

161
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,440
Hmm...

162
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,510
I feel like there might be

163
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,240
some kind of message there.

164
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,270
The two had a baby panda back in 2013.

165
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,710
But because Taiwan sent their own rare animals

166
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,710
to Chinese zoos

167
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,620
in exchange for the pandas,

168
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,930
in this special case,

169
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,350
the baby doesn’t have to return

170
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,780
to mainland China.

171
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,200
Until, of course, everything in Taiwan

172
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,630
returns to mainland China.

173
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,630


174
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,540
But don’t underestimate the soft power of
pandas.

175
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,030
Pandas, you see,

176
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,130
always get good press.

177
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,190
People love watching them.

178
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,620
In 2013,

179
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,310
state-run China Network Television

180
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,160
even launched iPanda.com,

181
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,830
where you can watch a 24/7 multi-camera stream
of pandas...

182
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,580
scratching their butts, apparently.

183
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,110
Stupid pandas being cute.

184
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,490
And that’s the problem with Pandas.

185
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,250
They’re too warm and cuddly.

186
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,460
Just like the Chinese Communist Party.

187
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,580
Or rather, how it wants to be seen

188
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,400
by the rest of the world.

189
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
And that’s their game:

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,710
How could you dislike anything about China

191
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,810
when their mascot is the panda?

192
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,810
So I say,

193
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,150
if the Chinese government wants America

194
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,190
to send Bao Bao to China,

195
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,490
good riddance!

196
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,030
She’s just a symbol of how the Chinese regime

197
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,000
uses pandas for profit,

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,660
international arm-twisting, and soft power.

199
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,840
Soft, cuddly power.

200
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,280
I mean sure,

201
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,190
we’ve watched Bao Bao grow up from a cub,

202
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,920
into a spirited, independent panda that made
us laugh,

203
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,700
and showed us what it was like to play again.

204
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,380
Now she’s going off to make a new life for
herself

205
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,830
and to have cubs of her own.

206
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,300
I’m going to miss Bao Bao.

207
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:11,840
Chris!

208
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,860
We have to finish the episode!

209
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,800
Um, well, this is awkward.

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,100
So, uh, what do you think of Bao Bao?

211
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,800
And China’s panda diplomacy?

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,390
Leave your comments below.

213
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,080
And please, consider supporting the show on
Patreon,

214
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,310
so we can raise funds for our very own panda.

215
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,470
Or at least make enough

216
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,349
so we can eat lunch at Panda Express.

217
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:36,440
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

218
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,529
Once again, that was Chris Chappell.

219
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,600
Hopefully, he’ll see you next time.

220
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,240
Bao Bao!
