1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,060
What is life like for a North Korean Elite?

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,940
Parties in Pyongyang?

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,500
Or a living nightmare?

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,300
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,700
Ever wonder what life is like for members
of North Korea’s elite?

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,320
Well, I couldn’t get Kim Jong-Un to sit
down with me.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,939
I mean, I’m no James Franco.

9
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:27,019
But I got the next best thing:

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,640
Thae Yong-ho.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,930
He was North Korea's deputy ambassador to
the United Kingdom.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,820
Think about that—his job was to represent
a country

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,940
known for an insane despot who has convinced
people

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,100
to worship him as a god.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,800
But notice I said *was*.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,960
Because Thae Yong-ho defected in 2016.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,010
And believe me, that’s not a job you can
easily retire from.

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,600
While we were at the Oslo Freedom Forum,

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,489
Shelley Zhang had a chance to sit down with
the former ambassador

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,019
to hear his strange tale.

21
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,530
Thank you for joining us ambassador

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,640
Thank you

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
So what were you doing?

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,460
What was your job in the North Korea Embassy?

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,310
I was the deputy ambassador for North Korea
Embassy in London

26
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,090
until the summer of 2016

27
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,090
So what did you do?

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,560
What were part of your duties as the deputy
ambassador?

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,750
Basically, I was in charge of public relations

30
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,200
between North Korea and Britain.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,590
There is a small embassy of North Korea in
London,

32
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,649
so that's why basically,

33
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:46,119
I was in charge of all the relationships between
North Korea and UK,

34
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,159
like critical economic and cultural [inaudible]

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,620
So when you you were growing up in North Korea,
did you believe in the North Korea regime?

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
Of course.

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,979
You see, I was a true believer of North Korean
[inaudible] system,

38
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:09,220
and I thought, and I was taught, in school,

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,950
that North Korea is the only socialist paradise
in the world.

40
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,950
The only socialist paradise?

41
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,950
Yes that's right,

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,000
and so that's why I really truly believed
in

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,330
what I was taught and educated.

44
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,620
Do you remember what your first contact was
with the outside world?

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,760
Yes.

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,890
I started it sometime in China, in Beijing,

47
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,270
but the time that I stayed in China

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,350
was also the period of Chinese communist,
the party rules,

49
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,220
so that's why the mentality, philosophy, were
more or less same,

50
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,920
the China and ... So, basically,

51
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:00,130
I had no doubt in communism or socialism,

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:08,540
until, I was firstly posted to Denmark as
a North Korean diplomat.

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,770
When I first arrived at Denmark, I saw quite
a new world,

54
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,600
because what I was taught in North Korea is
that

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,190
all the socialist system can deliver

56
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,990
social welfare system to its people,

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,520
but the welfare system established in Denmark

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,130
was much much better than what was already
in North Korea.

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:49,480
So, that made me to analyze more deeply about
the capitalist system,

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,770
and so, I started to analyze the new world

61
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,760
and I learned that because of that tax assistant

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,690
even the capitalist system can deliver

63
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,270
much much better welfare system for its people

64
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,410
than the socialist of the countries

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,840
and then later I started to doubt about

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,890
the human rights in the visualism.

67
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:25,220
How society can coordinate the different demands
of the people

68
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,820
through democratic way.

69
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:38,350
So, it was really a shock to me as a true
believer in communism.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,110
So let's go back for a minute to life in Pyongyang.

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,650
Were you a member of the elite there?

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,650
Yes.

73
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,880
So what was life like there?

74
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,640
Do people who are in the elite have freedom,

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,710
or are they still monitored?

76
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,940
They are very much more monitored.

77
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:01,250
The more higher place, you go up,

78
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,380
the lesser freedom you have in North Korean
system.

79
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,620
All the leaders of North Korea are heavily
monitored

80
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,220
and you have less freedoms while you may have

81
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,430
more privileges of power or economic benefit,

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,620
but in terms of freedom,

83
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,780
you have less freedom than the classless people
in North Korea.

84
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,850
So how would that manifest?

85
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,700
Like you would be able to have ...

86
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,500
like live better material life,

87
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,760
but you wouldn't be able to step out of line?

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,590
Yes, that's right.

89
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,860
Everyone in North Korea

90
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,560
has a boundary in their mind,

91
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,770
so it is not possible to open your mind to
anybody in North Korea.

92
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,470
If you were detected,

93
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,440
as a man with a lot of dissatisfaction to
the society

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,370
then you would be the immediate target of
the arrest

95
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,140
and would be sent to prison,

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,400
or even prison camps.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,820
So you can never really know ...

98
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,670
let people know what you are thinking?

99
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,670
No.

100
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,670
No.

101
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,420
We have to be [inaudible] my colleagues' school

102
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,990
served quite a long time in foreign countries,

103
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,780
they all kept their mouths shut.

104
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,630
Well that's one thing I wanted to know, is
when you came to Denmark

105
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,380
and you saw that actually a democracy could
provide for its people,

106
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,900
wouldn't other diplomats have the same experience?

107
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,290
They have the same experience,

108
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,480
but we never share our experiences.

109
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,510
I never ask or ever even question,

110
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,340
like what do you think about the capitalist
system,

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,060
or [inaudible] welfare system.

112
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,790
We never ask that kind of things.

113
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,850
So even though people have gone outside of
North Korea

114
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,680
and seen that life is different than what
you were taught,

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,420
everybody still afraid to talk about it?

116
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,170
Nobody would ... so it's not hard to convince
people

117
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,990
to go back to North Korea?

118
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,990
Yes.

119
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,350
North Korea is a kind of society where there

120
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,330
is not any honest communications between the
people,

121
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,590
because people are not totally afraid of the
regime,

122
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,080
but they are afraid of each other,

123
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,410
because nobody knows who would inform to the
regime

124
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,420
about his ideas ideas or thinking,

125
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,870
so everyone must keep silent what he really
think.

126
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,640
So you wouldn't have to convince anybody that
North Korea is better,

127
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,980
or people just don't talk.

128
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,190
Don't talk and don't even raise any questions,

129
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,740
because everyone knows that once you raise
up these questions

130
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,639
or whatever then you would be immediate target
of the persecutions.

131
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,400
So that's why, this is common knowledge,

132
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,560
everyone knows that in North Korea.

133
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,080
So that sounds like defecting is quite dangerous?

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,210
Of course it's very dangerous.

135
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,780
To me, it's not quite dangerous but for normal
North Koreans

136
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,610
it's real dangerous,

137
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,300
because you can be easily shot dead by the
soldiers

138
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,910
when you cross the rivers by China.

139
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,610
How did you decide to defect?

140
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,710
It's a long story,

141
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,300
there's not any kind of the triggering point
when or how,

142
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,760
but it's a long plan and long thoughts.

143
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,360
So you had been thinking about it for a long
time.

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Yes.

145
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,560
A long time.

146
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
How about your family?

147
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,080
Were you able to get them out?

148
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,010
They agreed when I initiated defect

149
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,450
and they appreciated my brave decisions to
defect.

150
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,850
Could you even talk to your family about this
idea, would that be...

151
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:04,860
Yes, I talked [inaudible] my ideas before
the real defection.

152
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,520
I heard that before you defected, the North
Korean regime

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,320
called you one of the best and brightest diplomats,

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,690
after you defected did they admit that that
happened?

155
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,690
Yes.

156
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,520
So, what did they ...

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,810
They said that I'm a criminal.

158
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,920
That's why I defected the free world.

159
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,790
So they, all of the ambassadors,

160
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,710
[inaudible] North Korea views on those defectors.

161
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,810
So is all of your family out of North Korea
now then?

162
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,700
Well my wife and my two sons.

163
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,770
Do you have any family still there?

164
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,370
Yes, my brother, my sister,

165
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,750
and all my relatives are still in North Korea.

166
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,260
Do you know what happened to them?

167
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,750
There is not any telephone international telephone
lines,

168
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,230
so I am totally disconnected with my family
members.

169
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,041
Is that difficult?

170
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,050
Sometimes it is difficult,

171
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,050
but no choice, no alternatives.

172
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,050


173
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,580
Were you afraid to defect?

174
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,320
Yes.

175
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,970
I see that you travel with a bodyguard.

176
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,640
You're right, yes.

177
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,260
Have there been attempts on your life?

178
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,760
It is absolutely clear to me that now

179
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,400
I am number one target of [inaudible] by North
Korean regime,

180
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,920
that's why I am heavily protected by Southern
government

181
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,029
when I am in South Korea

182
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,790
and why when I go abroad then usually

183
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,100
the countries will host my visit,

184
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,899
will take the responsibility of the protection.

185
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,050
Are you the number one target because of your
rank, or-

186
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,040
Because of my rank and I am a very open critic
of North Korean system.

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,620
So it's kind of defecting and then speaking
out about it?

188
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Yes, that's right.

189
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,420
Many of my colleagues with my label of ranking,

190
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,399
they're silent,

191
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,510
and they don't like to appear on the media,

192
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:22,440
so that's why they don't have this kind of
media appearance

193
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,050
or attending this kind of events,

194
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,390
but I'm a little different that's why North
Korea regime,

195
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,910
I think hates me a lot.

196
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,670
Why do you do it then?

197
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,330
Because I think that just the waiting

198
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,920
for the collapse of North Korean system is
meaningless.

199
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,120
I think somebody should do something

200
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,790
and I should do something to bring up change.

201
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,360
If everyone is just waiting for the miracle
to happen,

202
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,709
the miracle may not take place.

203
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,410
I want to ask you a little bit about China
and North Korea?

204
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,980
What do you think about the Chinese regime's

205
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,709
relationship with North Korea?

206
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,800
China now continues to support [inaudible]
regime.

207
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,470
China continues to [inaudible] all North Korean
defectors

208
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,670
caught in China,

209
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,950
so this kind of inhuman North Korean system
by [inaudible] regime

210
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,750
is only possible by the support of Chinese.

211
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,209
So I really do hope,

212
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:25,670
that one day China is also democratized if
China

213
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,310
becomes a free and democratic world,

214
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,040
actually it will contribute a lot to the peace
and freedom

215
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,590
and democracy of the world.

216
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,090
If China becomes free and democratic country,

217
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,330
I think the next day,

218
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,630
North Korea will become democratic and free
state.

219
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,150
There's no doubt about it.

220
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,399
You don't think the North Korean regime could
survive without the Chinese regime?

221
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,399
No.

222
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,399
Never.

223
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,529
So let's talk a little bit about Chinese authorities

224
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,089
sending North Korean refugees back to North
Korea.

225
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:56,170
Do you think this is something

226
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,450
they are ever going to stop doing?

227
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,080
I think China should stop doing,

228
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,370
because North Korean refugees in China

229
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,700
must be treated different from the other normal
refugees.

230
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,209
Now refugee problem is really a one a big
problem

231
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,360
for the current world,

232
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:22,350
but those refugees do not have any final destinations
to be honest,

233
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,620
but North Korean refugees are different,

234
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,910
because there is a South Korea

235
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,779
who is willing to accept all the refugees
from North Korea,

236
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:36,970
so if, China lets them on their way to South
Korea,

237
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,700
it could be even beneficial for China's wealth,

238
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,589
because of Chinese policy of repatriation

239
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:48,290
many North Korean man and ladies are in slave
markets

240
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:55,310
in the human trafficking, sex slaves of all
these things,

241
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,790
so if Chinese just support them,

242
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,990
or just, give the way to continue their journey
to South Korea,

243
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,399
I think it could be beneficial for China's
[inaudible]

244
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,460
and China's people, but the Chinese government

245
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,670
still thinks that the contribution of North
Korean government

246
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,620
is Chinese interest.

247
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,490
That's why they try to support it by repatriation

248
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,980
these North Korean refugees to North Korea.

249
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,290
Let's talk a little bit about what you are
doing now.

250
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,550
You say that you think that people need to
do something

251
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,910
about the North Korean regime.

252
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,910
Yes.

253
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,960
So what are some of the things you are working
on?

254
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,580
I'm going to educate the North Korean people

255
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,580
and North Korean elite through online systems.

256
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,220
Now there around around one hundred North
Koreans working overseas,

257
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,240
they have all of them have a smartphone,

258
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,740
so they have very easy access to YouTube and
internet.

259
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,200
That's why I use this internet system to educate
them,

260
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,580
to give them the basic concepts of freedom,

261
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,250
human rights, democracy,

262
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:12,220
so that, the change of their thinking will
take place step-by-step.

263
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,180
Not one day.

264
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,880
But, I think this kind of long process of
educating them,

265
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,480
would make some progress one day.

266
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,839
Do you think that they might get the courage
to defect

267
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,860
and leave the North Korean regime?

268
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
Yes.

269
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,300
What about inside North Korea?

270
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,240
I think the only way to accelerate

271
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
the process of the North Korean regime's collapse

272
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,050
is to let more and more North Korean people

273
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,480
defect the North Korean system.

274
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,560
That is the most effective and peaceful way

275
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,529
to bring the collapse of North Korean system.

276
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,670
What about people outside of North Korea?

277
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,970
Is there anything people can do?

278
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,970
Yes.

279
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,519
People should unite to support

280
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,050
North Korean defectors' journey to South Korea.

281
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,920
The world [inaudible] should unite together

282
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,550
to stop China's government policy of repatriation

283
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,079
and all the [inaudible] on this human rights
affront

284
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,500
should be united,

285
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,290
because whatever human rights issues of the
countries,

286
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,260
if we are all united, and talk each others
human rights case,

287
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,910
those totalitarian governments look each other,

288
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,829
so if one success of one country or one human
rights cases

289
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:40,320
can be very easily expand to make another
success

290
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,380
in other parts of the world.

291
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,040
So I think all the human rights,

292
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,340
the cases, are interrelated,

293
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,800
so that's why ... that is the reason why I'm
here.

294
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,360
Thank you so much
