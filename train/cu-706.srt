1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,620
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,420
On THIS episode of China Uncensored…

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,560
Hey, here’s the new script.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,560
Thanks, Shelley.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,700
“On this episode of China Uncensored,

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,440
top ten reasons why I love pandas.”

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,650
What?

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,650
What is this?

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,690
Why are you wearing that?

10
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,910
Oh, it's for our musical number,

11
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,170
“Pandas are Totes Adorable.”

12
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,170
Page 5.

13
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,960
Matt, can you bring Chris's hat?

14
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,820
Here you go.

15
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,340
Seamus, can you load up the new background?

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,600
That's very panda.

17
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,009
No, no.

18
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,810
This can't be happening.

19
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,010
Noooooooooo!!!!!!

20
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,610
Matt: He's fine.

21
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,210
He'll come around.

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,810
Is this on?

23
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,120
Ok, I snuck back into the studio

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,560
to record this episode.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,160
Shelley doesn't know I'm here.

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,220
But look, we really need your help.

27
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,010
You’ve probably heard of

28
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,600
the YouTube Adpocalypse.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,690
It’s something that’s affected a lot of
YouTubers,

30
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,059
not just me.

31
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,520
It all started back in February

32
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,880
when this British newspaper ran a story

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,080
about Google Ads being placed before

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,100
extremist videos.

35
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,470
It was a dumb article with a bunch of errors,

36
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,880
and huge exaggerations.

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,430
But it started a chain reaction,

38
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,830
where other media picked up the story,

39
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,440
and soon big brands like these

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,040
started freaking out,

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,230
and a lot of them left YouTube completely.

42
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,840
In response, YouTube and Google

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,409
tightened up their algorithms,

44
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:32,909
blocking ads from videos

45
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,400
that might be “controversial or sensitive.”

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,940
Which is so nice and vague,

47
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,670
it could apply to anything.

48
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,850
On top of that,

49
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,850
they created new safeguards

50
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,530
so advertisers can opt out

51
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,450
of running ads on any and all of these things.

52
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,740
It's a good thing that China Uncensored

53
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,450
doesn't cover anything about tragedy or conflict.

54
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,740
Or anything controversial or sensitive.

55
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,000
Uh...can you still see me out there?

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,700
Anyway, this resulted in what became known

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,400
as the Adpocalypse.

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,259
And China Uncensored has been getting incinerated.

59
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,289
Just to be clear,

60
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,289
in the last year,

61
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,750
we've made two other episodes about

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,379
how Youtube is demonetizing some of our videos,

63
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,670
like the one where we sailed to disputed territory

64
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,470
in the South China Sea on a Filipino fishing
boat.

65
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,560
That was before the Adpocalypse though.

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,969
Now it's much, much worse.

67
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:29,969


68
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,180
In fact, over the past month,

69
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,309
only about 1 out of every 10 video plays on
China Uncensored

70
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:37,779
has included an ad.

71
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,019
Overall we lost more than

72
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:42,260
80% of our Youtube ad revenue—

73
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,959
even though just as many people

74
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,099
are watching as before.

75
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,569
So basically, I can’t even pay one

76
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,700
part-time person minimum wage from this—

77
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,400
let alone pay my whole team,

78
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,169
that includes Matt, Shelley, Seamus,

79
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,290
and, well, me.

80
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,949
One solution is, of course,

81
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,560
to stop making my videos controversial.

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,340
Then YouTube might start placing ads

83
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,319
most of the time again.

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,120
But I don’t want to see China Uncensored

85
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,939
turn into a panda-hugging,

86
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,489
no-substance show any more than you do.

87
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,370
Of course, that’s fine if you’re the type
of person

88
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,209
who likes getting all your news

89
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,469
from the six mega-corporations

90
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,739
that own 90% of all media...

91
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,280
Conglomerates that all just happen to have

92
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,430
major business interests in China.

93
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,870
But I don't think you're that type of person.

94
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,560
You like China Uncensored the way it is:

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,409
Independent and Uncensored.

96
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,769
Standing up to the Communist Party

97
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,839
and its multi-billion-dollar propaganda.

98
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,839
I've met a lot of you now

99
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:42,299
through fan meet-ups and Google hangouts,

100
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,129
and email and Facebook messages,

101
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,900
and you're all pretty amazing.

102
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,840
Together, we called out Apple TV

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,199
for censoring our app in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

104
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,879
We rescued an innocent woman

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,779
from a Chinese detention center,

106
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:57,219
by calling the police until they let her go.

107
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,809
And, of course,

108
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,309
you all proved that you're way better at photoshop

109
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,870
than Chinese officials.

110
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,010
So we've done some great things together.

111
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,700
And we need your help again.

112
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,219
Because we can’t keep doing this show without
you.

113
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,069
I’ll let you in on a secret.

114
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,620
Normally, YouTubers don’t talk about

115
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,890
how much they earn.

116
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,160
But I’ll tell you:

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,720
I used to make an average of $1.95

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,070
per thousand views.

119
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,840
Not much, you say?

120
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,130
Well, after Adpocalypse,

121
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:35,570
I started making 
only 14 cents.

122
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,440
That’s per thousand views.

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
And it's hard to say

124
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,600
if it will ever go back up.

125
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,980
We might never get our old revenue level back,

126
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,810
despite China Uncensored violating

127
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,360
none of YouTube’s community guidelines.

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,790
And so here’s the sad bottom line:

129
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,570
If we can’t earn money,

130
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,920
we will need to shut down China Uncensored.

131
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,880
But if you think independent media

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,450
and uncensored information about China

133
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,980
is important,

134
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,350
and you want to keep hearing stuff

135
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,530
you can't get anywhere else,

136
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,320
there is a way you can help.

137
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,560
A couple years ago,

138
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,510
we launched a campaign on Patreon.

139
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,100
Patreon is a website that lets you

140
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,470
directly support your favorite shows or artists.

141
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,320
You can contribute a certain amount of money

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
per China Uncensored episode.

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,690
Thanks to the incredible support

144
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,880
of nearly 1,400 patrons so far,

145
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,750
we were able to supplement our Youtube revenue,

146
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,840
and do things like:

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,810
Hire Seamus, our video editor,

148
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,340
so we could make better videos for you.

149
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,570
Travel to Washington DC

150
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,830
to arm-wrestle a congressman.

151
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
Take that fishing boat

152
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,030
to disputed territory in the South China Sea

153
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,220
to mess with the Chinese Navy.

154
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,120
Stalk Xi Jinping outside Mar-a-Lago.

155
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,890
And lots more.

156
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,970
Like the time I got followed

157
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,950
by the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong.

158
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,950
What's that Shelley?

159
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm not supposed to talk about that one?

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,570
Okay, fine.

161
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,310
Wait...how did you even know

162
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,450
I was recording this?!

163
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,170
She knows everything!

164
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,330
Anyway, my point is,

165
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,960
after the Adpocalypse,

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
now Patreon can’t just be a supplement

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,750
to our income.

168
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,740
It has to be almost the whole thing.

169
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,030
And that’s why we need your contributions

170
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,600
to keep China Uncensored alive.

171
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,900
The Chinese Communist Party

172
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,320
hires tens of thousands of online trolls,

173
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,450
called the “Wu Mao,” or “50-Cent”
Army.

174
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,900
Those trolls are paid to leave

175
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,670
pro-CCP comments.

176
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,440
Well, I want you to join my China Uncensored

177
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,690
50-Cent Army!

178
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,030
At the end of this video,

179
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,320

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,820

level.

187
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,580
Then you can sign in with Facebook

188
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,610
or your email address.

189
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,670
And if you want to support us,

190
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,980
but are tight on cash,

191
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,330
you can set a monthly maximum amount to give.

192
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,710
Honestly, every dollar helps.

193
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,490
Pay with a Credit Card or PayPal,

194
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,870
enter your details,

195
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,870
and voilà!

196
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,830
You’re now a member of the exclusive

197
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,500
China Uncensored 50-Cent Army!

198
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,960
And that’s way better than working

199
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,760
as a troll for the CCP.

200
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,770
We can't rely on YouTube ad revenue anymore.

201
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,900
But we want to keep giving you

202
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,300
the kind of entertaining, uncensored information

203
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,800
that you can’t get on any other channel.

204
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Especially not the giant American media conglomerates.

205
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,170
And if we get enough support,

206
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,700
we’ll use it to make China Uncensored even
better.

207
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,510
We want to do more episodes,

208
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,680
expand our website,

209
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,050
cover different topics,

210
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,370
set up a podcast,

211
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,800
and lots more.

212
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
We have big plans,

213
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,400
and we can't let YouTube

214
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
stand in our way.

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Don't worry,

216
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,090
we’ll still keep uploading videos to YouTube
for now,

217
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,889
but we’ll also be giving additional,

218
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,450
exclusive content only to you,

219
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,889
our 50-Cent Army,

220
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,950
once you sign up on Patreon.

221
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,180
Like the story about the People's Liberation
Army

222
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,580
following me in Hong Kong.

223
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,510
Just don't tell Shelley.

224
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,669
So click the link at the end of this video

225
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,639

226
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,960
and help us keep China Uncensored, uncensored.

227
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
And unpanda-ed.

228
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,730
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

229
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,810
and with your support,

230
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,600
I’ll see you next time.

231
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,030
Hey, we need you to come rehearse

232
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,520
your solo dance number.

233
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,639
Help me!

234
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,870
