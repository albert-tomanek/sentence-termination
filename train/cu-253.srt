00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,959
Hiding Behind a mask

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:04,010
Protesters fight for justice

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,320
Against a police force

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,760
that can no longer be trusted

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,330
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,920
On Wednesday, June 12,

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,490
teachers and students showed up in force

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,370
around the seat of the Hong Kong government.

10
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,770
Their demand:

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,410
End a controversial extradition bill

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,220
that could allow the Hong Kong government

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,070
to send people from Hong Kong

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,779
to mainland China for trial.

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,740
You know, where people tend to get killed

16
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,720
for their organs.

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,680
The police responded with a kind of brutality

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,690
rarely seen in Hong Kong.

19
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,390
They fired 150 cans of tear gas.

20
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,590
They fired bean bags and rubber bullets,

21
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,649
hitting one man in the face.

22
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:45,079
He was later arrested at the hospital,

23
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,319
since police can access people’s information

24
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,030
directly from hospital records.

25
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,719
It was a horrifying night that left many traumatized.

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,390
And helped spark a 2 million person strong
march

27
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,620
only a few days later.

28
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,289
Now protesters wear masks

29
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,440
to hide their identities from the authorities.

30
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Fighting for justice,

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,540
while hiding in the shadows.

32
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,540
Like Batman.

33
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,970
But with less weapons,

34
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,660
and more public support.

35
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,800
During Sunday’s 2 million strong march,

36
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,250
I spoke with two protesters

37
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,150
who were there the night of June 12.

38
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,650
Why were you out on the streets

39
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,570
protesting on Wednesday night?

40
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,680
On Wednesday night,

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,510
I just feel like Carrie Lam can not hear our
voice,

42
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,470
and our voice of being neglect.

43
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,930
1.03 million ordinary citizens like myself,

44
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,640
went onto the streets,

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,510
and our voice was crystal clear.

46
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,430
We want the government to withdraw

47
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,160
their extradition bill to China.

48
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
So, what did you see that night?

49
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Actually, I was not there at the afternoon.

50
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
I just came back home to dress up

51
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
and clean up myself and I opened the television

52
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,320
and I saw the very shocking picture.

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,710
The people was shot by the police.

54
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,450
They very clearly to see the people shoot
to the heart.

55
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,220
This is really shocking.

56
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,540
And they attacked the journalists,

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,520
the riot police rush over there

58
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,280
and the people keep going, keep going, moving,

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,789
everywhere is tear gas and I feel very, very
shocked.

60
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,879
I hesitate a while and dress up again and
go out again.

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,349
So you were initially kind of scared to go
out there?

62
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,060
Yeah, really scared.

63
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,220
But I just don't want to fight alone.

64
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,320
What happened when the police turned violent?

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,420
Protestors sent out a clear message to Carrie
Lam.

66
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,720
They need to withdraw the bill by 3.30 on
Wednesday,

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,340
otherwise we'll occupy the Legislative Counsil.

68
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,950
However, our voice was not heard,

69
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,499
so students and protestors surround the Legislative
Counsil,

70
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:54,180
and police just like burst out tear gas, with
batons.

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,150
Of course, there are some chaos

72
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,209
in between protesters and police,

73
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,829
but the majority of the students there

74
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,969
were protesting very peacefully.

75
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,640
Suddenly I heard bam,

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,909
and people were screaming,

77
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:12,120
“Someone got shot!

78
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,799
Someone got shot!”,

79
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,220
so I was furious and curious at the same time.

80
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,769
And I saw the medics carry injured person
out

81
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,280
with a big wound all over his face,

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,069
with really thick blood.

83
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,419
The blood was so thick and it leave

84
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:36,930
a big stain on the ground.

85
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,810
So the police force just sent out,

86
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,069
it's called Special Tactical Squad, STS, AKA
Raptors.

87
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,331
So, the Raptors just keep beating up students
in the front line.

88
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:45,331
And that one protestor was hit with a rubber
bullet, correct?

89
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,670
The one who got hit by the rubber bullet

90
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,780
was unwarned before they opened fire.

91
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,079
To me, this is against human rights,

92
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,379
and I think this a war crime.

93
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,790
What do you think of the police response?

94
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,150
I don't have much emotion to police

95
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:05,049
because I realized that after the Umbrella
Movement,

96
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,969
I just think that they are just like machine.

97
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,430
Just follow the order.

98
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,969
I can't believe the police want to shoot our
head,

99
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,290
must be someone ordered them to do so

100
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,410
and just follow the order.

101
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,250
So when you were there on Wednesday night,

102
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,010
and the police were firing rubber bullets
and tear gas,

103
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,010
how did you feel?

104
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,010
I feel furious.

105
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,010
I feel disappointed.

106
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,070
Right after the Special Tactical force

107
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,000
beat up students in the front line,

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,460
Protestors were not doing anything provocative,

109
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,180
and we were not provoking the police.

110
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,120
While protestors were being squeezed in between,

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,360
like sandwiches,

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,140
the Raptors just kept throwing tear gas into
the crowd.

113
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,950
I see a lot of families,

114
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,650
a lot of young students,

115
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,030
like five foot little girls were there.

116
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,860
I mean, Hong Kong police force, ask yourself,

117
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,380
you've got families,

118
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,480
how can you do that to ordinary citizens,

119
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,460
and tax payer like us?

120
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,010
So, what do you think of Carrie Lam

121
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,030
calling it organized riots?

122
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,440
To be honest,

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,800
they are just ordinary students,

124
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,980
from my observation.

125
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,170
Many of them are high school or students in
university.

126
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,700
I don't see how ordinary students like them

127
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,210
could be an organized crime.

128
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,210
We are not talking about triads

129
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,720
or any terrorist organization.

130
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,830
So, Carrie Lam,

131
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,760
you should really watch your word.

132
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,780
For those watching,

133
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,720
why do you want to keep your face hidden?

134
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:50,580
Because now the police said this event is
riot, yeah?

135
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,150
And this is a very serious crime,

136
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,660
several years of this, so I have to-

137
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
In jail.

138
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
In jail.

139
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
So I have to cover our face

140
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
and every Hong Kong people very shocked

141
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
because we just want to go to Tamar Park to
assemble.

142
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,660
Maybe some people want to charge,

143
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
the police want to storm the building,

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
but most of them is just sitting there.

145
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
They got the family,

146
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,660
they got adult,

147
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
so many teenager,

148
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
most of them is very peaceful.

149
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,660
And the police tried to shoot us,

150
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
do the tear gas,

151
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,660
and also came this as the riot.

152
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
I can't accept that.

153
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
So why do you want to hide your face?

154
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,660
I want to stay anonymous because Hong Kong
right now

155
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,660
is fill of white terror.

156
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,660
The hospital assisting the police

157
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
to make arrests in emergency room,

158
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,300
so people need to be really careful,

159
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,410
and the police are start making a lot of arrests
now.

160
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:32,540
So I want to stay anonymous because I'm afraid.

161
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,680
What do you think about Carrie Lam

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,400
saying she's postponed the Extradition Bill?

163
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,690
Is that enough?

164
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,350
She lie, of course.

165
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,660
She lied.

166
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,040
I just think she is not the someone

167
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,440
to decide to go this bill,

168
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,280
but she have to listen to order from someone.

169
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,220
I don't know what is someone.

170
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,620
Maybe the country, maybe someone, the leadership.

171
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,020
But her response really, really, really show,
yeah.

172
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,840
So you're not satisfied with Carrie Lam saying

173
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,900
they're going to postpone the extradition
bill?

174
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,330
There's a big difference between postpone
and suspend.

175
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,680
Are you worried about the future,

176
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,530
both for yourself and Hong Kong?

177
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,530
Of course.

178
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,530
Of course.

179
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,750
We are quite disappointed at this place.

180
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,150
After everything you saw on Wednesday night,

181
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,520
are you afraid to be back here today?

182
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Of course.

183
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,350
Of course, I scared, everybody's scared.

184
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,660
We just citizen, we have no power.

185
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,140
We are not armed, but we have to.

186
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,120
We just have to.

187
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,890
And are you nervous being here again today,

188
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,060
after everything that happened?

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,480
I am really panicked.

190
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,900
I am paranoid.

191
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,020
And what are your feelings about the future

192
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,840
for Hong Kong and for yourself?

193
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,120
To be honest, if it keeps going,

194
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,790
if it keeps progressing this way,

195
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,100
I don't see no future in Hong Kong.

196
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,740
I feel like the police,

197
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,950
the government are trying to end our future.

198
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,100
Students are our younger generation

199
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,260
and we need to protect them, educate them,

200
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,160
but not forcefully spoon-feed them what they
think

201
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,780
we should learn.

202
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,640
It's all about critical thinking.

203
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,360
Thank you very much.

204
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,720
Thank you.

205
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,520
Thank you very much for joining.

206
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,040
And thank you for watching.

207
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,000
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell,

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,440
reporting from Hong Kong.
