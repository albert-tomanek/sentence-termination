1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,080
Two countries...

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,870
both called “China”.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,270
Taiwan and China are not the same...

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,320
In more ways than you might realize.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,940
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,680
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,320
This is China.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,460
But it’s complicated,

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,260
since there are two governments that claim
to

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,890
represent the legitimate China.

11
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,770
After the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911,

12
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,900
China was known as the Republic of China,

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,769
led by the KMT.

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,769


15
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:30,769
Until 1949,

16
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,790
when the KMT lost a civil war against the
Communists.

17
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,770
Then they fled to the island province of Taiwan,

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,240
where they set up the new government of the
Republic of China.

19
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,940
Today, Taiwan is still officially the Republic
of China.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,130
And the rest of China is the People’s Republic
of China,

21
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,840
which is still communist.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,070
Which you can tell because Mao Zedong’s
portrait

23
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,130
is still in Tiananmen Square.

24
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,500
So is his embalmed corpse.

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,170
But a lot has changed since the Civil War

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,230
ended seven decades ago.

27
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,070
Taiwan—and what’s now called mainland
China—

28
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,970
have become very different.

29
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,430
Here are five major differences.

30
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,430
Number 5

31
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,780
Chinese Writing

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,360
In George Orwell's classic 1984,

33
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,700
the totalitarian party creates Newspeak,

34
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,880
a modified form of English created to control
how people think.

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,980
It was doubleplusgood.

36
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,280
In mainland China, the Communist Party dramatically
changed

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,740
the traditional written language that had
been used

38
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,750
throughout much of Chinese history.

39
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,450
They replaced it with simplified Chinese characters.

40
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,820
So for instance, this is the traditional Chinese
character for love.

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,010
This radical here means heart.

42
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,850
The Communists did this,

43
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,080
and left us with the simplified character
for love.

44
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,500
It was truly heartless.

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,450
The idea of modifying Chinese characters didn’t
start with

46
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,110
the Chinese Communist Party.

47
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,650
But Mao Zedong originally wanted to take it
to an extreme—

48
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,080
completely getting rid of Chinese characters
and replacing them

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,390
with an alphabet of Roman letters,

50
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,840
like the ones we use for English.

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,240
Here’s an example of one possible romanization
system

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,630
that the Communists looked into using as a
replacement.

53
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,340
But it didn’t get that far.

54
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,770
And we have one person to thank for that:

55
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,770
Stalin.

56
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,520
That’s not a joke.

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,490
Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union suggested
to Mao

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,400
that the Chinese people should have

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,930
their own national written language.

60
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,200
And Mao changed his mind.

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,810
Although during the Cultural Revolution in
the 60s,

62
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,400
Mao did try to further simplify Chinese characters
again,

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,100
but it didn’t work.

64
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,580
So nowadays mainland China uses simplified
Chinese,

65
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,880
but it’s not so simplified that it makes
it completely impossible

66
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,290
to read traditional characters.

67
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,150
Just much harder.

68
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,330
On the surface,

69
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,370
simplifying Chinese characters was to encourage
literacy.

70
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,580
But getting rid of traditional characters

71
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,940
also disconnected people

72
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,410
from their history and culture.

73
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,560
If the majority of citizens can only read
simplified characters,

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,830
then they can only read books

75
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,140
the Communist Party allows to be published.

76
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
But in Taiwan,

77
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,470
they’ve used traditional Chinese characters
all along.

78
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,120
Which means, in Taiwan,

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,450
people can more easily read ancient Chinese
texts.

80
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,850
Not that they do, since,

81
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,060
why bother when Taiwan has Netflix now.

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,540
But like I said, the Communist Party claimed

83
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,250
they enforced simplified Chinese to improve
literacy rates.

84
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,540
I mean, those traditional characters are so
complicated!

85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,330
Well, as of 2015,

86
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,650
in Mainland China only 3.6% of adults can’t
read and write.

87
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,030
In Taiwan, though—that number is only 1.6%.

88
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,880
Less than half.

89
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,190
Now there’s probably a lot of reasons for
that,

90
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,819
but it also shows you don’t have to sacrifice

91
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,140
your country’s cultural heritage for people

92
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,260
to be able to read and write.

93
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
Number 4

94
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,860
Bike Sharing

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,950
Who doesn’t love a good bike share program?

96
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,110
That’s at least one thing both sides of
the Taiwan Strait

97
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,200
can agree on!

98
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,840
But, there are some major differences.

99
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,890
Look at all the neat,

100
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,400
orderly bikes safely placed in their docks
in Taiwan.

101
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,690
But isn’t it a pain to have to take your
bike back to a dock?

102
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,440
That’s why in Mainland China,

103
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,030
they have bike share 2.0!

104
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,739
Every bike has a GPS chip so you can unlock
it

105
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,039
with your mobile phone and just leave it anywhere.

106
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,689
The problem is….

107
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,979
people really do leave them everywhere.

108
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,620
Bikes pile up for the more than 500 bike share
companies

109
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,710
competing in the country.

110
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,320
And it’s gotten to be a bit of a mess.

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,770
But hey, at least taking a bike keeps air
pollution low.

112
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,569
Wait, no.

113
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,059
You know, I think I’ll take Taiwan’s bike
share 1.0.

114
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,059
Number 3

115
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:44,059
Temples

116
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:49,219
The thing that struck me about Taiwan

117
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,460
is just how many temples there are.

118
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,219
You see them everywhere,

119
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:56,669
and you can just walk right in without paying
some entrance fee.

120
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,810
And people inside are still engaged in the
kind of ritual worship

121
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,219
they’ve been doing for hundreds of years.

122
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,211
Now this is not so much the case in Mainland
China.

123
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:09,240
Sure, China used to have tons of temples everywhere.

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,330
But then Mao Zedong launched the Cultural
Revolution,

125
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,469
specifically to destroy what he called the
Four Olds:

126
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:19,680
Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and
Old Ideas.

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,539
That included old Temples.

128
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,190
It’s hard to know exactly how much was destroyed

129
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,699
during those 10 years.

130
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,619
But it was a lot.

131
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,419
Of course, recently a number of Chinese temples

132
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:30,930
have been restored.

133
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,250
But they’re meant to be tourists sites,

134
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,509
where, in the great tradition of the Buddha,

135
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,039
they’re being used to make money for communist
officials.

136
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,030
Like the Jokhang Temple in Tibet.

137
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,889
The entrance fee is about 12 bucks.

138
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,129
Pay another 12 bucks and they’ll let you
take photos.

139
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:46,589
And let’s just say,

140
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,419
a lot of ancient artifacts you see in museums
in China today,

141
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,039
might not be too authentic.

142
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,580
The fact that a lot of those artifacts had
Simplified Chinese writing

143
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,430
should have been a clue.

144
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,460
Number 2

145
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,460
Democracy

146
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,690
This should be a no brainer.

147
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,740
In Taiwan in October and November,

148
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
everywhere you looked,

149
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,129
there were signs of a vibrant democracy.

150
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,219
Campaign banners,

151
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,759
even weird loudspeaker vans that drove through
the streets.

152
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,219
Taiwan’s been a full democracy since 1992.

153
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,559
People in Taiwan care about their government.

154
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:23,599
And they want their say in how things are
run.

155
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,330
But in mainland China,

156
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,909
the government doesn’t need to worry about

157
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,240
such nonsense as “democracy.”

158
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,520
It’s already the People’s Republic of
China.

159
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,159
It has the interests of the people at heart.

160
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,470
That must be why it doesn’t allow people
to vote.

161
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,590
It would be such a waste of time!

162
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,469
And besides, there’s the National People’s
Congress

163
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,030
that does the voting on behalf of the people.

164
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,289
And it’s so efficient!

165
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,520
It has never once voted down a bill

166
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,400
proposed by the Chinese Communist Party.

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,620
And finally Number 1

168
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Genocide

169
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,319
The government of Taiwan may have been

170
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,460
a bit authoritarian in the past.

171
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,649
But now it has a strict no genocide policy.

172
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,119
So when it comes to genocide,

173
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:07,719
the Chinese Communist Party really is so much
better at it.

174
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,020
The Communist Party has killed off tons of
groups

175
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,999
during its 70 years in power.

176
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,710
Intellectuals, democracy advocates, Tibetans...

177
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,219
But let’s look at one of the biggest groups

178
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,939
being genocided right now: Falun Gong.

179
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,099
A spiritual practice, widely popular in China.

180
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,679
In the 90s, the Chinese government celebrated
Falun Gong

181
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,369
in state-run newspapers...

182
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:28,659
And even invited its founder

183
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,460
to give a lecture at the Public Security Bureau.

184
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,879
But eventually,

185
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,129
the communist leader decided:

186
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,129
You know what?

187
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,059
There are too many people practicing.

188
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:38,800
Let’s round them up.

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
And kill them.

190
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,569
No, no, not just kill.

191
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,319
Kill them and take their organs,

192
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,419
so we can make a profit!

193
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,749
I mean, what’s the point of genocide

194
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,339
unless you can profit from it, right?

195
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,369
But in Taiwan—

196
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,210
which shares the same language and cultural
heritage,

197
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,619
but with democracy instead of one-party authoritarianism—

198
00:07:56,619 --> 00:08:00,119
Falun Gong is practiced everywhere.

199
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,069
And what’s the point of freedom if you can’t

200
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:09,110
also protest genocide somewhere else?

201
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,879
Those are five differences between China and
Taiwan.

202
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,539
But there’s actually many more.

203
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,379
So let me know in the comment section below

204
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,080
if you’d like me to do another episode with
more differences.

205
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
And remember,

206
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,300
