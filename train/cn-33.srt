1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,776
This is the Technical Difficulties, we’re
playing ‘Citation Needed’.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,020
Joining me today,
he reads books y'know, it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,580
I thought o'summat on t'train, but it’s
gone now.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,590
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,500
So in the end I just stocked up on booze from
the Tesco’s,

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,200
had a massive dump and went to sleep.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,259
And the bounciest man on the internet, 
Matt Gray.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,700
And this is what a live studio audience applauding
sounds like!

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,300
And today we are talking about 'Acoustic Kitty'.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,860
Is it when you don’t put the jack in before
you squeeze it?

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,500
What?

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,140
Acoustic kitty.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,390
Electric kitty!

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,890
Right, yes.

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,260
You’re playing a cat with a feedback pedal,
I get where you’re going with that.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,160
I didn’t get the 'jack' bit and I thought
it was like a car-jack or something.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,000
No, just grab the tail.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,179
No, that’s elevated kitty.

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,400
Yes, if you did it with a cat’s tail they
do get, generally,

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,660
a little bit higher each time.

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
Top Cat!

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,460
And when you take it out, low cat.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,560
Is it like some kind of loud bank?

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, get out.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
Get out!

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,870
I’ve just worked that one out.

27
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,870
Get out.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,360
You’ve going to have to explain that one.

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,780
Isn’t a kitty like a fund or something?

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,900
Yes, it is.

31
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,300
That got a boo!

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,580
I’m all about the groaning today!

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,860
Today, may I say, on behalf of us and the
entire audience,

34
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,140
you are the f***ing worst.

35
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,880
Oh, harsh(!)

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,310
Surely every cat is acoustic?

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,060
I'm telling you, man, not necessarily!

38
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,880
So since Bob Dylan electrified his cat, then…?

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,330
You’re actually in roughly the right era.

40
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,330
So 1960s.

41
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,330
Yes, absolutely.

42
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,270
And it’s an actual cat.

43
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,650
Yes, it is an actual cat.

44
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,240
But, it’s not like cats were silent until
the '60s.

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,820
It’s not like no one had ever, I don't know,
surprised one

46
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,780
or stood on its tail,
or actually not fed one

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,120
because, trust me, they are f***ing acoustic
when they’ve not been fed.

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,380
I know, but until 1916 they used to have another,
smaller cat

49
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,740
following them around with a series of placards
saying “meow” on them.

50
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,780
Until, one day, the first cat burped,
and went...

51
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,280
And they found their first talkie.

52
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,760
I just had the worst and best idea
at the same time.

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,860
Teach your cat to hook a little flag onto
its tail

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,260
that says what it actually means.

55
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,460
How would you train the cat in the first place?

56
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,580
One of the flags it would need would be the
flag to say,

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,100
“Don’t train me to hold up flags!”

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,640
Can I just say, in the five seconds that I
had there to work this s*** out,

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,500
at no point had I thought this through.

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,690
That’s abundantly clear!

61
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,780
Right, I thought, “Oh, you could do that”.

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,970
By the time you started going,
I went, “Oh, you really can’t.”

63
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,970
It’s fine.

64
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,400
That’s how the process of discovery happens.

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Well!

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Look before you leap.

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,319
Don’t nail flags to cats without considering
the consequences.

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,680
I did not mention nails!

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,940
I said hook.

70
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,560
It’s a little thing like that, like you
get on a-

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,440
What? A ringworm?

72
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
No!

73
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,980
I know the thing, it’s on the top of an
orange juice carton.

74
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,960
One of those-

75
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,520
- Ring-pull?
- Yes!

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,300
How will that hold a flag on?

77
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,620
- Glue!
- You want a ring-pull feline?

78
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,600
Why just not nail it to the cat then?

79
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,260
A ring-pull's for taking things off!

80
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,180
Yes, but I’m finding another use for it,
for f***’s sake!

81
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,140
Oh, you’re recycling now!

82
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,560
Yes!

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,320
- First buy your orange juice.
- Yes! Yes!

84
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,600
- Pull the tab, place to one side.
- Yes!

85
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,820
Drink the orange juice, cut the flag out of
the orange juice…

86
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,920
So hold on, this is basically a cat saying,

87
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,630
“orange juice” for the rest of its life?

88
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,370
On the one side it says orange juice...

89
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,370
...on the other side it says nothing!

90
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,110
On the other it says, “Food” or, “Toilet”
or, “I hate you” or, “Ow.”

91
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,650
And you’re going to train the cat to get
a different one...?

92
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,780
Yes, I am, there’ll be...

93
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,120
But they can’t use the scissors to cut out
the orange juice carton!

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
They have a HUMAN HELPER!

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,500
You haven’t thought this through!

96
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,120
I know!

97
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,540
Stop judging me!

98
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,760
I have all these ideas, all the time!

99
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,860
You’ve managed to catch one in the nth-of-a-second

100
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,490
that the idea existed as a thing in my mind.

101
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,819
Anybody else want to take a swing,

102
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,510
just while we’ve got him on the run?

103
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,510
While he's down?

104
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,600
The thing is, amidst all that, Gary…

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
- Oh god.
- Don’t tell me he’s got a point.

106
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,680
You were talking about terrible ideas that
briefly sounded like a good thing,

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,060
and I’m giving you a point for it.

108
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,200
Yes!

109
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,700
Here we go…

110
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,560
Isn't there a thing in 'Monty Python' where
they hit mice to make an instrument?

111
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,510
Is that like an acoustic kitty but with-

112
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,210
You’re thinking the wrong way round here.

113
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,380
You’re thinking production of noise.

114
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,630
A listening cat?

115
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,220
Espionage?

116
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
F***!

117
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,520
So, you feed the cat LSD to achieve mind control,

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,169
put on your tinfoil hat and send it to listen.

119
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,020
- You’ve got one part of that right...
- Tinfoil hat!

120
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,140
and it’s not the LSD or the tinfoil hat.

121
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,620
Tinfoil cat!

122
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,319
So, they’ve strapped a tape recorder or
something to a cat

123
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,650
and let it wander in places.

124
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,940
A big reel-to-reel on the back.

125
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,060
A big Uher on the back!

126
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,840
I’ll give you the point,

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,520
they did attach something to it but it wasn’t
a big reel-to-reel tape.

128
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,160
Oh, it’d be a radio transmitter...

129
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,240
Rockets!

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,460
Yes…

131
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
No.

132
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,039
It’s got to get there, and they don’t
walk far.

133
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,039
You’ve absolutely right.

134
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,039
You’ve also used the word ‘strap’,

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,689
I’m giving you a point for radio transmitter,

136
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:05,920
but strap is definitely not right.

137
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,220
Implant?

138
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,080
- Absolutely right.
- What?!

139
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Apparently, I’m the sensible one this
episode.

140
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:11,969
Yes.

141
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:15,569
So, me putting my cat in a dress
for medical reasons is weird

142
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,930
but implanting a microphone in a cat,
totes normal.

143
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,699
That’s the way today’s going for everybody.

144
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,289
Yes, in an hour-long procedure
a veterinary surgeon implanted

145
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,720
a microphone in the cat’s ear canal

146
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,600
Oh...

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,500
a small radio transmitter
at the base of its skull

148
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,160
Oh!

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
and a thin wire into its fur.

150
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Agh!

151
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,340
That’s what the cat said.

152
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,810
I like the fact it’s a perfectly normal
looking cat after this,

153
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,479
apart from the aerial with the red flashing
light on top.

154
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,010
Who might’ve done that?

155
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,540
Is it... is it... is it Russia?

156
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,500
No.

157
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Is it... is it... is it America?

158
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,260
Yes.

159
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,140
Yes, it was the CIA Directorate
of Science and Technology.

160
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,659
How the hell did the CIA manage to out-weird
Russian intelligence?

161
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,419
They probably didn’t, but we don’t know
what the Russians were up to,

162
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,610
because of Russian intelligence.

163
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,430
While they were implanting
microphones in cats

164
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,039
the Russians were firing theirs into
the icy vacuum of space, let’s face it.

165
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,539
With even bigger antennas!

166
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,990
Yes, it was the CIA from America.

167
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,080
The idea being that the cat
would wander into a place

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,759
and just be surreptitiously recording things.

169
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,180
Let me guess, the cat didn’t wander where
they wanted it to wander.

170
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,280
Because it's a cat.

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Yes.

172
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,469
What they did they have to do another operation
to get around?

173
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:29,659
Oh no, this isn’t the old woman
who swallowed a fly is it?

174
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,979
They don’t end up sending an elephant in
to distract from the cat?

175
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,860
They’ve invented, by the way, the Cyberman
cat there, incidentally!

176
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,750
Because they've been replacing parts.

177
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,750
Make them bionic.

178
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,059
But, how can you…

179
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,080
I can only go in grim places to what they
had to do to fix…

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
They bypassed the cat’s sense of hunger,
apparently.

181
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,260
- Oh, for... how?!
- What?!

182
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,700
- Grim.
- I’m just quoting what it says here.

183
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,840
It is grim.

184
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,699
Cats are always hungry.

185
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,650
Yes, that was one of the problems with it.

186
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,080
The CIA really know what tuna sounds like.

187
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,560
(Is that what cats eat?
I’ve never fed one.)

188
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,060
So, how much did this cost?

189
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:06,629
To get a cat, to do the research-

190
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,030
Well, the cat’s cheap.

191
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,199
Yes, to be fair, the cat was probably cheap
but the entire project here,

192
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,990
according to Victor Marchetti,
former CIA officer,

193
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,069
how much did they spend on a... on a cat?

194
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,229
Was it a dollar sign
with the word "ridiculous" after it?

195
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:24,310
Hang on, Price is Right rules?

196
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,979
Yeah, Price is Right rules, closest one without
going over.

197
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,270
We’re in dollars, yes?

198
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,270
Yes, we’re in US dollars.

199
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,490
US dollars in the 1960s,

200
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,710
so it’s about half what you have now.

201
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,889
I’m going to say half-a-million.

202
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:34,899
He’s saying half-a-million.

203
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,580
“One million dollars.”

204
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,430
Now, we know what you do now.

205
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,310
Is he going to do the $1 bid,
or is he going to go high?

206
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,009
Well, I’m not going high, I was going to
say $150,000

207
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,249
but you pointed to him first.

208
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,320
Well, you’re correct
but you’re not even close, $20m.

209
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,600
F***!

210
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,569
So they got the cat.

211
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,979
No way, really?

212
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,099
They implanted things in the cat.

213
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,099
Where did they release the cat?

214
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,159
Okay, not... surely not in the abroads?

215
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,500
No, it was in America, I’ll give you that.

216
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Embassy Row, if there is such a thing,

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,449
in New York, or Washington or something.

218
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:10,629
Yes, you’re absolutely right, the Soviet
compound in Washington DC.

219
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,990
So, someone walked up to the Soviet compound,

220
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,253
- bunged a cat over the wall...
- threw a cat at it!

221
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:16,580
Or was it parachuted in?

222
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,780
No, the first mission was to eavesdrop on
two men in a park out...

223
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,420
...sorry, parachuted?!

224
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,160
Yeah!

225
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,600
I’m not entirely convinced that a cat is
going to be really good at pulling its rip-cord.

226
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,820
It’s coming from low-altitude, it’ll have
the wire that...

227
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
- It's a static line.
- Oh, wire attached to it.

228
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,880
Ha-ha!

229
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,420
Not so stupid now.

230
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,000
They released it.

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,490
It did wander towards the park bench.

232
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,490
What happened?

233
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,899
It died of hunger because they’d bypassed
its hunger centre.

234
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,870
I was going to say,
they bypassed its hunger centre,

235
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,520
but it'd go in to the kitchen
and eat all the lovely tuna

236
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,800
that had been left cooling on a window-sill,
or something like that.

237
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,290
Put a wee flag up saying, “I’m a spy.”

238
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,880
Did it immediately have a dump?

239
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
Yeah, mark its territory.

240
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,480
And that’s all that was recorded.

241
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Marking its territory, yes.

242
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
It is, sadly, a little bit harsher.

243
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,060
Oh, hit by a car.

244
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,300
Yes, hit by a taxi immediately.

245
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,100
Oh, we're all the worst...

246
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,560
The twenty million dollar cat...

247
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,800
“We can rebuild it!...
oh actually, never mind.”

248
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,980
...was hit by a taxi almost immediately.

249
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,300
Are these guys with dark glasses,

250
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,250
dark car parked over the round from the compound,

251
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,079
releasing the cat out of the boot of the car...

252
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,860
"Good work agent, and now we..."

253
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,300
The former Director of the CIA Technical Service

254
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,490
said that’s an urban myth, and the actual
problem with it was what?

255
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,490
It walked off.

256
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,920
Yes, training the cat, I’ll give you the
point for that.

257
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,240
The project was considered to be a failure
and a total loss.

258
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
What happened to the cat?

259
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,480
Well, you just said it got run over.

260
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,830
Did it have a proper military burial?

261
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,449
No, this is the alternate story.

262
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:46,449
This is what the CIA-

263
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:51,959
Did it defect to work for the other side?

264
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,449
I like that idea because clearly the Russians
have better tuna.

265
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:59,120
It goes through the gate, on the other side
is a Russian Blue.

266
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,470
“Welcome, Agent Tiddles.”

267
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
If the Russians had better tuna...

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,560
they’d be able to pick up on the frequencies
transmitted by it better.

269
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Tuner, oh…

270
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,500
Radio tuner, oh my god.

271
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,620
Four. It’s passed the boundary.

272
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,600
Snuck over.

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,020
Yes, I’m sorry, it’s an ugly four, though,

274
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,760
it really is, it’s off the edge.

275
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,640
According to that CIA Director,

276
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,320
what happened to that cat once they ended
the program?

277
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,410
Did it just go and live with other people
all the time,

278
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,839
picking up on hilarious conversations

279
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,699
that could be made into an excellent film
now I’ve just thought of it?

280
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,321
There’s a cracking kids’ book in that.

281
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:36,321
Yes.

282
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,880
Yes, the equipment was taken out of the cat,
the cat was resewn.

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
Hang on, that’s two massive things you’ve
just skipped over there.

284
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,480
One, "the equipment was taken out of the cat"
is a sentence

285
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,380
that I’m pretty hopeful would only be heard
in this room today,

286
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,120
and, “The cat was sewn up.”

287
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,810
Yes, it was, and lived a long and happy life
afterwards.

288
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,900
I’m going with hypothesis A somehow.

289
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,880
I can only imagine that it actually
got shipped off to Portmeirion

290
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,990
and it’s now wearing a little blue blazer

291
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,920
and being chased by just a normal sized balloon
down a beach.

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
It’s a slow burning
‘Prisoner’ reference there.

293
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
That was a slow burn.

294
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,500
This is getting some weird reactive wave.

295
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,420
Anyone who’s seen ‘The Prisoner’,
that landed, that was good.

296
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,930
I’m envisioning the whole thing now.

297
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,639
You can see the whole title sequence,
can't you?

298
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,540
Entertain yourselves, this is a good half-hour
for me now.

299
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,910
I have managed to pull up here something from

300
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,329
the actual National Archives
of the United States,

301
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:35,390
a redacted document.

302
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,490
About a cat?

303
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,440
What did they think they could do with cats?

304
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,720
Distractionating!

305
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,180
While a better trained animal

306
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,199
actually goes and does the listening.

307
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,300
What, like a chimp with a little microphone?

308
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,550
And a suit, and shaved.

309
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,190
Obviously, you’ve got to blend in.

310
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,319
In fact, just a small person.

311
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:49,860
We could even use full-sized people.

312
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,540
We could call them spies!

313
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,949
“That’s a step too far, agent.”

314
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,949
“Okay...!”

315
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,819
I suppose, the only thing a cat can do is

316
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,329
just wander in unexpected and everyone be
fine with that.

317
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,420
Yes, you’re absolutely right, trained to
walk short distances.

318
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,220
That was $20m and high-tech cat bug equipment-

319
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,400
- To go 5 metres?
- Yes.

320
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
And only if they wanted to go that way anyway.

321
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,600
Why don't you just lob it?

322
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Again, however, and I’m quoting here,

323
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,490
“The environmental and security factors
force us to conclude that,

324
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,940
“for our purposes, it would not be practical.”

325
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,440
“But, damn it, we tried”, basically.

326
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,870
Have you ever had an essay where you know
your conclusion is terrible?

327
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,870
Yes.

328
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,129
But you have to write a conclusion anyway.

329
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,129
Yes.

330
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,220
“The work done on this problem over the
years reflects great credit

331
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,709
“on the personnel who guided it,
particularly... 'redacted',

332
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:47,580
“whose energy and imagination could be models
for scientific pioneers.”

333
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,260
S***, I probably know the guy, yeah.

334
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,899
There is a connection here to an article labelled
‘remote control animal’.

335
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:58,899
What?!

336
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:02,319
Is that an animal used to remote control or
remote control of an animal?

337
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:03,319
Remote control of an animal.

338
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,319
Ohh…

339
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:05,319
'Cos the other way round they use pigeons
for bombs.

340
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,800
I was going to say, pigeons in bombs.

341
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,290
The Brits did that, I think.

342
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,470
They put a pigeon in a bomb and they trained
it to peck on cities.

343
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,470
Yes, you’re absolutely right.

344
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,490
It pecked on a bit of glass and which bit
of glass they did

345
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,611
pulled a lever which made the bomb turn,

346
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:19,839
and then it went down to the ground.

347
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,569
It landed.

348
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,560
Well done there, that was worth it.

349
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
So, it wasn’t that?

350
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,360
No, it wasn’t,
but that’s a brilliant story.

351
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,980
Yes, it was BF Skinner’s pigeon controlled
guided bomb.

352
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,130
How do you think that worked?

353
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,370
What, for the pigeon it sounds pretty s***
either way, I'll be honest.

354
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,300
What did we call this weapon, incidentally?

355
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Er, Project Pigeon.

356
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
That’s a shame.

357
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
Clever. Clever.

358
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,980
I was going to go for the V-Coo.

359
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,879
Did Churchill not like the idea?

360
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,410
Is this one of these where you could flick
a coin

361
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,730
and on Monday he’d like it and on Tuesday
he’d hate it?

362
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,040
"Our problem was no one would take us seriously."

363
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,780
Well, if you’re going to call it
Operation Hilarious Pigeon Bomb,

364
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,230
or whatever they called it…!

365
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,100
There was also the Bat Bomb.

366
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,819
They attached incendiary bombs to bats

367
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:10,519
and then dropped a casing with 1000 bats on
woodland.

368
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,110
F... what?!

369
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,860
Incendiary bomb: thus.

370
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,620
Bat: that.

371
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,850
Small incendiary bomb.

372
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,970
What, like matches basically then?

373
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,970
Firecrackers.

374
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,040
Yes, the idea being that it was on somewhere

375
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,139
that had a lot of tinder and kindling,

376
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:27,709
and if you have hundreds of bats, one of them’s
going to find the target.

377
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,500
- That is horrific.
- Yes.

378
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,700
I like the fact that the first time
they tested it

379
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,310
they're flying over the target, the pulled
the lever on the bomb bay,

380
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,490
and the bats are just hung upside down in
the bomber.

381
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,339
And on the clipboard he just writes,

382
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,600
“maybe try night-time”
or something like that.

383
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,660
It’s just a bloke in a white coat.

384
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
“Hmm, yes.”

385
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,000
“Bats insufficiently motivated.”

386
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,720
It did, apparently, work.

387
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,740
Astonishingly enough.

388
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,800
What, dropping 1000 small incendiary bombs
caused a fire?

389
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
One is stunned!

390
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,680
The bats seem incidental to this process actually,
right now.

391
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,629
They were more about distribution, where did
it set fire to first?

392
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:05,940
- The bat houses.
- The plane.

393
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,820
Yes, pretty much, an auxiliary airbase where
they were testing it and it got away.

394
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,180
It’s not great, have a point.

395
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,100
“Wait a minute, it’s night-time!”

396
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
“S***.”

397
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,280
“We used homing pigeons!

398
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,480
“And for some reason they keep coming home.”

399
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,380
The bats incinerated the test range and roosted
under a fuel tank.

400
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,280
Fuel tank?!

401
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,000
- Fuel tank, yes.
- Whaaa!

402
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,579
It worked.

403
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:28,579
It was effective,

404
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,180
and then computer control came in a few years
later when the war ended.

405
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
What, of bats?

406
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,509
Well that’s where we started, isn’t it?

407
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:34,509
This is a tangent.

408
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,130
Can you imagine that at the start?

409
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,900
“What caused the fire?”

410
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,680
“Bats.”

411
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,340
“How did the bats start a fire?”

412
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,120
“I strapped a bomb to them.”

413
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,960
“What happened?”

414
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,660
“Went in the fuel tank at night.”

415
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,240
“Oh, for God’s sake.
What else have you done?”

416
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,560
“Homing pigeons.”

417
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,920
“Oh no, no, no, no, no.”

418
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,150
“Salmon with warheads on.”

419
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,579
“Oh s***, they’re going to come back
aren’t they?”

420
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,500
Are there still bats out there that have to
be defused, I wonder, after the war?

421
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,860
I don’t think bats live that long, I'll
be honest with you.

422
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,480
‘Warning, unexploded bat.’

423
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,930
Did they evolve to have
incendiary bombs in them?

424
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,350
That’s... not how evolution works.

425
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,350
Yet.

426
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,800
Tell that to the bombardier beetle.

427
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,649
There was also, and this is a brief and quite
dark story

428
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,649
but I’m going to go with it anyway-

429
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh yes, because that will change the tone
of the episode.

430
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,540
The anti-tank dog.

431
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,550
Alright, yeah, okay.

432
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,019
One louder, fine(!)

433
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,259
Was it a dog that really didn’t like tanks?

434
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:29,950
Well it didn’t when it hit 'em.

435
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,329
Quite the opposite.

436
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,420
Trained to associate
the image of a tank with food,

437
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,010
run towards it with...

438
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,680
- Bomb on.
- Yes. Spot on. What was the...

439
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,660
Well, Spot was all over it by the end of it.

440
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,670
“Run Spot, run...!”

441
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,291
There was one slight problem.

442
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,949
This was a Soviet plan, what was the problem
with the plan?

443
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,730
'Cos they actually got to the point of releasing
dogs on the battlefield.

444
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,390
Ran towards T34s instead of Tigers.

445
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,480
Yes, you’re absolutely right.

446
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,389
They were trained on Soviet tanks so they
ran towards the Soviet tanks.

447
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,550
I am thick as mince,

448
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,000
and even I can see where that’s going wrong,
right?

449
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,390
Just make a cardboard cut-out.

450
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,370
Or a balloon, or something like that, yeah.

451
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,750
There were some successful deployments

452
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,560
but they eventually realised that was not
a great idea.

453
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,141
I think that may have to be
where we call this-

454
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:19,640
On that massive downer.

455
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,720
Well, I was going to say, “On that bombshell,” but...

456
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,560
At the end of the show, congratulations Matt,
you win this one.

457
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,570
Yay!

458
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,260
Very clearly, you win this one.

459
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,600
You win some rice, raw fish and seaweed in
the shape of a luxury car.

460
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,900
It’s a sushi Rolls Royce.

461
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,290
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel.

462
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,700
Bye then.

463
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,960
To Gary Brannan.

464
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,140
To Matt Gray.

465
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,400
I’ve been Tom Scott,
we’ll see you next time.

466
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,500
And thank you to you.

467
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,610
Thank you so much.

468
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
Man, that got dark.

469
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,060
Yeah...
