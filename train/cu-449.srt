1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,060
China is buying influence in the Middle East

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,149
And persecuting Muslims at home

3
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:07,980
How long can they keep it up?

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,570
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,740
The Middle East.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,590
The place everyone wants to be.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,100
Despite, you know, history.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,529
Now there’s a new player operating in the
Middle East—China.

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,740
The Chinese Comunist Party sees the Middle
East

11
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:31,980
as a strategic place to challenge Western
democracies.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,160
But the Party might be biting off more than
it can chew.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,140
I sat down with Nasser Weddady,

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,489
an expert on Middle East relations,

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,880
to find out more.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,760
Thanks for joining me again.

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,199
Oh, thanks for having me.

18
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:49,699
So you know, the West has had such a fun time
in the Middle East.

19
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:51,890
Is China joining the party?

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,120
I think that's the understatement

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,160
of the last two centuries right there, Chris.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Yeah.

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,960
And I think that the Chinese government

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,570
is trying to get a foothold in the Middle
East,

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,820
but it's almost too cute because-

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,900
Cute?

27
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,980
Yes.

28
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,850
Because their thinking is that they can...

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,700
Their way in is to keep a good relationship
with the rulers

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,210
who none of them mostly is democratically
elected

31
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:25,100
and their representative city of their people
is highly questionable.

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,360
And with total disregard to public opinion.

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
And they think that they can,

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,899
I mean that's what we're seeing unfold,

35
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,150
they're signing trade deals with countries
like Saudi Arabia,

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,420
the UAE, Egypt now they're trying to get a
foothold in Iraq.

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,820
Places they don't always get along with each
other.

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,820
Yeah.

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,780
Places that are not the most stable in the
world

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,430
and definitely not the most democratic.

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,750
And their thinking is that we can sign deals

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,719
without having to get involved in any of the
confrontations.

43
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:04,130
And unfortunately the confrontations in the
Middle East have

44
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,780
a habit of being armed, not a peaceful confrontations.

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,120
And in theories, it sounds to me like

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,380
a nice sort of textbook and classroom strategy,

47
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,459
but that's exactly what every world power
started

48
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,890
with thinking that we're going to do thing
here and thing there

49
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,379
without getting too sucked up in the Middle
East.

50
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,770
Starting with United States,

51
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,470
arguably first involvement in the Middle East
notable one

52
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,520
was during the Suez crisis where President
Eisenhower was like,

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,769
"No, America is not going to caution whatever
you Britain,

54
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,250
French are cooking up."

55
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,739
And sort of invading the Suez Canal.

56
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,150
And then only two years later the U.S.

57
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,920
had its own small mini invasion to Lebanon
in 1958 that no one remembers.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,450
And that was basically...

59
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,730
I'll fast forward all the way,

60
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,170
you see that like sort of the Middle East
has a habit of sucking people in.

61
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,379
So is it like a rite of passage for a rising
world power

62
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,519
to get involved in some Middle Eastern quagmire?

63
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:18,680
I mean again the Middle East has things

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,850
that the rest of the world wants and needs.

65
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,060
There's oil, obviously an energy which is
capital for the Chinese

66
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,480
and the Chinese economy.

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,909
But also there's the geo strategic location,

68
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,129
which is whoever kind of dominates in the
Middle East,

69
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,360
gets with the package access to things like
the Suez Canal,

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,830
which is a vital artery of world commerce,
like sending,

71
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,330
doing trade with Europe.

72
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,239
Around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa

73
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,000
is not a practical proposition.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,830
What will take you through three months to
get to China via shipping lane

75
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,500
can get to China via the Swiss canal in three
weeks.

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,840
So it's a strategic position.

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,540
And not to mention that the Middle East

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,569
is increasingly becoming a market of its own

79
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:13,689
with huge purchase power,

80
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,650
particularly in the Gulf region.

81
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,010
So the Middle East is not just...

82
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,440
It is a lot of headaches,

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,010
but also there are some benefits.

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,970
So the Chinese, they talk themselves

85
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,830
into whatever exercises strategy they have.

86
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,410
But sooner or later, if you buy parts of the
Middle East,

87
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,590
you're going to own it.

88
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,720
So you think the Chinese Communist Party

89
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,010
sees control of the Middle East as a stepping
stone

90
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,480
in its rise to power and challenging the United
States

91
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,940
as a world superpower?

92
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,610
Yes, but the variation here is that the Chinese
Communist Party

93
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,980
seems to be talking itself into the rather
interesting idea

94
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,970
of that we can own the energy of the Middle
East

95
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,630
or be the major stakeholders,

96
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,970
but let the others, meaning the United States,
Europeans,

97
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,830
the Russians deal with the mess and that's
one of the gamble

98
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,720
they seem to be making.

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,720
I would say it's a little bit, it's too cute.

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,380
How is it working out for them now or?

101
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,470
I think that for the time being it's kind
of working for them

102
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,310
because they are securing increasing shares
of oil from Saudi Arabia,

103
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,050
from the UAE, major producers.

104
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,130
They have also been securing natural gas deals
with Qatar

105
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,530
and obviously their more traditional clients
and ally,

106
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,720
which is Iran, which is under huge like sort
of a big American sanctions,

107
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,990
an embargo and that embargo complicated life
for the Chinese

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,050
because they depend heavily on oil and they
need that stream of oil

109
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,720
to keep coming, to keep flooring.

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,620
And again, this is one of the aspects of the
Middle East.

111
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,850
You cannot...

112
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,600
It's a rather wishful thinking

113
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,440
that you can have secure stakes

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,690
and be a player without owning some of the
problems,

115
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,190
inherent problems of the region.

116
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,180
And the Chinese find themselves stuck in that
situation

117
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,150
because the confrontation with Iran is not
only a U.S. problem,

118
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,560
it's also the Europeans.

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,910
Even though that the Europeans seem at times
to be

120
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,120
far less aggressive about it.

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,770
But they fundamentally agree on the same principle,

122
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,910
which is Iran should not be allowed to be
in nuclear power.

123
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,930
And until sort of that conflict is resolved,

124
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,910
the Chinese will have to secure sources of
energy beyond Iran.

125
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,210
Why are relationships with China desirable
for Middle Eastern countries?

126
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,970
Oh, I think that's the biggest sales point
that Chinese have.

127
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,170
Which is you get deals with us that involved
no accountability whatsoever,

128
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,290
you're not going to have human rights groups
breathing down your neck

129
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,640
and you're certainly not going to be hearing
any complaints

130
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,600
about your internal politics from us meaning
Beijing.

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,010
And we don't care really what you do with
your political opposition

132
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,450
or how you treat your population or your public,

133
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,850
we couldn't care less.

134
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,640
What you get with us is great money,

135
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,950
great deals with no accountability.

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,970
And you know what?

137
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,590
Sometimes we might even throw our veto power

138
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,140
and the security council for you.

139
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,740
Which they did several times in Syria for
example.

140
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,840
Even though Syria right now is a big pile
of ashes.

141
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,620
There's not money to be made as it is,

142
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,920
but there could be and China has been shot
by the Syrian regime

143
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,980
and even the Russians trying to talk them
into taking on

144
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,290
some of the reconstruction work that needs
to be done there.

145
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,860
Well, so what happens when the Chinese Communist
Party

146
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,030
persecutes Muslims inside China,

147
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,790
like they'd been accused of ethnic cleansing

148
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,580
of the mostly Muslim uighur ethnic minority.

149
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,530
How do these Middle Eastern countries respond
to that?

150
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:35,160
Now that is probably one of the biggest glaring
hypocrisies of today's world.

151
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,900
Because on the one hand you have Muslim majority
countries governments

152
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,520
who time after time either choose to abstain
or not vote at all

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,410
or shoot down any international resolutions
that are targeting China.

154
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,700
Further mistreatment of the Uighurs and the
Muslim minority

155
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,390
in what they call Xinjiang is Turkistan.

156
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,470
And the public opinion...

157
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,610
Initially public opinions across the Muslim
world weren't quite aware

158
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,410
of the scale of what's going on,

159
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,090
but now awareness to starting to pick up about
this.

160
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,940
And outrage is building up, anger is building
up and-

161
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
In the public?

162
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,140
In the public, in public opinion.

163
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,160
Sooner or later it's going to become a problem

164
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,260
for Muslim majority governments.

165
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,460
Muslim majority country governments

166
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,830
because the stuff is indefensible and it's
quite glaring.

167
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,070
As a matter of fact,

168
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,490
there are two cases that come to mind about

169
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,920
sort of the conundrum that comes from this.

170
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,540
The first one is Pakistan.

171
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,750
Pakistan is obviously is second,

172
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,890
I believe the second most populous Muslim
nation on earth.

173
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:59,040
And Pakistan has been a strategic ally of
China's for the past 40,

174
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,820
some 50 years.

175
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,720
Because they see China as a balancing power

176
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,960
in their ever lasting confrontation with India.

177
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,590
And China has been investing billions in Pakistan,

178
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,590
providing weaponry.

179
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:19,550
And so the relationship between Pakistan and
China is very deep.

180
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:27,470
And recently there was a resolution in the
UN over the weaker persecution.

181
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,730
Pakistan voted against it.

182
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,710
And this is particularly sort of baffling

183
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,210
to the rest of us in the Muslim world

184
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,440
because in Pakistan people went out in the
streets

185
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,130
protesting the famous or infamous Danish cartoons
and Mohammed cartoons.

186
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,130
Mum on the Uighurs not much.

187
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,050
Why is there the silence?

188
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,230
I think that it's a combination of the Chinese
obviously

189
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,190
have made it known that they expect our allies
with friends

190
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,470
not to get involved in the story,

191
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,240
but I think also internally in Pakistan,

192
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,930
the Pakistan government would rather not

193
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,370
just become a public opinion issue.

194
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,490
Because currently Pakistan is cash strapped,

195
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,570
they have massive economic problems

196
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,590
and they're constantly like months away

197
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,880
from defaulting on their foreign loans.

198
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,740
So they need mass cash injections.

199
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,460
And I think that the Chinese made it clear

200
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,800
that and the Pakistan's government itself
internalized

201
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,760
the fact of life that if they talk about this
issue

202
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,270
that there will harm their relationships with
China,

203
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,330
which is right now their only source of cash.

204
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:55,870
And sort of this is schizophrenic and the
hypocrisy is just sickening.

205
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,990
Because Pakistan, I mean Pakistan was founded
originally.

206
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,310
Who is the idea behind Pakistan?

207
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,860
This is going to be the country that provides
a home for Muslims away

208
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,830
from persecution or so it was built initially.

209
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,170
That's the [inaudible] debtor of Pakistan.

210
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,830
So is it possible that these relationships
with China

211
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,540
could potentially become a destabilizing factor
in all of these countries

212
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,390
if the public opinion starts to sway against
China

213
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,860
and then their governments are sort of caught
in the middle?

214
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,860
I think that, that is the likelihood of that

215
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,300
is only increasing with time as there's more
is known about

216
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,800
what is going on in China and the way the
Muslims are being persecuted,

217
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,710
the more that's going to become a factor.

218
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,000
And that's the second case that I was going
to point out too,

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
which is Turkey.

220
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,350
Turkey historically has a relationship, and
again,

221
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,820
let's remember like what is Xinjiang original
name.

222
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,300
It's East Turkestan.

223
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,650
East Turkestan.

224
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,650
Turk.

225
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,960
And Turkey, historically even before the Urdu
were on government,

226
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,950
before the Islamists take over of Turkey,

227
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,240
even under nationalist secular Turkish governments,

228
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,029
there was always this ideology that looked
to

229
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:19,890
all of these Turkic speaking peoples that
stretch

230
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:27,200
all the way to China as some sort of brothers
or cousins.

231
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,490
And there's a cultural influence and there's
a sense of a common belonging

232
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,440
and that is one of the reasons that pushed

233
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,600
the Turkish government at one point to be
vocal

234
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,800
about what is going on and what has been done
to the Uighurs in China.

235
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,640
And they took a lot of refugees and they keep
on settling refugees.

236
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,980
But at some point, even Turkey had to watch.

237
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,150
To watch how it's talking about the issue
publicly

238
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,839
because China expressed sort of displeasure
with it

239
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,310
and so that Erdogan had to do a u-turn and
sort of tone down his language.

240
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,950
And again, what is at stake is billions and
billions of dollars in trade

241
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,810
and commerce with China.

242
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,350
And that's what is terrifying about this issue.

243
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,960
This is where the Uyghurs issue in Turkey
became very sensitive

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,070
because it's not only one of religion,

245
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,720
there [inaudible] were Muslims and Muslims

246
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,550
but also there's an ethnic dimension because
there are Turkic.

247
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,710
So it became a public opinion issue in Turkey

248
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,750
and it's a soft point, a weakness point for
Erdogan,

249
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,490
if he doesn't look tough enough on China,

250
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,220
which he had to back down from.

251
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,480
And that is likely to happen in most Muslim
countries

252
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,140
as Uighur advocacy steps up and it is stepping
up.

253
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:57,850
There was a famous incident of a German of
Turkish descent

254
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:05,800
of football soccer player Mr. Mesut Ozil tweeting
about the crisis...

255
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,390
Like sort of the mistreatment and the persecution
of Uyghurs.

256
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,710
That generated a massive backlash against
China

257
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:19,510
and the Chinese government actually responded
to Ozil's tweet,

258
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,230
which by the way it was inconvenient both
for the Turkish government

259
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,680
and for many Muslim majority governments.

260
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,930
It was really embarrassing for them

261
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,630
because it's shown a light on the topic

262
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,580
that they didn't want to talk about.

263
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,390
And they wanted to skirt.

264
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,240
So what is the public opinion of these Chinese
relationships

265
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,580
outside of even the uighurs?

266
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,971
I think that the public opinion

267
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:45,529
and the Muslim majority countries in the past,

268
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,450
I would say starting sometime in the last
decade,

269
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:56,300
used to view China as this far away kind of
friend who didn't meddle,

270
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,510
sort of didn't in meddle in an internal affairs
of countries

271
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,090
and people were interested in China.

272
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,090
Yeah.

273
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,890
Rather superficial things,

274
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,310
things some people might call soft power,

275
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,650
like Chinese culture wanting to challenge
say Beijing.

276
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,070
And I remember a time where actually the Chinese
government itself

277
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,730
was pushing an angle showing that China had
Muslims

278
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,589
and that was a sort of rapprochement point,
a meeting point.

279
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:30,120
It was a sales point to public opinions around
the Muslim world.

280
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,620
Of course that changed because those Chinese
Muslims

281
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,330
that were shown were actually the uighurs
that changed.

282
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,330
Yeah.

283
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,180
And the second thing is that historically
China

284
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,970
was part of the non-aligned block,

285
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,070
which was sort of a block of 50-some countries.

286
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,380
That was founded in the 60s and the idea

287
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,300
was like these are third world countries

288
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,730
that are arising and that didn't want to be
caught up

289
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,850
in the cold war confrontation between the
Western Bloc

290
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,870
and the Soviet Bloc.

291
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,480
And that's how the Chinese influence

292
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,630
started seeping in Muslim majority countries,

293
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,880
in the Middle East, in North Africa, even
in West Africa.

294
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,929
And that was punctuated with,

295
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,610
like aids that came generally in the form
of construction,

296
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,710
lack of infrastructure, ports, stadiums,

297
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,329
roads and occasionally offering scholarships
to people

298
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,199
to go to study in China.

299
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,330
But all of this was pretty mild and torn down.

300
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,620
And there were some occasions also that evolved
arm sales,

301
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,940
like fighter jets to Egypt, Algeria missile
systems.

302
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,700
But that started happening only in the 80s.

303
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,220
And then the big change is China itself changed,

304
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,330
became this like American totalized imperialist
power.

305
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,260
The Chinese started aggressively push again
for a foothold for markets,

306
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,720
for market shares, for sales.

307
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,860
And that happened in North Africa.

308
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,140
Algeria comes to mind particularly started
happening

309
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,100
in places looking for natural resources

310
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,030
like Mauritania with the fisheries deal

311
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,559
that we spoke about in the podcast.

312
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,750
And obviously in places like Pakistan,

313
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,970
which are neighboring, really within reach
of China's

314
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,620
and the other relationships is very deep.

315
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,520
It's state to state, military to military,

316
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,090
and it's one of strategic Alliance.

317
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,090
Are there military investments going on?

318
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,120
I know you mentioned some issues in Pakistan.

319
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,630
I mean there's obviously the military base

320
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,430
that the Chinese leased in Djibouti, Islam
majority country.

321
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:51,150
Strategic location on Indian Ocean and the
Red Sea.

322
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,890
And obviously they're stepping up military
to military cooperation

323
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,500
beyond Pakistan in places like Egypt

324
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,860
where they're selling them fighter jets, missile
systems,

325
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,680
Mauritanians so...

326
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,820
They sold that also military equipment.

327
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,490
They've had deals like that also in West Africa.

328
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,200
And so the Chinese are like sort of,

329
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,980
they're trying to widen the menu of things,
of goodies

330
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,220
you can get by becoming friends with the Chinese
government.

331
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,720
So how does the West view this?

332
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,150
I think that the Western world is of two minds
about all of this.

333
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:37,900
Because the Western world as we're going through
this new era of division,

334
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:44,450
of lack of clarity, of purpose when it comes
to Chinese influencer,

335
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:51,250
there doesn't seem to be a unified front in
the Western world

336
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,410
meaning the United States and its Western
European allies.

337
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,900
And each one it's basically, each one on to
their own.

338
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,460
Like in places in the Middle East and in Africa,

339
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,410
there isn't a joint strategy between let's
say the majors,

340
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,049
traditional stakeholders, United States, France,
Britain.

341
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,920
They're not necessarily coordinating efforts

342
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,100
let's say in places like Africa or the Middle
East

343
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,770
to roll back Chinese influence.

344
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,140
Because the Chinese have been very smart in
approaching these relationships

345
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,041
and exploiting the weaknesses of the Western
world and using them.

346
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,750
And one of the major weaknesses,

347
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,010
this might be shocking to some viewers.

348
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,000
As much as I have...

349
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,800
We could record an entire episode with me
criticizing the Western world

350
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,100
for its uneven and the times immoral behavior

351
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,280
when it's dealing with these countries.

352
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,310
That criticism stands.

353
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,220
However, the difference between China and
the Western world

354
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,420
is that in the Western world,

355
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,640
these are democracies that have representatives,

356
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,850
parliaments and have a free press.

357
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,990
You don't like the policy of the United States.

358
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,600
Let's say vis-à-vis Iraq, or vis-à-vis Iran,

359
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,020
the American press is flooding literally with
OPEDs and interviews

360
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,070
and opinions from the people who are feeling
the brunt of U.S. Policies.

361
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,620
You're not going to get that with the Chinese.

362
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:31,850
There are parliaments, there are norms, you
can sue dictators,

363
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,549
you can go after them and there are legions

364
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,179
and legions of cases where this happened.

365
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:39,440
With the Chinese, you're not going to get
that.

366
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,230
So ultimately to summarize here is just that

367
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,460
the major weakness the Western world has,

368
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,230
which ironically also what is the greatness
of the Western world,

369
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,970
is that there is a measure of accountability

370
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,670
that you can push through Western institutions

371
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:59,510
against dictatorships and rulers,

372
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,280
whereas the Chinese are immune from that

373
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,679
because the Chinese become friends with those
strong men,

374
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,040
rulers and dictators

375
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,720
and they're not going to hold them accountable
for anything.

376
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,059
And this is a question that I get asked time
and again,

377
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,809
it's like, "America as an imperialist,

378
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,230
Britain as an imperialist power,

379
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:26,360
so what changed when another imperialist power
comes on along the play?"

380
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,670
I was like, "Be careful for what you wish
for.

381
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,360
There are major differences here that are
worthy of noting."

382
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,230
Well, so what would you say to people in these
Muslim countries

383
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,059
who do make that argument that what is the
difference

384
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,910
between the United States and China?

385
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,530
I will simply point out two things like the
Magnitsky Act,

386
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,070
landmark led-American legislation that allows
people

387
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,790
to be sanctioned for human rights abuses.

388
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,049
There's no such thing with the Chinese.

389
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,610
And I want to say to people is that in America

390
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,720
you have friends and allies and civil society,

391
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,720
in the press and even amongst elected officials,

392
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,820
there is no such thing with China and,

393
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,920
and that is also holds true of the Western
democracies in Europe.

394
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,830
My warning is this, if you think that China
is going to be your friend

395
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,299
and then just finally is going to liberate
you from Western imperialism,

396
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,890
you are wrong.

397
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:36,730
China is actually a lot worse than the Western
countries ever could be.

398
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,780
And the difference is a fundamental one,

399
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,040
is that China is not trying to export freedom
and democracy.

400
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:49,960
China is trying to export its own authoritarian
model and you,

401
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,650
the people, we, the people who live under
dictatorships

402
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,140
are going to be the biggest losers from that.

403
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
Wow.

404
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,560
Well, thank you for joining me.

405
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,380
That was very interesting.

406
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,700
Thank you for having me.
