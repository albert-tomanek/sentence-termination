1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,810
Ah, college.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,069
Living on your own.

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,910
Doing what you want, when you want.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,719
Letting it all hang out.

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,440
And for tens of thousands of students from
mainland China

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,550
studying here in Australia,

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,640
they finally are out from under

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,450
the watchful eyes of their parents,

9
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,660
and can take a big old hit of academic freedom.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,150
The issue is the academic freedom they have
in Australia,

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,110
even though they are in this free county,

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,739
it's quite limited.

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,460
It's more like what they'd actually experience
studying in China,

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,800
I sat down with Chinese Australian Alex Joske,

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,560
a freelance journalist and student at Australian
national university

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,380
Well, why not?

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,540
Do they have some kind of prudish RA

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,060
who’s against getting a higher education?

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,560
No.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,520
So why don't Chinese students

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,100
want to explore their political philosophy?

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,920
I think they've been growing up
in China

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,890
with what's known as patriotic education

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,739
and, I wouldn't say they're brainwashed,

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,270
but they've certainly been brought up

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,601
in a certain way that encourages them

27
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,030
not to criticize the Party.

28
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,250
And that same attitude carries over

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,250
when they're in Australia.

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,210
Oh yeah, we all have that political ideology

31
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,229
we were dating back home that we say we'll
be with forever,

32
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,160
but I mean, come on,

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
it's college.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,700
You get over that.

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,880
I don't think they've managed to

36
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,369
dump the Party quite yet.

37
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:31,399
Clearly these Chinese students need to loosen
up.

38
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,270
These kids can benefit from my years

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,729
at a small liberal arts college.

40
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,200
So I donned the robes

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,760
symbolic of Greco-Roman philosophy and debate.

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,080
Toga! Toga! Toga!

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,380
What are you studying?

44
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,820
Accounting.

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,700
Master of Statistics.

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,939
Master of International Management.

47
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:00,939
Finance.

48
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:01,939
Actuarial.

49
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,900
Software engineering.

50
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,940
Both of you, software engineering?

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,680
Yeah.

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,760
Have you guys ever considered taking an art
class?

53
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Uh, maybe ... not.

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,460
Art class?

55
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah.

56
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,160
Art class?

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,020
Art class.

58
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,600
Art class?

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,280
Yeah.

60
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,520
No, I didn't take art class.

61
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,460
How about you?

62
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Art? Have you ever taken an art class?

63
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,000
No!

64
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,220
And what's the craziest political party you've
been to?

65
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,160
Sorry?

66
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,560
Political?

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
Political party, yeah.

68
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Party?

69
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,260
I think I don't know any one.

70
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,160
what's been the craziest political party you've
been to?

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,140
Party?

72
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
Oh.

73
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,520
Have you ever experimented with democracy?

74
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,840
Democracy?

75
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,060
Have you voted on something?

76
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,060
Not yet.

77
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Democracy?

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Yeah, democracy.

79
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,860
What's democracy?

80
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,280
Democracy.

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
Democracy?

82
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,500
And have you guys ever experimented

83
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,800
with democracy while you're out here?

84
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm sorry, what is democracy?

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,560
Democracy, you know.

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
We do not know it.

87
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,600
What is democracy?

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
You don't know democracy?

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Yeah.

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,920
That's okay.

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,120
Well, we can go on to the next question.

92
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,590
What do you say or do if you hear someone

93
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,700
say something critical or bad about China?

94
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,080
It is interesting to exchange some ideas

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,020
but I don't think I have the responsibility
to tell them,

96
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,549
"You need to think in that way."

97
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,090
At first, I may feel a bit angry when somebody
talks

98
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,830
some bad things about your mother countries.

99
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:46,340
Yeah, maybe I want to argue with him and ask
him

100
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,080
why he feels not good about my country.

101
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,269
I will try to convince him there are many
good things in China.

102
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:11,180
Some people will say something about Tibet
and Xinjiang problems—like this.

103
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:20,900
And kind of, we often think that you shouldn't
have bring up such ideas.

104
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,780
I think many people love China.

105
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,030
Yeah, but to understand, they say something
bad on China,

106
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,540
I think if they're right, I think it's okay.

107
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,540
It's okay?!

108
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,540
Yeah.

109
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,880
I think if it’s a fact, you can talk something
bad

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,120
and I think it can make us make progress.

111
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,200
I think better say some good thing to them.

112
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,020
Let them know China is a good country.

113
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,640
Yeah.

114
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,080
Ahh youth.

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,500
You never forget your first liberal democracy.

116
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,040
But it still felt like there was something
holding them back.

117
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,300
So, there were some serious inhibitions that
need to be explored.

118
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,020
Why do these Chinese students have all these
hangups?

119
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,200
One major part of that is the Chinese Students
and Scholars Association,

120
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,140
which basically functions as the Chinese government's

121
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,180
ears and eyes on campus.

122
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,450
It's kind of like a frat?

123
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,020
Not quite.

124
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,040
It's a rich kid frat.

125
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,320
I know how to handle these people.

126
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,440
It’s locked.

127
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,380
No one’s home.

128
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,520
Is this a Communist Party or what?

129
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,220
Well, they wouldn't let me in.

130
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,820
Can you get me in?

131
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,980
No.

132
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,000
Why not?

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,940
Last time I interacted with them,

134
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,120
they followed me and tried to kick me out
of the venue.

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,460
What's their deal?

136
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm not really sure.

137
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,640
Yeah, well they just saw me going in and followed
me

138
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,620
and had people sit around me and my friend,

139
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,670
and watched us for the whole evening.

140
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,670
And then

141
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,670
when we went to the bathroom,

142
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,670
they followed us, too,

143
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,220
and tried to have us kicked out.

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Why did the CSSA target you?

145
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,860
I'd previously reported on and investigated

146
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,700
their ties to the Chinese government,

147
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,640
and also their attempts to censor free information

148
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,580
critical of the Chinese government on campus.

149
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,710
And for that reason,

150
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,770
they're extremely hostile towards me.

151
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,770
And is it just you,

152
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,420
or do they harass other students?

153
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,220
I was there with a friend who is a political
dissident from China,

154
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,960
and they were definitely targeting him as
well.

155
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
And I think it's not just something at this
university.

156
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
It's not just

157
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,840
the CSSA at ANU, it's CSSAs all across the
globe

158
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,620
that would be willing to engage in these kinds
of activities.

159
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,160
What are some of the ways the CSSA

160
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
monitors Chinese students abroad?

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,180
Well, it's believed they're in regular contact
with the embassy.

162
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,270
There have been a couple of cases of Chinese
students

163
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,400
or lecturers making comments in class critical
of the Chinese Communist Party,

164
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,060
and then these comments being reported back
to the Chinese government.

165
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,270
So, it's quite likely that CSSAs are involved
in those cases.

166
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,840
How can we tell the CSSA to be cool and stay
the heck out of school?

167
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,990
I think it's important for universities to
send a message to CSSAs

168
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,120
that they're not ever going to be endorsed
by universities.

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,600
They won't be allowed to use university facilities,
and the universities

170
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,240
should really encourage alternative Chinese
Student Associations

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,260
that don't have these kinds of intimate ties
with the Chinese government.

172
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,000
So, how can Chinese students be encouraged

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,190
to come out of their shell a bit more?

174
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,510
Yeah, universities really need to make sure

175
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,320
they're spread out across the university.

176
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,410
That they don't form enclaves,

177
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,110
that they have ample opportunities to interact
with non-Chinese students

178
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,344
and really make the most of their experience.

179
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,850
What you're saying is, we need to throw a
party?

180
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,940
That's not what I meant.

181
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,400
The mother of all parties.

182
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,340
