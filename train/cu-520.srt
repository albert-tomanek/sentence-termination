00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,860
the Chinese Communist Party loves

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,900
Pakistan’sprime beachfront property.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,600
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,430
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,660
This is Gwadar.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,880
It used to be a sleepy fishing town

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,210
on the coast of Pakistan.

9
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,789
But over the past several years,

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:22,849
with Chinese investment

11
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,470
of hundreds of millions of dollars…
…this once a sleepy fishing town

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,889
has morphed into a deep-sea port …

13
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:33,120
…and a giant gateway for trade.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,440
Now controlled by the Chinese regime.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,530
Ah, progress.

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,199
The state-owned China Overseas Ports Holding
Company Limited,

17
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:45,289
or COPHC, “has proudly taken over”

18
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,629
and will be calling the shots

19
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,210
for the next 40 years.

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,210
The port, Gwadar,

21
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,670
is near the mouth of the Persian Gulf.

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,899
That area—the Strait of Hormuz—

23
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,000
is a key shipping route.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,539
About 20% of the world’s oil

25
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,089
flows through there,

26
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,089
plus a huge quantity of regular cargo.

27
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,500
Gwadar is especially important to China

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,060
because it connects the western part of China

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,670
to the Arabian Sea through Pakistan.

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,530
And that gives China easier access to

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,290
the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,700
The port is a lynchpin linking land and sea

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,299
in Xi Jinping’s One Belt One Road Initiative.

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,840
One Belt One Road is a network

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,520
of trade corridors that connect

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,340
China with the rest of the world

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,630
and make it easier for China

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,689
to acquire raw materials,

39
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,189
export Chinese goods,

40
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,869
and project its influence across the globe.

41
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,409
The trillion dollar One Belt One Road

42
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,750
is marketed as the “new silk road,”

43
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,219
a purely economic initiative

44
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,189
meant to evoke a romantic age

45
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,659
where silk flowed west

46
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,490
along ancient trade routes.

47
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,229
Only now, instead of silk,

48
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,899
it’s cheap plastic toys.

49
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:52,719
The Chinese Communist Party insists

50
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,539
that One Belt One Road is about

51
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,020
peace and prosperity.

52
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,820
But not everybody is so sure.

53
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,149
The Center for Strategic and International
Studies,

54
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,799
a think tank, points to

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
the “string of pearls” theory.

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
The “string of pearls” is the idea that

57
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,470
China plans to develop a string of military
bases

58
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,410
along the Indian Ocean to support

59
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,990
extended naval missions

60
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,690
and expand its military reach.

61
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,150
The report says that even if China

62
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,160
doesn’t establish naval outposts directly,

63
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,410
by investing in trade-related infrastructure

64
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,420
around the world,

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,300
China is creating places

66
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,050
“with Chinese characteristics.”

67
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,490
These are locations that can serve

68
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,760
as support for the Chinese Navy,

69
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,810
but technically let China say

70
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,790
they’re not expanding military bases.

71
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,590
“What, us expand our military?

72
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,590
No!

73
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,990
We want ‘prosperity for all—

74
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,300
not global hegemony.’”

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,380
But, places with Chinese characteristics

76
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,010
would still “affect the security calculus

77
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,440
of India and the US in the region,

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,010
as well as set a precedent,

79
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,090
potentially for application in Europe.”

80
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,090
In other words,

81
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,090
these places could give

82
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,250
the Chinese Communist Party

83
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,840
similar advantages to having military bases,

84
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,620
but the Party gets to deny

85
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,590
that they’re military bases.

86
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,560
So they can call the military “string of
pearls”

87
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,780
part of their trade corridor.

88
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,050
But in Pakistan, China is bold enough

89
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,760
to call a spade a spade.

90
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,530
At least that’s what two separate reports
claim—

91
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,070
from the South China Morning Post

92
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,380
and the Washington Times.

93
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,010
China is building a joint naval

94
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,490
and air base for Chinese forces,

95
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,430
just a short distance up the coast from—

96
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,480
you guessed it—

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,010
the port of Gwadar that they now control.

98
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,790
Sources “familiar with the deal” say

99
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,010
a group of Chinese People’s Liberation Army
officers

100
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,160
met with Pakistani military officials in December

101
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,370
and hammered out a deal that would see

102
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,220
the port of Jiwani,

103
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,210
about 15 miles away from Gwadar,

104
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,550
become a Chinese military base.

105
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,120
It would have \ha small airfield be upgraded

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,840
to “handle large Chinese military aircraft.”

107
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,260
And it might also require the forced relocation

108
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,650
of “scores of residents living in the area.”

109
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,740
Don’t worry, the Chinese regime

110
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,400
is very skilled at forced relocations.

111
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,490
They’re scheduled to break ground

112
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,800
for the base in Jiwani this July.

113
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,180
Jiwani will be China’s second offshore military
base.

114
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,580
Its first offshore military base

115
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,430
was launched last year—

116
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
in the small,

117
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,139
hilarious African nation of Djibouti.

118
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,099
The former Foreign Secretary of India,

119
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,020
Kanwal Sibal, is not surprised.

120
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,259
He predicted it back in 2014,

121
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,259
when China was getting

122
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,930
extra chummy with Pakistan

123
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,180
over the mega-port in Gwadar.

124
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,210
He wrote that “China will, inevitably,

125
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,069
follow up with its commercial footholds

126
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,990
in the Indian Ocean with naval ones.”

127
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,409
It’s not always great to be right.

128
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,870
Ok, it usually is.

129
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,509
Retired US Army Reserve Colonel Lawrence Sellin

130
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,669
writes that China’s Jiwani base

131
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,620
a sign of “Chinese militarisation

132
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,949
of Pakistan, in particular,

133
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,890
and in the Indian Ocean.”

134
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,320
He said the combination of Chinese military
bases

135
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,219
in Djibouti and Pakistan would “not only
[be]

136
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:06,599
capable of dominating vital sea lanes

137
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,210
in the Arabian Sea,

138
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,830
but boxing-in U.S bases

139
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,240
in the Persian Gulf”

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,680
and outflanking the US navy.

141
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,229
And the retired Colonel warns that

142
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,080
more Chinese military expansion

143
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,610
could be on the way,

144
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,610
using what he calls

145
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,800
“debt-trap” tactics.

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,830
That’s when the Chinese regime

147
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,930
lends you tons of money.

148
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,689
And then when you can’t pay it off,

149
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,879
they offer to forgive the debt in exchange

150
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,689
for strategic infrastructure

151
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,229
or natural resources.

152
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:33,720
It’s like borrowing money

153
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,810
you can’t pay back

154
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,400
from your friendly neighborhood loan shark.

155
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,880
Except instead of breaking your legs,

156
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,379
he makes you lease him your legs

157
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,319
for 99 years.

158
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,479
Like what the Chinese Communist Party

159
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,070
did in Sri Lanka.

160
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,949
“There is concern that the Chinese

161
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,999
will transform its 99-year lease

162
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:52,270
of the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota

163
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,139
into another naval base,

164
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,610
the exact ‘debt-trap’ method

165
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,050
the Chinese used in Djibouti.”

166
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,909
So then the Party would have a naval base

167
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,779
right off the southeast coast of India.

168
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,449
To match its new Pakistani military base,

169
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,620
which is just to the west of India.

170
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,550
India is not happy.

171
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,159
Especially because they’ve seen what happens

172
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,330
when China builds bases,

173
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,169
sorry, islands,

174
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,290
in the South China Sea.

175
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,090
So what do you think about China’s plans

176
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,530
to build a military base in Pakistan?

177
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,230
Leave your comments below.

178
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,280
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

179
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,600
See you next time.

Find out about China’s secret military plans

181
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,229
and what it means for the world.

186

of the Chinese regime
