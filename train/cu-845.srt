1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,129
Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,790
is accused of being a national security threat

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,609
Trump Banned Huawei

4
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:08,830
Then postponed the ban

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,830
Twice.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,080
Was it a trade war misstep?

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Or all part of a larger plan?

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,730
I’m Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,200
We are now officially more than a year into
the US-China Trade War.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
But unofficially,

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,210
it’s been nearly two decades since the Chinese
Communist Party

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,340
began its trade war against the US—

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,260
using its newfound membership in the World
Trade Organization

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,480
to steal American intellectual property,

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,829
manipulate its currency,

17
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,850
and twist the law to give Chinese companies
an advantage.

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,790
President Trump may not have started the trade
war.

19
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,719
But will he be able to finish it?

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,180
I sat down with China expert Gordon Chang
to find out.

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,220
Thanks for joining me again, Gordon.

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,460
Thank you Chris.

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,180
So, almost exactly a year ago

24
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,399
I had you on the show and I asked you,

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,739
"Who do you think is winning the trade war?"

26
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,219
At the time, you said it's too early to tell.

27
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:07,070
So, a year later, who is winning the trade
war?

28
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,299
Up until yesterday,

29
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,830
the United States was clearly winning the
trade war.

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,970
That's what I'd like to hear.

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,860
But today ... today's a pretty dark day for
the United States.

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,720
Up until yesterday, President Trump I think
was winning.

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,500
He was imposing tariffs.

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,960
He was making the Chinese hurt,

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,780
and that's the important thing here.

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,140
And that he was willing to use the power of
the United States,

37
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,000
to push the Chinese in a better direction.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,549
Today however, a different story.

39
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,380
Today the president gave Huawei Technologies,

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,540
the Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,311
a second 90 day reprieve

42
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,549
from being on the commerce department's entity
list.

43
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:46,960
If you're on the entity list,

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,600
it means no US company can either license
or sell technology,

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,460
and Huawei clearly has stolen US tech.

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,329
But also is a national security threat.

47
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,570
And indeed, President Trump yesterday said,

48
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,570
"Huawei is a national security threat?"

49
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,420
But today, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross
says,

50
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,170
"Oh, we're going to allow American companies

51
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,000
to do whatever they want for the next 90 days."

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,790
That shows I think a failure of political
will.

53
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,540
You got to go back to the Osaka G20 at the
end of June.

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,970
And there was this internal arrangement between
Trump and Xi Jinping,

55
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,470
the Chinese ruler.

56
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,480
Basically the Chinese agreed to buy more US
agricultural products.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,260
We agreed to give reprieves to Huawei.

58
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,720
That's an awful deal from any number of different
perspectives, but the-

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Why is that?

60
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,260
Well, it's because first of all, what we're
doing is,

61
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,629
we're making ourselves look like a third world
economy

62
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,780
by selling primary products,

63
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,830
while we're giving the Chinese a free pass
on high technology.

64
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,950
So by allowing Huawei to use US tech,

65
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,880
license from Google for instance, buy Qualcomm
chips,

66
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,560
we were allowing them to essentially continue
their lead

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,580
in the fifth generation of wireless communications.

68
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,580
5G.

69
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,709
The internet of things.

70
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,659
Whoever controls 5G and artificial intelligence,

71
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,590
probably controls the economy of the 21st
century.

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,190
And we were allowing Huawei to continue its
lead on us.

73
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,099
We don't want to look like Brazil for instance,

74
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,519
where you sell primary products-

75
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,700
And our soccer teams aren't that good.

76
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,540
Well, I wish our men's team were as good as
the Brazilians,

77
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,140
but that's a different story.

78
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
But the point is,

79
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,080
we don't want to end up to being a seller
of primary products

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,130
and buying manufactured goods,

81
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,239
high tech products from the Chinese.

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,630
So it was a bad deal structure.

83
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,360
But this story gets even worse Chris.

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Okay.

85
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,650
The story is that, the Chinese did not agree,

86
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,790
did not actually buy more US agricultural
products.

87
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,250
They just stiffed us in that.

88
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,940
So what does President Trump do?

89
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,019
The Chinese dishonored their part of the deal.

90
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,860
Well, Trump goes ahead with our part of the
deal.

91
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,129
So this really looks bad.

92
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,970
I just hope this is a temporary failure of
will,

93
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,709
but this is the second of these 90-day exemptions.

94
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,480
The first one was unwarranted.

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
As it turns out.

96
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,530
The second one is even worse.

97
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,230
The third one, if it comes, is going to be
a debacle.

98
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,840
Well, so I was going to ask about this

99
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,410
because over the course of the trade war,

100
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,630
you've seen the Trump administration

101
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,720
say they're going to put new tariffs on China

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,380
and then they delay the tariffs.

103
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,380
The Huawei ban,

104
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,810
they said they're going to ban Huawei

105
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,910
and then they delay that.

106
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,440
Do you think that's sending mixed messages

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,800
or is it part of a broader plan by the administration?

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,910
Who knows what's in Trump head?

109
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,280
But when you look at it from the outside,

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,690
it doesn't look good.

111
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,860
It is important to impose those tariffs.

112
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
Remember these are remedies

113
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,199
for the theft of US intellectual property.

114
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,550
And when you read the commission

115
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,560
on the theft of US intellectual property,

116
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,090
the Blair Huntsman report,

117
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,460
or look at the US trade representatives, March,
2018 report,

118
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,700
clearly China steals hundreds of billions
of dollars.

119
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,310
People can argue whether it's 150 billion
or 600 billion,

120
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,930
but the point is, even at the lower end of
the range,

121
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,270
this is a grievous wound to an innovation
based economy.

122
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,460
So, we've got to do whatever we can to stop
the Chinese

123
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,990
from stealing our stuff immediately.

124
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,840
And this is separate and apart from China's
violations

125
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,500
of its World Trade Organization obligations
to us.

126
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,710
So China's getting worse than that score.

127
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,930
So it's across the board a deterioration in
their behavior.

128
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,681
And so it's good that the Trump administration

129
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,220
has identified the problem,

130
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,040
is doing something about it,

131
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,740
but it's not doing enough.

132
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,920
Well so I've heard that the ultimate goal
of the trade war,

133
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,290
is not so much fixing the trade deficit.

134
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,759
What do you think are the Trump administration's
long term goals?

135
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,680
I think the long term goals disengage the
Chinese economy from ours.

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,710
To get our factories out of China.

137
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,080
To buy from our friends,

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,680
or to buy from ourselves for that matter.

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,460
But if not buy from ourselves at least by
from our friends.

140
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,060
Instead of a country that's using the proceeds
of trade

141
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,910
to build up its military.

142
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,610
Where it's senior officers are openly talking

143
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,860
gleefully about killing Americans.

144
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,810
Twice in December you had a senior Chinese
military officer,

145
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,080
urge publicly unprovoked attacks on the US
Navy

146
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,700
and the global commons.

147
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,910
And in the second of those comments,

148
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,729
you had a Chinese Admiral say,

149
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,440
"Look he wanted to use his ballistic missiles
to sink

150
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,289
two US aircraft carriers kill 10,000 Americans."

151
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,530
We shouldn't be trading with that country.

152
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,870
And remember, it's more than just boasting.

153
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,039
Last year, China lasered a US C-130,

154
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,610
temporarily caused eye injuries to two pilots.

155
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,550
If you're trying to blind pilots of a plane,

156
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,560
you're trying to bring it down,

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,980
you're trying to kill the crew.

158
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,520
And then also in Guangzhou,

159
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,270
China used Sonic attacks against the US consulate,

160
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,700
caused brain injuries to our diplomats.

161
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,919
It goes on and on.

162
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,440
So clearly we shouldn't be trading with China
full stop.

163
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,030
I mean this is just wrong.

164
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,070
And clearly with President Trump

165
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,870
giving the reprieve to Huawei today,

166
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,729
that's a big mistake.

167
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,169
So I know the People's Bank of China has allowed

168
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,930
the value of the UN to fall versus the US
dollar.

169
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,860
Do you think that was a strategic move?

170
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,009
I think that it was.

171
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,970
China controls the value of its currency.

172
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,970
It does it two ways.

173
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,539
First of all, it's got capital controls,

174
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,190
but second of all,

175
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,130
it sets a target level every trading day and
it must ...

176
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,610
Currency can't trade outside of a band.

177
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,220
So what it did couple of weeks ago was,

178
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,380
I think move that target ban that fixing number
lower,

179
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,630
and that was a signal to traders that the
currency

180
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,330
should go below that critical seven to one
level.

181
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,040
That's seven of the Chinese currency

182
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,569
to one of the American currency.

183
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,340
So China devaluing its currency, is that helpful?

184
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,060
Well, it's helpful to us.

185
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,990
I'm not so sure that it's a good thing for
China because first of all,

186
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,760
by doing that, they make products to the US
cheaper.

187
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,210
That's certainly bolstered president Trump's
arguments

188
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,260
that his tariffs are not being paid for by
the American consumer.

189
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,800
So this I think is not going to be helpful
to the Chinese,

190
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,199
but there's something really more important
Chris for the Chinese,

191
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,780
that is, their number one always lurking in
the background problem

192
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,379
is capital flight.

193
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,169
Because in 2015, 2016 there was perhaps 2.12,

194
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,649
$2.2 trillion of net capital outflow.

195
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,820
That is a loss that could lead to the end
of the Chinese economy.

196
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,100
And by devaluing the currency,

197
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,980
going below that important psychological seven
to one level,

198
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,560
it shows the Chinese people,

199
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
"Look it's time to get your currency up,

200
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,260
put it into something safer."

201
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,540
And there's been increased evidence of gold
buying

202
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,320
on the part of the Chinese public.

203
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,290
I think that that's largely a feeling.

204
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,029
That's informal capital flight,

205
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:06,160
that's getting your money out of renminbi,

206
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,870
and putting it into a hard asset.

207
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,730
So I think China is going to have a problem.

208
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,080
If they're going to allow the currency to
erode much more,

209
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,640
are we going to going to eight, one?

210
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Nine, one?

211
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,790
Who knows.

212
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,390
China's going to have this capital flow problem.

213
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,710
The way they fixed it last time were two things.

214
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,570
They stabilized the value of currency and
second of all,

215
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,890
they imposed even more draconian capital controls.

216
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,940
Well you can do that to stem capital outflow,

217
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,690
but that has serious knockon effects on the
Chinese economy.

218
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,720
People aren't going to bring money into a
country

219
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,550
if they think they can't get it out.

220
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,860
And also it sends some really bad signals
internally.

221
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,269
So yeah, the Chinese can devalue the currency

222
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,050
and they can say that this is one of their
tools,

223
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,450
but in the end it's going to hurt China far
more than the United States.

224
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,300
Well, this is something people have been debating
for a long time,

225
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,441
that the level of control the Chinese Communist
Party

226
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:01,210
has over the Chinese economy,

227
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,130
actually makes it stronger and more resilient
than the US economy.

228
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,560
Do you agree with that?

229
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,680
Well, short term, yes you can do a number
of things.

230
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,070
So for instance, they did not have a 2008
downturn.

231
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,440
The rest of the world did.

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,769
China didn't.

233
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,080
But what China did by avoiding 2008 with the
massive stimulus,

234
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,140
was it created these even bigger imbalances
in the Chinese economy.

235
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,180
And in some point there's going to be an adjustment
as economists call it.

236
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,750
In other words, what people would call a crash.

237
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,830
So, they can do this, where they control borrowers,

238
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,860
lenders, banks, courts, everything.

239
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,160
So they can ... Yeah, it does give them an
advantage in the short term,

240
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,170
but they're creating a problem for which there
is no solution

241
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,800
and that is perhaps the biggest crash in history.

242
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,500
So it is an advantage, but it's also a disadvantage.

243
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Remember.

244
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,089
Because they have the capacity to sort of
overpower the market,

245
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,910
they do it and the more they do it,

246
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,029
the bigger imbalance it becomes,

247
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:04,250
making the problems even more insoluble.

248
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,270
So there is a real cost to all of this.

249
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,080
Speaking of these sort of corrections,

250
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,920
it's been 10 years since the US had a recession.

251
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,180
Some people say we're due for another one.

252
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
If that happens,

253
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,940
how do you think that will shift the balance
of power

254
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,500
between the US and China?

255
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,579
Well, that would certainly shift the balance
of power

256
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:24,320
more to the Chinese side of course.

257
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,790
I mean when you look at the yield curve,

258
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,040
the inverted yield curve where you have your
10-year treasuries

259
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,529
trading well below shorter term maturities.

260
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,290
Yeah, that is a sign of a recession to come.

261
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,500
And when you see that,

262
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,220
it means a recession will come.

263
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,459
So yes, it's coming.

264
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:44,459
Weather it's coming two,

265
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,459
three years down the road,

266
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:46,459
we just don't know.

267
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:50,480
And oftentimes there's a big lag between the
yield curve

268
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,020
going inverted and a US recession.

269
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,870
And I think part of what we're seeing right
now is,

270
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,870
the yield's changing.

271
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,339
Not so much as a reflection of what people
think about the US economy,

272
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:05,180
but what people in other countries are thinking
about their economy.

273
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,640
It stinks outside, so they're bringing their
money into safe havens,

274
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,790
like 10-year treasury obligations.

275
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,310
So I think that's part of it.

276
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,300
Also, you got to remember that recessions
are inevitable,

277
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,130
just as recoveries are inevitable and free
markets.

278
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,000
So yes, a recession is coming,

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,639
but whether it's when.

280
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,180
I think it's probably pretty far down the
road.

281
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
In other words,

282
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,410
I think it's farther down the road

283
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,720
and it's not going to help China in the near
term,

284
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,670
which is really what we're talking about.

285
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,170
Even with the election coming up.

286
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,170
Yeah.

287
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,220
Even with the election coming up.

288
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,790
I'm not saying it's impossible to have a recession

289
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,800
between now and November, 2020,

290
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,160
I think that it's probably unlikely.

291
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,430
So this is of course something only time will
tell.

292
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,190
But when you start to look at past recessions,

293
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,550
past patterns, yeah, a recession will be coming,

294
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,810
but probably not in time to affect the election.

295
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,010
So what do you think the economic tools are
that

296
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,840
the Chinese Communist Party possesses to attack
the US?

297
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,450
They don't really have very many tools.

298
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,639
They've got things that they can do Chris.

299
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,340
But those things are going to hurt China

300
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,380
more than they're going to hurt us.

301
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,610
So as a practical matter,

302
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,139
they don't have tools.

303
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:18,139
On this trade war,

304
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,930
the only thing that China would have as an
advantage

305
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,730
would be political will.

306
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,830
And up until today,

307
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,360
I thought that Trump had more political will
than Xi Jinping.

308
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,990
Today I'm not quite so sure.

309
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,170
And the president ... our president,

310
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,920
I think has got a long way to go to show to
the American public

311
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,589
that he's willing to defend our economy.

312
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,440
So right now financially speaking,

313
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,139
what is the average Chinese citizen feeling,

314
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,529
versus the average American citizen?

315
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,510
In China is really hard to say there's an
average,

316
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,949
because disparity is so great.

317
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,600
I mean, your typical Communist Party cadre

318
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,800
who's making millions and millions-

319
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,350
Mostly on the side.

320
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,410
... all on the side.

321
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,089
Yeah, I don't think that they're going to
feel it.

322
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,089
But when you start looking at the numbers
for the economy,

323
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:08,350
you got to be very concerned.

324
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,660
China reported 6.3% growth for the first half
of this year.

325
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
Really unlikely.

326
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,560
Especially when you go back and you start
looking at

327
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,240
the underlying indicators for instance, June
and July.

328
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,640
Pretty horrible.

329
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,350
And there are indication of really soft domestic
demand.

330
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,279
Most important thing are the soft import numbers,

331
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,570
because that really reflects what the demand
is inside China,

332
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,220
but even some of the consumer numbers,

333
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
everyone's saying,

334
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,350
"Oh China no longer has a manufacturing based
economy."

335
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,230
Well, it's good because the manufacturing
PMIs

336
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,910
are both flashing red,

337
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,579
but even if you were to say manufacturing

338
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,360
isn't important for China anymore,

339
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,649
which I think is wrong,

340
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,779
nonetheless car sales are down in July 13th
straight month.

341
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,040
This year is going to be negative

342
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,790
on car sales as opposed to last year.

343
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,230
That's a bellwether sign of the economy

344
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,690
and of faith in Chinese people of their own
economy.

345
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,519
You got to go back to December of last year

346
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,730
when you had that professor at Roman university

347
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,490
who said that in 2018,

348
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,949
the Chinese economy was going to grow no more
than 1.67%

349
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:15,699
and might even contract.

350
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,279
And China comes out with this number,

351
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,930
"Oh, we grew 6.6% in 2018."

352
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,930
That's not the case.

353
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,010
I mean, we can argue all day about

354
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,829
where the Chinese economy is in reality,

355
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,800
but it's probably a lot closer to zero than
it is to six.

356
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,860
A lot of people have said that the trade war
is essentially

357
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,750
an existential threat for the Chinese Communist
Party?

358
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,750
Yeah.

359
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,839
I mean when you set yourself up as an all
powerful,

360
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,150
invincible, infallible organization,

361
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,120
everything Chris is an existential threat,

362
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,160
but the economy is even more so.

363
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,930
And that's because as people say,

364
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,399
and it's absolutely correct,

365
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,560
that the party has said that the continual
delivery of prosperity

366
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,190
shows the wisdom of Communist Party rule.

367
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,990
If your economy is crumbling,

368
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,520
it shows that maybe the Communist Party

369
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,589
isn't infallible and shouldn't be ruling.

370
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:10,110
But it creates grievances.

371
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,560
And it creates grievances at a pretty bad
time for China.

372
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,259
So I think that it is very much an issue

373
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:20,930
which does threaten the continued role of
the party.

374
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,930
As does for instance,

375
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,880
Hong Kong as does for a number of things.

376
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,470
So you think there's still some hope for the
free market?

377
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,259
There's great hope for the free market.

378
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,490
I mean, ultimately free markets prevail.

379
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,120
Sometimes it takes decades

380
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,649
as we saw in the case of the Cold War.

381
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,020
But during the Cold War we thought the Soviet
economy

382
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,310
was doing really well.

383
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,480
The CIA would come up with all these estimates

384
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,519
about how they're outperforming us.

385
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,170
And indeed, Soviet Union was winning the Cold
War

386
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,639
when people thought that the Soviet economy
was productive,

387
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,589
that it was outpacing ours.

388
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,680
Well we've going through this same sort of
pattern

389
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,230
with regard to China,

390
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,949
and now people are starting to say,

391
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:04,640
"Oh, maybe the Chinese economy isn't that
great."

392
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
And I think what we're going to witness

393
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,380
going forward essentially will be people saying,

394
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,470
"Oh my God, the places over there is falling
apart.

395
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,309
We better renew our commitment to democracy."

396
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,449
It's going to happen.

397
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:19,449
So in the end,

398
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,329
do you think there will be a trade deal?

399
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,400
If you're talking decades down the road?

400
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah.

401
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,580
I mean, but right now I don't,

402
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,860
and I think part of it is because

403
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,210
I think the Chinese political system looks
frozen right now.

404
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,350
There's a certain amount of paralysis.

405
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,590
It's got a siege mentality because it's got
the trade war,

406
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,110
it's got the crumbling economy,

407
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,830
it's got Hong Kong.

408
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,190
And of course it's got fights among various
factions at the top,

409
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,630
which I think had been exacerbated by all
of these problems.

410
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,570
When you're an all powerful ruler,

411
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,270
it's great when things are going well for
your country,

412
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,120
such as in 2017 for Xi Jinping.

413
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
You fast forward two years 2019,

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,539
things ain't going so well.

415
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,460
Xi Jinping has nobody to blame.

416
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,820
And because he's taken power from everybody,

417
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,010
which means he's taken accountability.

418
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,070
He's accumulated that for himself.

419
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,419
In 2012 when he became general secretary of
the Communist Party,

420
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,250
it was a collective system.

421
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,059
Nobody got blamed for good things.

422
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,240
Nobody got really praised for bad things.

423
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,480
Nobody got really praised for good things
because,

424
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,260
everyone was in on the decision.

425
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,740
Now that's not the case.

426
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,250
And also of course,

427
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,750
because Xi Jinping has deinstitutionalized
the party.

428
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,240
He's gotten rid of those rules that constrained
him.

429
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,780
But those were rules that also protected him.

430
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,000
So while people say Trump is facing election
in November, 2020,

431
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,410
Xi Jinping faces an election every day.

432
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,330
And the worst that can happen to Trump

433
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,740
is that he doesn't get reelected.

434
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,640
But the worst that can happen to Xi Jinping,

435
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
is pretty bad.

436
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,720
Well, thank you so much for joining me today,
Gordon.

437
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,150
It was another insightful interview.

438
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,780
Well, thank you so much, Chris.
