1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,070
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,680
How did the CCP identify American CIA operatives
in China?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,740
I guess the dark suits and glasses gave it
away.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,080
Everything is awesome when you’re in China...

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,059
and the CCP tells you it’s awesome.

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,770
And finally, America drops a bomb in China:

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,670
The new Star Wars movie.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,640
This is 
China Uncensored.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,080
Last year we reported the revelation

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,690
that the Chinese Communist Party

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,010
had more or less successfully executed

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,570
or imprisoned the CIA’s entire spy ring
in China.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,519
Now I’m not saying I support CIA operations...

14
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,629
but I’m definitely opposed to the killing
of agents.

15
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,679
Not cool, CCP.

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,890
But it was a mystery how the Chinese regime

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,390
got the names and details of those CIA informants.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,589
Was it hackers?

19
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,789
Was it a mole?

20
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,500
Was it a hacker mole?

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,040
Well, the CIA just arrested a former CIA agent

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,320
they think may have been responsible.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,670
53-year-old Jerry Chun Shing Lee

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,310
lives in Hong Kong but was apprehended on
Monday

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,939
when he traveled to John F. Kennedy Airport

26
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,299
in New York.

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,600
Just one more reason you should

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,409
never fly into JFK.

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,810
But just because there’s a little espionage

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,350
and murder between the US and China,

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,619
that doesn’t mean we can’t do business
together!

32
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,500
Google has opened its third office in China,

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,479
in the manufacturing city of Shenzhen.

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,049
You know, Google!

35
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,159
The company that ended its business

36
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,590
operations in China in 2010

37
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,940
because they were sick and tired of

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,609
the Chinese regime forcing them

39
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:44,829
to censor search results.

40
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:47,320
And of the Chinese regime hacking them.

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,829
Lousy hacker moles.

42
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:52,009
But it’s been eight years—

43
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,590
plenty of time to forget all the bad parts!

44
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,899
It’s like looking back to 2010 and thinking,

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,479
“Yeah, The Expendables was

46
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,700
a pretty cool movie, I guess.”

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,840
You guess?

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,539
Do you not remember how the plot made no sense?!

49
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:08,570
And how Arnold Schwarzenegger was only in
it

50
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,810
for like two minutes

51
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,540
after being in all the previews?

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,810
What a rip-off!

53
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,959
Anyway, Google is good with searches,

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,909
but bad with memory.

55
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,120
So they figured it was time for a sequel,

56
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,819
and set up this new office in Shenzhen.

57
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,780
The office itself isn’t a big deal.

58
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,709
It’s just a workspace for Google staff

59
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,290
who are already traveling back and forth to
China.

60
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,430
But it highlights how Google

61
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,250
is expanding its operations there.

62
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,930
Google is pushing to manufacture

63
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,209
more hardware in China.

64
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,900
Google’s also opening an Artificial Intelligence

65
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,920
research center in China.

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,860
Which, to me, doesn’t seem so smart.

67
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,830
And Google isn’t the only Western Company

68
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,560
trying to make inroads.

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,120
LEGO is partnering with Chinese tech company
Tencent

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,459
to make online games.

71
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,830
Obviously LEGO will have to make some changes.

72
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,860
For instance, deviating from the LEGO instructions

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,840
will now be a crime.

74
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,760
And the Chinese edition of the LEGO Movie

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,790
has no evil government overlord.

76
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,860
It just ends 5 minutes in,

77
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,800
with the Everything is Awesome song.

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,050
According to India’s Economic Times,

79
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,100
these satellite photos show a build up

80
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,120
of the Chinese military, including armored
tanks,

81
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,989
along the North Doklam plateau.

82
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,129
That’s very close to disputed territory

83
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,220
between China and Bhutan.

84
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,750
It was the site of a months-long border conflict

85
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,960
between China, Bhutan and India.

86
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,030
Is it already time for another border dispute

87
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,439
between China and India?

88
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,400
We’ll keep an eye on the situation

89
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,720
to see how it develops.

90
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,200
You know what a requirement

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,610
for being a lawyer in China is?

92
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,780
Love the Chinese Communist Party.

93
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,780
And if you don’t,

94
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,750
you can’t be a lawyer.

95
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,750
This is ridiculous.

96
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,910
Doesn’t the Chinese regime know l

97
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,159
awyers are incapable of feeling love?

98
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,440
This is Yu Wensheng.

99
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,409
He’s a Chinese human rights lawyer

100
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:07,280
who has criticized the Chinese leadership.

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
But several months ago,

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,189
he tried to open up his own law firm.

103
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,450
This is what Beijing authorities

104
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,590
told him in a letter:

105
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,170
“Through investigations, this organization
found

106
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,359
you have openly expressed opposition

107
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,400
to the [Communist] Party’s leadership.”

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,340
And now they’ve taken away his license.

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,220
According to the BBC, since 2015,

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,940
“More than 300 lawyers, legal assistants
and activists

111
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,620
have been questioned, and more than

112
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,389
two dozen have been formally investigated.”

113
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,139
And in a move that’s sure not to

114
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,400
anger Muslims around the world,

115
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,790
the “Chinese government authorities

116
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,580
have banned Muslim children from attending

117
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,770
religious events during winter break.”

118
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,590
The parents were furious.

119
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,990
But the kids were like,

120
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,030
“Oh no.

121
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,310
I guess I’ll have to go outside and play.”

122
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,639
Speaking of kids,

123
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,860
remember Ice Boy from last week’s episode?

124
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,310
Well he’s had his 15 minutes of fame.

125
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,870
Because now it’s all about Little Li.

126
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,870
At just 7 years old,

127
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,960
Little Li is already working as a deliveryman,

128
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,180
usually making around 30 stops a day.

129
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,590
This has sparked outrage on Chinese social
media

130
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,440
over child poverty,

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,669
something the Chinese regime

132
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,169
really doesn’t want people talking about.

133
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,620
Li’s father is presumed dead,

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,759
and his mother abandoned him for her other
family.

135
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,110
He’s being raised by

136
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,940
an old colleague of his father’s who,

137
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,250
you guessed it,

138
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,100
works as a delivery man.

139
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,400
He tried to get Li registered to go to school,

140
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,310
but couldn’t because of China’s

141
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,430
strict household registration program.

142
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,460
Now that the Internet has discovered Little
Li,

143
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,470
the local authorities have moved him to an
orphanage.

144
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,720
Hopefully now Little Li will get to attend
school,

145
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,540
and be bored like all the other kids.

146
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,770
Speaking of poverty,

147
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,360
another Chinese city has admitted

148
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,389
it faked economic data.

149
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,160
Baotou in China’s Inner Mongolia region

150
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,729
actually made about half as much revenue

151
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,120
as local officials had reported.

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,180
And finally, in entertainment news,

153
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,350
the Last Jedi bombed so badly in China,

154
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,350
it was pulled from theaters.

155
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,250
They blamed bad reviews.

156
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,120
And the fact that the original Star Wars trilogy

157
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,080
was banned in China for decades.

158
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,620
But I think the real reason The Last Jedi
bombed is,

159
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,270
Chinese people don’t like Porgs.

160
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,270
What do you think?

161
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,360

162

Uncensored.

166
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,090
But there’s more to tell!
