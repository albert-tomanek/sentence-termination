1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,949
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,949
what to do with too many college graduates.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,320
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,169
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,999
Being young in China isn't all sunshine and
bubble tea.

6
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:16,999
For example,

7
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:21,070
this year almost 8 million young people will
graduate university

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,020
and enter the job market.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,160
And there’s not enough jobs for them.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,970
If you thought the US job market was tough,

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,970
China is a place where 10,000 people applied

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,510
to be a receptionist.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,130
Economic opportunities?

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,520
Hold please!

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,040
The housing situation is not a rosy picture
either.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,680
In fact, a lot of them live together in crowded underground compounds

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,980
called ant colonies.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,420
A large number of restless,

19
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,010
unemployed young people can be a recipe for
disaster.

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,960
Especially when they’re mostly men—

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,470
because of that whole sex-selective abortion
thing

22
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,100
that resulted from decades of the Communist
Party's One-Child policy.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,140
Fortunately, the Party has a solution.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,830
They've just issued guidelines calling for
more college graduates

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,100
to work in poor rural communities.

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,120
That actually sounds like a good idea:

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,780
Programs that would employ young people

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,570
while also using their skills to help the
country.

29
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,400
Let's see what the guidelines say.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
Ok...here we go.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,320
General requirements.

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Guiding ideology?

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,280
“Fully implement the spirit of the 18th
National Congress of the CPC

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,820
and the Third Plenary Session of the 18th
CPC Central Committee,

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,100
the Fourth Plenary Session,

36
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,800
the Fifth Session of the CPC Central Committee,

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,200
the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC
Central Committee

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,430
and the Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th
CPC Central Committee,

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,580
thoroughly implement the new series of important speeches

40
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,080
of Xi Jinping...

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
something something...

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,900
four comprehensives...

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
something something...

44
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,520
core socialist values…”

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,560
Is this how they write everything?

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,440
Let's just skip ahead.

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,560
Ok, here's something.

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
Encouraging college students to join the PLA.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,819
They’re calling on “excellent college
graduates

50
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,249
to make contributions from the army barracks.”

51
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:19,209
Hopefully more excellent than 3,500 students
in Peking University's 2011 class,

52
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,449
who made 6,000 trips to the doctor during
their mandatory

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,030
two-week military training.

54
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,440
Guess they just weren't ready for those long
marches.

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,219
But you see, there’s been a rise in military
dropouts.

56
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,779
According to China’s Military Service Law,

57
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:39,409
anyone between the ages of 18 and 22

58
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,019
must serve two years in the People’s Liberation
Army.

59
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,780
They won’t take just anyone though.

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,989
You have to be healthy,

61
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,669
and you have to hold the right political views.

62
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,669
For example,

63
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:51,669
for an officer,

64
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,310
30 to 40% of his career is spent not on training,

65
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,180
but on political work.

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,950
That is, “studying CCP propaganda,

67
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,450
singing patriotic songs,

68
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,200
and conducting small group discussions

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,930
on Marxist-Leninist theory.”

70
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,290
You can see why the Party

71
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,749
would want to encourage young people to volunteer.

72
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,209
What many young Chinese are doing

73
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,980
is opting to postpone the draft

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,430
until after they graduate from college.

75
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,109
By which point they’re past the age requirement

76
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,750
and can just skip it entirely.

77
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,700
Don’t worry,

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,820
even if they do,

79
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,880
they still won’t have missed out on that
patriotic education.

80
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:27,889
Across China,

81
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,340
first year high school students and college
freshman

82
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,139
are required to go through military training.

83
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,099
Mostly it involves marching drills and singing
patriotic songs -

84
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,419
something every teenager loves.

85
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,699
Military training for students began in 1955.

86
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,030
But then in 1989, this happened.

87
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,230
Waves of restless,

88
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,540
educated young people thought the Communist Party

89
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,200
wanted to hear what they had to say.

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,840
That didn’t go so well.

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,780
Universities were now seen as a problem for
the Party—

92
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,109
hotbeds of counter-revolutionary protest.

93
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,819
That’s when a comprehensive patriotic education
campaign

94
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,120
was started.

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,430
By 2001,

96
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,120
military training had become mandatory for
all high school

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,169
and college freshmen.

98
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,719
And it seems to have worked.

99
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,389
I mean, democracy was, like, so 80s.

100
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,000
But that doesn't necessarily translate

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,780
into people wanting to join the military.

102
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,280
For years,

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,640
the Chinese military was a career option for
people

104
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,139
who couldn't afford or get into college.

105
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,139
But Chinese leader Xi Jinping

106
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,759
is actually trying to make the military leaner—

107
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,440
by laying off hundreds of thousands of soldiers

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,509
and putting an emphasis on technology.

109
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,620
So why is the PLA

110
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,379
trying to recruit more excellent students?

111
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,560
Well, having more educated officers for one.

112
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
And as a bonus,

113
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,840
it’s a way to keep potentially restless
young people occupied

114
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,120
instead of festering as marginalized out of
work layabouts

115
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,610
in ant colonies.

116
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,229
Yeah, those Chinese youth are too entitled
and individualistic.

117
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,909
I mean, they may be hardworking,

118
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,340
but they're getting too selfish.

119
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,930
Do they even think about core socialist values
anymore?

120
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,190
Wait a minute...

121
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,930
that sounds familiar!

122
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,780
Chinese millennials sound just like us American
millennials.

123
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,260
Well, not the core socialist values part.

124
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,940
But we have more in common than you might think.

125
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,900
Maybe this is good.

126
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,759
Maybe we can all put a little less emphasis

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,930
on preparing to fight each other,

128
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,330
and go get some bubble tea instead.

129
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,289
So what do you think about China’s excellent
students?

130
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,800
Leave your comments below.

131
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,460
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

132
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,220
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

133
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,320
See you next time.
