00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,230
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,400
I miss Ask Jeeves.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,840
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,660
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,690
Good news, everyone!

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,780
Google has finally taken the chains off.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,780
Back in May,

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,140
Google removed its famous “don’t be evil”
motto

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,189
from its code of conduct.

10
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,089
Google’s new motto is:

11
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,909
Don’t let anyone find out that you’re
evil.

12
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:28,310
Moral relativism is cool.

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,570
What is evil, anyway?

14
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,750
Don’t be unprofitable.

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,680
Don’t learn from your mistakes.

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,030
No, history never repeats itself.

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,120
Or at least that’s what I assume from this
article from the Intercept.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,410
It turns out, there’s a tratorious Google
employee who still hasn’t

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,829
gotten the hang of being evil but hiding it
per company policy.

20
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,769
Because that employee revealed Google’s
top secret project:

21
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:55,980
making a censored Android app for China that
uses their search engine.

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,379
The secret project is called Dragonfly,

23
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,210
and it’s allegedly been in the works among
a select number of employees

24
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,000
since the spring of 2017.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,780
We reached out to Google for comment about
their search engine in China.

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,110
Their “Google Spokesperson” said they
do have mobile apps in China,

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,840
but they don’t comment on speculation about
future plans.

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,000
It’s like if your wife asks,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,240
“You’re not going to eat that entire box
of Cheez-Its

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,960
in one sitting, are you?”

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
And you reply,

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,450
“There are things I’m going to eat,

33
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,219
but I don’t comment on specific future eating
plans.”

34
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,640
So China has a pretty big internet market:

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,600
750 million Internet users.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,530
That’s bigger than the entire population
of Europe.

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,719
And it seems like,

38
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,670
well there’s a ton of money Google could
be making in China.

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,710
And now that Google isn’t concerned about
not being evil,

40
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,680
they can finally tap into it.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,870
With the help of an “unnamed” Chinese
partner company.

42
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,549
As you know, the Chinese Communist Party

43
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,549
likes to keep a tight grip on the Internet.

44
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,750
Otherwise Chinese citizens might learn dangerous
things,

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,290
like how their government was totally willing
to massacre

46
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,230
a bunch of students in Tiananmen Square.

47
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,729
With the new Google search engine app for
Android,

48
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,200
Chinese people don’t need to know all that.

49
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
Because they won’t even be able to find
links

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,709
to troubling informational websites with y

51
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:13,709
ou know, facts—

52
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,950
like the BBC or Wikipedia.

53
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,769
Now you might be concerned that Google’s

54
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,569
new alleged Chinese search engine would create

55
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,030
some kind of bad precedent.

56
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,680
That, if the biggest search engine in the
world

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,710
is willing to cave to Chinese censorship demands,

58
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,520
why should any company resist?

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
It’s a fair point, but may I remind you

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,800
HOW MUCH MONEY IS ON THE LINE HERE, PEOPLE!

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,570
In fact, maybe Google’s new motto is actually:

62
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,830
Don’t be unprofitable.

63
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,580
After all, being evil can make you so much
more money.

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,099
Clearly that important point was lost on the
Google employee

65
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,270
who leaked the secret plan.

66
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,270
He told The Intercept,

67
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,330
“I’m against large companies and governments
collaborating

68
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,280
in the oppression of their people,

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,019
and feel like transparency around

70
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,670
what’s being done is in the public interest,”

71
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,379
and that “what is done in China will become
a template f

72
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,739
or many other nations.”

73
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:05,739
What?

74
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,459
Are you saying that this will embolden

75
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:08,739
other authoritarian nations

76
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,390
to further limit free information?

77
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,819
Well, don’t worry,

78
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,709
because other authoritarian nations don’t
have

79
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,010
750 million internet users.

80
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,120
Cha-ching.

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,990
Google is a company with 88,000 employees.

82
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,120
You can’t expect them all to have jumped
on

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,860
the evil is okay bandwagon.

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,239
So to minimize the chance of leaks,

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,209
only “a handful of top executives and managers,”

86
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,840
knew about project Dragonfly.

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,069
Executives like the current CEO.

88
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,240
Last December, he travelled to China

89
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,549
and met with top Communist Party officials,

90
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,280
who had great money-making ideas,

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,720
as communist officials always do.

92
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,930
That same month,

93
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,100
Google opened an artificial intelligence

94
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,580
research center in Beijing.

95
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,769
In May, they brought their file management
app

96
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,439
to the Chinese market.

97
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,610
And in July, they launched a fun game

98
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,700
for the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat.

99
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,769
Let’s just say there are some privacy concerns
about WeChat.

100
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,520
Clearly not a concern for Google, though!

101
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,770
In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if Google’s
unnamed

102
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,140
Chinese partner company is Tencent,

103
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,459
the maker of WeChat.

104
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,470
I wonder if this new app will also give user
data

105
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,620
directly to the Chinese government,

106
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,570
just like WeChat does!

107
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,690
Now some people have compared Google’s move
to

108
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,830
the shameful history of IBM in Nazi Germany.

109
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,370
I mean, I’m not making that comparison.

110
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,600
I’m just saying, some people have—

111
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,060
and now you know that.

112
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,950
But giving in to the Chinese regime

113
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,230
isn’t actually new for Google.

114
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,650
They were in China before.

115
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,710
In 2006, Google set up

116
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,021
a highly censored version of their search
engine

117
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:43,630
for the Chinese market.

118
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,950
And Google got slammed for it.

119
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,990
Here’s a clip from a 2006 Congressional
hearing about

120
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,650
American tech companies.

121
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,110
US Congressman Chris Smith was not too happy
with Google.

122
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,200
“When a user enters a forbidden word,

123
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,580
such as ‘democracy’ or ‘Chinese torture’
or ‘Falun Gong,’

124
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,850
the search results are blocked,

125
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,050
or you are redirected to a misleading site,

126
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,100
and the user’s computer can be frozen

127
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,450
for unspecified periods of time…”

128
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,320
“...It is hard not to draw the conclusion
that Google

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,670
has seriously compromised its ‘Don’t Be
Evil’ policy.”

130
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,690
Well guess what, foolish politician actually
trying to call out

131
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,500
a big corporation for it shady behavior?

132
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,070
Google doesn’t have the “don’t be evil”
policy anymore.

133
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,220
Take that!

134
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,510
Problem solved.

135
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,160
So what happened to that censored Chinese
version of Google

136
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,930
that Congressman Smith was complaining about
in 2006?

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,840
Four years later, Google backed out.

138
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,190
In a 2010 official blog post, they said:

139
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,190
Guess what?

140
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,500
The Chinese Communist Party hacked us.

141
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,120
And they targeted the gmail accounts of human
rights activists.

142
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,910
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal.

143
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,360
Google stood up to the evil Chinese regime.

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,660
They announced that they were uncensoring
their search engine,

145
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,450
and if that meant the regime kicked them out
of China,

146
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,750
so be it.

147
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,180
And so it was.

148
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,300
Google co-founder Sergey Brin,

149
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,440
who partly grew up in the Soviet Union,

150
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,960
told the Wall Street Journal that he was worried
about

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,170
China’s totalitarianism.

152
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,440
And, at the time,

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
I praised Google for doing the right thing.

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,060
It turned out later,

155
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,740
their pull-out might have been about

156
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,260
more than just doing what was right.

157
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,060
It was also maybe because they were

158
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,780
hardly making any money in China.

159
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
But don’t worry.

160
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,490
Google is under new leadership now!

161
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,540
And their new motto is:

162
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,290
Don’t learn from your mistakes.

163
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,950
Because, the lesson from this should have
been:

164
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,950
It’s really hard for Google to make money
in the Chinese market

165
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,430
because the Chinese regime will always

166
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,630
stack the cards against you in favor of Chinese
companies

167
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,650
while also hacking you and stealing your intellectual
property.

168
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,790
But the lesson the new Google CEO took was:

169
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,090
If at first you don’t succeed,

170
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,070
try, try again.

171
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,850
But now with more evil.

172
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,850
The sad part is,

173
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,990
Google is hardly alone in wanting to be in
China:

174
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,470
Bing and Yahoo already have censored search
engines there,

175
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,280
although they have a fraction of the market
share

176
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,530
of Chinese companies like Baidu.

177
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,680
Apple has made a huge investment in China.

178
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,100
And we all know that Mark Zuckerberg

179
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,750
will literally run through the Beijing smog

180
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,030
to get Facebook there.

181
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,530
But at one point, Google was alone

182
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,400
in standing up to the Chinese Communist Party.

183
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,640
Which makes this new search engine thing

184
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,740
so much more disappointing.

185
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,600
And now the question on my mind is,

186
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,480
if Google does get back into the Chinese market,

187
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,110
and is desperate to make money there,

188
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,320
what happens if someday the Chinese Communist
Party

189
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,800
decides it doesn’t like how Google operates
outside China?

190
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,060
Like they do with, I don’t know,

191
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,290
international airlines that call Taiwan a
country.

192
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,730
To get into the Chinese market,

193
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,840
would Google be more evil outside China, too?

194
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,360
As someone who hosts the world’s

195
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,720
most important English-language satirical
news show

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,680
about China on YouTube,

197
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,750
which is owned by Google,

198
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,470
I’m a little bit concerned.

199
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,500
When you have a moment, try this.

200
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,710
Do a search for China Uncensored.

201
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,150
“China uncensorship pollution”!?

202
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,960
That’s a funny autocomplete!

203
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,910
Oddly enough, our newer, much smaller podcast,

204
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,150
China Unscripted, does come up.

205
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,830
We’ve also had fans of the show tell us

206
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,710
that they’ve stopped seeing China Uncensored

207
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,520
in recommended videos.

208
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,370
That they get no notification of new episodes,

209
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,490
even when they have the notification bell
turned on.

210
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,060
We’re constantly having videos get demonetized.

211
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,590
And get this:

212
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,680
Some viewers have told me they were suddenly

213
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,740
unsubscribed from China Uncensored.

214
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,140
That even happened to Shelley,

215
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,340
who you know,

216
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
is on the show.

217
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,479
And I’m sure all of these problems will
get much better

218
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,840
once Google has serious financial stakes in
China.

219
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,730
There’s no evidence that Google

220
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,760
is intentionally targeting China Uncensored.

221
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,890
It could just be that Google is inept.

222
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,970
And that is completely possible.

223
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,120
You see, China is no less totalitarian than
it was back in 2010,

224
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,970
when Google initially pulled out.

225
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,450
In fact, they are increasingly using online
surveillance

226
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,440
to control Chinese people.

227
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,430
But even if Google doesn’t care about being
evil anymore—

228
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,600
even if all they care about is making money
for their shareholders,

229
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,090
or if they’re just drooling over the idea
of getting a piece of

230
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,560
750 million internet users—

231
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,740
going in to China is a bad idea.

232
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,810
Having a Chinese partner company

233
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,790
may help Google make more money,

234
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,060
but there’s definitely a price to pay.

235
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,250
And it might be higher than they think.

236
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,810
Which is why Google should really change their
motto to:

237
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,570
Don’t be stupid.

238
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,430
What do you think about Google’s re-entry
into China?

239
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,900
What should their new motto be?

240
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,540
Leave your comments below.

241
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,090
And now, it’s time to answer questions from
fans

242
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,930
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

243
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,180
Alfred Schneider aks,

244
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,520
“Chris, I've heard that PRC have built

245
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,030
some delightful vacation resorts

246
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,810
in the South China Sea.

247
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,800
Which one would you like to visit the most,
and why?”

248
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,820
Oh Alfred, that is probably the toughest question

249
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
I’ve been asked so far.

250
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,630
There are so many; how can I choose?

251
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,890
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party is developing

252
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,270
a booming tourism industry in the South China
Sea.

253
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,050
Particularly in disputed territories.

254
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,460
I mean, my favorite Chinese state-run media
the Global Times

255
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,240
makes a vacation there sound so appealing.

256
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,310
Look at that beachfront view.

257
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,270
“Since 2013, around 10,000 Chinese tourists
have been able

258
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,280
to enjoy the natural beauty of the Xisha Islands.”

259
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,700
Otherwise known as the Paracel Islands,

260
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,050
territory claimed by China, Vietnam, and Taiwan.

261
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,670
The best part about vacationing in these wonderful
resorts

262
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,140
is probably the flybys from Chinese nuclear
capable bombers.

263
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,650
Now if that doesn’t sound like a vacation,

264
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,750
I don’t know what does.

265
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,150
Just like the tourists in this Global Times
article,

266
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,430
I too would love to travel to the Xisha-slash-Paracel
Islands

267
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,280
on the Coconut-fragrance Princess,

268
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,010
watch a flag-raising ceremony

269
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,340
as the Chinese National Anthem is played over
the water,

270
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,270
and talk about never giving up an inch

271
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,460
of China’s territorial integrity.

272
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,730
Thanks for your question Alfred.

273
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,770
And before we wrap up,

274
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,900
this is a good time to make a plug for your
support.

275
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,240
This show is funded mainly not through Google
ads,

276
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,010
but through contributions from viewers.

277
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,020
You can contribute a dollar or more per episode

278
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,320
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

279
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,680
You’ll get cool rewards,

280
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,920
including a chance to have your questions
for me

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,090
answered here on the show.

282
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,160
And even if you can’t support China Uncensored
on Patreon,

283
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,870
you can make a huge difference by just

284
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,300
sharing the show with your friends and family.

285
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,130
Since Google is going to make that as hard
as possible.

286
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,230
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

287
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,770
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

288
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,760
See you next time.

289
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,240
You know China Uncensored isn’t just on
YouTube.

290
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,410
We have half-hour episodes

291
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,490
you can watch on cable in New York,

292
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,360
San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
