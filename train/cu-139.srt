1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,040
Hey Chris?

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,540
(Inquisitive grunt)

3
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,149
You know how former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin

4
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,629
said he was going to eradicate Falun Gong
in three months?

5
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,440
Yeah?

6
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,700
I don’t think that happened.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,980
May 13th is World Falun Dafa Day.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,890
Falun Dafa is more commonly known as Falun
Gong.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,100
It’s been 24 years its founder Li Hongzhi

10
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,999
began publicly teaching the meditation practice.

11
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:29,199
Here in New York, it’s being celebrated
with a parade.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,580
Around 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners from
around the world

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,810
have descended on New York's humble, rat-infested,
urine-soaked streets.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,240
This is probably the biggest gathering of
the practitioners

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,280
of the much maligned spiritual movement

16
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,899
since the Chinese regime started persecuting
them in 1999.

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,609
So why does the Communist Party consider these
people such a threat?

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
Is that a rhetorical question?

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,440
No…?

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,739
Then how about you go find out?

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,320
WHAT’S YOUR PLAN TO UNDERMINE CHINA?!

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,720
Chris! Be more subtle.

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,120
How are you planning to undermine China?

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,700
Undermine?

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,260
And so, what’s your plan to undermine China?

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,760
What’s your plan to undermine China?

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you. Nevermind.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,560
Ok, it’s hard to see why anyone would consider
these people a threat.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, Chris, have you ever heard of the saying
“qí hǔ nán xià”?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,980
Of course!

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,040
Well, this can’t end well.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,060
“Qí hǔ nán xià.”

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,040
It means if you’re riding
a tiger, it’s hard to get off.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,520
And believe me I know.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
I took China Uncensored Video Editor
Seamus

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,200
to Central Park Zoo to put it to the test.

37
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,000
He will be missed.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,800
Basically, it means you’re in over your
head. Like poor, poor Seamus.

39
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,470
This parade wasn’t part of the plan.

40
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,790
Falun Gong was supposed to be wiped out in
three months.

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,610
Jiang Zemin said he would “Destroy their
reputations,

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,690
cut them off financially, and eradicate them
physically.”

43
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,160
Instead it turned into an 17-year fiasco—

44
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,700
one the Communist Party can’t stop even
if they wanted to.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,420
You see, the Communist Party doesn’t like
to admit

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,110
it ever did anything wrong.

47
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,440
The only thing it admitted might not have
been perfect

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,590
was the Cultural Revolution,

49
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,580
and they still placed most of the blame on
Mao’s wife.

50
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,220
And then tried to never talk about it again.

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,750
Imagine what would happen if the Party

52
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,540
officially stopped persecuting Falun Gong.

53
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,840
The Party would then have to admit that Falun Gong

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,880
weren’t the crazy dangerous people that had to be put down.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,940
And ordinary Chinese people might think,

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,140
"Hey, if the Party lied about Falun Gong all
these years,

57
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,380
and only persecuted them for political reasons,

58
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,350
the Party could decide to do that to anyone."

59
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,230
And maybe they’d start to question the Party’s
rule.

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,840
Of course, it might already be too late,

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,390
because it seems like people are figuring
out the propaganda on their own.

62
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,090
Yeah, I have some friends from mainland China,
so.

63
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,650
They don't refuse to listen to the truth,
at least, I think.

64
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,680
So they started to feel sorry,

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,840
and feel angry for the Communist Party that they
still do the persecution.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,099
I think they started to question the authority
of the regime.

67
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,900
I know a lot of Chinese from my work, and
so

68
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,010
but I feel like most of them can understand.

69
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,099
I think more and more people now get to know

70
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,160
people who practice Falun Dafa,

71
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,800
and also they have a pretty good impression.

72
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,840
My relatives in China used to be afraid to
talk about Falun Gong

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,440
but now they’re not afraid.

74
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,060
They’ve changed their minds about the Communist
Party

75
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,599
because in China there are no principles,

76
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,119
only money and power, and they have suffered.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,840
So basically, the Party can’t stop the persecution
of Falun Gong

78
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,750
without exposing themselves,

79
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,300
but they can’t keep it going forever either.

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,160
Exactly.

81
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,060
Hey, I've been trying to reach Seamus all
day,

82
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:17,159
and I haven't been able to.

83
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:18,879
Do you know what happened to him?
