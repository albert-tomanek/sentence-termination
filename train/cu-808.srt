1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,200
China wants to replace the United States

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,140
as the regional power in the Middle East.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,280
And big deals with Saudi Arabia are the key.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,100
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,460
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,669
Saudi Arabia has been a long-time US ally.

7
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:20,539
Sometimes even a close friend.

8
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,349
All the way through President Trump, too—

9
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:26,099
though he seems slightly less comfortable
with the hand-holding.

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,130
Now the story of why the US and Saudi Arabia

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,539
have been friends is a whole other topic.

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,470
Maybe someday on America Uncovered.

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,090
But the big news is that the Chinese Communist
Party

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,039
is looking to step in.

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,590
Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants to tie Saudi
Arabia

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,510
to his Belt and Road Initiative—

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,079
the trillion dollar global infrastructure
plan

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,120
supported by a seriously terrible propaganda
song.

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,840
The future's coming now!

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,700
The Belt and Road is how!

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,620
That song is also a virulent strain of earworn.

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,320
Anyway, the Chinese Communist Party’s ultimate
goal

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,050
in improving ties with Saudi Arabia is to
become

24
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,910
a dominant foreign power in the Middle East.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,300
Of course, history has not always been kind
to

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,750
foreign powers in the Middle East.

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,760
But the Chinese Communist Party probably doesn’t
know this,

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,760
since it rewrote all the Chinese language
history books.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,620
I guess nothing happened between 1966 and
1976.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,400
Ok, back to Saudi Arabia.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,620
That country invests heavily in the United
States.

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,180
And it’s mainly through the state-owned

33
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,180
Saudi Public Investment Fund.

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,630
It’s one of the largest sovereign wealth
funds in the Middle East,

35
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,570
with about 300 billion dollars in assets.

36
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,900
That’s a lot of money.

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,980
Like, investing three-and-a-half billion dollars
into Uber

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,390
was chump change.

39
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,050
By 2030, the Saudi Public Investment Fund

40
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,470
plans to invest more than 2 trillion dollars
worldwide.

41
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,860
And a big chunk of that could end up in China.

42
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,360
The head of the Saudi Fund was in Beijing
last month

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,490
for a forum on Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road
Initiative.

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,670
He told CNBC,

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,660
“This is the first time for me to go out

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,370
and meet asset managers,

47
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,480
companies, Chinese entrepreneurs,

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,600
and they are really very impressive.”

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,490
And now, a spokesman for the fund said they
were

50
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,460
“planning to open a new office in Asia ‘to
focus on China.’”

51
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,870
Now wait just a minute.

52
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,750
Questionable dealings with Saudi Arabia

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,670
are supposed to be a US thing!

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,980
This is just another case of the Chinese Communist
Party

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,580
stealing our intellectual property.

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,850
And they’ve been working on this for a while.

57
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,850
In February, the Saudi Crown Prince

58
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,270
met Xi Jinping in China.

59
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,460
They had great things to say about each other.

60
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
Xi Jinping said,

61
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,630
“The two countries should speed up

62
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,630
the signing of an implementation plan

63
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,710
on connecting the Belt and Road Initiative

64
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,520
with the Saudi Vision 2030.”

65
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,740
That’s Saudi Arabia’s own massive economic
plan.

66
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,790
And the Crown Prince said,

67
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,630
“Saudi Arabia is full of confidence in the
bright future

68
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,490
of China's development under the leadership
of President Xi.”

69
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,820
That was obviously the right thing to say,

70
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,230
because the two countries then signed

71
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,480
28 billion dollars in deals.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,020
Wait, that gives me an idea!

73
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,230
You know, I, too am full of confidence in
the bright future

74
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,130
of China’s development under the leadership
of Presitator Xi.

75
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,900
Can I have 28 billion dollars now?

76
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,980
No?

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,800
How about just enough to pay off my student
loans?

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,140
OK, how about a tunafish sandwich?

79
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,240
Anyway, that 28 billion was just a continuation

80
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,760
of a 65 billion dollar investment and trade
deal

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,870
signed by the Saudi King and Xi Jinping in
2017.

82
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,850
It’s good to be king.

83
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,660
You can hold hands with every world leader.

84
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,960
Many of the Belt and Road projects

85
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,570
will include energy grids and ports.

86
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,370
There are reasons behind these agreements.

87
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,720
China is hungry for oil.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Especially to fuel the Belt and Road.

89
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,849
China gets oil from all over the Middle East,

90
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,350
and has invested heavily in the region.

91
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,459
And that’s made China a powerful force,

92
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:57,950
as different countries, including Saudi Arabia,

93
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,569
compete for Chinese investment.

94
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,041
Now, China has historically had trouble in
the Middle East

95
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,600
because they’ve supported Iran for years.

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,720
And a lot of other Middle Eastern countries...

97
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,300
don’t like Iran.

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,040
But the Chinese Communist Party has solved
that problem...

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,880
with billions of dollars.

100
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,890
Yes, through the Belt and Road,

101
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,079
China has become the largest trading partner

102
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,349
of the Arab League, including Saudi Arabia,

103
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:22,479
as well as Iran.

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
And the Chinese Communist Party could even

105
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,060
eventually replace the US as a power in the
Middle East.

106
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,330
I mean it’s been so fun and easy for the
US;

107
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,300
I can see why China would want a piece of
the action.

108
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,300
So Saudi Arabia is boosting oil exports to
China.

109
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,360
And it’s helping China build several of
its own oil refineries,

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,840
through joint ventures with the Saudi

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,470
State-run oil company Aramco.

112
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,059
Saudi Arabia is also helping build

113
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:49,249
a 10-billion-dollar oil refinery

114
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:52,430
in a Chinese-controlled port in Pakistan.

115
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,650
That’s key Belt and Road real estate right
there.

116
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,919
These oil deals are important,

117
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,550
because the latest US sanctions on Iranian
oil

118
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,199
also apply to China.

119
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,280
Meaning, the Chinese regime either has to

120
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,569
defy US sanctions, and face the penalty,

121
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:11,569
or it has to find other sources of oil.

122
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:13,120
Though so far,

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,229
China hasn’t reached out to Saudi Arabia
for more oil.

124
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,430
As far as we know.

125
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,430
But to say the China-Saudi relationship is
just about oil would be crude.

126
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,449
Saudi Arabia also is a strategic location

127
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,020
for China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

128
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,659
It would give China access to the Red Sea
through Saudi ports,

129
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,020
which means easier access to the Suez Canal

130
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,639
and the Mediterranean Sea,

131
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,169
where China controls a major port to Europe
through Greece.

132
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:42,860
And is also investing in a key port in Italy.

133
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,460
And Saudi Arabia gets more out of this

134
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,620
than just a market for oil.

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,930
It gets an alternative to the United States.

136
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,789
Global oil prices are being kept down

137
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,550
by increased US shale oil production.

138
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,800
And inside the US,

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,650
there’s less support for Saudi Arabia,

140
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,240
especially over the war in Yemen.

141
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,249
However, President Trump vetoed that resolution.

142
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:07,819
Still, Saudi Arabia is looking for new allies.

143
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:08,819
To that end,

144
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,550
Saudi schools will now be teaching Mandarin.

145
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,240
That decision happened after that 28 billion
dollar deal

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,150
Saudi Arabia and China signed in February.

147
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,849
Because when you’re an absolute monarch,

148
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,240
you can just decide those things on the spot.

149
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,030
And you can also totally sell out the Muslims
inside China

150
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,139
without public oversight.

151
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,839
The Chinese regime has been putting the Uighurs,

152
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,379
a mostly Muslim ethnic minority,

153
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,580
into concentration camps

154
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,319
and trying to wipe out their language and
culture.

155
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,259
They call it fighting terrorism and extremism.

156
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:41,479
Well, after that 28 billion dollar deal,

157
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,749
the Saudi Crown Prince said

158
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,830
“China has the right to carry out anti-terrorism

159
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,439
and de-extremisation work for its national
security.”

160
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,370
And if that involves putting a million Uighur
Muslims

161
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,300
into Chinese concentration camps,

162
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
so be it.

163
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,069
At least they’ll be learning Mandarin.

164
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,120
So what do you think of Saudi Arabia’s

165
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,599
growing ties with China?

166
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,249
Leave your comments below.

167
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,449
And now, I’m going to answer a question
from one of you—

168
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:05,759
who supports China Uncensored

169
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,909
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

170
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:10,300
Today’s question comes from...

171
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,520
Charlie Matsubara.

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,460
“What are the best and worst things about

173
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,439
living and working in NYC?”

174
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,619
What’s the best thing?

175
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:21,610
Living in a city that has pancakes this fluffy.

176
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,629
I’m kind of obsessed.

177
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,710
What’s the worst thing?

178
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,180
Living in a city that has pancakes this fluffy.

I’m pretty sure I’ve discovered a new
type of diabetes.

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,399
Thanks for you question.

181
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,649
And if you’d like me to answer your question
on the show,

182
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,009
sign up to support China Uncensored

183
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,309
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

184
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,369
We rely on your support to keep the show going

185
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,499
since YouTube likes demonetizing videos

186
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,089
that are too controversial.

187
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,870
Which happens to include a lot of videos

188
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,369
that criticize the Chinese Communist Party.

189
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,949
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

190
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:52,160
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

191
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,100
See you next time.
