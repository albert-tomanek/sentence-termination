00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,339
Hi, Chris Chappell here.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,420
I just landed in sunny Florida,

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,400
where I'm going to interview Chinese leader Xi Jinping

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,230
during his visit with President Trump this
week.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,410
Ok, so it didn't go so well

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,070
last time I tried to interview the paramount
leader

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,160
of the Chinese Communist Party in 2015.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,400
Sure, I may be banned for life

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,430
from the Waldorf Astoria in New York.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,640
But you know what they say:

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,540
Second time's a charm.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,990
Palm Beach Florida.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,079
One of the richest towns in America.

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,800
Home to more than 25 billionaires.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,079
An oasis of sun, surf, sand...

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,100
and strip malls?

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,420
Oh right.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm in West Palm Beach.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
It's kinda like how West New York

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,979
is actually in New Jersey.

21
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,030
Palm Beach is...

22
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,840
all the way over there.

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,520
Right across the water there

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,460
in Palm Beach,

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,280
the leader of the free world

26
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:11,469
is meeting the leader of the unfree world.

27
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,990
I’m of course talking about President Donald Trump

28
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,229
and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

29
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,810
And what better place for Xi Jinping

30
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,450
to get a taste of American culture

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,760
than Florida?!

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,620
I’m sure he and Trump

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,120
have lots to talk about.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,619
North Korea

35
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:25,740
Trade

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,899
Plus they can share tips

37
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:29,259
on how they both handle factional infighting

38
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,030
in their administrations.

39
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,940
Now the last time Xi Jinping came to the US,

40
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,880
I didn’t get the interview I wanted.

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,689
But this time, I’m more confident.

42
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,780
I’ve already sent off my interview request
via fax

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,729
to the Chinese Embassy.

44
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,630
Because the only way to make a media request

45
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,990
with the Chinese Embassy

46
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,590
is by fax.

47
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,880
I still haven’t heard back.

48
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,979
but this is going to happen.

49
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,040
I just have to figure out how to get...

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,380
over there.

51
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,130
Darn it!

52
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,130
Shelley!

53
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,229
The road's closed!

54
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,229
I need another way

55
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,340
to get across the bridge!

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,820
Ok, listen to me carefully.

57
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,960
Turn the car around.

58
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,070
Park it in a strip mall.

59
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,880
And walk across the bridge.

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Seriously?

61
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,380
It's the only way across.

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Making it to Palm Beach

63
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,340
was harder than I imagined.

64
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,269
But I was finally here.

65
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:34,430
I'm headed to Xi Jinping’s hotel,

66
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,790
the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa.

67
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,290
But first,

68
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,069
I decided to pick up a gift for him.

69
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,030
The Chinese are all about guanxi—

70
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,030
relationships!

71
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,430
That’s why I’m going to get Xi

72
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,950
some authentic Americana

73
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,660
at the most American place I could find.

74
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,500
But inside Cracker Barrel,

75
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,880
everything seemed to be made in China.

76
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
China.

77
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
Chiiiinaaa!

78
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,170
Oh, how ’bout this one?

79
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,420
Still China.

80
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,180
But then I realized, back in 2015,

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,690
Trump had already given me the answer!

82
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,019
“If you were President,

83
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,170
would you throw him a big dinner?”

84
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,060
“I would not be throwing him a dinner.

85
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
We’ve had this conversation.

86
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,980
I’d get him a McDonald’s hamburger and
say

87
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,659
‘We got to get down to work.’”

88
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,270
Now I just have to find a McDonalds.

89
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,049
No McDonald's in Palm Beach.

90
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,080
Go back to West Palm Beach.

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,420
As I finally approached Xi Jinping’s hotel,

92
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,819
huge groups of mostly Chinese people

93
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,360
were waiting to greet the Chinese leader.

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
And they were all wearing red shirts and hats.

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,970
We're just curious where you guys got the shirts.

96
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,740
The hats, the shirt, and the bags

97
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,930
were given to us when we got on the bus.

98
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,599
What bus?

99
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,920
From the local Chinese organizations.

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,049
Organizations most definitely not tied

101
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,049
to the Chinese government.

102
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,750
Do any of those organizations

103
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,730
have ties to the Chinese government

104
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,760
or are they...?

105
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Uhhhh

106
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,939
And as I waited alongside these people

107
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,780
who all came here totally independently,

108
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,660
I saw Xi Jinping’s motorcade come by,

109
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,889
and I knew I had my chance.

110
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,889
No, wait!

111
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,889
Xi Jinping,

112
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:26,889
can I get an interview with you?

113
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:27,520
Xi! Xi!

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,940
I think he’s in the next one, for sure.

115
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Mr. Xi, Mr. Xi!

116
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:32,889
Can I get an interview with, please?

117
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,840
No no wait wait!

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,340
Mr. Xi!

119
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,440
Some days you just can’t get an interview

120
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,020
with the leader of the unfree world!

121
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,780
I blew it.

122
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,200
But I knew the interview was waiting for me...

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,540
just behind that fence,

124
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,600
guard towers and rows and rows

125
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,100
of security personnel.

126
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,560
Security is pretty tight.

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,770
But I’m getting this interview

128
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,169
one way or the other.

129
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,750
Because there’s one thing

130
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,110
the Secret Service didn’t count on.

131
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,720
And that’s that Chris Chappell

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,729
is the three-time regional Topanga Canyon
regional

133
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,580
Father Son foot race champion.

134
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,700
Let’s just see them try to catch me.

135
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,560
Shelley!

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,880
I'm going to make a run for it.

137
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,259
I need you to get me past the Secret Service.

138
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,259
What?

139
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,960
No.

140
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,920
Why not?

141
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,380
Professional courtesy, Chris.

142
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,370
We do not mess with the Secret Service.

143
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,870
Also, I’m pretty sure they have guns.

144
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,319
But I can dodge bullets!

145
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,419
No, you can’t.

146
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:26,660
Fine.

147
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,430
I'll just join Mar-a-Lago.

148
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,699
That'll get me in there.

149
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,050
The initiation fee is $200,000.

150
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,360
What?

151
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,699
No.

152
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:35,810
Just give it up, Chris.

153
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,810
You know Xi Jinping

154
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,509
has never given a TV interview

155
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,400
to Western media, right?

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
That's great!

157
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,410
I'll be the first!

158
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,580
I'm going for it.

159
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,410
They caught me instantly.

160
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,450
Fine.

161
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,450
I may not be able

162
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,880
to get to Xi Jinping this time,

163
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
but I'm not giving up.

164
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,930
You hear me, Xi!

165
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,710
Someday, the interview will be mine!

166
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,710
I know!

167
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,760
I’ll just have to fly to Beijing!

168
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,400
On second thought, maybe not.

169
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
But you know,

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Fort Lauderdale is only an hour away.

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,210
You know what that means?!

172
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,360
China Uncensored Spring Break Gone Wild!!!!

173
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,260
Xi Jinping, you really missed out today.
