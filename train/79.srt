1
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,799
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we’re playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,720
Joining me today: he reads books, y'know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
“Hello!”

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,880
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,039
♫ I-i-if women like that like men like those,
then why don’t women like me? ♫

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,640
Singing(!)

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,730
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,730
Howdy, YouTube!

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,720
- Oh!
- Nice. Nice.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,180
In front of me I’ve got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can’t see it.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,840
Every fact they get right is
a point and a ding

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,350
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers which is...

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,219
And today we are talking about John Stonehouse.

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,390
Did he live in a greenhouse?

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,420
Completely against type.

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,040
Now's when you ding, Tom(!)

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,940
No. I can’t give you that.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,399
Am I close?

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,399
No...

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,399
In any way?

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,399
No.

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
Was he... a bricklayer?

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,739
Stone House? No. No he wasn’t.

24
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,040
He did go to work in a House, and there’s
a capital H in that.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
A House of something.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Cards.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Fun.

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Ill repute.

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,980
I mean, you’re pretty close with
House of Cards.

30
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
Parliament.

31
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,980
Yes, have a point.

32
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
- Oh!
- Yay.

33
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,870
Born in Southampton, educated there and at
the London School of Economics.

34
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,020
So was he not a politiciser?

35
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,430
And then he went into politics, as the
Labour Cooperative Member of Parliament.

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,940
So he owned some small supermarkets(?)

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,100
Erm, sort of...

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,980
Did you hear that? Clunk-clunk-clunk-clunk!

39
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,920
“Archivist gear engaged.

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,130
“Everybody else shut up, I know the answer.”

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,040
I don’t! But you do still have
Cooperative Labour MPs.

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
In what sense?

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,460
They don’t sit at the back going,
“F*** no.

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,520
“It’s bollocks, we’re not doing it.”.

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,700
Pretty much.

46
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,320
He worked very closely to the
Foreign Office.

47
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,780
There was the Foreign Office, the Home Office,
the India Office and then another one.

48
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,060
Commonwealth.

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,900
Ooh, no…

50
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,660
No, it’s pre-Commonwealth. Empire?

51
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,420
Halfway between the two.

52
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,140
Com-pire.

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,930
Places We Stole Office.

54
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:13,010
Yes, it’s the Colonial Office, so yes, I will
give you the point for that, absolutely right.

55
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,510
Yes, he became Minister for State for Technology
and then took a role…

56
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,800
Was he going around people’s houses trying
to sell cable?

57
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,060
You never had that?

58
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,889
Not from the Colonies Office, no!

59
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:29,159
He moved on from there, this was...

60
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:32,750
You said technology, I don't for...

61
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,110
I know nothing about politics or other countries!
I've got to go somewhere.

62
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,110
I’ve just realised that...

63
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,870
Would you like some Colonial Cable?

64
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,959
I’ve just realised, we’ve not actually
touched on telegraphs yet

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,540
and we have to do that at least once or twice
a seas…

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,700
Oh, f*** off!

67
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,460
Yes, he became Minister for State for Technology,
but that meant he then transitioned into what?

68
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,760
And this was in charge of telecommunications
as well as telegraphy, everything like that.

69
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,950
- Post Office.
- Postmaster General.

70
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,080
You’re both getting the point. He was the
Postmaster General of the United Kingdom.

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,019
Hell of a title, that.

72
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,329
Yes. He was also the last Postmaster General
of the United Kingdom.

73
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,799
Oh God, what did he do?

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,360
Nothing, they’ve just all been
really specific since.

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,160
(Yes!)

76
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,040
Sorry, Matt!

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,900
Specific...

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,860
Oh…

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,919
Anything that has General on the end
sounds great, anyway.

80
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,650
He oversaw the jamming of something.

81
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,370
A marmalade factory.

82
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,859
There’s this sort-of jam war going on where
they just…

83
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,739
He’s holding toast at the other end.

84
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,450
That’s Wallace and Gromit, isn’t it, actually?

85
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,480
We must stop this terrible conflict...

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,540
to preserve life.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Ohhh!

88
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,099
Even the audience was
half-hearted on that one.

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,480
Wouldn’t want people to end up marmalised.

90
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,950
1970, he oversaw the jamming of something.

91
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,950
’70?

92
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,950
1970.

93
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,840
- Is it pirate...
- Pirate radio!

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Yes. I’ll give you the point there,
specifically what, where’s it coming from?

95
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,139
- Luxembourg?
- North Sea?

96
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,720
You’re thinking Radio Luxembourg but no,
you’re absolutely right, it’s off in the North Sea.

97
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,139
This was one of the Radio Carolines.

98
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,380
- Oh!
- Was it?

99
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,160
You see I didn’t say that because
I thought it was a leading question

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,380
and it would be wrong.

101
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,560
Yes, but this isn’t QI! You’re allowed
to go for that answer here.

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,840
Awooga!

103
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,640
So he jammed Radio Caroline and part of the
response to that

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,880
was that Radio Caroline did what?

105
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,900
Jammed them right back.

106
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,190
No, that actually would be... not illegal,
but it certainly would be, I think,

107
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,781
a declaration of war if you do that to a country.

108
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,003
And when it comes to boats we’ve probably
got the bigger shooty ones in town.

109
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,580
We might have slightly more.

110
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,400
Because Caroline was on and off for a bit.
So was it off for a bit?

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,200
It was, they tried to overcome the jamming,
obviously,

112
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,780
what were they sending back over the airwaves?

113
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,010
Swear words. Filthy streams of invective…

114
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,770
They could have done, they were offshore.

115
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,800
Don’t forget Radio Caroline wasn’t illegal,

116
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,590
they just made it so that any British person
associating with it was breaking the law.

117
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,160
“Vote for the other ones.”

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,210
Yes, absolutely right, they went political

119
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,180
and they started broadcasting pro-Conservative
propaganda back at them.

120
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,670
Sorry! Pirate radio station broadcasting
pro-Conservative messages?

121
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,360
Let that sink in for a minute.

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,440
“Vote Tory!”

123
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,780
Yeah, you wouldn’t get that
these days would you? Blimey.

124
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,400
No, there’s no pirate radio stations!

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,020
- There are.
- Oh, there are.

126
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,960
I was going to say, presumably you have deal
with those, Matt.

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes, they interfere over the broadcasts that
we are trying to make at work.

128
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,350
And then we report them to OFCOM and then
they find them

129
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,160
and say no, you’re being naughty, please
don’t do that.

130
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,051
When you said deal with them, that suggested
you somehow

131
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,600
went round at night and dealt with them.

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,730
With a baseball bat.

133
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,780
Matt Gray does have a black ski-mask and an
awful lot of black turtlenecks.

134
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,860
A van just comes out of the OFCOM offices
with you guys in.

135
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,260
John Stonehouse, still in charge of post and
telecommunications in the 1970s, introduced what?

136
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,840
It’s not stamps or anything because they’re
already there...

137
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,580
Oh, it is.

138
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,200
- Is it stamps?
- Second-class...!

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,880
Is it second-class stamps?

140
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,340
Absolutely right, first and second-class stamps.
These all seem…

141
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,380
(You f***er!)

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,520
...fairly normal. In 1970 he was setting up
various companies, having things on the side.

143
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,770
By 1974 most of these were in financial trouble.

144
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,180
What did he decide to do?

145
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,740
Print himself a whole book of stamps
as legal tender

146
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,060
and pay off his debts with
a massive box full of stamps.

147
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,400
That would have been a better plan than the
one he actually had.

148
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,240
Issue a single £150,000 stamp on the quiet
to a collector.

149
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,440
Also a better plan than what he did.

150
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,640
Jesus Christ! Rob a bank.

151
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,600
With stamps.

152
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,380
Hang on, did he invent selfie stamps,

153
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,960
where you could send in a selfie and you’d
have your own stamp?

154
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,220
He didn’t set up his pirate radio station
did he, playing pro-Tory propaganda?

155
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,510
He’s in deep financial trouble here,

156
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,840
he’s doing creative accounting so he’s
going to be going to jail.

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,800
Did he disappear?

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
Oh, a little bit more than that.

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Is he…?

160
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Did he fake his death?

161
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Yes, he did. He faked his…

162
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,620
Is he one of these clothes on the beach guys
and disappears?

163
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,660
Spot on. Exactly right, he faked his death,
November 1974,

164
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,070
leaving a pile of clothes on a Miami beach.

165
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,070
Whose clothes?

166
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,600
His clothes.

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,230
Where was he actually going?

168
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,230
Cuba!

169
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,230
Australia.

170
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,230
That’s a long swim.

171
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,180
You’re one better than me, I was going to
say a long walk

172
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,250
which would have been quite stupid.

173
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,760
Well, swimming it naked,
he’s going to get cold.

174
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,380
He is. Maybe he slathered himself
in goose fat beforehand.

175
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,360
And, hell, he’s going the wrong way round,
he should have gone from LA.

176
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,820
Yeah, the man’s a fool.

177
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,820
Goose fat is what you use,
I’m right aren’t I?

178
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,580
That’s what you use for cross-channel swimming.

179
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,120
Yes, when you’re swimming from Miami to
Australia, that’s what you use.

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Goose fat, yes.

181
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,300
Most people use their arms and legs.
Gary, goose fat.

182
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,150
-“It’ll be fine!”
- Just bobs around...

183
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,430
“Gary, there’s a breaker.”

184
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,910
“It’s fine, the goose fat'll save me!”

185
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,070
Ejecting it from behind,
like propulsive goose fat.

186
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,350
Hey, a goose gives out a lot of fat, you know.

187
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,680
He’s just leaving this greasy trail on the
ocean as he goes.

188
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,480
“Gary Brannan’s greasy ocean trail.”

189
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Hell of a series.

190
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,520
I once did a goose at Christmas
and it put out...

191
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,870
A single goose-- now in all fairness I got
it from a budget supermarket

192
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,070
so it may not have been the very best of geese,
let’s be honest.

193
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,110
Budget supermarkets sell geese?

194
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,110
For a tenner!

195
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,700
Yes, they just get them from the local pond,
and you know…

196
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,330
Ask no questions, tell no lies.
That’s the way I looked at it.

197
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,040
But I did, and it pumped half a litre of fat.

198
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,370
It didn’t even drip out, it literally just
leaked fat.

199
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,720
You know those things when you get oil wells
and there’s a gusher…

200
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,990
“Goose fat, we’re rich! Ah, I'm greasy...”

201
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,470
“Quick take me to the Channel!
This is my only chance!”

202
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,550
“White gold!”, he cried.

203
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,460
Did it deep fry itself? Half a litre?

204
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,620
It just... you put it on an angle to let it
all drain out

205
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
and it just kept coming and coming and coming.

206
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,430
It was a whole big mincemeat jar that big
was nearly full of goose fat.

207
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,600
No man in the world can eat that much 
roast potatoes, is what I’ve found.

208
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,100
Sorry, can I just point out:

209
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,520
mincemeat jar full of goose fat, that’s
quite a northern thing to say…

210
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,100
So yes, Stonehouse, meanwhile. 
Stonehouse was... I’m just trying to pull this back.

211
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,340
It was in my fridge for months!

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,140
I remember, you sent me a picture of it!

213
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,790
You actually sound closer to
tears than laughter, Gary.

214
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,010
Because, just after we’d had this massive
Christmas dinner where I’d done the goose.

215
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,110
I got all this goose fat, the holy grail of
Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes...

216
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,540
Went on a f***ing diet
and I never touched the stuff.

217
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,280
AUDIENCE: Aww.

218
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
And in this jar was…

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,860
John Stonehouse…

220
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,050
Seamless(!)

221
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,060
John Stonehouse was en-route to Australia

222
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,080
setting up a new life with
his mistress and secretary.

223
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Are they two separate people?

224
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,960
Was he just being a real arse and taking his
mistress and his secretary?

225
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,030
Well, who was his new identity?
Whose identity had he taken on?

226
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,300
Did he nick a dead person's?

227
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,870
Yes, he did. Deceased husband of a constituent.

228
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,700
So he deposited cash at one bank, picked it
up at another and the teller was suspicious

229
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,620
and reported him to local police.

230
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,320
The police, when they interviewed him,

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,200
asked him to drop his trousers. Why?

232
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Normal.

233
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,630
Was the person he was pretending to be a eunuch?

234
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,110
No, just his trousers, just his trousers.

235
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,140
Well they’re looking for an identifying mark,
are they not? So tattoo or birthmark.

236
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,820
Yes... neither. This is 1974.

237
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Lord Lucan!

238
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,710
Yes. They suspected that he was Lord Lucan
who had very famously disappeared,

239
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,310
there’s a whole separate story there.

240
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,880
Someone suspiciously turning up
with an English accent in Australia,

241
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,080
depositing large sums of money.

242
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,410
Who is obviously on the run...

243
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,260
Lord Lucan had a large scar down his leg.

244
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,400
So the police were going,
well, drop your trousers,

245
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,779
we want to see if you’re Lord Lucan.
He wasn't...

246
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:42,770
Did he debag himself in aid of the…

247
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,150
Because if he did, and he dropped his trousers
and there’s no scar,

248
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,500
he should surely be let go.

249
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,090
Yes, and then they’re not going to be suspicious
of him ever again.

250
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,580
Yes, he was still arrested, they just knew
he wasn’t Lord Lucan.

251
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Oh.

252
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,840
“We know you’re somebody but we don’t
know who.

253
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,430
“Standard procedure, drop the trousers.”

254
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,920
That was essentially... yeah, that would have
been 1974.

255
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,770
“What do we do second?”
“I don’t know, it’s never failed.”

256
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,780
“Every arse tells a story.”

257
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,240
“All right, we’re going to need
to get your arse print here,

258
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,000
“please just sit in this ink for a little
while, and then on this paper...”

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,820
“Just reverse onto this paper.”

260
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,440
“It’s thumbprint. Thumbprint!”

261
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,930
He’s arrested, six months later he’s deported
to the UK.

262
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,290
He’s remanded in Brixton prison. What has
he not done at any point during this?

263
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,870
Pulled his trousers up.

264
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,050
Walked really waddly all the way.

265
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,140
“They haven’t said I could,” he said.

266
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,380
Changed his name back?

267
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,779
Bear in mind his job.

268
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:45,580
As Postmaster General, ex…

269
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,610
Sorry, what was that?

270
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,860
Postmaster General, ex-Postmaster General.

271
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,690
Was he still in the same job?
Had he not been sacked?

272
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,310
- Yes.
- Oh, s***!

273
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,120
He did not resign as an MP.

274
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Oh, boy!

275
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,040
So did he come back to massive fines for not
having done his job properly?

276
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,120
- No, he was an MP.
- You don’t get fined for not doing your job.

277
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,600
- Oh!
- Satire.

278
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,240
He just kept being an MP and getting his salary.

279
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,080
Were they still paying him throughout the
entire time he buggered off?

280
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,120
Well, at this point,
he had to have his trousers down

281
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,220
because of the sheer size of his balls.

282
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,300
He was put on trial on 21 charges of fraud,
theft, forgery, conspiracy to defraud,

283
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,810
causing a false police investigation
and wasting police time.

284
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,470
He sounds right for an MP.

285
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,600
Trial was 68 days long.
He conducted his own defence.

286
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
That’s brave.

287
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,240
Yeah, it didn’t work all that well.

288
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,230
Did he just drop his trousers when he could?

289
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,170
And say repeatedly, “not Lord Lucan” because
it worked the first time.

290
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,060
After his release he worked as a fundraiser,

291
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,710
joined what became the Liberal Democrats,

292
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,670
wrote some novels, started a small business
that sold hotel safes.

293
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm speeding through all this…

294
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,240
- Hotel safes?
- Hotel safes.

295
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,450
Because he’s used to embezzling money…

296
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,140
They had a funnel that went directly to his
bank account.

297
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,690
“Put money in my safe!” “No, f*** you!”

298
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,010
- “You put money in your safe!”
- “Invest in my company…”

299
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,710
It hasn’t got a back on it!

300
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,200
More than 20 years after his death,
something was revealed about him.

301
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,870
He was Lord Lucan?

302
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,870
He just had a lot of bio-oil.

303
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,210
I thought he was going for the button to say
yes then!

304
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,320
No, no, way, way back in his political career,

305
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,140
he’d negotiated an
agreement of technological cooperation

306
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,390
between Britain and Czechoslovakia, as was.

307
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,710
Uh oh. Is he a spy?

308
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, he's sp-- in fact--

309
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,760
The minute you say 'information sharing' and
'Czechoslovakia' which is in the former Soviet bloc,

310
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,400
he’s not going to just be going and eating
their fine pastries, is he?

311
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,610
Yes, it turned out that he’d been an agent

312
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,960
for the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic
military intelligence.

313
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,830
S***, he’s Postmaster General!

314
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,830
Yes.

315
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,160
That’s why it takes so long for your post
to arrive!

316
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,900
I’m going to give you a point for twigging
that before I made the connection there.

317
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,190
It goes via Czechoslovakia!

318
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,420
He was Minister in Charge of Post and Technology.

319
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,060
And that includes things like the
Post Office Tower and things like that,

320
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,480
that are transmitting signals around the world.

321
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Yes.

322
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,209
This is pretty bad s*** isn’t it, let’s
face it. This is bad news bears.

323
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,520
Somehow the embezzling
and taking someone else’s identity

324
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,240
is yet not the worst thing about this man.

325
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
- No.
- Because he’s used to it!

326
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,740
That’s true, that.

327
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,070
At the point where the government found out
about this,

328
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,510
Margaret Thatcher was in power.
What did she decide to do?

329
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,020
- Nothing?
- Privatise him.

330
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,860
Yes, he will work with more efficiency
as a privately owned scumbag.

331
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,660
British politics jokes there.

332
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,540
Well, either nothing or something, is what
I’m going for there.

333
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,839
Chris, choose one of those options.

334
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,330
I’m going with something.

335
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,900
You’re wrong. It’s nothing.

336
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Oh…

337
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,180
It was easier to cover it up and never let
the public know

338
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,990
that there had been a Czech spy in government.

339
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,940
Because they’d obviously done no Czechs
on him!

340
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,620
Oh…

341
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes.

342
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,140
At the end of the show...

343
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,780
Congratulations, Matt, you win this one.

344
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,790
How?

345
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,310
Genuinely, you got a lot of dings in there.

346
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,250
You win breakfast food prepared by the star
of Sherlock.

347
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,120
It’s Eggs Benedict Cumberbatch.

348
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,140
F***ing...

349
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,540
Do enjoy that.

350
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,990
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel.

351
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,990
It’s over!

352
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,980
To Gary Brannan.

353
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,200
To Matt Gray.

354
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,280
Bye-bye YouTube.

355
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,140
I’ve been Tom Scott,
we’ll see you next time.
