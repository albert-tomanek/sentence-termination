1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,290
A New Pentagon Budget targets China

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,950
An invitation to Xinjiang

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,620
And unprecedented defaults for Chinese businesses

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,640
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,500
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,670
I’m Chris Chappell.

each time we publish a new episode.

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,430
This week’s China news headlines!

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,120
Now you might think that the United States

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,790
already spends a lot on its military.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,890
In 2018,

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,530
it was about 670 billion dollars.

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,770
But, that’s going to change!

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,550
Because in this new budget proposal

19
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,160
from the Pentagon for 2020

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,170
they’re requesting nearly 50 billion more—

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,590
putting it at almost 720 billion dollars.

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,590
To give you an idea,

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,750
that’s more than the next 6 countries’

24
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,280
military budgets combined.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,789
But why spend so much more now?

26
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,350
Well, according to the Acting US Secretary
of Defense,

27
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,509
it’s because of China, China, China.

28
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:09,509
In a prepared testimony

29
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,899
to the Senate Armed Services Committee,

30
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:12,899
Shanahan wrote,

31
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:16,549
“China is aggressively modernizing its military,

32
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,439
systematically stealing science and technology,

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
and seeking military advantage

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,969
through a strategy of military-civil fusion.”

35
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:26,659
The new budget proposal includes money

36
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,930
for a bunch of things,

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,909
like staying ahead of Chinese bombers,

38
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,880
hypersonic weapons, and cyber attacks.

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,189
It also includes about $14 billion

40
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,779
for space based systems and the Space Force.

41
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,810
Because again, China.

42
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,799
What a great time to be alive.

43
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,999
The budget proposal says,

44
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,079
“It is increasingly clear that China and
Russia

45
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,220
want to shape a world

46
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,149
consistent with their authoritarian models—

47
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,639
gaining veto authority over other nations’

48
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,459
economic, diplomatic, and security decisions.”

49
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,770
That’s a concern that the Chairman

50
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,409
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also shares.

51
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,719
“China and Russia have capitalized on

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,169
our distractions and restraints

53
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:09,509
by investing in capabilities specifically
designed

54
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,450
to challenge our traditional sources of strength.”

55
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,390
I just hope the new military budget includes
the weapon

56
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,180
I’ve been calling for since the 90s.

57
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,820
...mega thunderzord, power up!

58
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,400
720 billion dollars sounds like a lot for
the US military.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
Especially since China’s latest military
budget proposal

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,580
is only about 180 billion.

61
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,370
But here’s something the US

62
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,569
doesn’t spend as much money on:

63
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,739
stability maintenance.

64
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,030
That’s the catch-all term for

65
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,120
the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,799
to police its own citizens.

67
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:51,810
And that budget, is 200 billion dollars.

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,470
But, as experts have pointed out,

69
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,020
that stability maintenance budget doesn’t
even include

70
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,720
things like the unofficial detention centers,

71
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,480
black jails, and hired gangs

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,460
often used by local authorities in China.

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,390
So the real amount they’re spending

74
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,310
is definitely more than 200 billion dollars.

75
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,859
Gives you an idea of who the Communist Party

76
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,480
thinks is the biggest threat to its rule.

77
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,480
But sometimes, you just gotta spend the money.

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,010
Rolling students over with tanks isn’t free.

79
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,430
Speaking of stopping citizens

80
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,390
from threatening the Communist Party—

81
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,530
the Uighur people of Xinjiang.

82
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,530
But don’t worry!

83
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,889
I hear they’re extremely happy with the
Party.

84
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,010
Because the Communist Party is fighting Muslim
extremism

85
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,110
with job training camps!

86
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,849
State-run CCTV even interviewed

87
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,510
one of the happy Uighurs in one of those camps.

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,920
“Abudusaimaiti said he felt lucky to be

89
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,920
accepted by the vocational training center.

90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,849
‘One who has been infected by extremism

91
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,939
is not him or herself.

92
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:55,290
They could kill or do even worse things

93
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,849
if his or her thoughts are infected by extremism.

94
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,040
If one's not transformed in time,

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,370
there will be dire consequences.’”

96
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,430
He’s not wrong.

97
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,739
Any Uighur who isn’t transformed faces dire
consequences.

98
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,150
Anyway, there’s all kinds of rumors going
around

99
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,409
that these job training camps are actually

100
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:16,829
more like concentration camps

101
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,880
where they brainwash and torture people.

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,360
But that’s only according the Uighurs who’ve
escaped.

103
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,880
Chinese state run media wants you to know

104
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,000
that there’s a lot of fake news out there
about Xinjiang.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,740
That’s why China is inviting European diplomats
to Xinjiang

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,370
to see for themselves how great things are.

107
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,180
Well, it’s really more of a “sounding
out of interest,”

108
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,690
not an actual invitation.

109
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,009
But I’m sure if the European diplomats do
visit,

110
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,780
they’ll see how completely,

111
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,560
spontaneously happy the Uighurs are.

112
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,280
“If you’re happy and you know it clap
your hands.”

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,750
Unfortunately, we can’t hear the rest of
the song,

114
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,770
but I’m pretty sure the next line is:

115
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,500
“If you’re singing this song for the cameras

116
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,970
so we don’t kidnap your relatives,

117
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,599
stomp your feet.”

118
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,039
Just a guess.

119
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:06,560
Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal is trying
to spread

120
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,389
what I can only assume is more fake news

121
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,530
to slander the glorious Chinese Communist
Party.

122
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,230
They claim that Chinese authorities

123
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,830
are razing muslim communities to the ground.

124
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,879
And all they offer as evidence

125
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,139
is some fairly clear satellite photos

126
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,259
that appear to show large parts of a city

127
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,400
being razed to the ground.

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400


129
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,759
Pff, evidence.

130
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,060
In more news about how well

131
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,520
the Chinese Communist Party is regulating
religion,

132
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang

133
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,580
has said again that the reincarnation of the
Dalai Lama

134
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,810
should follow Chinese law.

135
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,440
That happened after the Dalai Lama said that

136
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,440
he might reincarnate outside of Tibet,

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,639
like, say, in India.

138
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,490
This isn’t the first time the Communist
Party

139
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,660
has taken an interest in reincarnation.

140
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,889
Last time was in 1995,

141
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,050
when they picked the Panchen Lama—

142
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,520
the second-most important figure in Tibetan
Buddhism.

143
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,860
And they did a fantastic job.

144
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,550
State-run Xinhua news paraphrased their Panchen
Lama

145
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,340
as saying he will “resolutely endorse comrade
Xi Jinping

146
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,870
as the core of the Communist Party”

147
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,009
and “endorse socialism with Chinese characteristics.”

148
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,659
I mean, what more could you want in a spiritual
leader—

149
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,680
than endorsing the atheist Communist Party?

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Anyway, the current Dalai Lama is getting
on in age—

151
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,340
meaning, he might have to reincarnate soon.

152
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,790
But don’t worry,

153
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,720
because the next Chinese Dalai Lama

154
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,650
will endorse the Communist Party.

155
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,050
They’ll make sure of it.

156
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,190
Bad news for the Chinese economy.

157
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,120
Companies are defaulting on their debts

158
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,490
at an 'unprecedented' level.

159
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,349
On the show we’ve spoken about how bad

160
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,680
debt within the shadow banking system

161
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,289
has created a huge debt bubble in China.

162
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,669
So authorities are doing what they do best:

163
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,030
Cracking down.

164
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,129
The flip side is,

165
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:00,759
shadow banking is the primary credit provider

166
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,940
for a lot of Chinese companies.

167
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,220
So the crackdown could actually be making
things worse.

168
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,860
You know, maybe the Chinese Communist Party

169
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,970
should give not cracking down a try.

170
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,889
Just something for the suggestion box.

171
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,229
I hear the Party is really open to suggestions.

172
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,729
Please don’t purge me.

173
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,699
Foxconn, the company that makes your iPhones,

174
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,220
may be moving some of its production out of
China.

175
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,970
You see Foxconn is actually a Taiwanese company.

176
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,569
And chairman Terry Gou says he might

177
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:35,180
move some of its work back to Taiwan.

178
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,610
One reason is because the US-China trade war

179
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,600
makes it more expensive to manufacture in
China.

180
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,449
Another reason is, he doesn’t want to be

181
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,540
forced to keep corporate data in China,

182
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,350
under Chinese law.

183
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,800
Although to be fair—

184
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,479
under Chinese law,

185
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,879
Taiwan is just another province of China.

186
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,330
The United States is continuing to put pressure

187
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,250
on Chinese telecom company Huawei.

188
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,889
The US has warned countries around the world

189
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,930
that Huawei is working with the Chinese regime

190
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,159
to undermine national security.

191
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,460
Now, the US is giving that warning to Brazil.

192
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,680
The Chinese regime has been pushing Huawei

193
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,729
and its 5G network to Brazil

194
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,389
and dozens of other countries

195
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,831
as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.

196
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,819
In a meeting this week,

197
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,009
President Trump apparently told Brazil’s
president

198
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:26,199
not to take China’s Huawei,

199
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,440
but to take this soccer jersey instead.

200
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,349
Because the soccer jersey can’t spy on him.

201
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,480
Just to be clear,

202
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,320
Trump did not actually say that.

203
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
It was a joke.

204
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,770
I don’t want to be responsible

205
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,360
for the next Gorilla channel.

206
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
And finally,

207
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,880
there’s a new trend in China:

208
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
People are using social media

209
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,770
to post selfies in Goth makeup.

210
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,130
I mean, why goth?!

211
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,250
Of you’re going to bring back the 90s,

212
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,670
at least bring back something cool.

213
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,500
Like Power Rangers.

214
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,020
...mega thunderzord, power up!

215
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,520
But apparently,

216
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,460
the goth thing is actually a subtle protest.

217
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,720
It comes after a woman

218
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,620
was denied entry to the Guangzhou subway

219
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,760
because of her dark makeup.

220
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,090
So some people starting posting photos

221
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,560
of themselves in goth makeup on Sina Weibo—

222
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,480
the Chinese version of Twitter.

223
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,170
And amazingly,

224
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,850
the “Guangzhou Metro has since apologized
on Weibo

225
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,270
for ‘inappropriately’ handling the matter,

226
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,700
and says it has suspended

227
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,590
the security staffer for retraining.”

228
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,160
Which is surprising considering

229
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,360
how the Chinese regime usually handles subcultures.

230
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,760
I mean, this is a regime that banned Peppa
Pig

231
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,370
for being too gangster.

232
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,520
Apparently a subculture developed

233
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,630
where people were getting Peppa Pig tattoos.

234
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,820
Now I see why the Communist Party

235
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,060
needs to spend so much money on stability
maintenance.

236
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,430
Peppa Pig is a serious threat to social harmony.

237
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,530
And just wait until Chinese people discover

238
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,540
emo music and guyliner.

239
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,540
And before you go,

240
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,110
now is the time I answer a question

241
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,360
from a member of the China Uncensored 50-Cent
Army—

242
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
fans who support the show

243
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,290
with a dollar or more per episode

244
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,090
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

245
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,300
David Schwimmerer asks,

246
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
“How many questions do you actually want
from us?

247
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,840
Is this too many?

248
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,330
What about this?”

249
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,830
Great questions David.

250
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,220
There’s no limit to the number of questions

251
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,730
I want from my loyal 50 cent army!

252
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,750
I hope everyone who contributes to the show
on Patreon

253
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,020
will submit at least one good question.

254
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,500
What’s that, Shelley?

255
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,120
Yes, fine, you can ask Shelley questions,
too.

256
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,900
Or even Matt.

257
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,130
Answering your questions on the show

258
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,810
is a big way we can thank you for your support.

259
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,330
After the first YouTube adpocalypse in 2017,

260
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,770
YouTube began demonetizing a ton of our videos.

261
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,440
But people like you stepped up

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,080
and started supporting the show through Patreon.

263
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
And if you didn’t,

264
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,280
I wouldn’t be here.

265
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,710
I know not everyone

266
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,810
can afford to support China Uncensored,

267
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,920
but I know everyone thanks those of you who
do.

268
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,660
Except the Chinese Communist Party.

269
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,420
The Communist Party is very mad at you.

270
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,700
It would like you to please stop.

271
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,820
Thanks again for all your questions David.

272
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,240
And thank you for watching China Uncensored.

273
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,360
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

274
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
see you next time.
