1
00:00:00,679 --> 00:00:03,719
Chinese troops knock on Afghanistan’s doorstep

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,819
China wants to build a power station in space

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:12,260
And, why are Chinese netizens calling this
woman ugly?

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,200
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,520
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,680

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,869
This week’s China news headlines.

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,450
“Remember, you never saw us here.”

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,760
That’s what this Chinese soldier

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,300
told a Washington Post reporter in Tajikistan.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,770
I’m guessing that soldier has never met
a reporter before.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,770
The soldier was shopping

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,100
in a small bazaar in southeastern Tajikistan,

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,850
near the borders with China and Afghanistan.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,460
It’s about 85 miles from a secret Chinese
military outpost.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,579
I mean, not so secret that you can’t see
it from satellite photos.

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,680
Or in this photo taken by the Washington Post
reporter.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,820
Or from the reports of nearby villagers who
say

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,040
they’ve seen dozens, possibly hundreds,

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,530
of Chinese troops over the past three years.

25
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,530
But other than that,

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,570
nobody knows about

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,130
China’s secret military base in Tajikistan!

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,100
Unless you watch China Uncensored.

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,420
Or read the Washington Post.

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,390
China has invested heavily in Tajikistan

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,490
as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,630
That’s Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s trillion
dollar

33
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,190
global infrastructure investment plan.

34
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,780
Basically, the Chinese regime

35
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,590
gives huge loans to poor countries.

36
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,240
The poor countries then use those loans to
pay

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,720
Chinese state-run companies to come build
stuff for them—

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,770
like roads and shipping ports.

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,170
And if they can’t pay the loans off,

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,210
Chinese officials might write off the debt

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,229
in exchange for some of the country’s

42
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,030
resources and/or infrastructure.

43
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,220
Hmm.

44
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,390
China has built coal plants, hospitals,

45
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,939
schools, roads, railways, and tunnels in Tajikistan.

46
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,549
In fact, “China, through a single state
bank,

47
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:05,159
held more than half of Tajikistan’s external
debt as of 2016,

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,140
up from none in 2006.”

49
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,489
The base in Tajikistan joins a variety of
other

50
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,069
Chinese ports and military installations

51
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,779
throughout the region.

52
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:18,140
Wow, India looks surrounded.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,359
According to the Washington Post,

54
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,830
the Chinese soldiers in Tajikistan

55
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,609
might be technically paramilitary troops.

56
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,909
The Washington Post also says that US officials

57
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,139
are aware of the Chinese base,

58
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,969
but aren’t particularly concerned.

59
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,370
In fact they might feel

60
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,159
it provides greater security to the region.

61
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,060
But either way, this is a big deal.

62
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,559
China is putting troops on the border of Afghanistan

63
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,709
right at a time when the United States

64
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,739
is considering withdrawing troops from the
region.

65
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,569
But I say, let ’em!

66
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,860
The Brits had their turn.

67
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,299
The Soviets had theirs.

68
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,900
We Americans had ours.

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,879
It’s time... to let China fail in Afghanistan,
too.

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,349
It looks like China has added

71
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,499
a new locale to the Belt and Road Initiative:

72
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:01,650
space!

73
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,739
China is now looking at building

74
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,989
a solar power station in orbit.

75
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,400
Of course when I say China,

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,230
I mean the Chinese military,

77
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,959
since that’s who runs China’s space program.

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,969
Construction of an experimental base has already
begun.

79
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,309
And according to China's state-backed

80
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:19,359
Science and Technology Daily,

81
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,859
“Chinese scientists plan to build and launch

82
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,510
small power stations into the stratosphere

83
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,950
between 2021 and 2025.”

84
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,449
Those will then be upgraded into larger,

85
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,920
more powerful stations between 2030 and 2050.

86
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,650
Presumably by which point we’ll finally
get

87
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,379
those flying cars we were promised.

88
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,120
Now a solar power station in space makes a
lot of sense.

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,799
The China Academy of Space Technology claims
that,

90
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,370
by orbiting above most of the atmosphere,

91
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,969
the solar array will be 6 times as efficient.

92
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,359
I assume that’s...once they figure out a
way

93
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,849
to beam all that power back down to Earth.

94
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,639
Plus, then China can claim that the stratosphere

95
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,369
has been Chinese territory since ancient times.

96
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:02,059
This is Ren Zhengfei,

97
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:04,849
the founder of Chinese telecom maker Huawei.

98
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,519
He recently gave an interview with the BBC.

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,249
And he’s not happy with the US.

100
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:13,869
“There’s no way the US can crush us.”

101
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:18,239
That was his response to the global reaction
against Huawei

102
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,680
because of national security concerns.

103
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,040
Following the US’s lead,

104
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,979
a lot of countries are banning Huawei from
government contracts

105
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,070
and from building national 5G networks.

106
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,790
Many intelligence agencies are concerned

107
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,150
that Huawei’s phones and other telecommunications
equipment

108
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,800
could be used to spy on people.

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,669
But in response to that, the Huawei founder
said,

110
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:42,460
“The Chinese government has already clearly
said

111
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,400
that it won't install any backdoors.

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,919
And we won't install backdoors either.”

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,729
Well the word of a Chinese Communist Party
member

114
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,020
is good enough for me.

115
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,360
Incidentally, he also did confirm that Huawei

116
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,180
has a Communist Party committee,

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,009
but you shouldn't worry

118
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:01,159
because all companies in China have one.

119
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,990
I don’t know why the Communist Party

120
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,460
infiltrating every company

121
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,340
should make me *less* worried.

122
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,310
But anyway, you may recall that the US

123
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,730
had asked Canada to arrest his daughter,

124
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,199
current Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.

125
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,729
She’s accused of violating US sanctions
on Iran.

126
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:21,040
But daddy says that’s just nonsense.

127
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,909
“I object to what the US has done.

128
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:27,990
This kind of politically motivated act is
not acceptable.”

129
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,490
Yes, it was politically motivated.

130
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,990
And definitely not because Meng was charged
with

131
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,710
13 specific counts from the State of New York,

132
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,909
including bank fraud,

133
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,210
money laundering,

134
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,060
and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

135
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,360
No, no!

136
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,460
It’s politically motivated!

137
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,219
That mean old Uncle Sam is jealous

138
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,099
of a Chinese company’s success,

139
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,620
and is trying to keep it down.

140
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,050
But you know who really gets it?

141
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,120
Former New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.

142
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,810
She told Chinese state-run media

143
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,719
we need to listen to China.

144
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,410
She praised China’s great progress.

145
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,650
And that Belt and Road Initiative?

146
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,870
That’s “one of the greatest ideas we’ve
ever heard globally”.

147
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,389
Yeah, it’s a way better idea than

148
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,340
the rest of the dumb ideas of the 21st century,

149
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,500
like smart phones.

150
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,659
Or blockchain.

151
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:17,129
Or Netflix.

152
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,129
Needless to say,

153
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,129
the former PM’s article

154
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,231
caused a bit of backlash in New Zealand.

155
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,990
New Zealand is currently reeling under the
revelation

156
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,460
of a widespread campaign of influence

157
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,610
waged by the Chinese Communist Party.

158
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,990
That includes a well placed parliament member

159
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,159
who used to train Chinese spies,

160
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,099
and a well-known New Zealand scholar

161
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,810
whose home was broken into by likely Chinese
agents.

162
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,810
You can see why some folks

163
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,870
might be a bit upset by what Jenny Shipley

164
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,599
wrote for the People’s Daily.

165
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,159
But, in her defense, she said the article—

166
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,159
which has her by-line—

167
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,590
well, she never actually wrote it.

168
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,379
Apparently, People’s Daily just took

169
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,199
a previous interview with her

170
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,279
and turned it into an opinion piece.

171
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,469
So she didn’t write it, but she did say
those things.

172
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:06,710
Sounds like Shipley and the People’s Daily

173
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,110
were made for each other.

174
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,910
Speaking of listening to China,

175
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,499
did you know who the world’s biggest victim
of hacking is,

176
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:15,719
according to Chinese authorities?

177
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:17,229
It’s China.

178
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,509
Which is why China is hitting back against
Australia

179
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:23,860
for claiming China was behind a recent cyber
attack

180
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,029
on Australian political parties.

181
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,599
It’s just like Huawei.

182
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,950
A victim of a western powers.

183
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,900
What’s that Shelley?

184
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,759
Oh, Australia’s cybersecurity chief actually
said

185
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,669
they weren’t sure which country was behind
it?

186
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,790
Ahh, I see.

187
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,840
Australia merely said,

188
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,279
“Some unknown country hacked us,”

189
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,610
and China’s response was,

190
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,050
“Well we didn’t do it!

191
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,289
How dare you accuse us?!

192
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,669
We get hacked all the time.

193
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,669
You’re crazy.”

194
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,120
Well, that sounds like a very normal

195
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,159
and completely not guilty reaction.

196
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,750
Speaking of aboveboard Chinese technology,

197
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,580
a Chinese tech company called SenseNets

198
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,099
apparently left sensitive personal information
of its clients

199
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,300
in an an open database that could be accessed
by anyone.

200
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Now normally,

201
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,330
that’s an unbelievably stupid lapse in data
security.

202
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,029
But in this case,

203
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,900
it turned out to be partly a good thing.

204
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,800
Why?

205
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,569
Well, the people in SenseNets’ database

206
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,789
were actually the Uighur people of Xinjiang.

207
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,849
And the leak showed that the Communist Party

208
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,400
has been keeping very close tabs on them.

209
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,990
The records tracked everything from a person’s
ID number,

210
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,199
birthday, address, ethnicity, employer...

211
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,440
as well as updated GPS coordinates

212
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,510
that could tell if, for instance,

213
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,870
this particular person was visiting a mosque.

214
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,820
As one online security expert put it,

215
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,630
“Who in their right mind runs a database

216
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,620
which is completely open

217
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,899
and gives any visitors full administrative
rights

218
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,579
so then those database records can be manipulated

219
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,010
by anyone with an internet connection?”

220
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,170
No wonder China is the world’s biggest victim
of hacking.

221
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,560
Also, a victim of Neptune, god of the Sea.

222
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,279
Because “a storm in the English Channel

223
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,360
damaged S-400 anti-aircraft missiles

224
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,889
that Russia was shipping to China”

225
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:14,889
Which makes me wonder,

226
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,899
what was a Russian ship doing in the English
Channel?

227
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,779
Anyway, the cargo contained

228
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,370
these kind of S-400 Russian anti-aircraft
missiles.

229
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,650
They’re a Chinese favorite.

230
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,800
In fact, China is under US sanctions

231
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,160
for buying weapons just like this from Russia.

232
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,040
But I wouldn’t want you to worry that

233
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,850
the accident means China won’t have enough

234
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,140
anti-aircraft missiles.

235
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,490
Two other Russian shipments did make it through.

236
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,500
And Russia has said it will replace the damaged
weapons by 2020.

237
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,480
That’s the kind of customer service Russia
has become known for.

238
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,589
And finally, this is 25-year-old Jing Wen,

239
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:55,510
a Chinese model who’s worked for Chanel
and Prada.

240
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,650
And this is a recent ad by Zara featuring
her.

241
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,980
She is a disgusting insult to China.

242
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,389
That’s apparently what Netizens in China
are calling her.

243
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,870
Like, literally, they’re using the hashtag
“insult to China.”

244
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,680
You see in Asia, and particularly China,

245
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,690
they really like white skin.

246
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,380
I’m not being racist!

247
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,670
This is a real thing.

248
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,250
It’s not because they want to look like
caucasians.

249
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,570
It’s because historically whiter skin meant

250
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,290
you weren’t a peasant working out in the
sun all day.

251
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,920
But Zara’s decision to showcase Jing Wen’s
freckles

252
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,080
seems to have really riled up a lot of people.

253
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,509
Or at least a very vocal minority.

254
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,690
One person wrote that showing Jing’s Wen’s
freckles

255
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,880
was imposing Western beauty standards on Asian
women,

256
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,779
and “For those women to be called the most
beautiful in Asia

257
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,550
feels like discrimination to the rest of us.”

258
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,710
Now while this might seem totally bonkers
to you,

259
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,250
it gets weirder.

260
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,519
State-run media actually wrote a reasonable
response,

261
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,079
saying people who were complaining

262
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,300
were being way too sensitive.

263
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,740
“Their [complaints] show over-sensitivity

264
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,290
and a lack of cultural confidence.

265
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,089
It shows they are so afraid of being hurt

266
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,360
that they tend to take a defense gesture

267
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,649
against any move they do not understand.”

268
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,700
Okay hold on,

269
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,750
that’s not just reasonable for Chinese state-run
media.

270
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,070
That’s the most reasonable thing I’ve
ever heard said

271
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,610
in any media in the last couple years.

272
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,759
If only they felt the same way

273
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,750
when a Chinese dissident speaks out.

274
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,769
And before you go,

275
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,211
it’s time when I answer a question

276
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:33,211
from a fan of the show

277
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,211
who supports China Uncensored

278
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,880
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

279
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,209
BlueFox asks,

280
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:40,269
“Chris, with both China and Russia

281
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,829
claiming they have these weapons

282
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,630
like those space lasers.

283
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,040
Do you think that the US

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,830
is taking there claims seriously or not?”

285
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,870
In case you don’t know,

286
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,230
Blue Fox is referring to this recent Pentagon
report.

287
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,899
The report says “China and Russia, in particular,

288
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,430
are developing a variety of means to exploit

289
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,610
perceived US reliance on space-based systems

290
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,760
and challenge the US position in space.”

291
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,970
So it’s more than just lasers.

292
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,569
Is the US taking this seriously?

293
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,550
I’d say it is.

294
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,199
It seems the general consensus is that

295
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,839
the US has fallen behind China and Russia

296
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,980
in terms of space defense.

297
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,040
This is something defense and security agencies

298
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,010
have been saying for a while now.

299
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,610
And it’s one of the main reasons President
Trump

300
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,990
wants to create a Space Force.

301
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,690
Because whether we like it or not,

302
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,180
space warfare is already here.

303
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,930
And yet, still no flying cars!

304
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,920
Thanks for your question, Blue Fox.

305
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,850
So why am I answering questions on the show?

306
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,889
It’s because a lot of advertisers

307
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,150
don’t dare to work with a show

308
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,970
that criticizes the Chinese Communist Party.

309
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,569
So we rely on support from viewers like you

310
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,339
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

311
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,339
Answering your questions on the show

312
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,360
is one of my ways of saying thank you.

313
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,509
So head over to patreon.com/chinaucnensored

314
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:56,569
to find out how you can keep China, uncensored.

315
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,400
Thanks for watching.

316
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,900
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

317
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,000
See you next time.
