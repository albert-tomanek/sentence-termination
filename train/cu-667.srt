00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,250
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,940
Trump punishes Chinese company ZTE—

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,070
and then...he says he wants to help them

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,060
get back in business?!

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,680
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,089
US President Trump has been—

8
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:20,650
and this may shock you—

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,769
a source of controversy.

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:23,859
But in one area,

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,060
even some of his harshest critics have been
supportive.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,960
"One of the few areas where the president
and I agreed—

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,340
and I was vocally supportive of him—

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,730
was his tough approach to China.

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,730
In fact,

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,640
I said at one point that I'm closer

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,170
to President Trump on China

18
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,630
than I was to President Obama or President
Bush.

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,970
And he saw that in the newspaper

20
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,750
and sent me a handwritten note thanking me.”

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,060
Wait...Donald Trump sent Chuck Schumer

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,850
a handwritten note?

23
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,850
See?

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,330
Donald Trump is literate!

25
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,790
How dare the media slander him!

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,610
“You are fake news.”

27
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,120
Anyway, Senator Schumer had praised

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,259
the Trump administration’s move against

29
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:08,700
the Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,210
Last month, the US banned ZTE from buying

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,119
American technology for 7 years.

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,689
It was punishment for ZTE violating the terms
of

33
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,491
a sanctions settlement with the US.

34
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:22,859
You see, ZTE had illegally shipped

35
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,100
equipment with American parts

36
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,219
to North Korea and Iran...283 times.

37
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,619
When they were caught,

38
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,109
ZTE agreed to pay more than a billion dollars
in fines.

39
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:39,619
They also agreed to punish the executives
who were involved.

40
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,310
But the US Commerce Department says that ZTE

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,049
rewarded the executives instead.

42
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,770
Which led to the new ban on ZTE

43
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,950
buying American technology.

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,569
And that’s all but left China’s

45
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,039
second largest telecommunications company

46
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,429
dead in the water.

47
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,399
That’s why it was shock when, a few days
ago,

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,039
Trump tweeted he would work with Xi Jinping

49
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,609
to get ZTE back in business...fast.

50
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,640
Obviously a lot of folks in the US were less
than happy.

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,780
Some even went on to suggest Trump was maybe
possibly bribed.

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,060
And others outright said it.

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,780
That accusation came from reports

54
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,010
that Chinese state-owned company

55
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,780
paid half a billion dollars to an Indonesia
Development firm

56
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,820
that’s building Trump-branded hotels a golf
course.

57
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,460
That doesn’t look good.

58
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,500
But it turns out, that’s probably not what’s
going on.

59
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,030
The Indonesia deal was signed before Trump
got elected,

60
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,250
and...according to the main company involved,

61
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,980
they haven’t actually signed

62
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,940
the $500 million loan deal with China.

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,040
So Trump is not getting a Chinese bribe

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,000
for helping ZTE.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Of course...maybe Trump will still get

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,530
free tickets to the Indonesian resort,

67
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,129
“An immersive world of magic and adventure”

68
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,450
that features, “a variety of thrill rides
and adventures

69
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,210
interwoven with original stories and themes

70
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,840
from Indonesia’s rich cultural heritage.”

71
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,220
Although as president,

72
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,220
he should get that anyway if he wants, right?

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,980
Probably Trump saying he’ll help ZTE

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,470
has more to do with using it as a negotiating
tool

75
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,250
in trade talks with Xi Jinping.

76
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,790
Some critics of China,

77
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,640
like US Senator Marco Rubio,

78
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,070
don’t think that’s a good idea

79
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,170
because of espionage concerns.

80
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,840
But only time will tell whether it’s the
right move.

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
Or frankly, whether Trump will actually

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,960
do anything to help ZTE at all.

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
So what do you think?

84
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,490
Leave your comments below.

85
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,530
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored,

86
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,070
once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

87
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,480
see you next time.

88
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,420
Time for another question from a Patreon supporter!

89
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,780
Jake B asks:

90
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,520
“Have you guys ever received a physical
or financial threat

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,870
over a specific video or the channel directly?”

92
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,740
We’ve had two minor death threats.

93
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,980
That Matt only told me about much, much later.

94
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,280
But the main threat to China Uncensored is
financial.

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
It’s hard to find advertisers,

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,640
because they’re afraid of the Communist
Party retaliating.

97
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,200
We’re still working on it, but it’s really
hard.

98
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,090
And that’s why we rely mainly on support

99
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,340
from viewers like you, Jake!

100
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,960
