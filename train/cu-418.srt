1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,600
Canada has a secret deep state

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,360
With close ties to China

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,280
And it explains how the Chinese military

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Nearly found its way into Canada

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,000
Canada. America’s friendly neighbors to the north.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800
...panda hugging neighbors to the north!

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,440
But like a panda, the soft cuddly exterior\h
hides razor sharp claws and teeth.\h

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
Canada was planning on inviting the Chinese\h
military over for cold-weather training drills.\h\h

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,000
But those drills were canceled\h
after the US freaked out.\h

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
Why would the Candaian government\h
think it was a good idea to invite\h\h

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
troops from a hostile Communist Dictatorship?

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,160
To find out, I interviewed Cleo Paskal from\h\h

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,080
Chatham House & Foundation\h
for Defense of Democracies.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,440
Cleo, thanks for joining me today.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,560
Pleasure. Really happy to have this opportunity\h
to talk about Canada. Usually people never ask.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
We care about the Canadians here on China\h\h

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
Uncensored. Well, okay. So the\h
first big question is, in what\h\h

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,520
universe was it decided that the Chinese and\h
Canadian military should be working together?

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:29,360
Okay. Canada's a funny country. We are not\h
probably what you think we are. We are much\h\h

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
bigger than you think we are. We're the second\h
largest land mass on the planet. We're part of\h\h

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:44,400
NATO. We're a G7 country. We are a real country,\h
a real big, serious country, but we have a lot\h\h

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,800
of different approaches internationally\h
that sometimes come out in this sort of\h\h

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,880
decision-making. And one of the things that's\h
been going on for a very long time in Canada\h\h

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:03,040
is a deep political and economic linkage\h
to China. This didn't come out of the blue.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,720
This was a tip of an iceberg that goes\h
back to the 1880s when Canada was sending\h\h

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,480
missionaries to China and those missionaries,\h
long story short, had kids in China.\h\h

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,080
White, Canadian kids who grew up in China, learned\h
Chinese, became very attached to the culture,\h\h

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,240
came back to Canada. Then some of them went\h
back and got involved in China during the\h\h

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,360
'40s, '30s and '40s. And when they came back to\h
Ottawa, after that, this group who were known\h\h

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,120
as the mish kids, the missionary kids, got into\h
the Canadian Foreign Service because they had\h\h

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,320
language skills and had traveled, and many were\h
quite idealistic about what was going on in China\h\h

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,440
and pushed from within the\h
system for a very long time,\h\h

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,800
for recognition of China, as opposed to Taiwan.

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,480
This is a very condensed version of that, but\h
there was within the Canadian Foreign Service,\h\h

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,560
there was this group of people who were very\h
sympathetic to Communist China. And when Canada\h\h

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,600
recognized China in 1970, it was one of the first\h
Western countries to recognize China, among the\h\h

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,720
grouping of ambassadors that Canada sent to China,\h
four of them were these former missionary kids.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,760
Well, just a quick question about that.

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,480
Yeah, sure. Go.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,320
If the missionaries went during the Qing\h
Dynasty, there was the Qing Dynasty,\h\h

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,200
then the Republican period, and then the Communist\h
Party, they didn't see any difference between\h\h

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,720
the China that they may have grown up in and\h
what the Chinese Communist Party was doing?

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,320
It's a really complicated, tricky question\h
that gets into psychology. So, first of all,\h\h

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,880
as missionary kids, they were among the\h
people and were very sympathetic to the\h\h

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,280
Chinese people. And a lot of them, one of them,\h
James Endicott, he didn't become an ambassador,\h\h

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,280
but became very influential later on, worked\h
initially very closely with Chiang Kai-shek and\h\h

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,320
was feeding information to the OSS. And was part\h
of that grouping. And he didn't like what he saw\h\h

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,200
that group doing in China. He thought they\h
were starving their own troops, and he thought\h\h

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:29,920
they were baskering people. It was a complicated\h
period and the Chinese, in particular, Zhou Enlai,\h\h

51
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,120
who he became quite close with, were very good at\h
presenting their case. They knew how to talk to\h\h

52
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,520
that sort of a person. And so very effectively\h
co-opted him and others into their cause.

53
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,760
Now, after they came to power in 49, of course,\h
they got rid of a lot of them. They kicked a lot\h\h

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,080
of them out of the country. But by that\h
time, I think Endicott left maybe in 48,\h\h

55
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,520
because there was a Chiang Kai-shek hit squat out\h
for him. So he comes back to Canada and he starts\h\h

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,520
up a newspaper magazine, which is basically\h
CCP propaganda. So from very early on these\h\h

57
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,840
mish kids who had been considered China experts\h
by the intelligence community at the time,\h\h

58
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,680
were embedded in the system, but also became\h
sympathetic to Communist China. And they\h\h

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,680
persisted. They persisted in the system for a very\h
long time. There are other elements to it, but if\h\h

60
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,440
you have any other questions about that, it's an\h
interesting topic, happy to ramble on about it.

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
I'd be happy to talk more about that on the\h
podcast we're going to do with you on China\h\h

62
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,640
Unscripted. But for now, I think you've\h
provided some interesting context to why\h\h

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,309
some in the Canadian government\h
might think military.

64
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:43,120
That's the only part of it. Just\h
wait, just wait. It gets better. Okay.\h\h

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,200
So that's just one bizarre element\h
of Canadian CCP linkages, but\h\h

66
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,560
a whole other part of it is at the same time, you\h
have people within the Canadian community who are\h\h

67
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:07,200
buying into the whole anti-Americanism, especially\h
with the beginning of the Vietnam War, who also\h\h

68
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,440
get brought into that whole, Canada's a great\h
country, and we're going to go save the world,\h\h

69
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,320
the new missionary type thing. Pierre Trudeau, who\h
was Prime Minister of Canada for a very long time,\h\h

70
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,800
he became Prime Minister, I think in 68. And\h
he was more or less Prime Minister till 84.

71
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,440
And he was really instrumental in\h
recognizing China. He visited China in 1949.\h\h

72
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:39,280
On his communist tour of the world. He visited in\h
1960 as a labor lawyer. And then when he came back\h\h

73
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,840
and became prime minister, he had\h
this ready coterie of mish kids in\h\h

74
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,120
the civil service. And he himself was\h
this other grouping of international\h\h

75
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,280
lefties who was sympathetic to the\h
cause. And so they came together-

76
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
This was Justin Trudeau's father?

77
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
Are you ready for the third strain?

78
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay.

79
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,080
The third strain is business.

80
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,840
Of course.

81
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,840
Yeah. The third strain involves\h
initially this incredible company\h\h

82
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,240
based out of Quebec called Power Corp, Power\h
Corporation, not a evil empire name at all.\h\h

83
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,200
And they are a massive multi-billion dollar\h
company that does everything. Does a lot\h\h

84
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,600
of money management, does media. It\h
does resources, all sorts of stuff-

85
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,120
Standard mum and pop company.

86
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:35,120
And that's run by... Well, it is. Because\h
it's a family company and the family is the\h\h

87
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,640
Desmarais family who are incredibly powerful. The\h
Desmarais family have had four people who became\h\h

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,920
prime ministers or were prime ministers of Canada,\h
have had some sort of affiliation with Power Corp.\h\h

89
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,640
And when Power Corp saw the opportunities\h
in China, as Trudeau was prime minister,\h\h

90
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:02,400
was opening up China, Trudeau came together\h
with the Compliance Canadian Administration\h\h

91
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:11,520
and Power Corp, and they started the Canada China\h
Business Council around 1977, 1978, very early.\h\h

92
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,480
And on the board was CITIC, which is\h
a Chinese government linked company,\h\h

93
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,040
very important company. And on the Canadian\h
side, there were a few, but there was Power Corp,\h\h

94
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,240
there was Bombardier, there was SNC Lavalin.\h
These are three massive Montreal-based companies.\h\h

95
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,680
And the Desmarais Power Corp facilitated CITIC's\h
first major overseas investment out of China,\h\h

96
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,840
which was into Canada through Power Corp. What\h
you're seeing with these military exercises\h\h

97
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,680
is a very small tip of a massive iceberg that's\h
been moving in this direction for 120 years.

98
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:00,320
And so that's why, even though the documents\h
that came out point to decisions made by the\h\h

99
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
Trudeau government, it actually began back in\h
2013 under the Conservative Stephen Harper,\h\h

100
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,200
Prime Minister. So this is not just one party\h
or the other in Canada. This is systemic.

101
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
It partially is. But another thing to understand\h\h

102
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
when you're thinking about Canada is, you have\h
to think about our foreign policy in the context\h\h

103
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,560
of U.S. Foreign Policy. So what was going on\h
towards China in the U.S. at the same time,\h\h

104
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:35,120
Scarborough Shoal was around that time. It wasn't\h
as if countries were standing up to China in any\h\h

105
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,360
conceivable way. The initial deal was under the\h
Harper government and it was through a mill-mill\h\h

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,960
cooperation arrangement, but Harper\h
since has become very vocal about China.\h\h

107
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,560
And the current leader, we have the party in\h
power now is the Liberal Party and our Prime\h\h

108
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,520
Minister's Justin Trudeau, who's the son of Pierre\h
Trudeau who went to China in '49, '60, '73, and\h\h

109
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,320
soon after Tiananmen Square, he took his two sons,\h
including Justin on a nice little visit to China.

110
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Lovely.

111
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,720
So Harper's kind of switched, but the head of\h
the opposition, which is the Conservative Party,\h\h

112
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,880
Erin O'Toole, who's former Canadian military,\h
is much more direct about standing up to China.\h\h

113
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,560
So yes, it's embedded in the system. Yes, prime\h
ministers for both parties have been involved,\h\h

114
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,440
but currently at this moment, the Conservatives\h
are much more clear about standing up to China.

115
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,240
So the documents about the China Canadian\h
military cooperation have suspiciously little\h\h

116
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,720
redacting, meaning things weren't properly\h
blacked out. Why do you think that was?

117
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,600
It gives me hope actually. If you haven't seen\h
the documents, I suggest you go see them there.\h\h

118
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,040
You can see them at thechinafile.com\h
and full credit to Canadian journalist,\h\h

119
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,080
Ezra Levant from Rebel News for getting them and\h
then releasing them so we could all see them.\h\h

120
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:07,840
They're about 37 pages and they're really poorly\h
redacted to the point where it almost looks like\h\h

121
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:15,840
the important bits are being highlighted. There\h
are a lot of very good people in the system,\h\h

122
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,920
who've been trying to get the story out about\h
China being a security problem for Canada for\h\h

123
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,560
a long time, we had the Sidewinder Report\h
was leaked in the late '90s, the Canadian\h\h

124
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,080
Security Intelligence Service put out a report\h
a couple of years ago saying this is a problem.

125
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,720
Richard Fadden, who's former head of CSIS,\h
publicly talks about this all the time.\h\h

126
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,640
Charles Burton, who's an incredible academic and\h
former diplomat talks about it. They're a big\h\h

127
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,680
group of people within Canada who are very, very\h
worried about this and breaking through is hard.\h\h

128
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,000
So having international coverage of what's\h
going on in Canada is really helpful. The\h\h

129
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,440
fact that these China files are being covered\h
by you, makes it more of an issue for Canada,\h\h

130
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,760
which helps the politicians and the\h
diplomats who are trying to maybe say,\h\h

131
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
"Look, maybe this isn't such a great idea."

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,960
Well, speaking of Canadian politicians, I\h
know Canada's Foreign Affairs Ministry begged\h\h

133
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,640
for the training drills to continue\h
because it would negatively affect\h\h

134
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,160
bilateral ties. And so I got to ask, the\h
kidnapping of two Canadian citizens by China,\h\h

135
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,920
Michael Kovrig, and Michael Spavor,\h
that doesn't affect bilateral ties?

136
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,600
Thank you very much for mentioning them. The\h
background to that is Canada responded to an\h\h

137
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,640
extradition treaty request from the U.S. for\h
Ms. Meng, who's the daughter of the Huawei\h\h

138
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,480
founder and herself is the CEO at Huawei.\h
And we detained her two years ago. And within\h\h

139
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:57,040
a couple of weeks, China retaliated by taking\h
two Canadians and they're being held largely\h\h

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,240
incommunicado in detention in China to this day.\h
And you would think that would be a big deal. And\h\h

141
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,640
some of the Canadian press like The Globe and Mail\h
keep a count of how many days they've been held.\h\h

142
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,440
There's a Christmas card lobby going on now\h
where we're being asked to send Christmas\h\h

143
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,200
cards to the Chinese embassies and consulates\h
to forward to them, just so that the Chinese\h\h

144
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,000
know that people care. And yes, you would think\h
it would affect our engagement with China, but\h\h

145
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:38,240
it's so deep and so extensive, as a momentum,\h
as an ideology within some of the, I'd say,\h\h

146
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,400
small groups of decision-making,\h
that it's very hard to break through.

147
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,880
Now, in those documents, the Deputy\h
Minister, who's pushing to say,\h\h

148
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,120
"We don't want, don't break off relations with\h
China. If you're going to cancel anything,\h\h

149
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,400
you need to get it cleared by us." He's\h
now Clerk of the Privy Council, which is\h\h

150
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,320
Canada's top civil servant. We have these peculiar\h
names for stuff, still. This is somebody who is\h\h

151
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:20,240
deep, deep, deep in the civil service. And the\h
idea is they've been bought into this, don't upset\h\h

152
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,200
China, psychology. And if you think about it,\h
how often do you hear China criticizing Canada.\h\h

153
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,360
They'll criticize Australia, they'll criticize\h
even New Zealand, sometimes definitely the\h\h

154
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,160
U.S. but we are the Five Eyes partner that rarely\h
gets any blow back in China [inaudible 00:15:45].\h\h

155
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:49,360
So that gives you an indication that we are\h
successfully not a problem, whatever that entails.

156
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,200
Until, they kidnapped two Canadian\h
citizens when there's a little-

157
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:01,760
But even, what are we doing? What came out in\h
those documents was not long after, within a\h\h

158
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,320
year after they'd kidnapped them, we continued\h
the exchanges. The military to its credit is\h\h

159
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,080
the one that canceled the winter training and\h
they canceled it without approval from Global\h\h

160
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,440
Affairs Canada, which is our Ministry of Foreign\h
Affairs, which is what the exchange is about.\h\h

161
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,960
Global Affairs Canada went nuts. They said, "How\h
can you, the military, cancel it without checking\h\h

162
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,560
with us. This is going to affect our relationship\h
with China." But also in the documents,\h\h

163
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,520
there's a list of continuing exchanges,\h
after the two Michaels were taken, including\h\h

164
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
Minister McKenna, who's our Environment Minister\h
going to China to talk about climate change.\h\h

165
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:44,400
We, as a federal government, haven't\h
really, I think, understood China.\h\h

166
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,640
This isn't how you're going to get back\h
the two Michaels. Anyway, regardless-

167
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:48,880
Clearly.

168
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah.

169
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,840
Sorry. So what is the Chinese Communist\h
Party's ultimate goal in Canada?

170
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,000
We've talked about Conference of National Power\h
before, and Canada has a lot to offer to China.\h\h

171
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,240
It's highly strategically located, especially\h
since China is apparently a near Arctic power.\h\h

172
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:20,080
It has tons of resources. It's right next\h
to the U.S. We are a Five Eyes partner. We\h\h

173
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,480
have very good high tech. We had a company\h
called Nortel, which was doing cutting edge\h\h

174
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:35,040
research in a whole bunch of areas that was hacked\h
by almost certainly Chinese-based hackers. And\h\h

175
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,920
coincidentally Huawei built up a lot of its tech\h
profile, not long afterwards with very similar\h\h

176
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:49,840
sorts of stuff. We had escorted Chinese scientists\h
out of a level 4 bio lab in Winnipeg last summer,\h\h

177
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,320
not this summer, but the summer before,\h
like we have tons, whatever China wants,\h\h

178
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,840
they can probably find a\h
little bit of it in Canada.

179
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
Are they going after the poutine?

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,840
I think they have some standards.

181
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,760
I beg your pardon. I like poutine.

182
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,280
But I can tell you, currently, everything you'd\h
find anywhere else in the world, you'll find\h\h

183
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,600
in Canada in terms of China. Currently they're\h
trying to buy a gold mine in Nunavut up in the far\h\h

184
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,080
North that is not economically viable, but it does\h
happen to have a port on the Northwest passage.\h\h

185
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:35,440
And it's a hundred miles away from the NORAD base.\h
It's all the stuff you'd expect. Every single box\h\h

186
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,200
that they can check from any single country, if\h
Canada has it, that's obviously what they want.\h\h

187
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,680
And they want us also to keep quiet about Hong\h
Kong. There are 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong,\h\h

188
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,280
passport holding Canadians in Hong Kong,\h
and they don't want Canada to become, a\h\h

189
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,720
Hong Kong government, next... And we've got\h
massive crime coming in through Vancouver.\h\h

190
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,280
And we have wheat and we have gold. If we\h
open up the mines where Earth's [inaudible\h\h

191
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,040
00:19:26], we're like the Walmart of countries.

192
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,080
Canada's where it's at.

193
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,040
Yeah.

194
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
Are the Canadian people aware of this\h
relationship, what's going on? What's at risk?

195
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:31,440
China's popularity numbers in Canada are very low.\h
They're single digit. There's an enormous amount\h\h

196
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,960
of anger. And as always, you have to say, to be\h
clear, because it's accurate, this is Chinese\h\h

197
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,880
Communist Party. This is directed at China as a\h
country, not Chinese Canadians. Chinese Canadians\h\h

198
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:53,280
built the railroad, put up with the head tax,\h
we had a very discriminatory immigration policy,\h\h

199
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:01,200
but they are a very important part of Canada. And\h
it's clear. Within the population, it's not about\h\h

200
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
the guy you went to school with, it's\h
about the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

201
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
And those numbers are high, but by and large,\h\h

202
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,720
Canadians don't care that much about foreign\h
policy. It's not a big topic in the media.

203
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,840
And if it is, then it's about the U.S.\h
And if it's about the U.S., often,\h\h

204
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,400
especially over the last four years, the media,\h
which it tends to be center, center, left,\h\h

205
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:40,880
like U.S. has been counter of the U.S. And\h
China's been very good at playing that card,\h\h

206
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,480
trying to create divisions\h
between the U.S. and Canada,\h\h

207
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
reaching out to disaffected groups within\h
Canada. There was a very weird thing going on\h\h

208
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,340
in the '70s where Black Panthers were coming up to\h
Montreal for acupuncture training. Yeah, exactly.

209
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:48,560
We're going to have to talk about\h
that more on the podcast, I think.

210
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Yeah. China has been in Canada affecting some of\h
the perceptions of China for a very long time,\h\h

211
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,560
as you saw with the James Endicott story, but\h
by and large now, Canadians are not huge fans\h\h

212
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,800
of the Chinese Communist Party. This military\h
cooperation thing was not popular at all, but\h\h

213
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:16,400
it's not a major political issue at the moment.\h
So it's hard to get it to sway decision-making.

214
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,440
So what can be done to counter the influence\h
of the Chinese Communist Party in Canada?

215
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
As ever, I think you need\h
more information out there,\h\h

216
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,680
more coverage, more understanding. Again, there is\h
some very good media within Canada. Canadian Media\h\h

217
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,640
is the one that broke the story. The Epoch\h
Times is available in French in Quebec now.\h\h

218
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,360
We're getting interesting kinds of coverage,\h
but I think it takes specific events. And we\h\h

219
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,720
are very sensitive often to our allies, our\h
Five Eyes allies. So in the documents, again,\h\h

220
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,840
there was a big question from Global Affairs\h
Canada, about whether we were canceling the winter\h\h

221
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,160
training, because the U.S. is putting pressure\h
on us, or was it one of the other Five Eyes?\h\h

222
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,320
Was Australia upset about this? Or was it just\h
the U.S. And if it's Australia, oddly enough,\h\h

223
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,640
that actually can have more influence than the\h
Americans, because we're used to the Americans\h\h

224
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,880
complaining. If the Australians continue to stand\h
their ground, it becomes very helpful for Canada.

225
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,720
Well, great. Thank you for sharing all that\h
with me. I didn't realize how deep it went.

226
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,800
It's pretty bad. Yeah.

227
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,560
Well, yes. Thanks again for joining us.

228
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
Thank you for having me. And as long as the\h
poutine is safe, then I think we're okay.

229
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,760
Definitely.

230
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,880
I strangely feel the urge to order some Poutine.\h\h

231
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,520
If you’d like to hear more from Cleo,\h
check out our interview with her on the\h\h

232
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,960
China Unscripted Podcast, where we go into way\h
more detail. That’ll be out later this week.

233
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,840
Thanks for watching, once again I’m\h
Chris Chappell. See you next time.
