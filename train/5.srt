00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,440
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,560
Joining me today, he reads books you know,
it's Chris Joel.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,180
[MUFFLED BY COFFEE] Hello.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,020
Drinking coffee. I timed that really...

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,400
Prioritise, prioritise baby.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,760
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,540
And so the man says to the lady, "I'll have another go, but I don't know if I can fit another bread roll up my ass!"

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,560
Now, now the question is, 
I know Gary was planning to prep lines for this series.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,840
And the bounciest man on the Internet, Matt Gray

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,720
Series five. Welcome!

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,340
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,360
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING].

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,060
And there's a special prize for a particularly good answers, which is ♫[MYSTERY BISCUITS]♫

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,120
If you've never watched this before, 
you're in for a treat.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,020
Every season we get new people. You... oh my God, the s*** you are about to endure. Let's face it.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Today we are talking about the hydraulic telegraph.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,420
Holy moly! That's a wet telegram.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,180
I, erm, well I'll give you a point.
There is water involved.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,680
Well yes, there is f***ing water involved!

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,120
IT'S HYDRAULIC!

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,520
I'm a moron, I know nothing about science.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,680
It's all pissing witchcraft, even I know that bit!

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,220
And you are still getting a point for it. [DING]

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,980
Well I won't moan too much then.

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,200
"Stand in front of the
nozzle to receive your message."

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,780
On that point...

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,740
"Aunt Mildred says hello, but I don't 
want to tell you what she's been up to."

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,040
On that point yesterday, I genuinely, 
this is a genuine story.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,900
I saw a coach company called Morse Coaches. Right?

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,300
That's good.

31
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,420
It was reversing, but I couldn't understand why the beeping noise was just saying 'S' repeatedly.

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,980
It was probably just saying 'eeeeee'!

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,120
The thing is, we all pedanted 
your Morse code there, in different ways.

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,980
He's like, "that's E". 
I'm like, "no that's T, that's a long one".

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,480
Surely it could say "Warning! This vehicle is reversing!" in Morse, is what I was what I was thinking.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,180
People wouldn't move out of the way. 
They would be too busy trying to read it.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,840
W... A... R... N... [THUD]

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,100
You committed to that hit there.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,460
I did. I did, I did, I did, yeah.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,400
It wasn't Morse code.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,620
Not any version of it.

42
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,780
Flags!

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,140
Little tin flags or something. 
Metal flags that would pop up.

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,220
So it spells out the message.

45
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,200
You're thinking of the optical telegraph.

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,860
I'm thinking of an optical telegraph powered by water, thank you very much.

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,840
Ooh! I'm going to give you a point for that. [DING]

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,820
- Ooh!
 - Fountains?

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,400
No.

50
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,700
No. How would you...
There are flags and there is water.

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,800
And this is...
First of all, let me clue you in.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
And there are shoes!
And there are boxes.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,120
And there are houses...
And there are doors.

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,880
And orang-utans.

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
There are also oranges.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,820
Today we have the handle on nouns.

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,320
- There are two versions of this...
- Hello children.

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,380
Welcome along.

59
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,580
Today we are learning about things.

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
Today we are learning about flags.

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,800
And there is water.

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,060
And shoes.

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
And there are antelope.

64
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Goodbye.
We'll see you next week.

65
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,480
Goodbye.

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,500
I don't think we can really explain what Tom is though, without adjectives.

67
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,280
Are you done(?)

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,620
Probably not,
but you know, have another go.

69
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,220
That's the most exasperated look you've ever done.

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,060
"Are you done, children(?)"

71
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,380
Anyway.

72
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,000
Is it some kind of coastal system for getting 
messages out into the water, by sending...

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,160
different pressures to pop up things, 
that would spell out a message?

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,220
Yeah, I'll give you the point there [DING].

75
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,100
- I'll definitely give you the point. 
  - So it's Pop Up Pirate, but telegraph?

76
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,060
Sounds like it, yeah.

77
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,040
When do you think this was?

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,760
19th century. Everything was iron and hydraulic then.

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,000
- Right.
- Ooh, steady.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,020
This is not the version we are talking about. There is a 19th century version. Again, I'll give you a point [DING].

81
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,660
But, I'm going to come to that later.

82
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,500
Is this the mid 90s version in Eureka, in Halifax?

83
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,260
Ooh!

84
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,480
I mean...

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,780
Northern reference.

86
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,220
I get... I went there.

87
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,840
Specific northern reference.

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,100
- We all went.
- We all went as kids, to Eureka

89
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,160
It's still there as far as I know.

90
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,540
- It is still there.
- But I didn't know they had a hydraulic telegraph?

91
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,780
Neither do I, but if there was 
somewhere that would have one.

92
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,320
They had a massive Archimedes screw on the ceiling.

93
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Lucky Archimedes.

94
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,480
Wait! We are talking about Archimedes, 
we are pretty much in the right area.

95
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,600
Ah! So Greco-Roman

96
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,160
Yeah! Fourth century BC Greece.

97
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,780
Yeah! [DING] Point.

98
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,240
I'm trying to imagine a fourth century Greece.
I'm just trying to put Greased Lightning into Latin,

99
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,620
and I'm failing badly, at the minute.

100
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,480
Well if you can't none of us have got a chance.

101
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,020
Hang on, hang on. He's studied Latin.

102
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,000
Classical education.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,040
It's been more than a decade since 
I got my GCSE in Latin now.

104
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,980
Can you manage, "I've got chills, they're multiplying"?

105
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,100
Probably not.

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,700
- Habeat...
- Yes.

107
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,440
Chillea..?

108
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,480
Er.

109
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,020
- Frig... frig...
- Expandero!

110
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,240
Habeat frigits... frigidare-something.

111
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,140
Et saeu... erm, multiplicanus. Or something like that.

112
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,480
Multiplicanus est. Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,840
Corrections in the comments, 
for all of you YouTube watchers who know Latin.

114
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,200
So. Ancient Greece

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Yes.

116
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,740
There are two signal towers, on two hills. 
With two identical tubs of water.

117
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,480
How do they get them to 
both show the same message?

118
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,180
Inscriptions on the side of the tub of water.
How do they get them to synchronise?

119
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,820
Gentle and well timed piddling?

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
Oh, I'm so tempted to give you a point.

121
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
Gentle and well timed horse piddling.

122
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,040
No, they're not putting water in.

123
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,620
Gentle Piddling is a village isn't it?

124
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,060
It's in the Cotswolds.

125
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,440
You're thinking of
Much-Piddling-on-the-Wold, there.

126
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,040
They let some out? They let some water 
out with a tap or something like that.

127
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,900
Yes, a spigot.

128
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
[DING] Ooh! What else!

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,800
And did they have a tube from the bottom of one, 
to the bottom of the other? So it auto levelled.

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,040
No. That's the British system that comes later.
So I'll give you a point [DING].

131
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,300
But, that's not how they synchronised
between two far away hills.

132
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,240
Men yelling?

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,160
Mobile phones?

134
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,480
No, it can't be something else, 
because the water is the communication method.

135
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,340
Or is that storing the message?

136
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,360
Hang on, we never actually established that 
this water is any method of communication.

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,680
At the minute we just have two towers 
that let some water out occasionally.

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,760
Yeah, and there's things inscribed on little bowls.

139
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
- OK.
- Where the water comes out.

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,660
So how do you get both sides to time when they're 
taking the plug out and putting it back in again?

141
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,440
Lights?

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,140
Mmm, fourth century BC?

143
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,280
Candles?

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
I mean it's a big candle.

145
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,080
Fire! Bonfire!

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,000
There we go. [DING]

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,520
- 'Cos that's the way they used to communicate anyway.
- Big candle.

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,480
Big candle! Bonfire.

149
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
"Big candle!"

150
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,520
Why the water? They lit fires anyway.

151
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,220
Because a bonfire can only send one signal.

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
"I'm on fire!"

153
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,180
"By, it's warm out t'day!"

154
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,660
It can send two signals.

155
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,120
"I'm not on fire."

156
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,280
- That's true.
- On and off.

157
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,260
Yeah, well that's how they did it. [DING]

158
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,240
Binary.

159
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,760
Unplug. Off. Put it back in. What's the message? 
You both read down your bowls.

160
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,480
Bowl says "I'm on fire!"

161
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,900
Must be a big bowl.

162
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,400
They said an earthenware bowl. 
The depth being some three cubits.

163
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
What the hell is a cubit?

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,660
-- It's about there...
-- There to there, innit?

165
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,020
Oh! Yes, absolutely. Have a point. [DING] I was going to look up 'cubit definition' there, but that's roughly right.

166
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,340
- Has he got two dancing cubits?
- Those are my cubits, baby!

167
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,140
Oh God!

168
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,880
So yeah, about... yea big. and presumably draining quite slowly so they can synchronise...

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,280
"Please send chips", or whatever... 
the Greek equivalent of that is.

170
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,380
Pita!

171
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,200
Yeah.

172
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,780
Half way down, one of them is 
just that laughing and crying emoji.

173
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,780
Drama!

174
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,120
"LOL."

175
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,140
Smiling poo.

176
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,100
It's halfway between ROFL and LOL. 
I don't know where we stand on this?

177
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,800
ROL.

178
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,080
He's sitting on the floor, rocking back and forth a bit.

179
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,660
No, its not that, it's like anything where you use LOL

180
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,880
You see it reach LOL on the watermark, 
 you look over, he's just sat there, doing that.

181
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,180
- Slight intake of breath.
- You just see...

182
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,980
I don't know why I had this ancient 
Greek man looking at his phone.

183
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,120
Cause that's what they used to communicate, I just said!

184
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,460
LOL has fallen out of fashion now 
though. It is just emojis now.

185
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,360
People don't type LOL as much.

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
The amount... it's one of those kind of things, isn't it,

187
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,820
where people who aren't used to emojis yet, 
keep using the laughing and crying one.

188
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
- For actual crying.
- Yeah!

189
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,580
Which changes the tone of a message, like

190
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,280
"I'm sorry to hear your aunt's died."

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,720
And then have the crying with laughter emoji on it.

192
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,020
Well, it's like the parents who 
thought LOL meant lots of love.

193
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,240
Yes! That happened. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,540
"Sorry to hear you broke your ankle, LOL."

195
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,660
But...

196
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,160
That's like MSN messenger was.

197
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,900
Remember MSN Messenger, everybody?

198
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,480
No they don't! Some of them are too young for it!

199
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,840
It was like Facebook messenger...only s***er.

200
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,900
You would wait all night for your 
friend to appear, and they may not.

201
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,360
So there was an idea.

202
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,880
As I think you said, British 19th century.

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
Yes.

204
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,880
For two connected tubes.

205
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,660
♫ Tu-u-bes! ♫

206
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,260
I don't know why I said it like that

207
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,860
♫ Tubes. ♫

208
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,280
Um, and the idea was, you would put in water or take 
 out water and it would synchronise at the other side.

209
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,560
What were some of the problems with that system?

210
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,260
Putting the tube in, in the first place?

211
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,940
I'll give you a point. [DING] It was £200 a mile.
Which in 1838 money, is a lot of money.

212
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,520
Compared to just sending a messenger.

213
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,460
They would have to be made out of 
copper or something expensive.

214
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,700
- Oh yeah.
- Rather than just PVC tube from Wickes.

215
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,300
Yeah.

216
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,580
- That's a hardware store.
- Cast iron was often used for hydraulic tubes.

217
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,520
'Cos they could take the pressure.

218
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,340
What distance are we talking? 
Are we talking like over a dock, or over London?

219
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,040
Cause London was basically hydraulically
 powered up until the 1920s.

220
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
Oh that's true.

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,520
London had a big hydraulic power system.

222
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,280
So, if it's over London...

223
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,860
You should explain how that works.

224
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,020
Well you just had big accumulators. So big
 towers would be used to store the pressure.

225
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,360
And it would be used for moving lifts, 
for goods lifts, for cranes.

226
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,280
It would be powered off a
 central hydraulic power system.

227
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,900
- Cool.
- With pipes all over London.

228
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,800
And they're still...
I think they're used as cable runs now.

229
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,820
Under London. It was a huge London wide system. Especially using the docks, with dock gates,

230
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,700
and cranes and lifts and other things that need...
powering left and hither and yon.

231
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,820
Like dumb waiters in hotels.

232
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,000
So they just have a massive water tank
 at the centre of the system, that created...

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,620
Well several tanks, yeah.

234
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,640
...created the pressure. That gets pumped through.

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,260
And you can use some pressure if you wanted?

236
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,760
Yeah!

237
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,800
For the love of God, will somebody Biscuits that man!

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,220
♫[MYSTERY BISCUITS]♫

239
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,480
That's fair. That's fair, thank you
 for reminding me to Biscuit that.

240
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,800
First Biscuits of the season.

241
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,520
Yes, that was part of the problem.

242
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,420
The inventor was a Mr. Francis Whishaw.

243
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,340
- Uh-huh.
- Of course.

244
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,200
A good Victorian inventor's name.

245
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,140
"No sooner is motion given to one end..."

246
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,080
Poo!

247
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,360
Eh, readers?

248
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,460
than it is communicated through the whole sixty yards to the other end of the column.

249
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,840
- F*** a duck!
- So you might as well wave.

250
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,980
So when I said distance 
was the problem, you could just yell.

251
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,280
You could just yell, yeah.

252
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,220
When you said hydraulic telegraph, 
when I was forgetting hydraulic meant water,

253
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,360
but remembered it was tubes of stuff,

254
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,100
I was thinking of the, the, the...

255
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,620
-- Steady!
-- Good mime. Good mime.

256
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,260
"Tell me about your mother."

257
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,500
The blowy tubes they had.

258
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,380
Vacuum tubes.

259
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,040
Yes.

260
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,120
Sorry, sucky tubes.

261
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,300
Pneumatic tubes.

262
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,160
Pneumatic is the right word. Yes.

263
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
They had a whole system of telegraph through...

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,660
Yeah, you just had... you could, you had one...

265
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,920
You had a tube with air going one way and 
air going the other and you put a thing and... pfoom!

266
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,900
-- Still use them.
-- All round London.

267
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,300
There was atmospheric trains as well.

268
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,900
There was a whole, that was like the 
Victorian way of powering things was to...

269
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,960
Hyperloop?

270
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,880
I don't know what that is. Is that...

271
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,760
No, hyperloop is magnetic induction.

272
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,000
But it's inside a vacuum tube.

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Inside a vacuum.

274
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh, this was just a vacuum. 
It was like a tube carriage, with like, erm...

275
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,100
A shield round it in the middle. 
That would act as a piston.

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,980
You would just put them in and...

277
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,660
- Shove 'em. 
- And foomp!

278
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,160
You would basically release air at one end and foomp!

279
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,620
And you would be just sucked through in a tube carriage. And then you just appear at the other end.

280
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,060
Hoping no one would be there.

281
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,660
You would be in a container. You would be in a train here, it's not people...

282
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
-- Container!
-- It's not the thing from Futurama.

283
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,660
Oh.

284
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,400
But, at the same time on that, you'd be hoping no one opened the window for a fag. Wouldn't you, eh?

285
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,120
Woosh!

286
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,560
Like the end of Goldfinger, only underground.

287
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,060
Erm, but they were above ground atmospheric 
trains as well. Because you would have a big...

288
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,040
pneumatic tube up the middle 
of the lines. Again with an, erm...

289
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,700
A piston underneath, that would suck
 the train along. But the problem was...

290
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm just loving all these hand actions.

291
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,580
What you would have is that they use some kind of coating on the rubber and it was really attractive to rats.

292
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,100
So they ate it, and you'd lose the pressure.

293
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,180
Ah, you lose your back pressure.

294
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,960
And probably the rats would, at some point,
 get smeared into the wall by a passing...

295
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,980
And the rod and tube would get full
 of imploded, er... kerploded rats.

296
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,000
And they might even lubricate the system.

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,900
- Ahh! I'm not so, not so...
- Briefly!

298
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Briefly as they disintegrate.

299
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,140
So the hydraulic telegraph, 
what were the other problems?

300
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,520
We have distance not being particularly good.

301
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,260
Cost.

302
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,320
We have cost. Yep. What's the other problem if you've got water that needs to be kept level, between two...

303
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,380
Science!

304
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,200
Water always finds its own level.

305
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,280
Oh, right. OK. So you need two places that are at the same height, for it to balance out properly. Won't you?

306
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,780
Yes.

307
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,020
You couldn't do it from
the top of a hill to the bottom of a hill.

308
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,100
- No, because otherwise...
- It would just flow out.

309
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,400
What you invented there, is a fountain.

310
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,860
Ohh, I was going to say water slide, actually personally.

311
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,880
OK, Yeah, water slide communication would work.

312
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,180
- Woohoohoo hoo!
- That's the best way to transmit a message.

313
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,680
"The British are attacking!

314
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
"What you have to do, Paul Revere,
is you have to start on top of this hill...

315
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,100
"Go down the slide once if by land,
and twice if by sea."

316
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,240
"Once!

317
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,940
"Hang on, he's going back up again.

318
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,160
"He might just have forgot his towel."

319
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,320
"Have ye done?"

320
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,980
"Can't hear him, have to wait now. If he
comes down again, we've no idea, have we?"

321
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,420
"He's gone up four times now! He's just being greedy."

322
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
"His message appears to be 'Wheeee!'"

323
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,460
"Woohoo hooo!"

324
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm just seeing stuff like the D-Day landing, with 
soldiers coming off little slides off the end of boats.

325
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,620
"Whee!"

326
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,360
Wouldn't that make war so much more jolly?

327
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,760
"Woohoo hooo!"

328
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,020
I mean there's a lot of ways 
to make war more jolly. I think...

329
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,480
Like not doing it.

330
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah! Not killing people, would be a start.

331
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,300
"Send in the jesters!"

332
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,380
A machine gun that fires out 
signal flags that just say "bang"!

333
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,740
At the end of the show then,
