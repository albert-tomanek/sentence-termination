1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,040
The US and China have agreed on a trade deal.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,370
But they seem to understand their “deal”
in conflicting ways.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,320
And the ideological differences run deep.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,730
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,199
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,460
you should be using a VPN to protect your

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,899
America’s trade war with China continues.

10
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,509
But President Trump announced this month both
countries

11
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:34,949
have agreed on at least a temporary trade
deal.

12
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:37,370
As Trump wrote on his favorite platform,

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,030
“The deal I just made with China is, by
far,

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,670
the greatest and biggest deal ever made

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,280
for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history
of our Country.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,019
In fact, there is a question as to whether
or not

17
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:52,679
this much product can be produced?

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,550
Our farmers will figure it out.

19
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,820
Thank you China!”

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,800
Now I know what you’re thinking:

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
“Wow!

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,909
That sounds like the greatest and biggest
deal

23
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,320
ever made in the history of our country!”

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,860
So here’s what this great deal actually
says...

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,909
Um, wait, it doesn’t say anything.

26
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,920
Shelley, why are these notes blank?

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,720
What’s that?

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,250
Nothing was actually written down.

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,160
Apparently, what happened is that on October
11,

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,640
President Trump met with China’s Vice Premier
Liu He.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,409
Then Trump announced they had made

32
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,120
“Phase One” of a trade deal.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,780
But it was more of a handshake deal

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,860
than a written-down sort of deal.

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,520
And like many handshake deals,

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,260
each side remembers it a little differently.

37
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,490
From Trump’s perspective,

38
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,180
“China will buy as much as $50 billion in
U.S. agricultural goods

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,930
in exchange for the suspension of additional
tariffs.”

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,729
Specifically, Trump has delayed the tariff
increase

41
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,280
that was originally going to go into effect
on October 15—

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,359
on $250 billion dollars of Chinese goods.

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,399
But Trump has not reduced any existing tariffs

44
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,930
or stopped future tariffs.

45
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,210
But from China’s perspective coming out
of that handshake,

46
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,750
they still want more talks,

47
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,520
and would need *existing* tariffs rolled back

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,330
in order to reach that 50 billion worth of
agricultural imports.

49
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,250
And instead of this month’s handshake

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,190
being phase one of the trade deal,

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,480
China’s Vice Premier said the meeting merely

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,310
“laid an important foundation for a phase
one agreement.”

53
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,550
So where does that leave the US and China?

54
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,130
It’s like Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

55
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,650
It’s still unresolved,

56
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,550
and overall you’re just left feeling disappointed.

57
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,680
And will Rey and Kylo Ren fall in love

58
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,800
or forever remain mortal enemies?

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,390
Well, you won’t have to wait much longer
to find out.

60
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,660
In both cases.

61
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,800
As for the trade deal,

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,610
we may get the next episode as soon as mid-November.

63
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,130
That’s when President Trump and Chinese
leader Xi Jinping

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,180
will meet at the APEC forum in Chile.

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,560
Presumably after another one of those

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,670
super awkward world-leader family photos.

67
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,840
Everyone loves those.

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Especially Putin.

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,090
So if Trump and Xi still need to meet in November

70
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,540
to make the phase one deal,

71
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,150
does that mean that October’s meeting was
a wash?

72
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,670
This is what US Commerce Secretary Wilbur
Ross told FOX News.

73
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,020
“I think we’re in a better place.

74
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,340
And remember, for a while, there was no talk.

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,770
It was broken off.

76
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,950
Now they’re back at the table.

77
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,480
Clearly they want to make a deal.

78
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,990
We would like to make a deal.

79
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,370
But from our point of view,

80
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,090
it has to be the right deal.

81
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,440
And it doesn’t have to be in November.

82
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,650
It’s more critical that it be a proper deal

83
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,780
than exactly when it occurs.”

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,530
So what would a “proper deal” involve?

85
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,010
Well, phase one—the written kind,

86
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,960
not just the handshake kind—

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,330
could reduce upcoming US tariffs,

88
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,201
in exchange for China’s promise

89
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:59,920
to buy those American agricultural goods.

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,030
That’s important to Trump,

91
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,080
because making American farmers happy

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,760
makes it easier for him to win the 2020 presidential
election.

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,120
And China, for its part, wants to have a deal,
too.

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,780
US tariffs over the last year-plus

95
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,879
have hurt the Chinese economy pretty hard.

96
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,310
Last quarter, China’s official statistics

97
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,090
reported the lowest GDP growth in 27 years.

98
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,759
Of course, everyone knows that they fudge
the GDP numbers,

99
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,289
but the fact that they let the *official*
number go that low

100
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,860
is a sign of a weakening economy.

101
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,720
And a weak economy threatens Xi Jinping’s
grip on power.

102
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,639
So that, along with Trump seeking re-election,

103
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,580
means both sides want a phase one deal

104
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,259
and the political brownie points that follow.

105
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,789
But a phase one deal like this

106
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,240
won’t solve the fundamental trade problem.

107
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,659
The Chinese regime has been cheating on trade

108
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,259
for two decades—

109
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,849
from intellectual property theft,

110
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,880
to forced technology transfers,

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,610
to illegal subsidies.

112
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,009
And they continue to cheat.

113
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,509
A final trade deal would need to resolve all
these things.

114
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,680
Maybe that’s phase two.

115
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,360
Maybe that’s phase seven.

116
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,150
Maybe that’s phase never.

117
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,729
But whenever it happens,

118
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,479
it can’t just be a pinky-swear promise.

119
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,210
“The most important is enforcement.

120
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,310
Because their record hasn’t been that great
on enforcement,

121
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,419
so we need to have a real enforcement mechanism.”

122
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,300
“‘Not great’ is like an understatement,
right?

123
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,730
I mean the Chinese break promises all over
town.

124
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,389
They break promises with the WTO.

125
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:33,840
They broke promises with the US.

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
How are you going to get that enforcement
in there,

127
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,930
and get the Chinese to follow it?”

128
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,199
“Well if they don’t,

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,270
we really don’t have much of an arrangement.”

130
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,419
No, you really don’t.

131
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:46,699
Which is why even if Trump and Xi sign something
in November,

132
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,639
it won’t actually end the longstanding trade
tensions

133
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,060
between the US and China.

134
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,629
Those tensions come down to more than

135
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,639
just trade and enforcement of WTO rules.

136
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,759
There are deep ideological differences

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,569
between the US government,

138
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,669
and the Chinese Communist Party.

139
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:05,849
The Chinese Communist Party insists on

140
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,129
controlling all private enterprise.

141
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,999
This article in the state-run People’s Daily
last week

142
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,539
says that private companies

143
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,749
must strengthen the work of Party-building.

144
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:20,439
It says that nearly 1.6 million private companies
inside China

145
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,199
already have Communist Party branches within
their structures,

146
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,319
and the rest should follow their example.

147
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,780
That’s exactly the opposite of what the
US wants.

148
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,039
The US wants private companies to be, in fact,
private,

149
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,159
and not controlled by the whims of the Communist
Party.

150
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,479
Unless, of course,

151
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,100
it means the Communist Party can force private
companies

152
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,779
to buy $50 billion dollars in US agricultural
products.

153
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,060
But let’s conveniently ignore that little
irony.

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,900
And anyway, the ideological differences run
deeper.

155
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,760
Because the US and China are competing for
geopolitical power—

156
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,360
a.k.a. world domination.

157
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,650
China pledges billions of dollars to Africa...

158
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,340
The US pledges billions of dollars to Africa.

159
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
China pushes its companies

160
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,499
to dominate 5G wireless communications...

161
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:11,350
The US pushes its own companies to dominate
5G.

162
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,770
China wants to build an airport in Greenland...

163
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,930
The US wants to...buy Greenland.

164
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,229
So it’s unclear if any trade deal

165
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,430
can really solve these deep differences.

166
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,229
And no matter what gets signed in November,

167
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,029
it can only be phase one of a much bigger
battle.

168
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,160

When you go online,

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,930
everything you do is being tracked and logged—

171
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,370
by the websites you visit and your internet
service provider.

172
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,750
And in many cases, by the government.

173
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,499
Especially if you're in a place like mainland
China or Hong Kong,

174
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,759
where this kind of tracking can put you at
risk

175
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,419
of surveillance and even arrest.

176
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,870
That's why you should use a VPN like Surfshark
