1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,840
the problem with the national security law is is\h
that it's firstly it's so vaguely written that\h\h

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,280
uh you know any one of us um i'm sure would be in\h
breach of many categories of it and and the fact\h\h

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,520
is also it has this extra territorial application\h
so actually i mean i've been in breach of the\h\h

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,360
national security law many times a day every\h
day since it was introduced just by sitting in\h\h

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,440
in this chair in London and uh and talking\h
about hong kong you're British? you didn't guess\h\h

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,080
um well so because it is extra territorial it\h
just seems to me that you know that this has\h\h

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,280
become a red line for the chinese communist\h
party they i don't think they're gonna\h\h

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760
back down from this but obviously the\h
international community can't let this\h\h

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,840
stand so kind of like an immovable object meaning\h
an unstoppable force what's where is this going\h\h

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,800
well i think it it definitely uh marks obviously\h
it marks the total end of hong kong's autonomy and\h\h

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,520
basic freedoms and and the rule of law um it's\h
surely a turning point for the international\h\h

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,040
community um i mean the international community's\h
response rhetorically has been quite strong\h\h

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,880
in terms of actions the actions that the united\h
states and the uk have taken uh are certainly\h\h

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,360
very welcome but i think there's a real need for\h
others in the international community to step up\h\h

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,160
and really for the whole free world to unite um\h
in our outcry at what's happened to hong kong\h\h

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,720
not just because it's devastating for hong kong\h
but actually if the ccp is allowed to get away\h\h

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,440
with what they've done they won't stop there you\h
know we talked about taiwan a few minutes ago\h\h

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,600
taiwan will be next and our own freedoms will\h
be after that i mean wouldn't you say that they\h\h

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,800
have essentially gotten away with it though so\h
far uh yes i think that that is true um and that's\h\h

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,320
why we need a much more robust international\h
response so that um yes they may get away with\h\h

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,400
it but we need to ensure that they pay the highest\h
possible price so that means targeted sanctions\h\h

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
uh and and other forms of pressure so that um\h
they may get away with it but but not without cost\h\h

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,000
well so you mentioned the sanctions the u.s\h
government has put on um many officials in hong\h\h

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,760
kong uh which which might actually have an impact\h
on the chinese communist party because it uh we\h\h

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,560
actually did an episode about it uh how it cuts\h
off potentially chinese banks from the u.s dollar\h\h

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,760
do you think there's anything more that can be\h
done and in particular what more can the uk do\h\h

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,160
well so we have the u.s sanctions which are very\h
welcome but i think it would be even stronger if\h\h

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,800
uh if if many other parts of the free world\h
uh also introduce sanctions so i think the uk\h\h

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
which now has um magnitsky\h
style sanctions legislation\h\h

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,280
should be looking very seriously at uh at imposing\h
either magnitsky sanctions on um carrie lam\h\h

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,800
and uh some of the senior police officers\h
responsible for police brutality and officials\h\h

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,960
in beijing who are responsible for uh destroying\h
the sinai british joint declaration and\h\h

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,480
and uh breaking their promises to hong kong\h
um or if um there's a possibility that uh\h\h

34
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:39,200
the current magnitsky legislation um the criteria\h
may or may not uh be able to be applied to\h\h

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,000
to hong kong and that's debatable but if that's\h
the case and the british government should either\h\h

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,360
amend the legislation or or introduce a\h
separate sanctions regime but but either\h\h

37
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,200
way uh i think the uk should introduce targeted\h
sanctions and then i think other countries uh\h\h

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,000
european countries canada australia and and if\h
the free world really unites and coordinates these\h\h

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:13,840
kind of measures then then i think that could have\h
uh uh an impact what do you think's stopping that

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,080
you
