00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,290
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,420
this advanced technology could secretly make
you sick,

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,140
and the whole time you’d have no idea what’s
going on.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your...

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,240
wait do you hear that?!

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,940
It’s like some kind of subtle and vague,

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,300
but abnormal sensations of sound and pressure.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,060
“...we got a health alert saying,

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,380
I can read you part of it,

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,910
a US government employee in China recently
reported

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,700
subtle and vague, but abnormal sensations
of sound and pressure.”

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,960
Wow!

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,100
Are they sure it wasn’t just from watching
CNN?

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,560
On Wednesday, an embassy spokesperson reported

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,640
that an employee in the US consulate in Guangzhou

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,290
...experienced a “variety of physical symptoms”

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,650
between late 2017 and April 2018.

18
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,240
The employee was sent back to the United States,

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,540
and diagnosed with a “mild traumatic brain
injury.”

20
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,210
This statement from the embassy warns,

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,550
“While in China,

22
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,310
if you experience any unusual acute auditory
or sensory phenomena

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,039
accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing
noises,

24
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,289
do not attempt to locate their source.

25
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:18,909
Instead, move to a location where the sounds
are not present.”

26
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,060
Which sounds really creepy.

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,609
Especially since it’s consistent with what’s
called a sonic attack.

28
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:28,909
And no, that’s not the newest burger from
Sonic.

29
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,709
A sonic attack uses weaponized frequencies

30
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:34,850
that can’t be heard clearly by the human
ear,

31
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,899
but can trigger very real physical responses.

32
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,329
The BBC says some of the symptoms include,

33
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,749
“vertigo, vomiting or uncontrollable defecation.”

34
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:49,560
Which is also a symptom of your late night
Sonic Attack.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,990
According to the US Secretary of State,

36
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,429
what happened to the US diplomat in China
is medically similar

37
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,549
to what happened US diplomats in Cuba back
in 2016.

38
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,529
“We had an incident in Guangzhou that was,

39
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:09,729
that the medical indications are very similar

40
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,760
and entirely consistent with the medical indications

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,379
that have taken place to Americans working
in Cuba.”

42
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,159
If you’re curious, Gizmodo has uploaded
that sound,

43
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,840
which seems like an incredibly bad idea, but
hey, it’s the internet.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,409
Let’s take a listen.

45
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,370
Yeah, it’s definitely Yanny.

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,580
What’s that, Shelley?

47
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,099
What do you mean, it’s Laurel?

48
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,209
Ugh, well you’re obviously wrong.

49
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,110
Anyway, enough of that!

50
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,200
It’s time for another fan question.

51
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,780
Brett, Uhh, Brett asks,

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,650
Has China Uncensored gotten any offers from
Superfunds,

53
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,329
SuperPACs or other geopolitcal groups to push
a specific political agenda?

54
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,510
Good question.

55
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,260
Let me put it this way.

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,880
The other day we reached out to Audible for
sponsorship.

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,060
You know, Audible, that advertises on everything.

58
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,220
Well, apparently they felt China Uncensored
was too “political.”

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,329
If you’re political agenda is criticizing

60
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,920
Communism and the Chinese communist Party,

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,050
it's pretty hard to find support.

62
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,159
Superfunds?

63
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,670
Geopolitical groups?

64
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,670
Not likely.

65
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,260
That’s why we rely on you, my 50 cent army!
