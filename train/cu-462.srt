00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,360
Chinese diplomats in Fiji\h

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,840
Crashed Taiwan’s National Day Party

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,080
But that’s not all they’re doing

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,920
To challenge Taiwan in the Pacific

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
Welcome back to China\h
Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.\h

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,920
 There was a major diplomatic incident\h
between China and Taiwan this month in Fiji.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,360
What happened? Well, it’s a bit\h
of a he said/she said situation.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
According to Taiwan, two Chinese diplomats\h\h

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,560
crashed a Taiwanese National\h
Day Party in Fiji on October 8.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,400
I believe we have a picture of the\h
two Chinese diplomats in question.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,520
Anyway, the party crashing\h
led to a fistfight in Fiji.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,440
Also known as a stoush.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,400
A scuffle.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,040
A fracas.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
Newspapers love a good old-fashioned fracas.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
Anyway, the fight was serious enough to land\h\h

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,760
a Taiwanese official in the\h
hospital with a concussion.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,680
So why did these Chinese diplomats crash\h
Taiwan’s National Day party? Well Taiwanese\h\h

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,960
officials say that the Chinese diplomats were\h
trying to photograph the people who were there.\h

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,000
“Beijing has deployed such\h
tactics—turning up at events,\h\h

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,320
taking photographs of people—in recent years to\h
intimidate its rivals and those who support them.”

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,680
When the Taiwanese staff tried to\h
stop them from taking photographs,\h\h

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,160
the Chinese diplomats assaulted them.\h

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,160
Of course, Beijing totally denies this.\h

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,160
"First of all, Taiwan has no so-called diplomats\h
in Fiji...The relevant report you mentioned is\h\h

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,520
totally inconsistent with the facts. Taiwan\h
is like a thief crying 'stop thief'."

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,480
Yeah, there aren’t any so-called\h
Taiwanese diplomats in Fiji,\h\h

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,640
which means we couldn’t have so-called punched\h
them in their so-called faces. In fact,\h\h

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,640
those Taiwanese diplomats who don’t\h
exist punched us in the face first!

30
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,920
Chinese authorities are saying that\h
the Taiwanese “acted provocatively\h\h

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,320
against the Chinese Embassy staff...causing\h
injuries and damage to one Chinese diplomat.”

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,440
So how did those Chinese diplomats\h
get there in the first place?\h\h

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
They totally didn’t crash Taiwan’s party.\h

34
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,960
They were just “carrying out their official duties\h
in the public area outside the function venue.”

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,120
...official duties that may or may not\h
have included secretly photographing\h\h

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
people going into the venue. And\h
trying to crash Taiwan’s party.\h\h

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,080
In any case, since Taiwan is part of China,\h\h

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,960
that means this Taiwanese party\h
is actually a Chinese party,\h\h

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,840
which means that the Chinese diplomats weren’t\h
crashing, they were just going to their own party!

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,080
Everyone knows the best\h
party is a Communist Party.\h

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
But the Chinese foreign ministry\h
wants the world to know that the real\h\h

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,000
problem isn’t the party crashing.\h
The real problem is the cake.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
That’s because “a false national flag\h
was openly displayed at the scene;\h\h

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,520
the cake was also marked with a false national\h
flag,” according to spokesman Zhao Lijian.

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,520
I believe that Zhao is saying\h
that the cake is a lie.

46
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,240
In the end, police were called to the event, but\h
the Chinese officials claimed diplomatic immunity.

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,200
The actions of the Chinese diplomats in Fiji\h
are part of China’s increasingly aggressive\h\h

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
“Wolf Warrior Diplomacy.”\h

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
As well as the Chinese Communist\h
Party’s increasing threats to Taiwan.

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,800
But that’s not the whole story.\h\h

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,480
What happened in Fiji is also about China’s\h
growing attempts to dominate the Pacific.

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,360
And I’ll tell you how, after this short break.

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,960
Welcome back. China’s fracas\h
over a Taiwanese cake in Fiji\h\h

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,920
is just a small part of the Communist\h
Party’s attempts to dominate the Pacific.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,760
Fiji is located here, in the South Pacific,\h
a short flight away from Australia.

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,040
Fiji is an archipelago of more than 300 islands.\h\h

57
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,360
It’s most famous for its abundant\h
natural resources, like bottled water.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
Fun fact: Fiji used to be known as\h\h

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,800
the Cannibal Isles. I imagine they changed\h
the name because it was hard to get tourists.

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
Welcome to the Cannibal Isles:\h
We’re here to serve you.\h

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,480
Anyway, Fiji was one of the first Pacific\h\h

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,640
nations to recognize the People’s\h
Republic of China back in 1975.\h

63
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,640
But relations between Fiji and\h
the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,680
really started warming up back in 2006,\h\h

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,800
after the current prime minister of Fiji, Frank\h
Bainimarama, seized power in a military coup.\h

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,160
China didn’t criticize the coup. In fact,\h
they increased their aid to Fiji dramatically,\h\h

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,960
from 1 million dollars to 161\h
million dollars within two years.

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,160
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has personally\h
met with Bainimarama several times,\h\h

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,200
including during a state visit to Fiji in 2014.

70
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,840
During that visit, they signed five agreements\h
as part of China’s Pacific engagement strategy.

71
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,120
Fiji is also part of China’s Belt and Road\h
Initiative. In just the last five years,\h\h

72
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,600
China has invested more than a billion dollars\h
in Fiji, mostly for infrastructure projects.

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,320
Like these Fiji-China Friendship Bridges. Yeah,\h
they really cemented the bilateral friendship.\h

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey Xinhua, I’m the one who makes punny\h
jokes around here. Stay in your lane.\h

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,600
Fiji also became the first Pacific\h
island nation to get a loan\h\h

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,480
from China’s infrastructure investment bank.

77
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:06,320
There have been some hiccups along the way. Like\h
a Chinese mega-resort that destroyed a local reef\h\h

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,720
and then had its building rights revoked.\h

79
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,520
But overall, the relationship between\h
Fiji and China has gotten even closer\h\h

80
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
after the coronavirus outbreak.

81
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
Chinese state-run media are talking about\h
speeding up construction projects in Fiji.

82
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Fiji does not have official\h
diplomatic relations with Taiwan,\h\h

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,760
but Taiwan does have a de facto embassy\h
in Fiji—the Taipei Trade Office.

84
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,600
And their National Day celebration, the one\h
that sparked the literal diplomatic fight,\h\h

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,680
was attended by Fiji government ministers,\h
opposition leaders, and prominent businesspeople.

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,920
So it’s easy to see why the Chinese\h
diplomats were so eager to figure out\h\h

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,320
who was at the party. Eating\h
that delicious, delicious cake.

88
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
In fact, Taiwan’s influence\h
is one of the big reasons\h\h

89
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,160
that the Chinese Communist Party\h
is more interested in the Pacific.\h

90
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,320
More on that after the break.

91
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,080
Welcome back. Taiwan is a\h
key reason why the Chinese\h\h

92
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Communist Party is interested in the Pacific.\h

93
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,200
Although frankly we are running out of parts of\h
the globe where China does not have an interest.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,040
But four of the 15 countries that officially\h
recognize Taiwan are in the Pacific: Nauru,\h\h

95
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,920
Palau, the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu.

96
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,960
Last year, the Chinese Communist Party\h
managed to get two Pacific countries to\h\h

97
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,960
switch diplomatic relations from Taiwan to\h
China: The Solomon Islands and Kiribati.

98
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,000
Thanks to China’s diplomatic application\h
of... lots and lots of money.

99
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,320
There’s a lot more going on with China and\h
these Pacific nations than I can fit into this\h\h

100
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,920
episode.\h Let me know if I should\h
do another episode on this topic.\h

101
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,480
But broadly speaking, the Pacific is one place\h
that Taiwan and China compete heavily for\h\h

102
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,320
influence, especially because Taiwan can afford to\h
give more aid to these smaller Pacific countries.\h

103
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,120
Remember: no matter how big or small a country\h
is, it gets one vote in the United Nations.\h\h

104
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,760
And the Pacific Ocean happens to be\h
a great place to build naval bases.

105
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,960
But it’s not just Taiwan that’s worried\h
about China’s increasing role in the Pacific.

106
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,240
Australia and New Zealand are also nervous about\h
China gaining more influence in their backyard.\h\h

107
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
In case China decides to turn the nine-dash line\h\h

108
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,160
into the 19-dash line. Or for\h
that matter the 90-dash line.

109
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,520
That’s one reason both Australia and New Zealand\h
are competing with China for influence in the\h\h

110
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:47,120
South Pacific as well. For example, Australia\h
outbid China to fund a military base in Fiji.

111
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,120
And the United States is paying\h
attention, too. After all,\h\h

112
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,880
the US not only has territory in the Pacific,\h
it also has many military bases in the region.

113
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,280
Last month Palau, which recognizes Taiwan and not\h\h

114
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,720
China, invited the US to build a\h
military base on their islands as well.

115
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
That’s after US Defense Secretary\h
Mark Esper visited Palau\h\h

116
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,960
and accused Beijing of being “a\h
malign influence” in the region.

117
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,280
And Beijing is the big reason that the US\h
has just released its 2020 Pacific Pledge.

118
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,240
It’s a pledge to give more than 200 million\h
dollars of funding to the Pacific islands,\h\h

119
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,320
including 130 million dollars to\h
support the response to COVID-19.

120
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
So expect to see growing diplomatic rivalries\h
in the Pacific over the next few years\h\h

121
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,960
between China and Taiwan, Australia,\h
New Zealand, and the United States.

122
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,280
Sounds like it’s going to be\h
a real party. Pass the cake.

123
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,720
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

124
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,720
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

125
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Bill asks, Do you think the USA should\h
sell F-35 fighter planes to Taiwan,\h\h

126
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,840
thus, giving Taiwan the ability to remove\h
all Chinese airplanes from its air space?\h\h

127
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,320
Taiwan might send a message to\h
the CCP: "Do Not Tread On Me!"

128
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,360
Well, Bill it’s complicated. Two years ago,\h
Taiwan had wanted to buy F-35 stealth fighter\h\h

129
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,360
jets from the US. But they stopped requesting that\h
last year, and asked for F-16 fighters instead.\h

130
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,520
The US just finalized that sale two months ago.

131
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,840
Why did Taiwan stop asking for the F-35s?\h

132
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
“The air force turned its back on\h
pursuing the F-35B short takeoff/vertical\h\h

133
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,640
landing (STOVL) fighter due to a recent Taiwan\h
National Security Council report. It indicated the\h\h

134
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,200
stealth fighter was too exorbitant and untested in\h
real combat to be a pragmatic choice for Taiwan.”

135
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,800
There was also concern that the US might not\h
sell the F-35 to Taiwan for security reasons.

136
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,400
But some experts say that\h
Taiwan still needs the F-35,\h\h

137
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
since they don’t have any stealth fighter jets.\h

138
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,360
And a former deputy undersecretary of defense has\h
suggested that instead of selling F-35s to Taiwan,\h\h

139
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
the US should lease them.

140
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,120
The idea would be that the planes would\h
be leased to Taiwan but would stay\h\h

141
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,920
in the US. That way they could be a\h
deterrent to China, but China wouldn’t\h\h

142
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,760
be able to spy on the F-35s, or attack them,\h
since they wouldn’t be physically in Taiwan.

143
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,760
It’s an interesting idea.\h

144
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
Thanks for your question Bill.\h

145
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
And if you’d like to have me respond to\h
your question or comment on the show,\h\h
