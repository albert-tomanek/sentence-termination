1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,780
Turkey faces off with China

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,189
Over treatment of the Uighur ethnic minority

3
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:08,720
How will this showdown go down?

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,820
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,120
I’m Chris Chappell.

we publish a new episode.

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,289
The Uighurs.

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,090
They’re the dominant ethnic minority

13
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,280
in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of
China.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,469
That’s its official name because it’s
totally autonomous.

15
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,899
You know, other than the massive state security
apparatus

16
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,609
the Chinese Communist Party has installed
in Xinjiang.

17
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:40,440
“The security here is incredibly tight.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,859
There are armored cars on the streets.

19
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,780
Police stations on every corner.

20
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,719
And tons of surveillance cameras.

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,809
In the past year, police have stepped up security.

22
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,539
The region is now under probably the most

23
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,269
intense government surveillance in the world.”

24
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,399
Not to mention the government workers literally

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,179
being sent into people’s homes to spy on
them.

26
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:02,979
I mean who doesn’t like being watched 24/7

27
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,080
with the threat of detention

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,200
hanging over your head at all times?

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,730
I can’t imagine why any Uighurs

30
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,510
would want independence from China.

31
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,030
For years, the Chinese Communist Party

32
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,110
has targeted the Uighurs.

33
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,320
They're a mostly Turkic Muslim group,

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,200
so the Party justifies it as a crackdown on
terrorists.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,890
And it is true some Uighurs from Xinjiang

36
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,860
have joined terrorist groups like ISIS.

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,910
But authorities have detained

38
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,840
more than a million Uighurs in concentration
camps.

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,280
So that makes you wonder,

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,870
do Chinese authorities think all Uighurs are
terrorists?

41
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,390
Well, that would be taking it too far.

42
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,180
Chinese authorities clearly don’t think

43
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,030
all Uighurs are terrorists.

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,030
For instance,

45
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,730
Uighur women make great wife material.

46
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,001
...since you know, there’s about 30 million

47
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,200
more men than women in China.

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,700
It’s because of the extremely well-thought-out

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,030
One Child Policy that resulted in the abortions

50
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,780
of tens of millions of unborn girls.

51
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,570
Now, many Western countries have spoken out

52
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,870
against the persecution of Uighurs.

53
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,070
Including the Trump Administration.

54
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,340
Because when you think ‘defending Muslims,’

55
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,319
you think Donald Trump.

56
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,549
And Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi

57
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,840
said just last week that she spoke with

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,459
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about

59
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,640
doing more to help the Uighurs.

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,330
More proof of how the Chinese Communist Party

61
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,170
is bringing Democrats and Republicans together.

62
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,450
It’s heartwarming, really.

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,069
But in the upside down world we live in,

64
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,799
Muslim countries by and large have remained
silent

65
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,950
about the Chinese regime’s treatment of
Muslims.

66
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,940
Does that have anything to do with the billions
of dollars

67
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,159
China is investing in these countries?

68
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,430
I’m not saying it’s about money.

69
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,060
But I’m not *not* saying it’s not not
about money.

70
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,670
Think about *that.*

71
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,849
But the Muslim world’s silence

72
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,060
on the Chinese regime’s persecution of Muslims

73
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,120
has started to change.

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
And it has started with

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,170
one of the most unlikely countries:

76
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,180
Turkey.

77
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
Because when you think

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,870
‘standing up to authoritarian persecution,’

79
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,209
you think Turkish dictator President Erdoğan.

80
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,020
Turkey has become the first predominantly
Muslim country

81
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,830
to directly criticize the Chinese regime on
the issue.

82
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,629
This statement is a from the Turkish Foreign
Ministry.

83
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,040
It specifically calls out the “serious human
rights violations

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,269
committed in the Xinjiang region.”

85
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,849
The statement was made despite a recent 3.6
billion dollar loan

86
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,120
from a Chinese state-owned bank.

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,029
The statement also grieved the death of

88
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:33,799
a famous Uighur musician and poet, Abdurehim
Heyit.

89
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,900
He’s been detained in China since 2017.

90
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900


91
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,029
Heyit is incredibly popular in the Turkic
world for his art.

92
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:43,499
So, what was the Chinese regime’s response?

93
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,469
The report of his death was greatly exaggerated.

94
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,870
China released this video,

95
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,460
supposedly of Heyit saying, “Hey I’m fine!”

96
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,620
“My name is Abdurehim Heyit.

97
00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:02,760
Today is February 10, 2019.

98
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,699
I'm in the process of being investigated

99
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:11,819
for allegedly violating the national laws.

100
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm now in good health and have never been
abused.”

101
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,700
Ohhh, well that was a bit of a snafu.

102
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,400
The Chinese Foreign Ministry was quick to
gloat.

103
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,980
“Turkey’s ridiculous lie of describing

104
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,530
a person who is alive as a dead person

105
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,260
and its groundless accusations

106
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,000
are terribly wrong and irresponsible.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,580
We express resolute opposition to this.”

108
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,840
Yeah, how dare Turkey call someone dead

109
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,090
when that person is obviously alive

110
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,330
but held incommunicado with his whereabouts
unknown!

111
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,510
Although, if a government has to release

112
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,980
a “proof of life” video

113
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,630
to prove that they haven’t killed someone,

114
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,330
that’s not a good look.

115
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,180
It’s more of a kidnapper look.

116
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,470
But let’s go back to why Turkey messed up!

117
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,610
Because obviously if that specific fact was
wrong,

118
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,880
then entire argument that China is persecuting
Uighurs

119
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,670
must be false too!

120
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,280
At least according to this statement

121
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,180
from the Chinese embassy in Turkey.

122
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,240
“The allegations that the Chinese government

123
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,370
is trying to ‘eliminate’ the ethnic,

124
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,140
religious and cultural identity of the Uighurs

125
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,300
and other Muslim groups are completely untenable.”

126
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,000
So please, stop looking into any alleged stories
of torture.

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,510
Like this one.

128
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,070
But it was a short-lived victory for the Chinese
regime.

129
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,730
Because you know what the response

130
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,250
from Uighurs around the world has been?

131
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,060
Well, if the Chinese authorities are willing
to release

132
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,740
a video of one Uighur as proof he was alive,

133
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,080
why not release one for every Uighur in detention?

134
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,750
They started the #MeTooUyghur movement,

135
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,210
demanding video proof that their

136
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,890
detained friends and relatives are alive.

137
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,860
A Uighur Me Too Movement.

138
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,450
Look, you know,

139
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,130
not all Chinese people imprison Uighurs.

140
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,400
In fact, some Uighurs even fake it!

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,670
Some Uighurs just accidentally fell down the
stairs...

142
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,540
into concentration camps,

143
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,690
while in the process,

144
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,730
dropping their children...into...

145
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,540
far-away Chinese boarding schools

146
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,840
where they’re forbidden to speak their native
language.

147
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,020
Look, what I’m trying to say is,

148
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,830
stairs are dangerous and stop asking questions.

149
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,810
So what does this mean for Turkey's relationship
with China?

150
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,500
Turkey hasn’t officially responded

151
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,090
since China released the video they say is
Heyit.

152
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,060
But according to the Mercator Institute for
China Studies,

153
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,940
Turkey is too important for China

154
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,810
as an access point to the Middle East.

155
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,140
So the long-term blowback will probably be
small.

156
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
And before we go,

157
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,580
now is the time when I answer questions from
you,

158
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,400
my loyal 50-cent army—

159
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,740
fans of the show who support what we do

160
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,570
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

161
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,030
David Michael White asks,

162
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,860
“Chris, in your opinion,

163
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,700
what's the greatest love story in Chinese
literature?”

164
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,100
Oh well, I’m sure the right answer is probably

165
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,060
the characters from Dream of Red Chamber,

166
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,930
one of the four classics of Chinese literature.

167
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,600
It involves two star-crossed lovers bound
together

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,640
by a tragic karmic relationship.

169
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,970
And let me just say,

170
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,910
what I just said makes it sound

171
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,780
way more interesting that it actually is.

172
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,130
Now I know I’m going to get some blowback
for this,

173
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,390
because Dream of Red Chamber

174
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,420
is beloved by Chinese people everywhere,

175
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,590
but it must lose something in translation

176
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,790
because seriously,

177
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,950
it’s 3,000 pages divided into five volumes,

178
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,350
and in one of them,

179
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,730
literally the biggest plot point is...

180
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,690
the characters form a poetry club.

181
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,880
Yeah, that’s the main thing that happens.

182
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,370
Like, honestly I would say the relationship

183
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,351
between the Monkey King and the Tang Monk

184
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:41,330
in Journey to the West is a better romance.

185
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,680
Or maybe the bromance of the three brothers

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,300
in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

187
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
In fact, yeah,

188
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,080
that’s what I’m going to say as my answer.

189
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,390
The Three Sworn Brothers,

190
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,690
Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei,

191
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,020
who swore to die on the same day,

192
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,830
is the greatest love story in Chinese literature.

193
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,180
But it’s not romantic love.

194
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,600
It’s a bromantic love.

195
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,580
Now that classic is incredible.

196
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,610
What’s that, Shelley?

197
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,840
What about the Butterfly Lovers

198
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,250
or the Cowherd and Weaver Girl?

199
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,120
Nah, still going to go with

200
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

201
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,110
It’s right there in the name!

202
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,110
Thanks for your question,

203
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,920
