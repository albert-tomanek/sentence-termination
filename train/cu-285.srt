1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,440
We all know America has the CIA.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,040
Britain has MI6.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,580
And Russia has the FSB.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,100
But few people know about China’s three-letter
spy agency.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,780
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,250
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,250
Spy agencies.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,660
A cloak and dagger world of mystique and mystery.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,220
And with a little help from Hollywood, plenty
of glamor.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,939
“It doesn’t bother you to kill all those
people?

11
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:32,059
“Well I wouldn’t be very good at my job
if it did.”

12
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:34,830
We all know about the spy agencies from Great
Britain...

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,920
and from the US

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,600
—or at least we think we do,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,120
based on totally accurate Hollywood movies.

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,230
But China’s three-letter spy agency

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,950
may be the espionage world’s best kept secret.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,130
It’s called the MSS—

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,540
the Ministry of State Security.

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,880
But whereas the is CIA

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,100
is restricted to spying outside the US—

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,329
which it...always sticks to—

23
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,100
the MSS doesn’t have that restriction.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,090
It can spy anywhere!

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,090
Total freedom.

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,090
For the spies,

27
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,020
not for anyone else in China.

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,760
The MSS made headlines last December

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,710
after it detained two Canadians in China

30
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,420
on suspicion of “endangering national security.”

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,900
It was a move widely seen as retaliation

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,470
for Canada’s arrest of Huawei’s finance
chief

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,450
Meng Wanzhou.

34
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,460
Now for all the secret cloak and dagger stuff

35
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,060
that three-letter spy agencies get up to,

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,860
some, like the CIA,

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,810
can be surprisingly transparent.

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,180
Look, they have a website!

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,630
With career opportunities

40
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,900
And a library

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,650
And a Kids’ Zone

42
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,729
And an advice column?!

43
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,300
Anyway, you’re probably thinking, Chris,

44
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,040
having a website with job postings

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,260
seems like a low bar for transparency.

46
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,810
And that’s true.

47
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,500
Which makes it even more incredible

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,670
that China’s MSS doesn’t have a website
at all.

49
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,010
And it doesn’t have any publicly listed
contacts

50
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,299
or spokespeople either.

51
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,360
But at least it has a logo we can look to
for insight.

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,950
Let’s see:

53
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Hammer and sickle.

54
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,519
So the Communist Party is obviously the top
priority.

55
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,129
Below that, the Forbidden City,

56
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:15,819
which means the government.

57
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,269
And at the bottom the Great Wall of China.

58
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:19,269
Which means...

59
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:20,900
repelling Mongolians?

60
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,760
Ok, I’m still working on it.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,150
But the fact that the MSS

62
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,000
puts the Chinese Communist Party first,

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
that’s been established.

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,599
According to this report by China expert Peter
Mattis,

65
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,019
“China’s civilian intelligence and security
agencies are...

66
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,499
an integral tool for the preservation of

67
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:40,770
the power of the Chinese Communist Party.”

68
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,200
And since the MSS is “empowered to arrest

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,760
and to operate inside and outside China”,

70
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,090
it can used to help crush

71
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,419
dangerous subversive elements inside the country.

72
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,049
Like people who wear robes.

73
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,750
Or people who wear skull caps.

74
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,309
Or people who meditate.

75
00:02:57,309 --> 00:03:00,559
But we still don’t know that much about
the MSS.

76
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:04,309
The only ad ever made public for a job at
the MSS

77
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,389
got posted on the career website of a Chinese
university.

78
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,590
But apparently that was a mistake,

79
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,090
because it was taken down immediately.

80
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,279
If you have good vision,

81
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,379
a “well-proportioned physique”

82
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,400
and are tall enough, the MSS wants you!

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,090
The post was for looking for grad students

84
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,010
with foreign language skills.

85
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,269
All sorts of foreign language skills.

86
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:26,579
Including Uighur,

87
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,120
which is spoken by the Muslim people

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,109
of China’s Xinjiang region.

89
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,340
Which, by the way, is, um,

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,809
absolutely not a *foreign* language,

91
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:38,780
it’s um, part of Chinese language since
ancient times.

92
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,669
Anyway, the MSS wants people who can speak
Uighur, ok?

93
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,840
Maybe they’ll help with the detention camps
in Xinjiang.

94
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,969
As one million Uighurs have been locked up
there

95
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,079
in re-education centers.

96
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,879
"They grabbed me and led me to another room

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,029
where they put me into a metal (chair-like)
device.

98
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,790
In this metal device you stand still and cannot
move.

99
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,909
Your arms are secured by the metal parts

100
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,260
and your chest is exposed.

101
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,579
After six hours in this device my whole body
ached.

102
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:11,290
Standing becomes uncomfortable after 10 minutes,

103
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,129
the iron rubs against your skin,

104
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:16,049
and after six hours the pain becomes very
strong."

105
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,660
Wow, that really makes you think:

106
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,220
Why would you need Uighur language skills
to torture people?

107
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,450
By the way, the MSS is also looking for people

108
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,090
who speak Tibetan, Mongolian, and Kazakh languages.

109
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,960
Anyway, another must-have skill

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,120
in the accidentally-posted job ad

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,060
was specialized knowledge in “information
security.”

112
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060


113
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,270
You know, something that could be put to good
use

114
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,100
in missions of stealing other country’s
state secrets.

115
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,790
And commercial secrets.

116
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,290
Like in the case of two alleged MSS spies

117
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,480
Zhu Hua and Zhang Jianguo—

118
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,290
who were indicted in December

119
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,740
for cybercrimes in the United States.

120
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,510
The two alleged spies are accused of computer
hacking

121
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,940
of a wide range of American government agencies
and corporations,

122
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,340
including the Navy and NASA.

123
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,540
"The extent and types of data stolen by the
defendants

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,340
is shocking and outrageous.

125
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,470
As the deputy attorney general and the director

126
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,370
noted the defendants are alleged to have been
members

127
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,220
of a hacking group operating in China called
APT 10.

128
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,280
As alleged, these defendants engaged in their
hacking campaign

129
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,240
in association with the Chinese Ministry of
State Security.”

130
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,750
At a 2007 MSS recruiting event at a Chinese
university,

131
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,810
recruiters said they wanted applicants for
jobs

132
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,860
that promised “lots of travel”,

133
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,460
“tiring” work that was “mostly not dangerous”

134
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,210
and female students were basically not wanted.

135
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,270
Another closely guarded MSS secret revealed:

136
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,940
they’re not an equal opportunity employer.

137
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,360
Also, with a monthly salary of $600

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,640
and having to sign a fair chunk of your life
away

139
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,990
with a minimum 10-year contract,

140
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,190
the pay kinda sucks.

141
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,380
But the MSS spying efforts against the US

142
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,930
got an even more embarrassing outing

143
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,650
when the deputy director of the agency, Yanjun
Xu,

144
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,610
was arrested in Belgium and extradited to
the US.

145
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,170
He now faces charges of stealing trade secrets

146
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,080
from American aerospace companies.

147
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,260
It was a big deal also because it’s the
first time ever

148
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,410
that a Chinese official was hauled to the
US

149
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,240
on corporate espionage allegations.

150
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,550
According to this article,

151
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,300
the MSS deputy director allegedly lured scientists

152
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,430
from three American aerospace companies to
China

153
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,290
by inviting them to give talks at a conference.

154
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,620
He then allegedly offered them cash for blueprints.

155
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,620
But honestly,

156
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,140
I’m just distracted by that amazing headline,

157
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,310
“Oh no Xi didn’t!”

158
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,310
Definitely my pick

159
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,140
for best news headline of the year.

160
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,200
Anyway, former CIA head Michael Hayden

161
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,220
describes how this kind of MSS spying works.

162
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,600
“No one comes out and says:

163
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
‘Hey, here’s 50 million dollars,

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,330
you wanna spy for the Chinese?’

165
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,770
You begin a relationship

166
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,270
and then you begin to develop that relationship.

167
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,430
From that ‘I love your work,

168
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,310
can I read the paper?’

169
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,750
And then six months later.

170
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,580
I’m really feeling bad,

171
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,500
this has been so wonderful for me.

172
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,460
Tell you what,

173
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,580
let’s establish a consultancy relationship.

174
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,150
Let me begin to pay you.

175
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,550
You see where this is going, right?”

176
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,710
And speaking of relationships,

177
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,480
the MSS is no stranger to that staple of spycraft—

178
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,950
the honey trap.

179
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,370
They may not have many female agents,

180
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,960
but when they do...

181
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,930
For example, accused MSS agent Katrina Leung.

182
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,510
The FBI code named her “Parlor Maid.”

183
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,010
Parlor Maid was initially a high value FBI
informant

184
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,669
before they realized that she had provided
her FBI handler

185
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,230
“with misinformation for more than a decade.”

186
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,270
In 2003, she was indicted—

187
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,430
but defended herself.

188
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,550
“America is my home and I cherish it.

189
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,900
I know we will answer the charges

190
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,990
and that my name will be cleared.”

191
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,000
Katrina Leung was half right.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Her case was initially dismissed on a technicality,

193
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,770
but she later pleaded guilty to lesser charges.

194
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,680
And the honey trap part?

195
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,560
She “was a double agent who was sleeping
with not one,

196
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,190
but two, of the [FBI’s] top China agents.”

197
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,539
This is former FBI agent James Smith, one
of those, um,

198
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,539
“top China agents” she successfully honey
trapped.

199
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,979
He was charged with gross negligence

200
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,759
for giving her access to classified FBI documents.

201
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,360
According to the book “Tiger trap:

202
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,410
America’s secret spy war with China,”

203
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,149
Smith allegedly had a 20-year-long

204
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,620
romantic affair with Parlor Maid,

205
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,920
and apparently brought sensitive documents

206
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,320
to their...um...meetings.

207
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,660
But just how serious is the secret spy war

208
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,350
between America’s spy agencies and China’s
MSS?

209
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,579
"The threats we face have never been more
severe

210
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,449
or more pervasive

211
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:18,990
or more potentially damaging to our national
security.

212
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,410
And no country poses a broader

213
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,100
more severe long term threat

214
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,809
to our nation's economy

215
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:29,529
and cyber infrastructure than China.

216
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,180
China's goal simply put is to replace the
U.S.

217
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,899
as the world's leading superpower

218
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,910
and they're using illegal methods to get there."

219
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,050
So, yeah, you should maybe think twice

220
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,709
when a guy from China tells you

221
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,970
he really enjoyed your research paper

222
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,879
about supersonic engine design,

223
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,860
and would love for you to speak at his conference.

224
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,120
Or that pretty Chinese woman

225
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,209
who says she’d would love to show you her...

226
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,990
top secret intelligence documents.

227
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,769
So what do you think about China’s secretive
spy agency,

228
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,820
the MSS?

229
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,360
