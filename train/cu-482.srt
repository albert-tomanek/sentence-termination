1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,040
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,130
the Chinese Communist Party says they want
to

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,860
spread peace around the world.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,010
But just in case,

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,060
they’re also filling the skies with terrifying
war machines.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,880
Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,240
We all know America has the world’s greatest
military.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
But I’ve got some bad news for you.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,780
Or good news,

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,860
depending on which country you’re living
in.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,300
Because the Chinese military is catching up
fast.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,680
So get ready to have your hopes for a peaceful
world dashed,

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,890
as we bring you 5 deadly Chinese military
aircraft.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,370
Number 5: the Harbin Z-19 Chinese attack helicopter

16
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,900
With a top speed of 174 miles per hour,

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,420
it may not be fast, but it sure is furious.

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,239
The Z-19 started life as a French helicopter

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,549
for search and rescue and MEDIVAC.

20
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:09,590
It was built under license by China’s

21
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,759
Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation.

22
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,100
But then they added armor plating,

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,469
a bunch of guns,

24
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,289
a mean-looking paint-job and voila!

25
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:23,749
One terrifying Harbin Z-19 copter ready for
battle.

26
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,920
The base model includes air-to-ground guided
missiles

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,649
and rocket projectiles.

28
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:32,109
And it packs a special surprise.

29
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:35,380
“The crash-proof seats are equipped with
bulletproof armor.

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,040
The oil tank is also crash proof

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,999
and designed to seal itself off once attacked.”

32
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,979
Wait, so if you shoot at it, the gas tank
shuts off

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,329
and...what...the helicopter falls out of the
sky?

34
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,990
What do you do?

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,810
“These helicopters are designed to be exported
to other countries.”

36
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,619
Oh I get it!

37
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,469
Sell copters that fall out of the sky to rival
countries.

38
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,299
Now that’s a clever way to win a war!

39
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,899
Anyway, all I can say is,

40
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:04,939
before you buy,

41
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,310
get that fuel tank cutoff thing checked out.

42
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,490
Number 4: The J-15 Flying Shark

43
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,050
While the Z-19 is a licensed copy of a French
helicopter,

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,670
the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark is a totally
unlicensed

45
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,660
knockoff of the Russian SU-33.

46
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,570
The Russians say China stole their design,

47
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,600
and were so upset that they broke off talks
to sell

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,000
dozens of the SU-33 aircraft to the Chinese
Air Force.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
And you know your relationship is on the rocks
when

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,450
even the Russians refuse to sell weapons to
you.

51
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,500
Chinese designers of the Flying Shark say

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,350
any similarity is totally a coincidence.

53
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,630
And they’re quick to point out

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,050
the Flying Shark is way better—

55
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,770
it’s a lot faster,

56
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,100
has longer range,

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,230
and can fly higher.

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,900
The J-15 is what’s called an air superiority
fighter jet.

59
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,740
It’s designed for air-to-air combat.

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,320
Plus it’s great at taking off and landing
from an aircraft carrier.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,870
And China is the proud owner of...

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,090
one single fully operational carrier—

63
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,860
called the Liaoning.

64
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,010
So now you know where to find the entire fleet

65
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,050
of two dozen Flying Sharks.

66
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,330
Yes, all in one convenient location.

67
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,540
Number 3: The Chengdu J-10

68
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,970
Now China might have only one working aircraft
carrier,

69
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,660
but you know what they’ve got lots of?

70
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,980
Vigorous Dragons!

71
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,130
Yup, that’s the code name for the Chengdu
J-10.

72
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,960
The Chinese military has about 240 of them
in service.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,320
And while in this dragon looks more sleepy
than vigorous…

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,300
…don’t be fooled.

75
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,440
According to Military Today,

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,930
this is the first Chinese-developed combat
fighter

77
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,040
that approaches Western fighters in terms
of

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,630
performance and capability.

79
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,430
It’s got cannons, air-to-air missiles,

80
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,260
laser-guided bombs,

81
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,180
free-fall bombs and rockets.

82
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,220
But you wouldn’t get that

83
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,160
from any Chinese air show.

84
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,650
No, the whole project was so secret

85
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,650
that the first photos of the J-10 didn’t
come out

86
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,250
until 3 years after its maiden flight in 1998.

87
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,340
But there was not so much secrecy

88
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,590
with the J-10’s more recent successor,

89
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,410
which brings us to...

90
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,660
Number 2: The J-11 warplane

91
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,500
There are plenty selfies on Chinese social
media of pilots

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,680
in their knockoff Russian fighter planes.

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
And with each one,

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,650
China gets another black mark

95
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,160
in the books of Russian arms dealers.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,660
According to the National Interest,

97
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,970
China started out by making a fully authorized
copy

98
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,310
of Russia’s top-shelf Sukhoi SU-27 multirole
fighter,

99
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,590
the plane that challenged the legendary twin-engine
F-15.

100
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,380
But then China ducked out of their contract
with Russia,

101
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,140
reverse-engineered the Sukhoi SU-27,

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,030
and made their own souped up version.

103
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,500
They call it the J-11.

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,160
Then a whole alphabet soup of J-11’s followed,

105
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,480
like the J-11B, the J-11D and the J-11BS.

106
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,690
I’m not making that last one up.

107
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,919
Anyway, the J-11-based aircraft

108
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,800
are the spearhead of the Chinese regime’s
efforts

109
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,830
to make long-range fighters

110
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,730
that can contest the seas around China.

111
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,870
And that brings us to...

112
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,580
Number 1: The J-20 stealth multipurpose fighter

113
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,120
The J-20 stealth, according to state-run media,

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,400
is China’s most advanced stealth fighter.

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,620
Well, technically, with its massive fuel tanks,

116
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,790
it’s more of a long-range interceptor.

117
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,380
So while it would probably lose

118
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,430
in a Top Gun-style dogfight

119
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,520
against a US F-22 or F-35 stealth fighter,

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,470
it’s perfect for attacking defenseless stratotankers—

121
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,340
the aerial fuelling stations that those smaller,

122
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,690
scrappier fighter jets are pretty much dependent
on.

123
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,790
China’s air force recently declared the
newest generation

124
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,870
of the J-20 to be combat-ready.

125
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,400
But designers admit there are

126
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,380
a few wrinkles left to iron out—

127
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,490
like engine reliability, control system,

128
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,650
stealth coat, hull materials and infrared
sensor…

129
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,490
Wait, those seem like...kind of big problems.

130
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,720
Um...let’s just take the state-run media’s
word for it.

131
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,230
The J-20 is really, really deadly.

132
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,760
Now all these dangerous Chinese planes in
the sky

133
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,720
can only mean one thing—

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,950
way more people believing in chemtrails.

135
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,480
And, if you believe experts like historian
Alfred McCoy,

136
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,960
who writes about challenges to US global power…

137
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,540
...thanks in part to high tech aircraft,

138
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,389
China could soon become the world’s

139
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,810
biggest military superpower.

140
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,770
And now it’s time for a fan question

141
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,550
from one of our supporters on Patreon.

142
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,260
Roberto Miglioli asks:
“Chris, how far is China willing to go

143
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,740
regarding the South China Sea standoff?

144
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,370
Do you think China will go to war to secure
that area?”

145
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,449
I think the better question is,

146
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,880
would any country go to war

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,630
to stop the Chinese Communist Party?

148
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,900
Because short of that,

149
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,990
nothing is stopping the Communist Party

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,270
in the South China Sea.

151
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,419
Despite neighboring countries

152
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,990
and even an international court

153
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,620
telling them not to,

154
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,930
the Communist Party built up fake islands

155
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,980
in disputed territorial waters.

156
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,440
And even though Chinese leader Xi Jinping

157
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,669
promised China wouldn’t militarize those
islands,

158
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:46,530
they’ve put missile launchers

159
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,730
and even recently landed a long range bomber,

160
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,290
in those disputed territorial waters.

161
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,400
That means China can now project military
power

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,030
anywhere in Southeast Asia,

163
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,300
and as far away as northern Australia.

164
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,280
So the Party has already all but secured the
area—

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,800
without going to war.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,930
Thanks for your question, Roberto.

167
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,930
And everyone else:

168
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,240
Remember that as a bonus

169
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759

And what do you think about China’s efforts

174
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,460
to fill the skies with Flying Sharks,

175
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,550
Vigorous Dragons,

176
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,300
and other deadly aircraft?
