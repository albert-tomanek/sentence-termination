00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,070
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,800
Bathing in the purple rain?

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,260
Sounds like Beijing pollution has gotten really
bad.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,020
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,949
Unless you’ve been living in a cave,

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,990
you know that the artist known as,

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,669
then formerly known as,

8
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:23,189
then once again known as Prince,

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,329
was found dead at his estate on April 21.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,960
Last Thursday, the coroner’s report revealed
the cause of death:

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,119
an overdose of fentanyl.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,600
What is fentanyl?

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,050
“It’s the strongest opiate based painkiller
on the market.

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,719
It is 50-100 times stronger than morphine

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,730
and 25 times to 50 times stronger than heroin.”

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,410
“It can go by the street name China White,
or China Girl.”

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,579
China Girl?

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,800
Now we’re dragging David Bowie into this?

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,100
Yeah, this year sucked.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,680
Now we don’t know how Prince got his fentanyl,

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,750
whether it was prescribed by a doctor or he
got it some other way.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,290
But fentanyl is a big problem in the United
States.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,880
According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration,

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,580
fentanyl was involved in 14% of drug overdose
deaths in 2014,

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,259
and it's getting worse.

26
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,729
In other words, fentanyl is killing more people
than heroin in some parts of the country.

27
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,659
And a lot of it comes from China.

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,199
In fact, buying it is as easy as doing an
online search for “buy fentanyl.”

29
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:38,199
Don't do that.

30
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,829
And it’s not just fentanyl.

31
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,719
Dangerous synthetic drugs of all sorts are
flooding into the United States from China.

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,130
China supplies the raw materials

33
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,090
and drug dealers create the finished product.

34
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,430
With fentanyl, dealers often “cut” it
with other drugs

35
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,950
that means they add a bit of it to a drug
like heroin.

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,619
Or they make pills that look like more expensive
drugs, like oxycontin.

37
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,909
Users may not know this

38
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:03,960
if they’re buying it off the streets.

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,079
And the big problem is,

40
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,729
it’s 50 times stronger than heroin,

41
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,399
so that makes it super easy to overdose.

42
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,750
Recently, US Senator Pat Toomey called on
the Obama Administration

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,110
to pressure the Chinese regime into stopping
exports on fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,849
A reasonable request if you assume Chinese
labs

45
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,449
were somehow unwittingly supplying perfectly
legal compounds that got misused down the line.

46
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,730
I mean, who could predict that some guy ordering
raw fentanyl, and a pill press,

47
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,629
might use it to make illegal drugs?

48
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:40,370
And the Chinese regime has taken action in
the past.

49
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,620
Last year, it made it illegal to export a
type of fentanyl called acetyl fentanyl.

50
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,280
In fact, the Chinese government has technically
banned the export of over 100 different synthetic drugs

51
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,200
But then…

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,010
Chinese labs just changed the recipe to make
a new type of fentanyl,

53
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,680
one that wasn't on the US’s controlled substances
list yet.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,920
So what can the Chinese regime do to stop
the influx of synthetic drugs

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,980
that are killing Americans?

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,390
I guess the question is whether that’s something
they want to stop.

57
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,819
Senator Toomey found out that apparently,

58
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,400
the Chinese law enforcement officials can’t
prosecute labs for shipping these drugs.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,510
Think about that.

60
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,420
The Chinese regime can detain people for remembering
the Tiananmen Square Massacre,

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,110
but not for shipping potentially deadly compounds?

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,720
You really think they couldn’t crack down
on labs if they wanted to?

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,170
Maybe, they don’t.

64
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,640
In 2014, a U.S. Army Special Operations Command
report

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,930
discusses the reality of the “unconventional
warfare” China is waging on the United States.

66
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,120
It quotes a top Chinese colonel Qiao Liang
as saying,

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,140
“the first rule of unrestricted warfare
is that there are no rules, with nothing forbidden.”

68
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,040
Part of that includes “drug warfare.”

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
National security analyst Joseph D. Douglass
wrote a book called Red Cocaine.

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,689
In it, he writes communist regimes,

71
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,750
“have been using narcotics for several decades

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,769
as a decisive weapon in the ongoing low-level
warfare

73
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,860
they are waging against Western civilization.”

74
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,510
According to the DEA,

75
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,510
90% of meth in the US is made by Mexican cartels.

76
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,820
But they get 80% of their ingredients from
China.

77
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,470
By the way, according to this report by the
Department of Justice,

78
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,820
the main source of illegal firearms in Mexico
is also China.

79
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,150
So maybe the Chinese regime knows exactly
what’s going on

80
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,000
and maybe that’s why they’ve done so little
to stem the flow of synthetic drugs.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,030
In fact, there’s been a big surge

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,480
in the number of new psychoactive drugs in
the last few years

83
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,130
not just fentanyl.

84
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,310
And a lot of them come from China.

85
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,760
So what do you think about about the Chinese

86
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,530
regime’s drug warfare?
