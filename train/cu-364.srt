1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,430
Hong Kong just elected a new leader,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,880
and the winner is…

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,140
Beijing!

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,670
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,120
Things have been a little on edge

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,370
in Hong Kong lately.

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,840
And I’m not talking about David Beckham

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,390
posting a video of his trip in Hong Kong

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,940
and saying he had a good time in “China.”

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,940
I guess it's true what they say.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,660
No one can offend it like Beckham.

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,030
Anyway, even more controversial than David
Beckham,

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,230
is the election of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive,

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,940
which is basically like their governor-slash-mayor-

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,719
slash-leader of the undead.

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,570
That's current chief executive CY Leung.

19
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,980
Clearly a man beloved by the people.

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,050
But moving on to the question

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,199
of who the next chief executive will be:

22
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,510
polls were showing that John Tsang,

23
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,809
Hong Kong’s former financial secretary,

24
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,289
was backed by almost half of adults,

25
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,379
while his closest rival Carrie Lam

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,120
had the support of only just over a quarter.

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,800
But the Chinese regime wanted Carrie Lam!

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,830
So they decided to give her a helping hand.

29
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,630
The top Chinese officials in charge of

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,180
telling the future Chief Executive exactly
what to do,

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,030
made it clear that Lam was their choice

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,280
for the person to tell what to do to.

33
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,880
Fortunately—the most popular candidate won
anyway!

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,320
Haha, in the crazy alternate reality Hong
Kong

35
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:33,100
that has universal suffrage, that is.

36
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,450
But in the real Hong Kong,

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,550
the people don’t actually get to directly
vote

38
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,150
for their Chief Executive.

39
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,220
It’s done through an electoral college-type
system.

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,120
And if you think America’s electoral college

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,240
has a few holes,

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,930
well, Hong Kong’s is one giant crater.

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,930
In Hong Kong,

44
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,990
a city of more than 7 million people,

45
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,160
only 1,200 representatives get to vote

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,790
for Chief Executive.

47
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,060
And get this:

48
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,570
The vast majority of those representatives

49
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,700
are not even elected by the people.

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,040
They’re special interest groups like the
hotel industry,

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,049
or the transportation industry,

52
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,590
plus a healthy dose of representatives

53
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,099
from the mainland Chinese government.

54
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,480
There are historical reasons for this structure:

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,890
namely, Great Britain.

56
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,319
But it was supposed to be reformed.

57
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,790
Back in 2007—

58
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,090
so long ago that the 1st generation iPhone

59
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,340
was the hottest thing on the market—

60
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,269
the Hong Kong government was like:

61
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:31,370
“Hey, we wanna have direct elections

62
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,330
for our Chief Executive in 2012.

63
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,690
One person, one vote.”

64
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,109
And in December that year,

65
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:39,739
the National People’s Congress—

66
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,739
a.k.a. the Chinese government—

67
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,120
tentatively agreed.

68
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,099
But they wanted to push the goalposts

69
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,870
back to 2017.

70
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,870
Because you know,

71
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,760
elections are really complicated and this
sort of thing

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,750
takes 10 years of careful planning or whatever.

73
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,099
But in 2014,

74
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,069
the National People’s Congress realized

75
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,909
their distant goalposts were actually getting
close.

76
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:05,349
So they changed the rules and announced that

77
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,400
“The Chief Executive shall be a person

78
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,379
who loves the country and loves Hong Kong.”

79
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,670
Which is Party speak for,

80
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,569
“We’ll pick the candidates and then you
can

81
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,609
vote for one of them.”

82
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,879
Which is like your parents taking you to Baskin
Robbins

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,879
and telling you,

84
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,870
“You can have any flavor of ice cream you
want...

85
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,120
as long as it’s Pistachio, Licorice, or
Rum Raisin.”

86
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,849
Seriously, who puts raisins in ice cream?

87
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,319
That announcement was followed by

88
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,450
79 days of mega protests.

89
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,380
Shot on my iPhone 6.

90
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,299
The Hong Kong legislature eventually rejected

91
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,209
Beijing’s our-way-or-the-highway proposal,

92
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,769
but that still left Hong Kong without universal
suffrage.

93
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,359
So by the time 2017 rolled around,

94
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,329
it was still the old system.

95
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,519
Basically, the Communist Party won by proposing

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,519
an alternative so bad that

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
no Hong Kongers wanted it,

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,590
and in the meantime, quietly moving the goalposts
back

99
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,959
as far as possible.

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,299
So by the time I can pick peanut butter chocolate

101
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,390
for Chief Executive,

102
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,760
we’ll probably have iPhone 13’s.

103
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,940
So it comes as no surprise

104
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,560
that in this year’s March 26th Chief Executive
election,

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,700
the candidate who won

106
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,979
was the one Beijing wanted all along.

107
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:21,690
Carrie Lam won with 777 votes.

108
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,539
That’s a two-thirds majority—

109
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,470
despite her only getting around a quarter

110
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,940
of popular support in pre-election polling.

111
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,180
She was a gracious enough winner, though.

112
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,039
She commended the other candidates, saying,

113
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,800
“They ran good campaigns that taught me
a lot.”

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,620
Namely, that you don’t have to be popular

115
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,319
to win a rigged election.

116
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,720
A major student-led political party called
it

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,630
“a nightmare to Hong Kongers.”

118
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,480
Which is ridiculous.

119
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,960
You wake up from nightmares.

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,009
But the new Chief Executive

121
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,820
has promised to heal Hong Kong.

122
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,030
“My priority will be to heal the divide,

123
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,820
and to ease the frustrations,

124
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,380
and to unite our society to move forward.”

125
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,410
And maybe she will.

126
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,410
Who knows?

127
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,370
It’s just that the last candidate backed
by Beijing

128
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,539
was CY Leung.

129
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:17,740
Last December, he announced he would step
down

130
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,940
and not run for reelection for,

131
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,310
you know, “family reasons”—

132
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,400
which is code for:

133
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,581
He’s so unpopular among Hong Kongers

134
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,260
that he basically can’t do his job anymore.

135
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,690
Oh, and he likely pissed someone off

136
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,380
in the Communist Party leadership.

137
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,461
You see, the battle over Hong Kong

138
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:36,400
isn’t just played out in the election

139
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,590
for Chief Executive.

140
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,550
Hong Kong has been a thorny problem

141
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,160
for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

142
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,759
Within the Party hierarchy,

143
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,770
the guy in charge of Hong Kong affairs

144
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,849
is head of the National People's Congress,

145
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,979
Zhang Dejiang.

146
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,389
And the guy who controls Zhang Dejiang from
behind the scenes

147
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,270
is former Party leader and Xi Jinping's amphibian
archenemy,

148
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,169
Jiang Zemin.

149
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,650
For the last several years,

150
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,949
Zhang Dejiang has seemingly made a pet project

151
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,610
of destabilizing Hong Kong.

152
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,939
After all, if Xi Jinping has to deal with
Hong Kong,

153
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,259
that takes his focus away from

154
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,960
getting rid of his political enemies

155
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,490
with his anti-corruption campaign.

156
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,349
Like I said, Zhang Dejiang is in charge

157
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,610
of the National People's Congress.

158
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,919
The same congress that issued the rules in
2014

159
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,139
about how Hongkongers could only vote

160
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,680
for preselected chief executive candidates.

161
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,120
Which sparked the Umbrella Movement.

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,490
Zhang’s National People’s Congress

163
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,449
also last year issued an “interpretation”

164
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,419
of Hong Kong's constitution

165
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,870
that let them throw out two recently elected

166
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,740
Hong Kong pro-democracy legislators.

167
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,970
A move guaranteed to put the city on edge.

168
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,650
So since Zhang Dejiang wanted Carrie Lam,

169
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,039
was her win a loss for Xi Jiping?

170
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,229
Not necessarily.

171
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,630
That’s because Xi Jinping already won his
battle

172
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,330
over Hong Kong’s Chief Executive.

173
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,960
The one who’s about to step down,

174
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,810
CY Leung—the guy reviled throughout Hong
Kong

175
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,889
for ordering police to use tear gas

176
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,430
against student protesters in the Umbrella
Movement—

177
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,290
was also in the Jiang Zemin camp.

178
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,840
Everyone expected him to run for re-election.

179
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
And let’s face it,

180
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
if he had,

181
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,390
he’d have won.

182
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,210
But according to what an inside source

183
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,240
told the South China Morning Post,

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,580
Zhang Dejiang “had recommended to the Communist
Party’s

185
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,139
Politburo Standing Committee

186
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,300
that the central government

187
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,770
should support Leung’s re-election,

188
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,229
but this was rejected by Xi.”

189
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,120
And then Leung “shocked” everyone

190
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,750
by saying he wouldn’t run for reelection.

191
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,670
Interesting.

192
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
As for the election,

193
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,889
a source close to the Xi leadership told the
Epoch Times

194
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,539
that Xi had “no preferred candidate,”

195
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:53,930
but was only concerned that,

196
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,560
“Hong Kong must remain stable.”

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,199
Which seems to me to suggest

198
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,789
Xi is choosing to pick his battles,

199
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,580
and whoever is Hong Kong’s Chief Executive

200
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,069
isn’t a big concern from him

201
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,729
now that he’s ousted CY Leung.

202
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,050
So what will happen in Hong Kong

203
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,050
under Carrie Lam?

204
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,900
Well, it’s pretty clear now that Hong Kong’s
Chief Executive

205
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,789
doesn’t have much real power.

206
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:16,340
She’ll probably just follow Beijing.

207
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,020
And what Beijing orders will depend on

208
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,289
whichever side wins the power struggle.

209
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:22,870
So what do you think about Carrie Lam’s
victory

210
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,870
in Hong Kong?
