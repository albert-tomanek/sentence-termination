00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,780
A secret coronavirus experiment

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,690
At the Wuhan Institute of Virology

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:15,119
Has been scrubbed from the internet

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:31,249
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,391
The coronavirus pandemic has been a disaster.

6
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:38,250
I don’t even think we fully grasp how much
damage it’s caused yet.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,800
But we’ve only just begun to uncover the
crazy story of the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,680
the biolab some think leaked the virus that
sparked the pandemic.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,660
And now, new information has come out about
a secret experiment that began at the lab,

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:04,290
at the start of 2019, just a few months before
the first reported cases of Covid in China.

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,700
Joining us today is Jack Posobiec, senior
editor of Human Events.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,080
Thanks for joining us.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,900
Hey, really excited to finally be on, man.

14
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,900
Yeah.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,200
So Human Events recently covered the story
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,010
experiments with transgenic mice.

17
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,700
That is mice that for instance, have been
genetically altered to have human DNA.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,320
Scientists have been doing that since the
'80s, but you discovered something new that

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,960
is a little bit disturbing.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
What is it?

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Right?

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Right.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,690
And so this is something where the Wuhan Institute
themselves who have come under so much scrutiny

24
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,860
and the United States side, which has been
partnered with the Wuhan Institute has also

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,030
been completely non forthcoming about where.

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,500
We know there have been instances in the past
of research and experiments that were going

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,960
on, where the study were being conducted of
gain of function experiments.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,650
What we're now seeing that we've uncovered
is that there was a project that had received

29
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,430
approval and funding all the way back in 2018.

30
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:14,439
We found this on archive document from the
Chinese academic, The Medical Journal of Science,

31
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,069
where they stated that in January of 2019,
a new study was going to begin.

32
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,190
And I want to be very clear about that timeline.

33
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:28,519
It was supposed to run January of '19 through
December of 2021.

34
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,469
That is the timeline that we're given on this
approval document for the pathogenicity.

35
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:41,519
So that is essentially how pathogenic, how
transferable, how transmissible, how infectious

36
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,920
are these new bat coronaviruses in transgenic
mice.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,249
These are mice that have been humanized with
human ACE2 receptors in their lungs.

38
00:02:54,249 --> 00:03:00,200
So essentially they have the same type of
ACE2 receptors in their lungs of these mice

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,159
that humans have as well.

40
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:09,879
And whether or not spike proteins from these
bad Corona viruses can infect these mice.

41
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,069
This is the same type of stuff that people
were talking about in the past that could

42
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:22,310
lead to the risk of an outbreak of a pandemic
because we knew, and they knew that the pathogenicity

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,879
of this was very high, the transmissibility
of this was very high and that you were directly

44
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:35,209
essentially creating, enhancing these viruses
through gain of function experiments so that

45
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,239
they would be infectious to humans because
in the past it wasn't working because they

46
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,650
couldn't find ones that would infect the mice,
they couldn't find ones where the spike proteins

47
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,709
fit.

48
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,650
That's why they humanized the mice in the
first place.

49
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,120
And so the fact that this study was scheduled
to begin January, 2019.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,109
And again, the information on it is very sketchy
because it has been completely scrubbed from

51
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:04,329
the Wuhan Institute's website, the database
is completely down.

52
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:10,030
There's no information in terms of where these
people are now, whether that researcher is

53
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,030
still involved.

54
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,900
Though the one thing that we've been able
to find that I was going to kind of looking

55
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,340
at it through another way, I was following
the mice.

56
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,610
I said, I wonder if the mice are still around.

57
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:25,340
It looks like they were actually also conducting
experiments later on in 2020 of the Wuhan

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,570
Corona virus so that SARS COVID-2 virus on
the very same humanized mice that they had

59
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,080
there at the lab.

60
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,050
So the question is that we don't really know
for sure how many of these live animals are

61
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,540
still at the lab or we're at the lab throughout
2020.

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,350
But what we do know is that this was scheduled
to run through 2021.

63
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,860
We have no more information about it, we don't
know if it's still going on, we don't know

64
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,000
if it was going on at beginning, but we do
know is that they don't want anyone talking

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
about it.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,840
It's a very interesting timeline.

67
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,100
So what do you think of the lab leak hypothesis?

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:09,440
Well, so I think the lab leak hypothesis is
likely for a variety of reasons.

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,870
Number one, because we now know that they
were conducting these enhancement experiments

70
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,380
at the Wuhan Institute.

71
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
And that's just it.

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,980
It's not only a lab leak, it is an enhancement
through gain of function of many of these

73
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:29,520
viruses by parading them through these different
species, whether it be the civets, whether

74
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,260
it be farotts or other mammals or these mice,
these humanized mice.

75
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,010
So they are the ones who are creating these
chimeric viruses.

76
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,750
And we've seen in the past that they have
created chimeric virus strains with the insertion

77
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,340
of these spike proteins and then combine them
with the humanized mice to see what would

78
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
happen.

79
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,060
We can see that going as far back as 2015,
we can see it in 2016, 2017, even as far back

80
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,250
as 2007 at this lab.

81
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,290
These risky experiments were going on in the
Wuhan Institute.

82
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,560
People like Dr. Fauci knew, Francis Collins,
the head of NIH knew, Peter Daszak, who was

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,060
their cutout at EcoHealth Alliance, knew about
this.

84
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,760
And all of the researchers in the Wuhan Institute,
they should have told us from the very start

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,640
what was going on.

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:26,930
And they use as a sort of endorsement and
a justification for this, this line that,

87
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,970
well, if we're conducting these experiments,
the risk outweighs the benefit.

88
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,170
And why does the risk outweigh the benefit?

89
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,880
Because we will have the tools to prevent
the next pandemic from happening.

90
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Well, here's the problem-

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,150
What do you mean, the benefit outweighs the
risk?

92
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,150
Right.

93
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,150
Exactly.

94
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,150
Yeah.

95
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,190
The benefit outweighs the risk because we
can prevent the next pandemic.

96
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,200
But that didn't happen.

97
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,630
The next pandemic is what happened and nobody
prevented it.

98
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,440
The tools weren't there, the playbook wasn't
there.

99
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,760
And in fact, it was the Wuhan Institute that
was at the heart of so many.

100
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,330
And now we're learning through the intelligence,
through information that we're getting out,

101
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,780
that these outbreaks are happening and it
wasn't going on in the wet market because

102
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,480
those early data points that we were getting,
yes, some people had been to the wet market,

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,300
it was a popular place to buy food, but not
everybody in those early infections had any

104
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,390
tie whatsoever to the wet market.

105
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,120
And that is why that story fell apart and
we later learned that that was a propaganda

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,640
narrative spread by the Chinese government.

107
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,560
Why did they spread that propaganda in the
first place?

108
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,860
So it doesn't make sense to me that the CCP
would purposefully release the virus they

109
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,860
can't control.

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,010
But it does seem like they took full advantage
of the situation.

111
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,060
What do you think?

112
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,460
That's pretty much where my thinking is on
this as well, is that once this came out,

113
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,240
the CCP, the Politburo there, Xi Jinping,
and the rest, Li Keqiang, they're looking

114
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,740
at the whole situation and saying, you know
what, if we can spin this in such a way where

115
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,681
it is not a China problem, but it becomes
a world problem, then we can position the

116
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:09,470
CCP, we can position China as not the bad
guy, not villain in the story.

117
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,020
We can position ourselves as the savior.

118
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,620
We can be the ones that save the world from
the virus, regardless of what it does to the

119
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,710
economic structures, the weakening it's going
to conduct to Western Europe and the United

120
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,401
States, the military issues that are going
to happen, not only throughout the west, but

121
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:33,130
also throughout Asia in terms of this pandemic
and this illness spreading throughout so many

122
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,110
of China's rivals.

123
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:41,740
They realize that they don't want to be the
ones to have to bear the full cost of this

124
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,140
thing and the full brunt of this thing.

125
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,839
And so they say, we can use this to our advantage
and Xi Jinping when he gave his speech at

126
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,290
the Tiananmen Square Gate, right at the same
place where Chairman Mao stood and so many

127
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:01,420
other leaders stood, he specifically said
that China did the best to rid the world of

128
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,420
the virus.

129
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,569
And now after 100 years of the CCP, he's saying
that China is leading the world and not any

130
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,959
other country.

131
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,730
Well, the coronavirus pandemic certainly raises
a whole lot of questions, but one of them

132
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,040
that comes to my mind is about what kind of
scientific experiments are being done behind

133
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,180
closed doors in an authoritarian regime that
does not value transparency?

134
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,430
What else do you think could be happening
behind the scenes?

135
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:36,680
Look, we've also done reporting at Human Events
where not only is this a question that's being

136
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,300
raised on podcasts and publications like our
own, but also from WikiLeaks.

137
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,459
We have a state department cable that was
written by Hillary Clinton in her office when

138
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,790
she was secretary of state, going back to
the founding of the Wuhan Institute of virology

139
00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:00,660
as a BSL, Biosafety Level Four facility in
Wuhan, that was set up in partnership with

140
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,050
the French government.

141
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,430
So it's Hilary going to the French and saying,
what are you doing to make sure that this

142
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,320
is not part of a bioweapons program with the
PLA, the Chinese military?

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,569
Because we know that everything that they
have set up in that laboratory is the exact

144
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:25,629
same types of functions, the exact same types
of capabilities that they would need to produce

145
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:27,009
bio weapons.

146
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,499
So this is not a question by the way.

147
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:35,920
And they try to say that, oh, you bring it
up now, you’re tinfoil, that's a crazy thing,

148
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,850
who would ever suggest such a thing, couldn't
possibly be what was going on.

149
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,850
No.

150
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,759
State department, Hillary Clinton, their own
cable says they were worried that this could

151
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,860
be tied to a bioweapons program.

152
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,189
We also know of course that the Wuhan Institute
and the Chinese Academy of Science have ties

153
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:59,029
to the PLA, they've got multiple military
researchers, military scientists that are

154
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,910
working hand in hand there, they're stationed
there.

155
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,110
We know that a general was sent to the Wuhan
Institute of Virology pretty early on after

156
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,230
China came clean about the fact that there
was a pandemic whatsoever.

157
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,139
So we can see these ties between the military
and the Institute as well.

158
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:20,069
And so when you're asking about what type
of classified programs could be going in there,

159
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:23,610
I would simply have to refer you back to Hillary
Clinton.

160
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,990
So obviously the big shocker in all of this
is how much the US may have been involved

161
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,752
in the coronavirus pandemic, origin, research,
whatever you want to call it.

162
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:35,839
Do you think this pandemic has taught us anything?

163
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,709
Do you think this will change how the US elites
work with China?

164
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:48,910
So I have an op-ed coming out pretty soon
here at humanevents.com, talking about how

165
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,069
the history of the relationship between the
US and the west and China is written, has

166
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,790
to be taken on through a new lens.

167
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,959
Because when we first started our engagement
with China in the 1970s and through the cold

168
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,529
war, and then started the economic relationship
that really ramped up in the aftermath of

169
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:13,170
Tiananmen Square, going back to 1992, when
this new trade agreement was signed.

170
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,569
There was this idea that exposure to the west
and exposure to foreign direct investment

171
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:23,809
would liberalize China and seek to speed up
the rise of political reforms and human rights

172
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,649
in China.

173
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:29,069
What we've seen though has been the exact
opposite.

174
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,879
The CCP is the 1% of China.

175
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,720
They're the elite of China.

176
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,439
The 1% in the West, they haven't been the
ones teaching to CCP about human rights and

177
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,439
civil liberties.

178
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,190
No, no, no, it's been the other way around.

179
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:51,100
The CCP has taught our 1% authoritarianism
and the power, the intoxicating power that

180
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,439
you are given when you have total control
over a population, when you can make them

181
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:03,480
pliable consumers for your goods and for your
products, you could become richer, you become

182
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,029
more powerful, you can attain this God complex
over the people that you rule and then you're

183
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:16,399
instituting a type of neo-feudalism rather
than becoming this type of opening up and

184
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,300
liberalization the way that we were told in
the past from Deng Xiaoping and the way that

185
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,990
we were told in the West.

186
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:30,230
Now, this has been a marriage, where the CCP
is influencing the 1% in the west and they

187
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,899
become more authoritarian, they become more
controlling, and that is what they want.

188
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,559
They want total ownership, total control of
society.

189
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,170
That's where it's all coming from.

190
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,379
Well, definitely put a link to that op-ed
in the description below.

191
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,160
Jack, thanks for joining us today.

192
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,139
It was great to hear about this story.

193
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:49,139
Really appreciate it.

194
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,279
And thanks so much for having me on, I love
all the work that you guys do on China Censored.

195
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,600
Thanks Jack, I appreciate that.

196
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,470
And thank you for watching.

197
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,279
We also interviewed Jack Posobiec this week
on the China Unscripted Podcast.

198
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,850
On the hour long podcast, we covered everything
from the coronavirus to how US elite love

199
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,959
the Chinese Communist Party.

200
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,790
It’s fascinating, be sure to check it out.

201
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,790
Link is below.

202
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:32,339
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, thanks for
watching China Uncensored.
