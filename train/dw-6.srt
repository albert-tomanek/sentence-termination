1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Well an atom's made of protons, neutrons, and electrons

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,500
the first two in the nucleus, the third around it

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
it's mostly empty space, but it feels solid in any case

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
The elements are all the different types of atoms

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,600
they differ by the number of protons in the middle.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,000
Hydrogen has only one,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,400
but Uranium has a ton

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's just chemistry 

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that you and me

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,500
are made of these atoms

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,700
Well atoms bond together to form molecules

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,600
Most of what's surrounding me and you

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Water, sugar, things yet undreamed of of of of

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,500
Look around you, see the combinations in a eucalypt tree

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Mendeleev's periodicity

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,400
gives us sand and water and the air above ove ove ove ove

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,600
It's just chemistry

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
that you and me

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,500
are made of these atoms:

20
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,600
Hydrogen, Ox-y-gen, Carbon, Nitrogen,

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,600
make up the world's life forms

22
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Do do do you, do do do do

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
but do you wonder how

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,500
matter forms something strange

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,000
when there's a chemical change?

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Where did these atoms come from? They were fused in stars

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Light elements combine releasing light from afar

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Fusion in the sun,

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,600
creates Helium

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,500
I guess what I be saying is you gotta use your reason

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,600
To open up your mind and see the cause of the seasons

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,500
How do we know what's true?

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
The scientific method shows you

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
It's just chemistry

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,800
that you and me

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,500
are made of these atoms

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Atoms bond together to form molecules

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,600
Most of what's surrounding me and you

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Water, sugar, sand and you'll find things undreamed of

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Argon, Neon, Xenon

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,800
There's no need to overstate

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
'Cause we are of course

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,000
This, of this, of this, we're made: atoms
