1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,200
A massive skyscraper shakes

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,410
Bitcoin prices plummet

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,030
And China expands its nuclear arsenal

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,040
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,650
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,100
And these are this week’s China news headlines

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,710
The Chinese Communist Party has prided itself
on how it’s transformed China into a land

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,740
of glittery skyscrapers.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,230
The problem is all those skyscrapers are made
in China.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:42,129
This video shows people in Shenzhen fleeing
in panic as a skyscraper, almost 1000 feet

11
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:48,660
tall, starts wobbling and swaying, even though
there was no earthquake or bad weather.

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,269
People inside the building were evacuated,
and an investigation is ongoing into—why

13
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:59,329
a giant skyscraper just randomly started wobbling.

14
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:04,470
But experts “found no safety abnormalities
in the main structure and surrounding environment

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,470
of the building”.

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,660
Other than the fact the building wobbles!

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,650
These have been a bad couple of weeks for
the public image of Chinese construction.

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,710
Last week, a man was left dangling from one
of China’s infamous glass bridges, after

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,860
the glass shattered in strong wind.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,020
There’s a big problem in China of construction
corruption.

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,450
Officials or contractors often siphon money
from construction, during each phase of the

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,710
project.

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,170
So the end result can be dangerously unstable
buildings.

24
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:45,170
It’s such a common problem, Chinese people
have a name for it—Tofu Dreg Construction.

25
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,040
Because it’s like the buildings are made
of the scraps left behind from making tofu.

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,700
That’s right, not even tofu.

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,110
Tofu scraps.

28
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,930
So in a way, it's appropriate that a Titanic
replica is now under construction in China.

29
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,940
If that falls apart, it’s just being historically
accurate.

30
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,479
Speaking of things collapsing—the price
of Bitcoin.

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,250
We partly have a Chinese government crackdown
to thank.

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,480
Chinese authorities said the crypto market
was too volatile so restricted trading, which

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,700
caused a volatile drop in the price of crypto,
including BitCoin.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,630
But if you’ve lost a bunch of money, don’t
worry, China is helping out.

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,200
With over half a million dollars in counterfeit
currency.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,700
This is one of the tactics of the Chinese
Communist Party’s economic warfare against

37
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,330
the US.

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,080
China is flooding the US with fake goods.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,170
In 2019, Customs and Border Patrol made almost
28,000 seizures.

40
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,350
Those goods would have been worth $1.5 billion
dollars if they were genuine.

41
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,460
And almost half of those fake goods came from
China.

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,480
So considering the economic warfare China
is waging against the US, you’ll probably

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,780
be wanting to invest in Chinese stocks with
ties to the Chinese military.

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,849
Well fear not, a Trump era ban on doing just
that has been postponed!

45
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:14,270
But you’d better move quick.

46
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,650
You only have until June 11.

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,970
Buy now!

48
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:25,160
A former American university professor has
been sentenced to 37 months in prison for

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,690
lying on grant applications.

50
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,739
He was trying to get millions of dollars in
federal grant money to do research in China.

51
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:39,890
As part of his sentence, he was also “ordered
to pay more than $3.4 million in restitution

52
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,070
to the National Institute of Health and approximately
$413,000 to The Ohio State University.”

53
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,550
If he’s having a hard time raising the money,
maybe he could invest in Dogecoin?

54
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:57,120
And after the break, the US may be falling
behind China on science.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,099
But there’s a plan to change that.

56
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,569
Welcome back.

57
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,239
Some fear the US is falling behind China in
the sciences.

58
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,810
So the Senate is considering a $120 billion
dollar investment to counter China.

59
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,260
It’s a bipartisan bill.

60
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,239
It is led by Democratic Senate Majority leader
Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator Todd

61
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,470
Young.

62
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,350
You see, the US kind of realized the problem
of having China dominate things like the medical

63
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,430
equipment supply chain when the coronavirus
hit.

64
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,570
China is rapidly expanding its nuclear weapons
arsenal.

65
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,060
That’s a concern for the US and Russia—who
have a regular nuclear dialogue to make sure

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,240
things don’t go Duke Nukem.

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,720
However, China doesn’t seem to be willing
to join these nuclear arms talks.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,440
According to U.S. disarmament Ambassador Robert
Wood “Despite the PRC’s dramatic build-up

69
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,910
of its nuclear arsenal, unfortunately it continues
to resist discussing nuclear risk reduction

70
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,410
bilaterally with the United States.”

71
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,750
But as world-ending catastrophes go, China
is willing to work with the US on climate

72
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,430
change.

73
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,780
Working to fight climate change can actually
be good for business.

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,840
Especially the business of ethnic slave labor.

75
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,500
A new report this week found China is using
Uyghur forced labor to make parts for solar

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,850
panels.

77
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,190
And China makes about 70% of the world’s
solar panels.

78
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:32,680
The Chinese Communist Party has been in propaganda
overdrive to cover up their genocide of the

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,419
I talked about that in a previous episode.

81
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,790
One of the Party’s propaganda tools is releasing
videos from Uyghurs.

82
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,970
“Chinese state media have published dozens
of the videos praising the Communist Party

83
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:52,780
and showing Uyghurs angrily denouncing former
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for declaring

84
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,250
a genocide in the far west Xinjiang region.”

85
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,270
The Party has been claiming that people made
these videos totally spontaneously and out

86
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,180
of their own free will.

87
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,460
Because they’re just so, so angry at Mike
Pompeo.

88
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,509
But in a very shocking twist, it turns out
the Chinese regime ordered Uyghurs to make

89
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,510
these videos.

90
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,150
The Associated Press obtained a screenshot
of a text message sent to government officials

91
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,460
in Xinjiang, telling them to find Uyghurs
to make these videos.

92
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,479
And the text even spelled out what these Uyghurs
should say in their totally spontaneous videos:

93
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,370
“Express a clear position on Pompeo’s
remarks, for example: I firmly oppose Pompeo’s

94
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,080
anti-Chinese remarks, and I am very angry
about them...Express your feelings of loving

95
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,180
the party, the country and Xinjiang (I am
Chinese, I love my motherland, I am happy

96
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,120
at work and in life, and so on).”

97
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Very convincing.

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,600
You know, after years of bending Hollywood
to its will, you’d think the Communist Party

99
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,330
could get some better screenwriters.

100
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,860
Unfortunately, the man who leaked this government
text to the AP has now been detained for “instigating

101
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
splittism”.

102
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,850
At least until he makes a video about how
much he loves the Chinese Communist Party.

103
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,230
Totally spontaneously and out of his own free
will.

104
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,039
The genocide of Uyghur Muslims in China is
part of the reason there’s a growing call

105
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,580
for a Boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympic
games.

106
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,889
This week, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
joined that call.

107
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,810
Specifically she’s calling for a diplomatic
boycott.

108
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,180
That’s where individual athletes would be
allowed to go and compete.

109
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,440
But US officials would not attend the games.

110
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,259
There’s a new job in China—organ donation
coordinators.

111
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,100
You see, China has been rapidly expanding
its organ transplant industry.

112
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,160
Lots of money to be made there.

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,080
Most of those organs come from religious and
ethnic minorities, like Falun Gong practitioners

114
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,110
or Uyghur Muslims, who are killed for their
organs.

115
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,800
China didn’t have any voluntary organ donation
system until 2011.

116
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,430
Unless you count the system where the Party
“volunteered” Uyghurs and Falun Gong.

117
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,060
But even after the Party started a separate
system for people to actually voluntarily

118
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,800
donate their organs, not many people used
it.

119
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,290
So that’s where organ donation coordinators
come in.

120
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:30,350
“Their role is to convince families of dying
patients to agree to donate their loved one’s

121
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,350
organs.”

122
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,010
Except according to a former organ donation
coordinator, that usually means screwing poor

123
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,010
people.

124
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,570
“[He] recounted one case involving a very
poor family.

125
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,760
Their dying family member could still have
been saved with proper medical treatment.

126
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,600
But the family decided not to proceed with
this.

127
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,380
Instead, they chose to starve him—and cash
out.”

128
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,500
Yeah, don’t get an organ transplant in China.

129
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,060
And a Chinese propaganda ploy in Turkey backfired
badly.

130
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,610
China hosted a drawing contest for highschoolers
called China in My Dreams.

131
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,790
Students were supposed to submit artwork that
best described the ties between China and

132
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,790
Turkey.

133
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,110
And boy did they ever.

134
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,140
Here are some examples.

135
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,510
Xi Jinping surrounded by Uyghurs skulls, and
another that shows a man dressed in clothing

136
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,680
made of the PRC flga putting his hand over
a Uyghurs mouth, expressing the idea that

137
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,510
uyghurs have no freedom of speech.

138
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:38,040
Yet other social media users have shared drawings
on various themes: uyghurs hanged by nooses

139
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,640
made from China's flag; uyghurs who were killed
by a sword while china and Turkey carried

140
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,530
on their 'friendship;' and the Chinese state
representatives demolishing mosques, impressioning

141
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,530
uyghurs.

142
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:55,230
I so love it when the Communist Party’s
propaganda initiatives blow up in their face.

143
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,850
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

144
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,330
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party

145
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,170
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

146
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,630
Nikolay asks: “Chris, In a case of war,
what do you think will happen with US companies

147
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,880
that pander to CCP, like YouTube and Twitter?”

148
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,630
Well Nikolay, I’d hate to see an actual
boots on the ground war between the US and

149
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,120
China, but if something like that were to
happen, many Western companies, not just the

150
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
tech companies like YouTube and Twitter, would
be screwed.

151
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,290
In fact, one of the first things the Communist
Party would do is to seize the factories and

152
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,200
assets of any American companies that are
operating inside China.

153
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
Right now, these companies think the China
market means big business and big bucks.

154
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,519
Of course it never works out that way.

155
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,020
But if the American public decided they wouldn’t
give their business to companies with ties

156
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,760
to China, those companies would change how
they do things.

157
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,029
And the great news is it doesn’t need to
take a war for that to happen.

158
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:07,459
Right now, you can start buying from competitors
who don’t invest in China, or boycott companies

159
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,080
that turn a blind eye to the Chinese Communist
Party.

160
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,220
