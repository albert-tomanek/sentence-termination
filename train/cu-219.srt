1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,790
The CCP Coronavirus

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,230
Has changed the world

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,720
Here’s how

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,840
This China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,470
Well folks, we’re all suffering because
of the Chinese Communist Party.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,230
The CCP Coronavirus has turned into a deadly
pandemic

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,500
that has people all over the world cowering
in their homes,

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,680
hoarding toilet paper.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,560
Shelley, how’d you get that photo?

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,990
It’s embarrassing.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,819
I’m not wearing a suit.

12
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:36,989
Anyway, since this is the Chinese Communist
Party’s fault,

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,379
I’ve started calling the coronavirus the
CCP Coronavirus.

14
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,030
I hope you’ll join me in doing the same.

15
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,809
But a picture is worth a thousand words.

16
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:50,639
So I’m about to show you many thousands
of words worth of

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,300
how the CCP Coronavirus has changed the world—

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,400
in a series of photos from before and after
the CCP Coronavirus pandemic.

19
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,360
And now the question is, will life ever be
the same again?

20
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,930
Personally, I hope not.

21
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,640
I hope we all approach the Chinese Communist
Party

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,890
with a good deal more skepticism now

23
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,120
and maybe start manufacturing medical supplies

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,680
inside the United States instead of China.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,310
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

26
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,230
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

27
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,220
stay safe out there.
