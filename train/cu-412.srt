1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,530
It’s been a year of protests,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,820
human rights abuses

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,960
and military madness.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,240
These are the biggest China stories of 2019.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,579
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,140
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,910
2019 has been a big year for China.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,720
The Chinese Communist Party is facing

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,860
unprecedented crises on all sides.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,610
And the rest of the world is finally becoming
aware of

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,260
the threat of the Chinese Communist Party...

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,100
or, at least some of the rest of the world
is.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,710
In other words, it’s been a good year for
China Uncensored.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:45,109
So join me as we take a look back at the 10
biggest China stories of 2019.

15
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,109
Number 10

16
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,579
The Chinese Communist Party celebrated

17
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,449
70 years of bloody rule over China

18
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,340
in the only way they knew how!

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,160
A massive military parade.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,449
But it wasn’t just about terrifying Chinese
people.

21
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,269
It was also about terrifying Americans.

22
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,439
For example, the H-6N Long-Range Bomber.

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,310
It can fire nuclear missiles that can hit
the United States.

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,750
Worst birthday party ever.

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,250
Number 9

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,190
2019 was also the 30th anniversary...of nothing.

27
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,560
Absolutely nothing.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,240
Stop asking questions.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,469
Actually, this was the year of a lot of anniversaries.

30
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,670
Besides the 30-year anniversary of the Tiananmen
Square...

31
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,180
oopsie daisy,

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,670
it was the 60-year anniversary of the Communist
Party’s

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,590
“liberation” of Tibet...

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,860
where they liberated people from their culture,

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,979
their religion, and their lives.

36
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,619
and it was the 20-year anniversary of when
Falun Gong practitioners

37
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,810
went from quietly meditating,

38
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,850
To getting tortured for meditating.

39
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,659
And the 10-year anniversary of a crackdown
on the Uyghurs in Xinjiang

40
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,390
after protests there.

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,421
It seems like the Communist Party

42
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:59,610
constantly needs a new group to persecute.

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,360
Who will win the coveted position in the next
decade?!

44
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,979
Number 8

45
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,679
China’s Belt and Road is expanding.

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,879
No, I’m not talking about Xi Jinping’s
waistline.

47
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,780
I’m talking about China’s allegedly trillion
dollar investment plan,

48
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,650
also known as One Belt, One Road.

49
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,459
Mostly China invests in developing countries,

50
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,290
including lots of authoritarian regimes.

51
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,791
But this year the Chinese Communist Party

52
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,060
made inroads in the West.

53
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,870
Italy joined up.

54
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,150
So did New Zealand.

55
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,960
But will 2020 be the year that these countries
discover

56
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,650
it was all One Belt, One Big Mistake?

57
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,849
Number 7

58
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,130
For decades US companies have been doing business
with China.

59
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,870
This year, they got called out for it.

60
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,980
Big US tech companies have been the backbone

61
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,819
of the Chinese Communist Party’s Orwellian
surveillance state.

62
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,500
Google, Apple, Hewlett Packard, IBM.

63
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,099
You name it.

64
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,349
“Microsoft has worked with a Chinese military-run
university

65
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,760
on artificial intelligence research that could
be used

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,980
for surveillance and censorship.”

67
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,810
Even MIT University was working with a Chinese
company

68
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,379
specializing in AI facial recognition technology.

69
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,760
Thermo Fisher was selling DNA sequencers

70
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,090
directly to Chinese authorities in Xinjiang.

71
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,970
And worst of all, China seized control of
gay dating app Grindr.

72
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,129
But now they have to give it back.

73
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,400
Number 6

74
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,629
The US China trade war enters its second year.

75
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,909
How shall I describe it?

76
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:46,830
"We're having a little spat with China."

77
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,830
Perfect.

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,459
The US has been hitting China with heavy tariffs.

79
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,840
The Chinese Communist Party has been trying
to fight back,

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,719
by putting tariffs on American goods.

81
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,610
And while China can’t hit the US

82
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,159
with nearly as much as the US can hit China
with,

83
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,650
China has targeted American farmers

84
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,730
in the hopes that will swing the 2020 US presidential
elections.

85
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,459
In December, the US and China agreed to

86
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,700
a “Phase One” deal to reduce US tariffs,

87
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,030
and get China to buy agricultural goods.

88
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,139
But something tells me the trade war isn’t
over yet.

89
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,500
What with China’s rampant intellectual property
theft,

90
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,820
state-owned industries, and massive subsidies,

91
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,220
it’s hard to get the Communist Party to
reform everything

92
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,080
it needs to reform to be on a level playing
field with the US.

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,250
Some experts think this is all headed towards

94
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,050
the US economy decoupling from China.

95
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,060
Maybe we’ll have the answer in 2020.

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,120
Number 5

97
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,840
The US doubled down on its fight with Chinese
telecom giant Huawei.

98
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,540
At the beginning of 2019,

99
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,940
the US charged Huawei with violating US sanctions
on Iran.

100
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,990
As well as being in general a national security
threat.

101
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,590
“It provides the capacity to maliciously
modify or steal information,

102
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,050
and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected
espionage.”

103
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,970
Did I mention accusations Huawei is funded
by the Chinese military?

104
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,990
At least according to the CIA.

105
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,280
And I trust the CIA.

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,449
This has served as the driving force for the
US

107
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,460
encouraging countries around the world ditch
Huawei.

108
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,449
There was also a US ban on certain Huawei
products,

109
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:31,000
but it’s been delayed several times,

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,800
now until 2020.

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,430
So it looks like I’ll still have a job next
year.

112
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,950
Number 4

113
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,320
With the trade war and attacks on Chinese
state-backed companies,

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,060
it’s no wonder the Chinese economy isn’t
doing so hot.

115
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,300
The Chinese regime has taken extreme measures
to try to cope.

116
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,220
But a failing economy threatens the Chinese
Communist Party’s

117
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,510
grip on power more than anything else.

118
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,169
The regime has managed to get away with insane
human rights abuses,

119
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:03,610
mass surveillance, and ethnic cleansing by
promising people,

120
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,360
hey, at least you have a shot at making some
money, right?

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,020
When that’s no longer true, watch out.

122
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,360
Number 3

123
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,940
Speaking of human rights abuses,

124
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,229
an international tribunal ruled this year
that yes,

125
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,320
China is killing innocent people for their
organs.

126
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,940
“Some of the more than 1.5 million detainees
in Chinese prison camps a

127
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,449
re being killed for their organs to serve
a booming transplant trade

128
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,380
that is worth some $1 billion a year.”

129
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,610
According to the tribunal, the primary victims
are Falun Gong practitioners.

130
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,910
Falun Gong is a traditional Chinese spiritual
practice,

131
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,389
but the Chinese regime sees Falun Gong as
an ideological threat—

132
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,919
just like anything else that people believe
in.

133
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,660
Like I said earlier, the Party has been

134
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,720
persecuting Falun Gong practitioners since
1999.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,330
That’s 20 years worth of organs.

136
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,270
And now it looks like the Uighurs might become

137
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,830
a big chunk of the unwilling organ “donors”
as well.

138
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,210
Which brings us to...

139
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,560
Number 2

140
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,069
China has built concentration camps to ethnically
cleanse the Uighurs.

141
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,910
Now the Chinese regime says these camps

142
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,980
are actually vocational training schools.

143
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,979
To help teach the mostly Muslim Uighurs

144
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,379
not to be religious extremists.

145
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,289
Which is why leaked internal memos about

146
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,150
these camps say to use the “organs of dictatorship,”

147
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,610
and show “absolutely no mercy.”

148
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,190
But if you ask Chinese authorities,

149
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,509
they’ll show you some Uighurs who seem

150
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,270
very happy with these camps.

151
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,750
“If you’re happy and you know it clap
your hands.”

152
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,289
That’s why so many Uighurs are lining up
to go!

153
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,050
Escorted by police.

154
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,150
With shaved heads.

155
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,729
Handcuffed and blindfolded.

156
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,360
But after facing international condemnation,

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,389
the Chinese regime has good news.

158
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:04,199
All the Uighurs have graduated!

159
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,919
So no need to look into this anymore everyone.

160
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,199
Nothing to see here.

161
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,470
And finally Number 1

162
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,009
I’m sure you can guess.

163
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:18,690
The protests in Hong Kong.

164
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,080
The people of Hong Kong are revolting against

165
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,300
Chinese rule strangling their freedoms.

166
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,849
While the police of Hong Kong are simply revolting.

167
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,759
Six months of protests and the Hong Kong government

168
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,760
has failed to meet protesters’ demands.

169
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
But millions of Hongkongers have refused to
back down.

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,820
And best of all, the Chinese regime is really,
really worried

171
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,930
these protests will spill over to the rest
of Mainland China.

172
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,140
Of course, most Americans didn’t hear much
about it

173
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,910
until Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey

174
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,630
tweeted his support for Hong Kong.

175
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,040
And then the NBA pressured him to delete it,

176
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,570
and then tried to distance itself from Hong
Kong,

177
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,560
to avoid upsetting their Chinese partnerships—

178
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,120
which are worth about 4 billion dollars a
year.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,410
It ended up just making everyone mad at the
NBA.

180
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,650
On the plus side,

181
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,280
now more Americans know about the protests
in Hong Kong.

182
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,420
And the craziest part?

183
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,520
All the attention on Hong Kong has gotten
Democrats,

184
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,180
Republicans and President Trump to all agree
on something:

185
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,590
passing a law to support the Hong Kong protesters.

186
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,480
Now that’s a Christmas miracle to end the
year on.

187
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,820
So those are the biggest China stories of
the year!

188
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,880
Thank you for being with me through all of
it.

189
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,990
Especially because YouTube is trying to run
this show out of business.

190
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,360
All year long, almost every single episode
we’ve done about Hong Kong,

191
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,040
and about half of all our other episodes,

192
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,630
have been instantly demonetized.

193
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,130
That means it’s really hard for us to make
enough money

194
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,140
to pay our staff and studio costs.

195
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,380
Fortunately, thanks to viewers who contributed
to China Uncensored

196
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,350
on the crowd funding website Patreon,

197
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,811
we’ve been able to continue to expose what

198
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,570
the Chinese Communist Party is doing.

199
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,940
So as a thank you to those fans,

200
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,740
the ones I call my 50-cent army,

201
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,230
I answer their questions at the end of these
episodes.

202
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,150
The last question of the year comes from Benjamin
Jull.

203
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,770
“What is the popular opinion of ordinary
Chinese people

204
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,340
towards these proto-Orwellian surveillance
systems?

205
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,750
Are they afraid of them or does it simply
not have any effect on their lives.

206
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,480
As bad as it seems it could turn out to be
a complete white elephant.”

207
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,680
That’s a good question.

208
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,190
There are so many surveillance cameras,

209
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,910
you might think people would just get used
to them.

210
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,620
In one major Chinese city,

211
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,790
there’s a camera for every six people.

212
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,320
Many Chinese people have gotten used to it.

213
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,270
What choice do they have?

214
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,580
And this ties into a bigger question:

215
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,670
How do Chinese people feel about the CCP?

216
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,250
We recently spoke to a Chinese dissident living
in America

217
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,920
who still has a network of connections inside
Mainland China.

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,430
And he told us that inside China,

219
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,530
there’s widespread hatred of the Chinese
Communist Party.

220
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,650
So maybe in 2020 or soon after,

221
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,470
we’ll really see some Hong Kong style protests

222
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,860
erupting in Mainland China.

223
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,410
Thanks for your question.

224
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,410
And thanks for watching.

225
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,780
If you’d like to give China Uncensored a
belated Christmas gift,

226
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,990

227
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,990
and contribute on patreon.

228
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,520
Have a blessed and safe new year.

229
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,240
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

230
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,540
See you in 2020.
