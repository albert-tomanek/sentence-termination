00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,929
just a few more years and we might see

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,410
China invading Taiwan!

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,500
They already have a plan...

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,060
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,610
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,610
War.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,880
War never changes.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,810
Especially when it involves the threat of
a war

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,040
between China and the United States.

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,720
I just hope we survive the fallout.

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,730
Now I know,

13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,150
you’re all probably still caught up

14
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,169
in the current threat of a war with North
Korea.

15
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:33,530
But I’m here to pile on a little more terror
on top of that.

16
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,030
Can’t have you people getting soft, can
I?

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,460
The Chinese regime has laid out a detailed,

18
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,149
comprehensive plan to invade Taiwan

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,010
by the year 2020.

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,820
That’s according to this book,

21
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,690
by Ian Easton of the Project 2049 Research
Institute.

22
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,449
The 300-page book brought together

23
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,539
public and leaked documents

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,910
from the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.

25
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,859
But our first clue something was up

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,039
came back in 2012.

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,030
At the 2012 18th Party Congress,

28
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,940
Xi Jinping said he was committed to,

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,430
“continue the 2020 Plan,

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,840
whereby we build and deploy

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,550
a complete operational capability

32
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,890
to use force against Taiwan by that year.”

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,290
Of course!

34
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,570
The 2020 Plan to invade Taiwan

35
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,070
was a plan to invade Taiwan by 2020!

36
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,180
How could we have been so blind?

37
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,320
I guess hindsight is...

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,580
easier to see things in.

39
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,900
The invasion plans involve the coordinated
efforts

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,530
of every branch of the Chinese military—

41
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,510
the Ground Forces, Navy, Army Air Forces,

42
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,150
the Marine Corps, and the Rocket Force.

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,360
Those are the guys responsible for China’s
ballistic missiles.

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
And of course,

45
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,240
the Team Rocket Forces control China’s Pokemon.

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,630
According to those documents,

47
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,490
the Taiwan invasion comes in three parts.

48
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,600
It begins with a 15-day pre-invasion bombardment.

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,320
“Taiwan would be subject to a massive bombardment

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,290
by ballistic missiles, cruise missiles,

51
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,520
and bombers against military targets on the
island.”

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,710
Then comes the amphibious landing

53
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,629
of 400,000 Chinese troops on the Island.

54
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,510
As for the actual invasion of the Island,

55
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,310
China has been training for that.

56
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,560
They’ve even created a mockup of

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
the Taiwan presidential palace

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,920
so troops can practice.

59
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,750
And the plan is bloody.

60
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,819
“Military operations will emphasize speed

61
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,730
and surprise to overwhelm coastal defenses

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,290
and create so much destruction in the early
phase

63
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,469
that Taiwan would surrender before

64
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:36,189
the U.S. military can deploy forces to the
area.”

65
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,849
And that is the key.

66
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,569
Fast action before the US can respond.

67
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,330
Because the US will respond.

68
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,030
According to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act,

69
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,590
the United States has to come to Taiwan’s
defense

70
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,510
if there’s an invasion.

71
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,069
And since the US already has

72
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,359
two squadrons of Air Force fighters,

73
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,719
4,000 Marines,

74
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,760
and a whole lot of navy warships,

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,719
submarines, and bombers in Japan and Guam,

76
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,379
those could be deployed pretty quickly.

77
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,200
And a gathering of Chinese troops

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,150
in the south of the country might be

79
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,700
a good tip off that something’s about to
go down.

80
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,540
Also, the bombarding Taiwan with missiles
part.

81
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,379
The US would definitely know by that point.

82
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,180
So a Chinese invasion of Taiwan inevitably
means

83
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,389
a strong likelihood of war between China and
the US.

84
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,340
The book by Project 2049 says,

85
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,650
“No one seemed clear on

86
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,469
exactly what might happen,

87
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:31,639
but all were sure is a future Chinese surprise
attack

88
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,420
would be worse than Pearl Harbor

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,349
and 9/11 combined.”

90
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,790
Naw way, that doesn’t go far enough.

91
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,450
It’s like Pearl Harbor,

92
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,720
plus 9/11,

93
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,480
plus the sacking of Rome in 410 AD,

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,810
and the 1960 World Series where the Pirates

95
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,349
somehow beat the Yankees.

96
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,650
Taiwan is a problem for the Chinese Communist
Party.

97
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,480
For one, its political independence is a constant
reminder

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,219
that the Chinese regime doesn’t have the
power

99
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,230
to do whatever it wants.

100
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,780
Also, it has democracy.

101
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,810
And that blows a giant hole in the CCP’s
line

102
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,370
about how Chinese people just aren’t ready
for democracy,

103
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,830
and require the CCP to have a harmonious society.

104
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,049
So that’s why, all along,

105
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,180
“[The Chinese regime] is using non-lethal
means—

106
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,290
psychological, diplomatic, propaganda,

107
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,730
and informational warfare—against Taiwan.

108
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,300
Once these are exhausted,

109
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,660
the plan for large-scale amphibious assault

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,050
will be carried out.”

111
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,380
Maybe you’re wondering, why the wait?

112
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,760
Why hasn’t China already invaded?

113
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,800
Turns out, that nearly did happen.

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,940
This article by Ian Easton describes how Mao

115
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,530
planned to invade Taiwan as early as 1950.

116
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,310
I’ve included the link below and on our
website

117
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,650
because it’s a fantastic read.

118
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,660
Basically, there was a massive spy operation
in place,

119
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,810
secretly undermining the fledgling Taiwanese
government.

120
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,980
It really was like a spy novel.

121
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,290
Through sheer luck, the spy ring fell apart,

122
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,720
putting a big hiccup in Mao’s plans.

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,530
Then the Korean War broke out

124
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,370
and Mao redirected his troops to fight the
US.

125
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,120
By the time that was done,

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,610
Taiwan had been too well established,

127
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,840
and backed by the United States,

128
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
for an invasion to happen.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,540
Which brings us to the new invasion plan,
for 2020.

130
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,190
Oh my gosh!

131
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,390
That’s only three years from now!

132
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,220
That’s the year we’ll have giant fighting
robots!

133
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,600
Or GIANT fighting robots!

134
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,020
Does that mean we’re going to see an invasion
of Taiwan,

135
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,360
possibly with robots?

136
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,910
Not necessarily.

137
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,140
The Chinese military looks intimidating,

138
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,290
but it’s more of a political organization
than a fighting force.

139
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,220
It hasn’t been in a war

140
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,000
since a 1979 attack on Vietnam,

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,610
which did not go so well for China.

142
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,940
So drafting up plans for a Taiwan invasion

143
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,110
might be more about jockeying for position

144
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,960
within the Chinese military,

145
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,720
rather than practical battle plans.

146
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,540
Because you’d have to be blind to miss

147
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,240
the potential consequences of getting into
a war

148
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,860
with the United States.

149
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,820
Also, China right now simply doesn’t have
the ships needed

150
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,490
to carry that many troops across the Taiwan
Strait.

151
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,970
So even though the CCP has a well-documented
plan

152
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,850
for a Taiwan invasion,

153
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,300
it might not be ready to carry it out by 2020,

154
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,490
or might just decide it’s too risky.

155
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,060
Or they don’t have enough robots.

156
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,060
On the other hand,

157
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,970
now that Xi Jinping has elevated himself

158
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,660
to new levels of power in the Communist Party,

159
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,580
he may be looking for a chance to showcase
his might.

160
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,250
We’ll find out in three years I guess!.

161
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,250
What do you think?

I’ve figured it out!

167
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,140
I know how to save Taiwan.

168
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,170
Just line the coast with piles upon piles
of stinky tofu!

169
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,630
That’ll stop the PLA!

170
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,630
