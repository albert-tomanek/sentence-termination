1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,280
China launched a propaganda war

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,800
taking advantage of the Israel-Palestine conflict

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:16,080
saying China is the savior of the world’s Muslims

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,160
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
Eleven days of fighting between\h
Israeli and Palestinian forces\h\h

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,800
ended on Friday with a ceasefire. It had\h
been the worst violence there since 2014.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,760
But every heartbreaking conflict\h\h

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,920
is also a great opportunity—for a\h
Chinese communist propaganda drive!

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,720
You might be arguing with people over who the\h
real bad guy is in this long-standing conflict.\h\h

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,680
Israel? Hamas? No. The real bad guy is...America!

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,040
During the fighting, Chinese state-run media came\h
out with article after article about how the US\h\h

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,200
is part of the problem, but\h
not part of the solution.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,200
The US stands opposite to international justice.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
And the US is the one really\h
harming the world’s Muslims.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,800
The Israel-Palestinian conflict has been a godsend\h
for the Communist Party. International pressure\h\h

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,240
has been mounting on the Chinese regime for\h
its genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,120
But with the recent fighting in Israel and Gaza,\h\h

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,120
the Communist Party can now use one of its\h
favorite propaganda tactics—the switcheroo.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,600
You see, the US is over-concerned about Muslim\h
Uyghurs, but what about Muslim Palestinians?

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,840
Get a load of this. State-run China Daily says the\h
US is “pretending to be friends and well-wishers\h\h

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,880
of Muslims, but they have been caught red-handed\h
this time. Because they are clamoring for the\h\h

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,960
human rights of Muslims in China, but quite\h
silent about the killings of Muslims in Palestine.\h\h

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
Thus their hypocrisies have been\h
revealed to the world once again.”

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
Wait, does that also mean China\h
is being hypocritical by saying\h\h

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160
they care about the Muslims in Palestine,\h
but not about the Muslims in Xinjiang?

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,640
Of course not, because what the US claims\h
is happening in Xinjiang are all lies.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying\h\h

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,000
said, the US “joined with a few of its allies\h
and attempted to organize meaningless meetings\h\h

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,360
on Xinjiang-related issues based\h
on lies and political prejudice.”

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,600
Because the reality is human rights in\h
Xinjiang are great! There’s an economic boom!

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,360
Granted, that economic boom is mostly felt\h
by the Han Chinese people that have flooded\h\h

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
Xinjiang in recent years, displacing the Uyghurs.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,760
But what’s important to remember is...look\h
at all that happy ethnic dancing!

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,920
Clearly China is the real\h
friend of the world’s Muslims.

35
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,760
“Muslims are well aware that the US allies\h
are pretending to come out as their friends\h\h

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,440
by shedding crocodile tears\h
for Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,720
“Muslims think that the [US] is using the\h
Xinjiang issue as a shield to hide their\h\h

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,120
long history of oppression in Muslim countries.\h
Since actions certainly speak louder than words,\h\h

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,240
Muslims know who are their genuine and\h
bonafide friends around the world.”

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,400
It’s China. China is their bonafide friend.

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Which is why it’s so evil that “The US has\h
been pressuring Arab countries [to criticize]\h\h

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,400
China's human rights and sabotaging the\h
China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.”

43
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Yes, please ignore whatever the US\h
says about China’s genocide of Muslims,\h\h

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
and continue to do business with China!

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,920
Which is why the state-run\h
Global Times suggests that,\h\h

46
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,080
“only human rights views of developing countries\h
such as China should be more listened to.”

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,200
And you know, since you asked, the\h
Chinese Communist Party does have\h\h

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,360
some ideas about how to solve\h
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
I’ll tell you what they are after the break.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,480
Welcome back.

51
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Yesterday’s ceasefire was\h
brokered largely by Egypt.

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Which, I can’t understand. After\h
all, China had also offered to help!

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,760
But don’t worry, because there *will* be more\h
conflict in the region at some point. And then\h\h

54
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,320
the Israelis and Palestinians can turn to China.\h\h

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,200
Because China knows all about\h
how to create peace and harmony.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,280
For example, China said,

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,200
“To avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, Israel\h
must fulfill its obligations proposed by\h\h

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,840
relevant UN resolutions, completely\h
lift its lockdown in the Gaza Strip,\h\h

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,640
ensure the safety and legal rights of\h
Palestinians in the occupied territories,\h\h

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,520
and facilitate the entrance\h
of humanitarian assistance.”

61
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,920
You know, like China does in\h
Xinjiang. Or it would if there was\h\h

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,320
actually a problem but there\h
isn’t so there’s no need.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,920
China is also suggesting a two state solution.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,400
What a great idea! Why hasn’t\h
anyone thought of that before?\h\h

65
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Oh wait, they did. And the\h
Palestinian side repeatedly said no.

66
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,360
But the important thing is—China doesn’t need\h
to offer actual solutions. They just need to\h\h

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,240
seem like they’re the rational good guy,\h
while making the US look like the bad guy.

68
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,440
The reason China supports a two state solution\h
is because that’s been the UN’s stance. A very\h\h

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,240
unsuccessful stance, but that doesn’t matter.\h
The Communist Party likes to pretend it's\h\h

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,320
a responsible international player by saying\h
oh yeah, we totally follow the UN. Especially\h\h

71
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,520
because China has tremendous control\h
over the UN. And can stop it from\h\h

72
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,960
say...criticizing what China is doing in Xinjiang.

73
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,240
Meanwhile, Chinese state-run media\h
has used the Israel-Palestine conflict\h\h

74
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,960
to criticize the US for being on the\h
opposite side of international justice.

75
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,160
And the Chinese Communist Party is also taking\h
advantage of political divisions in the US.

76
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
It blamed the crisis on both Trump and Biden.

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,080
It’s Trump’s fault because,\h
“What Trump did in the past\h\h

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
years has sowed the seeds for the\h
current conflicts and bloodshed.”

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So if you’re on the left in the US, you\h
might agree—Trump is a total monster.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,160
But it’s also Biden’s fault, because “Biden\h
is unlikely to make any concrete moves\h\h

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
in de-escalating the confrontation, at most\h\h

82
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,680
making certain gestures in diplomatic\h
language that do not mean anything.”

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,240
So if you’re on the right in the US, you might\h
agree—Biden is a weak, ineffectual president.

84
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,040
The Chinese Communist Party\h
really knows how to play us.

85
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,960
Of course I wouldn’t want you to\h
think China is just blaming the US.\h\h

86
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,160
They’re also blaming the Jews! You\h
see, spokesperson Hua Chunyingsays\h\h

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
this conflict is intertwined\h
with the Iran nuclear issue.

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,000
So Chinese state-run media say “Israel doesn’t\h
want to see the US and Iran reach a deal\h\h

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,600
so the conflict in Gaza will add difficulties\h
to the talks between the US and Iran.”

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,920
You see, Israel has a secret\h
plot to muck up the US-Iran Deal.\h\h

91
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,240
Which is why they got Hamas to fire\h
rockets at them so they could fire\h\h

92
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,200
back. And if that sounds like a crazy\h
conspiracy theory, listen to this.

93
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,280
“The US bore an undeniable responsibility\h
[because] its policy in the Middle East has\h\h

94
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,720
long been kidnapped by its Jewish community\h
that serves the interest of Israel.”

95
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,320
That’s right. Chinese state-run\h
media is blaming the current conflict\h\h

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,920
on a cabal of Jews controlling the US government.

97
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,520
Israel has been criticizing blatant\h
antisemitism in Chinese State-run media.

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,760
A recent Chinese state-run CGTN broadcast\h
questioned what was really behind US support\h\h

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,720
for Israel. The host said, “some people believe\h
that U.S. pro-Israeli policy is traceable to the\h\h

100
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,680
influence of wealthy Jews in the U.S. and the\h
Jewish lobby on U.S. foreign policymakers.”

101
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,360
“Jews dominate finance and internet sectors.\h\h

102
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,840
So do they have the powerful\h
lobbies some say? Possible.”

103
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,640
Stay classy Chinese state-run media.

104
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,320
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

105
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,880
fans who support us and our efforts to expose\h
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,800
on the crowd funding website Patreon.
 \h

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,720
Jason Oehring asks, “Question, has the CCP done or\h
said anything about moving the great firewall of\h\h

108
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,840
China so that it covers HK as well?”
(\h

109
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,440
That’s an excellent question.\h
For those of you who don’t know,\h\h

110
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,480
the great firewall is essentially the massive\h
censorship apparatus the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

111
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
uses to cut off China from the global internet\h
and control what people in China can see online.

112
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,680
Now, ever since the Chinese Communist Party\h
implemented the Hong Kong national security law,\h\h

113
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
Hong Kong’s freedoms have\h
increasingly been restricted.

114
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,400
Protesters have been arrested for\h
holding up blank pieces of white paper.

115
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,040
Hong Kong legislators need to make\h
patriotic oaths to the Communist Party.

116
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
Reporters are attacked in broad daylight.

117
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,200
Many are concerned it's just a matter of time\h
before the Great Firewall comes to Hong Kong.\h\h

118
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,960
Technically, Hong Kong still has\h
freedom of speech and the press.\h\h

119
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
But new fake news laws have a lot of\h
people worried about press freedom.

120
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,000
And earlier this year, a\h
pro-democracy website was blocked.\h\h

121
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,920
Which got a lot of people\h
thinking about the Great Firewall.

122
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,640
Last year, “The Hong Kong government\h
enabled police to censor online speech\h\h

123
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,640
and force internet service providers to hand\h
over user information and shut down platforms.”

124
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,960
So really, it’s only a matter of when, not\h
if, the Great Firewall comes to Hong Kong.

125
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Thanks for your question Jason and your support.
