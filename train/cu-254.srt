1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:02,940
China is sending a message to the US

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,900
It’s ready to fight for Taiwan

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,570
Plus the WHO’s China report is a disaster

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,940
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:20,210
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,859
This week’s China news headlines.

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,339
The Chinese Communist Party has said for a
long time that it plans to invade Taiwan.

8
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,659
But when it does, the US will probably respond.

9
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:37,629
So now, the Chinese military is preparing
for that US intervention.

10
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:41,280
That’s according to Taiwan’s Deputy Defense
Minister.\h

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,420
This week, Chinese aircraft once again harassed
Taiwan.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,340
That’s nothing new.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,440
What is new is how they did it.\h

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:57,250
Radar readings showed different groups of
Chinese jets flew in a pincer pattern, surrounding

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,770
Taiwan on three sides.\h

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,280
And according to my favorite Chinese state-run
media, the Global Times, there’s a reason.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,550
“The recent exercises show that the PLA
is...taking possible US and Japanese interventions

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,940
into consideration.”

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,690
Clearly, the flight plan of the Chinese jets
represented in yellow are to handle forces

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,360
coming from the US or Japan.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,700
The Chinese fighters also happened to fly
over at the same time as the President of

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,520
Palau and a US diplomat were visiting Taiwan.

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,570
Wait, what if the Chinese Communist Party
is actually afraid of...Palau?

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,930
Maybe they are.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,650
Because that US diplomat who traveled to Taiwan
was John Hennessy-Niland, the US Ambassador

26
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,750
to Palau.

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,200
And it’s the first time a US ambassador
has visited Taiwan in 40 years.

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,840
Which of course drew a “red line” warning
from China.\h

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,250
In other “angering China” news, last week
the US and Taiwan signed a Coast Guard Deal.

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,340
Which of course China denounced.

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,170
The deal means the US Coast Guard will be
working with Taiwan a little bit more.

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,610
It does kind of stretch the definition of
a Coast Guard.\h

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,549
Turns out “The U.S. has been deploying its
coast guard to the Western Pacific to help

34
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,879
allies enforce their claims in disputed waters.”

35
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,120
And the US Coast Guard even intercepted a
Chinese fishing boat illegally operating in

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
the waters of Palau in December.\h

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,180
Wait, Palau again?!

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,769
Be afraid, CCP.

39
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,480
Be very afraid.\h

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,890
But the latest group to offend the Chinese
Communist Party is: NASA.

41
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,019
They called Taiwan a country.

42
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,430
NASA has started a Send Your Name to Mars
campaign.

43
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,480
And in the “country” drop-down menu, you
could select Taiwan.

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,510
But obviously, the CCP is very sensitive and
this hurt its feelings.

45
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,799
So NASA changed it.

46
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:06,340
Now you select your “location” by picking
a country/region/territory.

47
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,249
NASA, if you’re going to cave to the Chinese
Communist Party, what are you going to do

48
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,430
when the aliens get here?

49
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,720
NASA has been banned from working with China’s
space program, since it’s run by the Chinese

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,730
military, and it could be a serious threat
to US national security.

51
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,980
And yet, recently NASA admitted they exchanged
data with China on Mars orbiters.

52
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,959
Ah well, it was a nice planet while it lasted.

53
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,140
But at least the US State Department is taking
a harder stance against the Chinese regime.

54
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,310
More on that after the break.

55
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,069
Welcome back.

56
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,620
The US State Department has released its latest
report on the state of human rights in China.

57
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,029
The state is: There are no human rights.

58
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,529
It calls the persecution of Uyghurs a genocide.

59
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:05,889
It also mentions allegations of forced organ
harvesting from Uyghurs and Falun Gong practitioners.

60
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:11,489
China responded by saying the hearts of all
Chinese citizens belong to the Party.\h

61
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,320
The State Department report comes a week after
Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on

62
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,970
NATO allies to join the US in countering China.

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,450
It also comes as the US successfully got its
allies to sanction China's abuse of Uyghurs.

64
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,510
And a Chinese professor has been caught on
camera revealing the secret to China’s success.

65
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,570
And by caught on camera, I mean he posted
this speech on Chinese TikTok.\h

66
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,270
“After reform and opening up, we let the
foreigners in.

67
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,080
They brought in their technology, their cars,
their money, their experience, their knowledge.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,300
China couldn’t compete with the foreigners.

69
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,890
So what did the Chinese government do?

70
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,480
Let people start business partnerships with
foreigners.

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,720
And use the partnerships to learn to do it
on our own.”\h

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,200
“Now the factories, the equipment, the technology,
the patents, the products, the market, the

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,420
brands, are all ours.

74
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,420
The foreigners are completely gone.”\h

75
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,432
“So now our Yang Jiechi and Wang Li have
the status to be so tough in their talks with

76
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:10,432
the Americans.

77
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:17,260
“You are not qualified [laughter] to speak
to me like this.”

78
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,270
“For the last 40 years, all we’ve done
is plagiarize.

79
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,080
We’ve copied our way to the top.

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,810
We plagiarized wildly, copied wildly.

81
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,810
What intellectual property rights?

82
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,810
What patented technology?

83
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,810
We’ll get it first and deal with it later.”

84
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,280
That’s what the Communist Party calls forced
technology transfer.

85
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,980
We did a full episode about it, check it out.

86
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Also, I’ve talked about this problem in
hundreds of China Uncensored episodes.

87
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,870
And yet, foreign companies keep throwing their
money and their intellectual property into

88
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,750
the China market.

89
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,130
What are you doing, Elon?!

90
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,070
The World Health Organization released its
report about the origin of the coronavirus.

91
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,830
And no one is happy.\h

92
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,320
Scientists say it only scratched the surface.

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,240
The White House says Americans deserve better
information.

94
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,330
The Wall Street Journal calls it the Wuhan
Whitewash.

95
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,961
That’s because the report is the result
of a close collaboration between the WHO and

96
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,500
the Chinese Communist Party.

97
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,380
And let’s just say, the Party might have
withheld some data.

98
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,030
Not that they have anything to hide.

99
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:31,000
A former head of the CDC says the coronavirus
mostly likely escaped from a Chinese lab,

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
accidentally.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,990
But the WHO report says I don’t know, maybe
it came from animals?

102
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,990
Maybe not.

103
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,270
I don’t know.

104
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,210
We might as well have asked a Magic 8 Ball.\h

105
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,640
But as the WHO report came out, China also
announced they’re going to try to prove

106
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,570
it came from outside China.

107
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,370
You know what?

108
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,280
Let’s just all say it came from Taiwan.

109
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,652
Then China will either have to admit it began
in China, or admit that Taiwan is not a part

110
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:02,830
of China.

111
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,300
It’s perfect!

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,270
And after the break, guess which world leaders
now have the coronavirus?

113
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,940
Welcome back.

114
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,650
Both the president and prime minister of Pakistan
have contracted the coronavirus.

115
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,640
It was shortly after they both had their first
dose of China’s Sinopharm vaccine.

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,440
These are the things you sacrifice when you
ally with the Chinese Communist Party.

117
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,840
Sinopharm claims their vaccine is 79% effective,
although that has not been independently verified.

118
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,750
Until it is, I’ll believe it as much as
I believe the coronavirus data China gave

119
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,320
to the WHO.

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:53,890
The top Chinese diplomat in Brazil has taken
to Twitter, to mock Justin Trudeau.

121
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,870
As tempting as it is, I will not take the
Communist Party’s side on this.\h

122
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,080
The Chinese diplomat tweeted “Boy, your
greatest achievement is to have ruined the

123
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,870
friendly relations between China and Canada,
and have turned Canada into a running dog

124
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,270
of the US.

125
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,270
Spendthrift!!!”

126
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,270
Spendthrift?

127
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,720
There are way better insults than spendthrift.

128
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,100
Why not try Dunderhead?

129
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,360
I mean, Trudeau is a real Afternoon Farmer.

130
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,020
All hat and no cattle.

131
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,340
Am I right?

132
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,690
A real Gadabout.

133
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:34,980
He’s a galumphing milksop Rumbumptious sauce
box!

134
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,349
Now this may shock you, but a new study has
found that Chinese loans to developing nations

135
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,219
may pose some problems.

136
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,649
The study looked at 100 Chinese loan agreements
in 24 countries.

137
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,310
This is the first study of its kind.\h

138
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,360
Apparently, loans from the Chinese Communist
Party impose “unique conditions on borrowing

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,360
nations which could be giving Beijing undue
influence over their economic and foreign

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
policies.”

141
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,829
They also all contain confidentiality clauses
that prevent these countries from telling

142
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,700
the public what’s actually in the deal.

143
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,010
Transparency, with Chinese characteristics.

144
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,259
Meanwhile, in Hong Kong news, the Chinese
Communist Party has officially implemented

145
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,069
the terrible things we told you they were
going to implement.\h

146
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:27,860
Among other things, the Party now demands
that only people who demonstrate loyalty can

147
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,509
run for office, which makes it pretty much
impossible for pro-democracy politicians to

148
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,920
run ever again.

149
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,160
And as a fun bonus, the Hong Kong National
Security police will be the ones vetting potential

150
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,910
candidates for loyalty.\h

151
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,379
But most Hong Kong activists aren’t really
thinking about running for office right now,

152
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,459
because they’re just trying to stay out
of prison.

153
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:56,019
On Thursday, seven prominent activists were
convicted of unlawful assembly over a protest

154
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,019
back in 2019.

155
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,970
They included “Martin Lee, an 82-year-old
barrister known as the ‘father of democracy’

156
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:11,220
in Hong Kong; Jimmy Lai, 73, a media tycoon
and founder of the staunchly pro-democracy

157
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:18,769
Apple Daily newspaper; and Margaret Ng, 73,
a respected barrister and columnist.”

158
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,410
Clearly these people are a menace to society.

159
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,709
They each now face up to five years in prison.\h

160
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:31,370
And finally, the Chinese Foreign Ministry
loves to spread propaganda through Twitter.

161
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,019
Even though Twitter is banned in China.

162
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,910
Here’s an example.

163
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,769
After the US Congress passed a bill condemning
China for their treatment of Uyghurs,

164
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:45,860
China’s Foreign Ministry Tweeted that “Ethnic
minorities in China enjoy equal rights and

165
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,809
freedom in religion and culture.

166
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:51,529
China's ethnic policy is more successful!”

167
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,660
Yes, this is what I call a successful ethnic
policy.

168
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,240
Or when the US imposed visa restrictions on
Chinese officials over abuses in Tibet,

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,620
China’s Foreign Ministry again took to their
favorite propaganda tool, Twitter, to say

170
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,589
they would be imposing visa restrictions on
US personnel.

171
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,699
China’s Foreign Ministry Tweets about 100
times each month.

172
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:19,279
The tweets all have some propaganda goal,
whether it’s criticizing the West, or praising

173
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,600
the Chinese Communist Party.

174
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,269
And the CCP loves to use Twitter to troll
the rest of the world.\h

175
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,579
Twitter, of course, refuses to deplatform
this dangerous propaganda machine.

176
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:38,720
Which is fine, because it’s not Twitter’s
job to censor people.

177
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,540
But there’s a way you can fight back, and
use China’s propaganda against them.

178
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,040
Students for a Free Tibet has created this
website called Tweets for Tibet.

179
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,649
You can pledge, say 10 cents, per Foreign
Ministry tweet.

180
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,060
And the money goes to the Tibetan Freedom
Movement.

181
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,129
Every time China’s Foreign Ministry Tweets,
it raises more money to stand up to the Chinese

182
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,819
Communist Party.

183
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,519
Every Tweet they make, hurts themselves.

184
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,640
It’s a brilliant way to use the energy of
the CCP’s trolling against them.\h

185
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,259
Now to be clear: We don’t make any money
from this.

186
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,279
We just heard about it and thought it was
a great idea.

187
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,819
In fact, we signed China Uncensored up to
pledge $1 per Tweet.

188
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:28,519
So if you want to turn the CCP’s propaganda
against itself, check it out.

189
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,769
Go to TweetsForTibet.com.

190
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:33,059
And I’ll put a link in the description below.

191
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,809
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

192
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:51,649
See you next time.
