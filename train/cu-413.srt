1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,590
China tells the US,

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,330
you kids get off my territorial waters!

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,960
Nothing like a little public humiliation

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,010
to encourage people to pay their debts.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,129
And finally Hong Kong just went Hong Wrong...again

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,640
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,289
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:27,519
In our top story,

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,140
yes China and the US are both concerned

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,660
about North Korea.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,320
But they’re still also maybe slightly worried

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
about each other.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,399
Kind of like when the X-Men

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,840
have to team up with Magneto

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,760
to save mutantkind.

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,170
That ends perfectly well, right?

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,170
On Tuesday,

20
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,930
a US warship sailed through the South China
Sea,

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,760
close to a string of reefs and shoals

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,390
called the Paracel Islands.

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,850
Now China says those reefs

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,719
are Chinese territory.

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
Vietnam says they’re Vietnamese territory.

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,900
The US says they’re in international waters—

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,629
and if you have a problem with that,

28
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,590
come argue with our warship.

29
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,620
The Chinese Communist Party was not pleased.

30
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,720
And this is a particularly sensitive time.

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,100
Next week is the 19th Party Congress,

32
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,930
a once every five year meeting

33
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,780
of top Communist Party leaders.

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,150
It’s a huge propaganda event,

35
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,570
and the Party likes to look strong.

36
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,820
Rise and shine, Xi Jinping!

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,460
I would not want to be the cameraman who filmed
that

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,710
and released it to the world.

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,710
But you know what else

40
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,140
makes the CCP look even weaker

41
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,030
than the core leader asleep on the job?

42
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,920
A US warship challenging their territorial
claims.

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,210
Like it does on a regular basis.

44
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,390
The Chinese regime may not be happy about
it.

45
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,180
But they’d better play nice,

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,530
because Donald Trump is coming to town next
month.

47
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,190
Trump is planning to make his first presidential
visit there in November.

48
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,680
I’m sure by then the whole sailing a warship

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,310
through Chinese-slash-international waters
thing

50
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,200
will have blown over.

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200


52
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,040
That US warship isn’t coming back…

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,030
until probably a month or two after Trump’s
visit.

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,530
And on to lighter issues:

55
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,140
North Korea’s nuclear weapons.

56
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,510
Trump has been trying to pressure the Chinese
regime

57
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,930
to help stop North Korea.

58
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,340
Meanwhile, Chinese state-run media is asking

59
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,750
the US and North Korea to just “cool it,
ok?”

60
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,840
But the reason they’re asking everyone to
calm down

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,610
could be more about the Chinese regime’s
embarrassment.

62
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,610
Because it turns out,

63
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,780
they don’t have as much power over North
Korea

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,730
as they’d like the world to think they do.

65
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,000
But they also don’t want the US to invade
of North Korea.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,780
Then China would have the US military

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,200
right up against the Chinese border.

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,760
Plus in the South China Sea.

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,900
That’s why the Chinese military has been
getting...

70
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,580
a facelift, ahead of the Party Congress.

71
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,440
I hope it’s better than Joan Rivers’ facelift.

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,440
Seriously, though -

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,130
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has spent the past
several years

74
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,200
purging political rivals in the military.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
In fact,

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,290
there’s been a huge turnover of top military
officials.

77
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,260
Xi’s also attempting to transform the PLA

78
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,990
into a streamlined modern military.

79
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,320
This includes becoming a global arms dealer.

80
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,940
We’ll have more on that later.

81
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,569
But at least when it comes to military drones,

82
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:21,380
President Trump is looking to counter China.

83
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,490
China wants to dominate the 10-billion-dollar

84
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,160
global drone market,

85
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,260
but Trump wants to put America first…

86
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,319
in the exporting of killer drones.

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,620
“Washington will also seek to renegotiate

88
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,260
a 1987 missile-control pact

89
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,180
with the aim of loosening international restrictions

90
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,790
on U.S. exports of unmanned aircraft.”

91
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,150
Whether China is going to be successful

92
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,819
at truly transforming their military

93
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,260
is hard to tell.

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,970
But one thing is clear:

95
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,410
It’s Taiwan's military that the rest of
the world

96
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,400
needs to look out for.

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,910
The Chinese Communist Party is no stranger

98
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,459
to using parades to showcase its military.

99
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,319
But nothing can compare to the parade

100
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,520
Taiwan just held for its National Day.

101
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,380
I think we all might need a second

102
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,920
to absorb that more fully.

103
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,040
Yes, if ever you wanted more proof

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,960
that Taiwan and China are very different countries,

105
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,450
just think about whether their soldiers

106
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,100
look like they want to kill you

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,980
or choreograph dances with you.

108
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,900
Speaking of things under threat in China:

109
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
cash.

110
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,310
Gone are the days of paying with paper money,

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,990
like some old fogey.

112
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,060
Or credit cards,

113
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,690
like some loser from the 2000s.

114
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,690
In China,

115
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,780
it’s all the rage now to pay with your mobile
phone.

116
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,720
“Mobile payment volume in the country

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,100
more than doubled to $5 trillion in 2016.”

118
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,680
Yes, apparently China found a use for QR codes.

119
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,690
Why has paying with your phone

120
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,800
become so popular in China?

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,550
It could be convenience.

122
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,550
It could also be

123
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,760
that it gives Chinese companies like Tencent,

124
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,500
“access to hordes of personal data.

125
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,530
That data can then be shared with the Chinese
government.”

126
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,090
Or maybe it’s a little of both.

127
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,990
Who says you can’t have oppression and convenience?

128
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,220
But when talking about convenient payments,

129
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,380
you have to talk about the most convenient
payment method of all—

130
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,940
not paying.

131
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,400
China is plagued by big companies

132
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,419
with connections to local governments

133
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,960
running up huge debts and then never paying
them back.

134
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,630
Well, that’s about to change.

135
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,570
Haha, not really.

136
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,020
But what is changing is how the Chinese regime

137
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,669
will go after small time debtors.

138
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:45,820
Down with the underdog!

139
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,040
Punish the poor!

140
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,710
Prepare to be publically shamed!

141
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,419
The CCP has told local authorities

142
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,790
“to establish online platforms to expose
debtors

143
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,320
who fail to honor their credit obligations.”

144
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,390
For quite some time now,

145
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,840
there’s been a trend in China of using public
humiliation

146
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,340
to go after individuals who can’t pay their
debts.

147
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,380
Billboards that name names.

148
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,240
Local officials who will bombard debtors

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,050
with phone messages telling them to pay up.

150
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,820
Blacklisting them from getting on planes

151
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,180
and high speed trains.

152
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,660
Public humiliation, really,

153
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,139
is a proud tradition of the Chinese Communist
Party,

154
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,800
dating back to the dunce caps

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,050
of the Cultural Revolution.

156
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,449
But the days of being humiliated

157
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,240
in front of a crowd are gone.

158
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,850
Now, you can be humiliated

159
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,230
in front of the entire country!

160
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,600
Because authorities said the online shaming
platforms

161
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,669
should be “maintained by local news organizations.”

162
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:39,961
And who needs rule of law

163
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,960
when you’ve got trial by media.

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
In other news,

165
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,889
if you’ve been watching China Uncensored
for a while,

166
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,710
you’ll know we’ve made two trips to Hong
Kong.

167
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,210
Once in 2014 to cover the Umbrella Movement.

168
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,210
And just last year

169
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,860
to interview activists like Joshua Wong.

170
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,890
The two of us are ready for Broadway!

171
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,830
If they hadn’t put Joshua in jail.

172
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,790
Times are changing in Hong Kong.

173
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,500
The Chinese regime recently rejected

174
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,900
the joint declaration that is the basis for
Hong Kong freedoms

175
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,490
denied in the Mainland.

176
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,900
And of course expelling democratically elected
lawmakers

177
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,509
because the Communist Party doesn’t like
them.

178
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,100
Well, most recently,

179
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,889
British activist and friend of the show Benedict
Rogers

180
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,479
was denied entry into Hong Kong.

181
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,960
Which like many heavy-handed things

182
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
done by the CCP,

183
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,340
will totally not backfire on them.

184
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,850
Like by causing huge amounts of negative publicity.

185
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,520
Or inspiring Rogers to set up a new NGO

186
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,400
that will monitor Hong Kong’s human rights
situation.

187
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,990
Is it a coincidence that Rogers,

188
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,080
“who is vocal in criticizing China

189
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,560
and advocating for democracy in Hong Kong”,

190
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,430
…was stopped at the Hong Kong airport

191
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,039
just a week before the CCP’s 19th Party
Congress?

192
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,039
Not sure,

193
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,870
but I have a feeling I won’t be able to
do any

194
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,949
on the ground reporting about it in Hong Kong.

195
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,000
Shelley, would you like to go?

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,200
No?

197
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,900
Sure you would.

198
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,130
And coming up after the break,

199
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,930
just when you thought lasting peace

200
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,120
between India and China had been achieved,

201
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,660
India’s defense minister does the unthinkable.

202
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,500
What are you doing still here?

203
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,740
The show’s over!

204
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,690
I know, you’re not ready to say goodbye.

205
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,180
Okay, go over to china Uncensored.tv.

206
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,860
There you’ll see more great episodes of
China Uncensored,

207
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,690
including full half hour episodes

208
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,469
you won’t see anywhere else.

209
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,880
I’m already there waiting for you.
