1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,040
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we’re playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,040
Hullo!

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,580
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,580
I--

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,000
Let me get the line out, you b******s!

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,450
And standing in for Matt Gray,
stand-up mathematician Matt Parker!

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,660
Always clear all before an important calculation.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,900
In front of me I’ve got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can’t see it.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,730
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,240
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers which is...

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,420
And today we are talking about
the Flip Flap Railway.

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,820
Ay, ah, hah!

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,500
- Hmm. Err. Erp.
- Wow.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,790
Is this... this is where the word “No”...

16
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,830
if we had an actual railway tunnel,

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,640
and there’s a big steam engine
coming down the tunnel

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,870
with the word, “no” written on the front
right now.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,760
You’ll notice that sometimes I have my hand
ready over the ding button here.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,170
This is not one of those times.

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,580
Er, is it a pneumatic railway?

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,810
...in the south of England?

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,860
Am I right? Am I wrong? I'm wrong.

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,860
He’s wrong.

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,740
Both flipping and flapping are things railroads
should not do.

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,750
Yes.

27
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,820
So this is some kind of disaster...

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,200
- No, it’s not a disaster.
- Oh!

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,490
If you got on this railway expecting a normal ride,
something has gone wrong.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,660
Oh, so it’s like a metaphorical railway.

31
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,580
Whoa. I was going to go for, like, theme park
or something, but I like that better.

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,210
And you’d have got the point. What might
the Flip Flap Railway be?

33
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,580
Is it a roller coaster?

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,900
Yes, you’re absolutely right.

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,310
Is it one of those scenic railways,
the 19th century ones where it would,

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,780
rather than like a normal rollercoaster now,
you’ve got all the bits and bobs underneath exposed,

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,800
you’d put big panels on
and paint an alpine scene.

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,409
So from a distance it would like you were
riding a train up and down mountains

39
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,880
and there’s a guy at the back who acts as
a brakeman to stop the train.

40
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,580
Gaaah!

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,940
The interesting thing about that is:

42
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
No.

43
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,220
Can I just say--

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,969
But you have successfully got several things
later on that we were going to talk about,

45
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,659
without any questions. So, yes, absolutely.

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,240
What were those really early rollercoasters
called? We’re talking 17th century here.

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,580
Pushing someone down a hill.

48
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,590
Yeah!

49
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,769
Yeah, they weren’t called that, but they
were giant slides.

50
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,099
The first ones were just
park benches going down a…

51
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,599
There’s one in France somewhere, where literally
there was a park bench

52
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,370
and you kind of sat on it sideways and then
it slid down a hill

53
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,900
and it was terrifyingly dangerous.

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,890
The thing is now when we hear the phrase,
“a park bench”

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,059
we just think of Matt and Tom sliding sideways
down a hill on a very poorly fixed one.

56
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:52,439
Yes, there was a gravity track
in Paris in 1812.

57
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,750
- Gravity track!
- Ohhhh...

58
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,769
And you said brakeman, this was before that.

59
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,090
Before someone thought of
stopping the f***ing thing!

60
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,159
Are you stuck on them forever? Just falling
and falling through eternity like Sisyphus

61
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,260
pushing the rock…!

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Sorry, wrong meeting.

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,200
Er, no.

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,820
Well, f***!

65
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,360
What, it wasn’t falling through eternity
for ever? Really?

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,000
I’m getting sick of his negative attitude
this episode.

67
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:20,620
Push up a hill, drop back down the hill.

68
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,900
The very early ones were called Russian Mountains.

69
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,849
Oh, I just thought you meant
some Russian mountains.

70
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,790
Well, this is what they originally were.

71
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,299
Russian sled rides on hills of ice that had
been constructed.

72
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:32,560
So that’s where the name came from, and
they would just...

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
So, up until the point someone went to Russia
and saw a mountain that had ice on it,

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,960
nobody had had the idea of even sitting on
a cart and riding down a steep hill?

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,819
Not specially constructing an ice hill
200 feet tall to slide down.

76
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,500
I’ll grant you, that would be difficult
in Norfolk.

77
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:56,280
Then you started getting the scenic railways.
Now, you talked about brakemen...

78
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,819
It’s done with a guy at the back who acts
as a brakeman

79
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,620
and just puts the brakes on in the right place,

80
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,969
rather than any kind of retarding device that
you might have on the wheels,

81
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:04,969
like you would now.

82
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,640
Oh, brilliant! So if he decides to let it
all hang out you get a…

83
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,459
Well if it does that on that height,
everyone’s seeing it, let’s face it.

84
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,480
The brakeman is the opposite of a hype-man.

85
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,880
So instead of someone going, “Yeah!” there’s
a guy going, “I don’t know.”

86
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,950
“Go steady, or I could make this dead boring
for you.”

87
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,190
You’re right, he is the fun-killer of the
roller coaster world isn’t he?

88
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,210
“Not that! Too much fun. There we are…”

89
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,560
“No, everybody be calm.”

90
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,530
There is also something here in America that
is an early rollercoaster

91
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,510
that is called the
Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway.

92
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,880
I both trust and utterly distrust that ride.

93
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,810
I’m just trying to imagine who thought the
word “chunk” was a good word to put...

94
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,210
Well, that’s the name of the place where
it was. This was a nine mile track.

95
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,710
Oh! I don’t know what it is,
but we’re going.

96
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,740
- Smash cut right now.
- Special!

97
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,120
Is it just some old railway?

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,660
It was one of the very first permanent railways
in America.

99
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,680
Is it like that bit in Indiana Jones 2?

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,460
Go on, press it! Go on, I saw you go…

101
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,120
Yeah, I did, because this is 1827, so what
didn’t they have for this railway?

102
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,160
Power!

103
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,297
Harrison Ford!

104
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,660
Just.

105
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,300
Lucasfilm special effects.

106
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,690
Chris gets the point. Yes, they didn’t have that.
Obviously, gravity, they can get cars down,

107
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,540
how do they get the cars back up?

108
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,080
Gert big men shoving up.

109
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,570
Er, you’re close...

110
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,180
Whoever’s on the ride next.

111
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,660
You say ride. This, to start off with, was
just genuinely a railway to move coal.

112
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,640
Oh, someone would have managed
to sneak onto that.

113
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,910
Yes, you’re absolutely right.

114
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,220
When there was down-time people would just
sneak onto it and ride the cars down,

115
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,900
but how do they get the cars back up?

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,700
I guess it’s not a loaded-car-pulls-down-an-empty-car
scenario here?

117
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,620
No, no.

118
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,700
Levitation.

119
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,760
Hosses!

120
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,340
Yes! You’re absolutely right, mules.

121
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,810
But they would send down enough cars and then
they would send down the mules...

122
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,020
- In the car?
- In the car...

123
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,740
- In the car.
- That's very good.

124
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,420
- They get a ride!
- And in fact yes, have a point.

125
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,920
- Their little ears…
- That’s probably not how they felt about it, Gary.

126
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,740
Yeah, but the first time they’re like
“what the hell is all this”,

127
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,820
we all would be, but then they’d be like,
“Fantastic.”

128
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,910
They’d be going down and their little ears'd
be flapping in the wind, all like that…

129
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,070
I think you’ve chronically misunderstood
what it is to be a mule, my friend.

130
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,630
And there’s a bloke halfway down doing a
drawing of it

131
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,040
so they can buy it when they get to the bottom
as a souvenir of the day.

132
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,900
There’s always the smart mule

133
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,280
who works out where the etching guy is so
they can make a face.

134
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,000
I reckon people saw the mules come off going,

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,790
“they look pretty excited, I’m having
a go on that”.

136
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,590
That is basically what happened.

137
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,590
I don’t think it was the mules there,

138
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,420
but it was people going
“this is an exciting ride”.

139
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,680
“This is fun wasted on mules”, basically.

140
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,780
And then someone else went,
well, we can charge for this

141
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,270
when there’s not enough coal to move.

142
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,680
Or mules to play with.

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,440
Or...

144
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,640
Steady.

145
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,220
Lonely country town, let's say...

146
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,360
That was basically the
world’s first roller coaster.

147
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,550
Someone sat on the back of one of the mules
as it goes down.

148
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,580
“This is f***ing awesome!”

149
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,200
That is Indiana Jones,
just a century too early.

150
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,210
Nah, that’s Slim Pickens riding the bomb!

151
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,880
Dr Strangelove with a mule in the compartment.

152
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,320
Sadly that has now been dismantled.

153
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,430
There is a trail there you can walk down,

154
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,740
but I imagine that’s not the same.

155
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,680
Ironically a trail there you could ride a
mule down,

156
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,580
which is worse for all concerned,
isn’t it?

157
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,670
You could, or you could ride a mule down on
a little wagon with some wheels.

158
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,750
Oh my God, yeah. ...Wagon Wheels?

159
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,260
They’re just going to go squishy.

160
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,960
They’d overheat and get flat spots!

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,860
Yes, they’re smaller than they used to be
anyway.

162
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,580
You can’t trust a marshmallow bearing.

163
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,400
Can’t, no.

164
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,800
Just overheat and then
you’d get decent speed.

165
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,290
Jam lubricant's all well and good up to 50mph,
but once you go over that...

166
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,580
Yeah. You’re looking for a
stout marmalade aren’t you?

167
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,680
Something fine-cut though.

168
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,830
Oh yeah, you don’t want the bits in it.

169
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,970
You can’t have a coarse shred,
it'll get jammed.

170
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,130
Oh absolutely, absolutely.

171
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,830
Marmite is your breakfast lubricant of choice
isn’t it?

172
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,660
Yes, but it burns up quickly.

173
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,830
It does and gives off quite the odour.

174
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,680
And woe betide the man who uses Branston!

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,880
For breakfast?

176
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,400
Matt, for God’s sake interrupt, you’ve
been going like this for about two minutes.

177
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,900
Yeah, but I go,
“okay, I think they’re finished”,

178
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,230
Oh no, there’s more. Yes. No, they’ve
peaked now. No, they haven’t…

179
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,280
I was just going to say, but then I realised
I was going to give actual advice, saying,

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
“use Maltesers as bearings”
then went that’s just a practical….

181
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,820
Oh yes, yes, you could have a race couldn’t you?
You could have a bearing race!

182
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,520
I’ve misunderstood this conversation, yes,
yes, if you’re actually going to do it…

183
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,639
Yes, Maltesers in.

184
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,020
Chocolate finger, Maltesers…

185
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,400
What’s the outer race though?

186
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,680
Oh, that’s a good point.

187
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,660
Doughnut!

188
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,630
I’m just going to point out for anyone not
in the UK that Wagon Wheels

189
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,400
are a type a big chocolate round biscuit,
so...

190
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,100
- They look a bit like the wheel off a wagon.
- They’re awful.

191
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,260
If your wagon were about yea-high.

192
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,300
No, they’re smaller than that.

193
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,459
Yea-high…

194
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,459
There we go.

195
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,559
So we had the Mauch Chunk Switchback,
which is arguably the first rollercoaster…

196
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,559
For donkeys.

197
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,880
We had the Russian mountains which could also
be early roller coasters, that sort of thing.

198
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,490
By the point that we had the Flip Flap Railway,

199
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,360
there was this idea that you might want to
get in a car that careened down a hill.

200
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,940
What was the Flip Flap Railway adding to that?

201
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,920
Flapping.

202
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,340
Flipping.

203
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,920
It wasn’t an early attempt to do a loop-the-loop
or something?

204
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:26,929
Spot on.

205
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,870
- Oh my god.
- It was the first loop-the-loop in America.

206
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,660
And they got the shape wrong?

207
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,420
Yes!

208
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,580
Were they lured in by the easy appeal of a
nice circle?

209
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,019
Yes, they were, would you like to tell us
some more about this?

210
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,360
Oh, they didn’t think about having a nice, consistent
amount of acceleration on their passengers.

211
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,980
And I bet they were either passing out or
bleeding from the eyeballs by the time…

212
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,509
Or both! They’re not mutually exclusive.

213
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,040
Those poor donkeys.

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,199
You see I thought they’d go too slow and
it’d get to the top

215
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:03,240
and they’d stop and all the donkeys would
fall out.

216
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
Yes. That’s exactly where I was going next.

217
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,740
No, because the problem is, right, the amount
pushing you out as you’re turning...

218
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,459
I’m going to be very careful here, or physics
teachers will email me afterwards.

219
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,970
It depends on the rate at which you’re curving,

220
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,060
and so to stop people from falling out at
the top,

221
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,120
because the curvature of a circle is pretty
consistent,

222
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,499
by the time you get to the top you’ve got
to be going bloody fast

223
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,769
to have enough force to keep you in your seat.

224
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,959
Or the mule.

225
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,430
So what you want to actually do is change
the rate at which your loop is curving

226
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,899
to give you extra force where required.

227
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,809
And so you don’t have do it all with speed,
you can do it with curvature instead.

228
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:40,089
Whereas they tried to do it all with speed
and it didn’t end well.

229
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,100
Yes. They tried... I’ve already given you
biscuits for that

230
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,980
but I feel like a round of applause is required
for that thing.

231
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,399
No further biscuits will ever be issued.
That wins them all, I think.

232
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,480
A circle is too big, so they use an ellipse
to get you over the top very quickly.

233
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,380
How many Gs were they roughly pulling on this
“centrifugal railway”, as it was called?

234
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,079
Anything above… where does it get painful?
It must be over four...

235
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,769
I think modern roller coasters you can briefly
pull about 5Gs. Which will...

236
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,829
So they were probably clipping seven or eight,

237
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:14,930
and that’s going to be very uncomfortable.

238
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,540
Yes, it actually pulled 12Gs.

239
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,020
Oh my God.

240
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,369
Yeah, that’s not good.

241
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:24,180
Not only is it a circular loop, it’s only
a 25 foot circular loop.

242
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,310
That's...!

243
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,589
What were some of the issues with riding this?

244
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:30,730
Your hat would fly off and you would look
ungentlemanly at the end.

245
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,029
Quite the opposite because if anything your
hat is going to be quite stuck to your head.

246
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:38,690
Ah, no, it came off on the little hill down
into it, didn’t it?

247
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,499
Er, no, discomfort and neck injuries from
whiplash.

248
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:45,370
I wouldn’t put discomfort
first in that list.

249
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,940
“Oh dear...”

250
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,400
Discomfort and now I’m like this, yes.

251
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,379
What did they test this with, by the way?

252
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,120
This is at Sea Lion Park at
Coney Island, New York.

253
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,940
- Sea lions?
- Sea lions!

254
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,020
No.

255
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,720
Seals!

256
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,620
Irons!

257
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,160
Okay, not donkeys, not people, not sea lions.

258
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,040
Sh...
A. N. Other livestock?

259
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
Monkeys.

260
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,350
Of course, the monkeys.

261
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,819
Sandbags and monkeys were put down.

262
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:18,499
Sorry! Sandbag... sandbag... “shall we throw
some monkeys in while we’re at it?”

263
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:22,389
“Ah, g'wan… they’ll enjoy it,
the donkeys did.”

264
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:27,100
Sea Lion Park became Luna Park.
Famous names and all that,

265
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,520
but the Flip Flap Railway was not retained,
why not?

266
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,619
Was it killing people, perchance?

267
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:38,009
Because of its unpopularity and reputation,
but I will give you the point.

268
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,240
It was not something you got on a second time.

269
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,040
For one reason or another.

270
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,809
No-one got to the end and went, “again!”,
y'know?

271
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,660
But there is one last legendary theme park
I want to talk about.

272
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,670
Is it Flamingo Land, in...?

273
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,490
No, it is Action Park in New Jersey.

274
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,180
Oh God, this is ringing bells and I have absolutely
no idea why. Augh!

275
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,380
Why might it be legendary, for folks who were
kids in the 1980s in New Jersey?

276
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,230
Because it killed a million, billion people
in their wave pool or something?

277
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,709
It hurt a lot of people, certainly.
I’ll give you the point for it.

278
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,629
So, hang on, wait. Your guess was it killed
a million, billion people

279
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,069
and you’re like, close enough to
“a few people got a bit injured”.

280
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,920
Yeah, like, we're...

281
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,040
The error bars are pretty big
on this show, right?

282
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,480
The error bars are massive on this show.

283
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,009
Feel free to chuck some ideas in.

284
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,390
And the reason I mention this in particular,

285
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,379
to do with all the other
things we’ve talked about,

286
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,980
is that they had the Cannonball Loop.

287
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,360
Uh oh.

288
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,470
Which is very similar to a few of the things
we’ve talked about,

289
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,110
with one important difference.

290
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,160
In a summer park, in a theme park, what did
they have that was a loop-the-loop?

291
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,600
They attempted a water-based loop-the-loop.

292
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,940
- Yes, they did.
- Oh, s***.

293
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,340
It was at their water park.

294
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,180
How do you do that, isn’t the water just
going to fall off at the top?

295
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,760
- Yes.
- And be a shower?

296
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,220
The thing about water is,
it follows the laws of physics.

297
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,589
Ah.

298
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,800
Yes, you are absolutely right.
It was a looping waterslide.

299
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,850
Not the modern kind, there are a couple of
modern looping water-slides,

300
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,839
they do an interesting kind of curve that
technically takes you over.

301
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,800
This was...

302
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,320
Circle.

303
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,040
That would take off your clothes wouldn’t
it?

304
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,500
No, the thing about clothes…

305
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,900
What, it’s really seductive
as you go through the loop...

306
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,200
No, but I thought, is that what happens...

307
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,410
“I see you’ve come to join me in the loop.

308
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,300
“How 'bout we get you out of those wet things?”

309
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,240
It would certainly… having had a couple of
waterslide incidents,

310
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,899
shall we say, moments of unpleasantness...

311
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:52,019
No, it doesn’t take your clothes off.
Riders were weighed and hosed down with cold water.

312
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,019
What?

313
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,430
And then instructed how to position their
bodies to complete the ride.

314
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,840
No. I’m already not getting on this.

315
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:05,300
You just wanted an excuse to pose,
let’s be honest here.

316
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
It was a laugh.

317
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,130
But you get on top of the ride and someone,

318
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,389
before you even get on the ride,
you’re at a water park.

319
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:14,119
You’re hoping, I assume, to drop into
nice, warm, bath-like water at the end.

320
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:16,930
The last thing you want is some bloke with
a hose pipe

321
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,200
with a little spray gun on the end going,
“right, arms up.”

322
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,800
They sent some test dummies down first,

323
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:23,230
what were the reports on what
happened to them?

324
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,360
They didn’t come down in one,
is what I’m going to guess.

325
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,540
Yes, that’s absolutely right, they were
dismembered on the way down.

326
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,790
And one unfortunate person
at the top of the loop, what happened?

327
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,259
Their clothes fell off.

328
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,790
Trousers caught on a nail! Just hanging there
in space getting showered on.

329
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,740
It was a closed loop. It was a closed tube.

330
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,170
Oh, they’re in a locked…

331
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,779
You know, this is the first one you’ve described

332
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,790
where I’m still thinking
“I want a go on this”.

333
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,980
They got stuck at the top and they had to
add a hatch at one point

334
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,189
to remove people who got stuck at the top

335
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:55,709
and didn’t want to go down the other side.

336
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,959
Yes, because you’re on this surface now,

337
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,489
and as you go down you’re going to have
that sheer drop.

338
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:03,910
Yes, “shump, clunk, dunk”, carry on.

339
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,910
Yes, there had to be “extractions”, as
it was put here, which is... not great.

340
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,670
So this person got physically stuck as in
they were too large?

341
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,730
No, they just weren’t going fast enough.

342
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,050
Oh my god.

343
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,369
Employees were offered $100 to test it and
I’m going to quote,

344
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:24,040
“100 bucks did not buy enough booze
to drown out that memory.”

345
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,960
I’m with Matt, I want a go on this.

346
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,540
At the end of the show, congratulations Matt,
you win this week.

347
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,700
Congratulations.

348
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,440
You win a brand new armoured fighting vehicle

349
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
that is actually an old fighting vehicle just
rebooted to look modern.

350
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,200
It’s a JJ Abrams tank.

351
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Ohhh.

352
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,960
So with that we say thank you to Chris Joel,

353
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,400
to Gary Brannan,

354
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,900
and to Matt Parker.

355
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,420
I’ve been Tom Scott
and we’ll see you next time.
