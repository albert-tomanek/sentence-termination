00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,050
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,720
why are Tibetans in China this happy?

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,160
Because they have to be.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,519
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,589
As you may know,

7
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:17,640
Tibet has been part of China since ancient
times.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,540
Which is why, in the 1950s,

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,580
the Chinese authorities had to liberate Tibet.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,380
From being part of China... already?

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,260
Yeah, it’s complicated.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,310
But at the time,

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,900
Tibet was in a perilous state,

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,680
and had been for decades—

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,690
because it was controlled by a cruel,

16
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,680
oppressive dictator.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,540
Fortunately, in 1959 it was finally liberated

18
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,020
by a benevolent, democratic leader—

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,810
Sure, Mao Zedong did kill an estimated 1 million
Tibetans.

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,260
But he also believed in fairness.

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,329
Mao killed millions of people in other parts
of China, too.

22
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,329
But anyway,

23
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,210
Tibetans are definitely happier now that they’re
free...

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,160
to be part of the People’s Republic of China
forever.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,329
And in all seriousness,

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,030
as long as the Chinese Communist Party rules
China,

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,539
they will never allow Tibet be an independent
country.

28
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,060
But you might be wondering—why?

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,000
Why would the Party bother sending troops
to Tibet,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,549
subjugating its population,

31
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,369
and dealing with the decades of international
backlash

32
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,039
for its occupation there?

33
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,259
I mean, the issue comes up every time

34
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,760
the Dalai Lama meets a world leader.

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,560
And it’s so embarrassing.

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,590
Well it turns out the CCP’s interest in
Tibet

37
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,499
is about more than just making sure

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,400
the citizens there are happy.

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,780
I know, you’re shocked.

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,530
In the CCP’s view,

41
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,969
controlling Tibet is part of China’s national
security.

42
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,990
And there are three main parts:

43
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,219
Borders, minerals, and water.

44
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,930
You’ll notice that “people”

45
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,600
did not make it into the top three.

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,680
People are disposable.

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,060
It’s the land that’s precious.

48
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,780
So Borders.

49
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,040
This is Tibet.

50
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,359
It’s huge.

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,130
It accounts for about 13% of all the landmass
of China.

52
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,939
And that’s just the arbitrarily drawn Tibet
Autonomous Region.

53
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,560
Historical Tibet was twice as big,

54
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,120
and there are Tibetan people living in these
areas today.

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,260
These are the Himalayan mountains.

56
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,599
They divide China from India, Nepal, and Bhutan.

57
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,350
And it’s this natural border that makes
Tibet so valuable.

58
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,060
The steep mountains and harsh climate

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,150
make travel across the border next to impossible.

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,299
A three-week death hike across the Himalayas
stops

61
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,760
way more intruders than a concrete border
wall.

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,439
Especially if you were, say, an invading Indian
army.

63
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,040
China and India have been rivals for a long
time.

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,920
They’ve fought wars over the border

65
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,840
between Tibet and India.

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,510
If Tibet were its own, independent country,

67
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,269
which neighbor do you think it would prefer
to trade with,

68
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,959
and do military drills with,

69
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,040
and go out to dinner and a movie with:

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,060
China or India?

71
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,360
And while Tibet has this impregnable mountain

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
border wall on one side,

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,540
....the other side is, well, still rugged,

74
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,520
but it’s no Mount Everest.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,319
Also now there are several good roads

76
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,400
and even a rail line connecting Tibet to China.

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,890
So not exactly impenetrable.

78
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,760
China has understood the border issue for
a long time.

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
“When British forces began making inroads
into Tibet from India

80
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,310
in the early 1900s”,

81
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,739
...The ruling Qing Dynasty freaked out

82
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,700
because they knew exactly what that could
mean.

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,590
And today, the CCP does not want some allied
Indian army

84
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,800
hanging out in Tibet,

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,370
next to some completely useless border.

86
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,370
After all,

87
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,260
good mountain ranges make good neighbors.

88
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,530
And there’s another important reason

89
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,810
the CCP wants to control Tibet:

90
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,810
Minerals.

91
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,560
The Tibetan plateau stores an estimated

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,069
$130 billion dollars worth of mineral reserves.

93
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,469
Those include key manufacturing ingredients,

94
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,069
like iron to make steel,

95
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,510
gold to make electronics,

96
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,749
and lead to make bullets.

97
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,609
I mean, batteries.

98
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,200
There are also rarer metals,

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,900
like lithium, mercury, and uranium.

100
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,900
For decades,

101
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,969
the CCP has been importing a lot of minerals

102
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,530
from foreign countries to supply its manufacturing
industries.

103
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,530
For example,

104
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,980
right now it’s cheaper for China to import
copper from Chile

105
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,060
than to mine it in Tibet.

106
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,440
But that’s changing,

107
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,660
because the CCP is incentivizing companies

108
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,650
to mine in Tibet.

109
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,070
They do this by, for example,

110
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,820
giving mining companies exemptions

111
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,440
from cumbersome environmental rules.

112
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,410
That’s why parts of Tibet are becoming

113
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,580
environmental disaster zones,

114
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,560
with polluted air, water and soil.

115
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,190
But the CCP wants to make sure that it can

116
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,830
mine important minerals in house—

117
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,540
in case, I don’t know,

118
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,030
other countries decide that the CCP is sucking
them dry

119
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,840
and put export tariffs on their minerals.

120
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,650
The third major reason the CCP wants to control
Tibet

121
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,420
is water.

122
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,680
Tibet is the giant peach-shaped water tower
of Asia.

123
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,650
Most of the major river systems in Asia originate
in Tibet

124
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,830
or from the larger Tibetan plateau.

125
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,190
Those include the two main rivers

126
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,650
that have sustained most of China’s population

127
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,900
for millennia:

128
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,540
The Yellow River and the Yangtze River.

129
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,490
Imagine if Tibet were independent,

130
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,390
and Tibet decided to somehow dam up those
rivers,

131
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,410
or re-route them!

132
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,980
It would be a disaster for China.

133
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,280
I know that sounds far-fetched.

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,700
How could the CCP ever think that Tibet

135
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
would do that to them?

136
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,900
Well, because the CCP is currently doing that

137
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,740
to other countries.

138
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,430
This is the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet.

139
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,790
It’s also called the Brahmaputra River

140
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,650
as it flows down through eastern India and
Bangladesh.

141
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,120
It’s a really important river for those
two countries.

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,560
And the CCP is in the process of damming it
up.

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,320
It already built this,

144
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,790
the Zangmu hydroelectric power station.

145
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,830
It has plans for as many as two dozen more
dams

146
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,850
along the same river.

147
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,810
The CCP also has plans to divert some of this
river

148
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,380
to dry parts of northern China.

149
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,300
That sounds great to the CCP,

150
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,230
but it means the people of India and Bangladesh

151
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,560
will get less water,

152
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,630
and there’s nothing they can do about it

153
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,640
because the CCP controls the source.

154
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,310
The CCP also controls the headwaters of rivers

155
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,820
that flow to Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia,

156
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,400
Thailand, and Vietnam.

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,400
So you can understand,

158
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,590
that with so much power over China’s water

159
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,560
and other countries’ water,

160
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,950
Tibet is a precious strategic resource.

161
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,230
That’s why the Chinese Communist Party

162
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,000
will never allow a free Tibet.

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,250
The only hope is a future China controlled
by

164
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,120
a not terrible, brutal, manipulative regime.

165
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,400
