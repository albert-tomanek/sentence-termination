1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,649
If you don’t like how China has handled
the coronavirus...

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:05,760
you’d better keep your mouth shut.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,330
Or else, you’re a racist!

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,640
At least, that’s what the Chinese Communist
Party says.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,460
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,940
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,970
In our last segment, I showed you how the
Chinese Communist Party

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,800
covered up the coronavirus, and used ruthless
authoritarian tactics

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,770
to suppress its citizens...

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,399
...and yet still managed to turn it into a
propaganda win.

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,329
Watch that segment if you haven’t already.

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,399
It’s a great lesson on how to create a huge
mess

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,550
and then make everyone believe you are saving
them

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,699
from the mess that you created.

15
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,620
But some people here in the west continue
to criticize how

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,449
the Chinese Communist Party has handled the
coronavirus.

17
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:59,190
Like how they covered it up for weeks,

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,620
which is why it’s now a global pandemic.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,789
That makes it much harder for the Chinese
Communist Party

20
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:08,710
to claim they’ve saved the world.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,420
Which is why the Party has a new term for
the people who criticize them:

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,869
Racist.

23
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,060
Just look at this article

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,860
in my favorite Chinese state-run media, the
Global Times:

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,630
“Racism shows ugly side as China fights
coronavirus.”

26
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,979
I feel like the Communist Party really gets
us.

27
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,560
As soon as they made it about racism,

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,570
American media latched onto it.

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,310
And sure, I get it.

30
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,439
There have been documented instances of racism,

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,399
from the predictable to the weird.

32
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,950
Like this questionable Corona Time photo from
Belgium.

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,140
And this Mexican performance with a dancing
coronavirus,

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,079
wearing a conical hat and a fu manchu.

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,299
And then, from New York City...

36
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,439
“This video, showing a man on the subway

37
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,950
spraying an Asian man with Febreze.”

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,060
Which is not only racist, but also bad science.

39
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,040
Febreze cannot neutralize the virus.

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,531
Also, what kind of person carries around of
Febreze?

41
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,360
There have also been more serious cases of
allegedly racist attacks.

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,920
Anyway, all this is to say, there have definitely
been cases

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,020
of individuals being racist towards Chinese
people—

44
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,670
or I guess towards Asians in general,

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,970
since racist people don’t always try to
make that distinction.

46
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,500
But that’s not what the Chinese Communist
Party is concerned about.

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,900
What they’re doing is accusing governments

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,340
and media organizations of being racist.

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,610
And using that to push their own propaganda.

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,680
For example, in February, as the Chinese economy
was crashing

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,880
from the impact of the Communist Party’s
massive quarantines,

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,020
the Wall Street Journal published this editorial,

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,860
calling China the real sick man of Asia.

54
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,690
“Sick man of BLANK”

55
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,080
actually refers to a country that’s in trouble
economically—

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,640
and that’s very clear if you actually read
the article.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,850
But as I talked about in a previous episode,

58
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,010
“Sick Man of Asia” is a term

59
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,380
that has historically been considered racist
in China,

60
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,910
dating back to the early 20th century.

61
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,650
So it’s not surprising that Chinese state-run
media

62
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,620
demanded an apology for the “racist headline.”

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,630
In fact, they published dozens of articles
that criticized

64
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,270
the “racist” and “anti-China” reaction
to the coronavirus

65
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,370
that used the Wall Street Journal article
as the main example.

66
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,010
And Chinese authorities expelled three Wall
Street Journal reporters from China

67
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,340
after it came out...

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,400
...though the expulsion was probably not really
about the headline,

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,930
as much as it was getting rid of Western journalists
in China.

70
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,790
Chinese state-run media also cried racism

71
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,770
when a newspaper in Denmark published this
image.

72
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,330
The article criticized the Chinese regime’s
coverup of the coronavirus.

73
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,070
The Chinese embassy demanded an apology.

74
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,760
Which they did not get.

75
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,870
Because the image wasn’t racist against
Chinese people.

76
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,850
It was satirizing the Chinese government,

77
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,959
which allowed the virus to spread

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,460
because it covered it up for almost two months!

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,210
Foreign governments are not immune to charges
of racism, either.

80
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,560
That Chinese state media article says the
Australian government’s

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,520
travel ban on people who had recently been
in China

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,540
“provoked a new resurgence of racism.”

83
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,490
Even though the ban was only on people coming
to Australia from mainland China.

84
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,400
It did not target ethnically Chinese people
coming to Australia from elsewhere,

85
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,410
including Taiwan.

86
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,440
So the travel ban targeted the country that
had the outbreak,

87
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,180
not Chinese people.

88
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,120
So really, when it comes to media and governments,

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,930
what we’ve been seeing is not racism,

90
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:08,220
but words and actions specifically targeted
at the country of China

91
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,440
and its ruling regime, the Chinese Communist
Party.

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,150
But that nuance is intentionally ignored by
the Chinese Communist Party

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,490
and its state-run media.

94
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,820
They want to conflate those issues to play
the racism card.

95
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,470
Let me show you exactly how they do it.

96
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,330
Here’s an opinion piece in the LA Times,

97
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,710
written by the head of the Chinese consulate
in Los Angeles.

98
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,861
First he spends half the article

99
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:42,100
praising China’s response to the coronavirus,

100
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,680
claiming that its response saved the rest
of the world,

101
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,580
and repeating how the World Health Organization
is praising China.

102
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,300
This is exactly the type of propaganda spin

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,950
we talked about in our previous segment.

104
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,530
But here’s the key paragraph.

105
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,870
The Chinese diplomat brings up

106
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,880
“disturbing reports from around the world
about discrimination

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,169
and stigmatization of the Chinese community.”

108
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,590
What kind of discrimination?

109
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,940
Xenophobia on social media, attacks on Chinese
people,

110
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,200
and discrimination against Chinese doctors.

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,980
Then in the very next sentence, he says,

112
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,230
“And despite its unparalleled response to
the crisis,

113
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,389
the Chinese government has been attacked by
some people

114
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,960
out of ideological prejudice.”

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,060
In three sentences,

116
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,830
this Chinese diplomat equates criticism of
the Chinese government

117
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,230
with\h xenophobia and physical attacks against
Chinese people.

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,680
He’s saying they’re the same thing.

119
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,390
That’s the trick.

120
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,600
They’re taking individual cases of racism,

121
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,940
and mixing them with targeted actions against
the Chinese government

122
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,210
and targeted criticisms of the Chinese regime.

123
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,520
And state-run media are spinning it as “the
West is racist against China.”

124
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,730
Yes, that’s the trick and people are falling
for it.

125
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,860
In fact, Chinese state-run media have even
gone so far as to say

126
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,960
racism is a worse enemy than the epidemic.

127
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,980
Oh right.

128
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,370
It’s *racism* that’s killed 6,000 people
in the past two months.

129
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,410
In February, Chinese state-run media

130
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,560
had criticized the US for implementing a travel
ban

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,290
on people who had recently been inside China.

132
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,380
And then in March, Chinese state-run media
upped their game:

133
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,870
claiming it’s racist to even say the coronavirus
originated in China.

134
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,300
This Global Times article says

135
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,120
“Some American officials, including Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo,

136
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,090
are using ‘Wuhan virus’ which is considered
a racist term.”

137
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,449
So even though the first cases of the coronavirus
were in Wuhan, China...

138
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,650
it’s racist to say that?

139
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,650
Yes.

140
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,639
Apparently it is.

141
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,850
Because starting in late February,

142
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,210
Chinese state media began spinning a new narrative:

143
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,610
the idea that the coronavirus “may not originate
in China.”

144
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,400
Yes, the origin “still hangs in the air.”

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,730
And soon, Chinese social media sites began

146
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,010
“pushing the idea that the virus really
originated in the United States.”

147
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,230
And then, the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson
tweeted that,

148
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,180
“It might be [the] US army who brought the
epidemic to Wuhan.”

149
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,789
Now, at first glance, this seems crazy.

150
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,139
But the more they push that idea,

151
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,300
the more people will actually start to question

152
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,070
whether it really did start in China,

153
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:47,079
especially when you can’t say it did without
being called racist.

154
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,220
The good news is that the US government

155
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,100
is not letting them get away with it.

156
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,449
Last week, the State Department summoned the
Chinese Ambassador

157
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,790
over the Foreign Ministry spokesperson’s
tweets.

158
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,569
And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned
China’s efforts

159
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,490
to shift the coronavirus blame on the US,

160
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,240
in a phone call with a communist party official.

161
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,670
But that hasn’t stopped the Chinese government
from pushing the idea

162
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,730
that no one knows where the coronavirus really
came from.

163
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,990
And now, when someone suggests the coronavirus
originated in China,

164
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,470
they cry racism!

165
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,529
What’s incredible is how quickly the narrative
shifted.

166
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,490
Because just 8 weeks ago,

167
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,620
Chinese state media had specifically referred
to the coronavirus

168
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,490
as the “Wuhan virus.”

169
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,629
But what’s even more incredible is how some
Western media

170
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,579
have completely bought into the Chinese Communist
Party’s narrative

171
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,600
about racism.

172
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,260
For example, after a US congressman referred
to the “Wuhan virus” in a tweet...

173
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,529
...the media jumped on it, saying the remark
stirred a ‘racism’ debate.

174
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,339
“GOP lawmakers continue to use ‘Wuhan
virus’ or ‘Chinese coronavirus’”.

175
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:03,860
And “Republicans face backlash over racist
labeling”.

176
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,680
Nicely done, Chinese Communist Party.

177
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,010
You know us so well.

178
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,160
It’s only been a few months since the outbreak.

179
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,679
And instead of the West criticizing you for
your massive coverup

180
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,360
that turned it into a global pandemic that’s
killed thousands of people,

181
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,759
you’ve got us fighting ourselves over racism.

182
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,720
Now, I’m not going to argue about whether
the term

183
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,499
Chinese coronavirus or Wuhan coronavirus is
racist or not.

184
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:36,970
No, I’ll be tackling that in an episode
of my new show,

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,970
Racism Unleashed.

186
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,129
What’s that, Shelley?

187
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:44,410
Ok, I’m being told that’s a terrible idea
for a show.

188
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,490
But my point is, the Chinese Communist Party
is using accusations of racism

189
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,740
to cover their own butts.

190
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,110
The fact that they can also use accusations
of racism

191
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,360
to get us to fight with each other forever
is just a bonus.

192
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,610
So dear viewers, I have a suggestion.

193
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,740
Let’s not call it the “Wuhan coronavirus”
or the “Chinese coronavirus.”

194
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,990
It was the Chinese Communist Party that turned
a small number of infections

195
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,689
into a global pandemic by covering it up—

196
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:20,730
and that’s exactly what they’re trying
to distract us from.

197
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,449
So let’s call it what it really is: The
“CCP Coronavirus.”

198
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,329
It’s hard to argue *that’s* racist.

199
00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:34,749
Next up, I’ll answer a question from a member
of our 50-Cent Army.

200
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:37,730
Those are the people who support China Uncensored
through Patreon.

201
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,610
DeBrainz asks:

202
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,119
“Does the CCP have any influence in choosing
medical managers

203
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,279
inside Chinese hospitals?

204
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,649
If so, how does it work?

205
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,610
In the US, a board of directors chooses the
most qualified a

206
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,309
nd experienced medical professional in a department
to be the manager.”

207
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,139
Good question.

208
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,259
Broadly speaking, the answer is yes.

209
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,639
I’m not saying US hospitals are always a
meritocracy.

210
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,189
But in China, qualification and experience

211
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:10,749
cannot be the most important criteria in any
big organization.

212
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:14,519
That’s because organizations with 50-plus
employees in China

213
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,679
are required to have a Communist Party branch.

214
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,429
Party representatives will make sure that
the decision-makers in that company

215
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:22,850
are loyal to the Party.

216
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,089
A company that’s disloyal to the Party will
be punished or be shut down,

217
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,800
so it’s in each company’s interest to
make sure the people in charge

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,059
toe the Party line.

219
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,459
That’s why many people join the Party.

220
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,329
It’s not because they are fans,

221
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,779
but because it’s a solid career move.

222
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,939
The person in charge might also be qualified
professionally,

223
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,389
but the Party generally has a hand in who
gets promoted.

224
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,759
Thanks for your question.

225
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,259
And thanks for watching.

226
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:52,110
Support China Uncensored by pledging a dollar
or more per episode,

227
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,899
so we can keep covering the coronavirus,

228
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,880
even as YouTube demonetizes us.

229
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,200
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

230
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,280
See you next time.
