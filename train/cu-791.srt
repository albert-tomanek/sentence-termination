1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,800
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,470
a missile defense system can’t protect you

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,380
against your own hypocrisy!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,300
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,030
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,870
The Chinese Communist Party is furious!

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,210
Again…

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,700
To be more specific,

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,250
the Chinese regime is furious about THAAD,

10
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,110
or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,020
That’s the system the US is installing in
South Korea

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,330
that will protect them from

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,820
a North Korean missile strike.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,380
The only thing I want to emphasize

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,750
is that we resolutely oppose the deployment
of THAAD

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,260
in South Korea.

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,780
How dare the United States

18
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,079
try to help protect its ally

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,540
from a rogue regime’s nuclear weapons...

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,540
...that it was able to develop because of
support

21
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,160
from the Chinese regime.

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,250
I mean, it’s not like China is going around
building

23
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,270
missile defense systems for other countries.

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,680
Oh.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,809
So apparently, China is helping Pakistan

26
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,880
build something similar to THAAD,

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,829
called LOMADS.

28
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,960
LOMADS stands for

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,889
Low-to-Medium Altitude Air Defense System.

30
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:10,420
LOMADS also describes how the Chinese regime

31
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,139
feels about THAAD,

32
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,329
a low level of constant mad.

33
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,829
LOMADS is capable of tracking

34
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:18,590
and destroying targets that—

35
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,859
you guessed it—

36
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,390
fly at low to medium altitudes.

37
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,180
Let’s just hope those made-in-China rockets

38
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,150
don’t explode prematurely,

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,329
like those Chinese watermelons.

40
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,469
So why is China helping Pakistan

41
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,420
build a missile defense system?

42
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,729
Because India.

43
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,139
Well, not only India.

44
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,810
But according to this Congressional report,

45
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,950
Beijing has long exploited the longstanding
rivalry

46
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,240
between India and Pakistan,

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,380
aiming to keep India so preoccupied

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,779
with its western neighbor

49
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,119
that it will not have the ability to mount

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,270
a serious challenge to China’s power and
influence

51
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,270
in Asia.

52
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,759
That’s also one of the reasons why China

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,959
helped Pakistan build its first nuclear bomb,

54
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,310
as well as Pakistan’s indigenous

55
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,039
ballistic missile capability.

56
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,979
You see, China and India don't really get
along.

57
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,470
It's kind of like when you have that one

58
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,599
next-door neighbor that you dislike

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
because he's harboring a certain spiritual
leader

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,290
in his house,

61
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,020
after that leader fled your house

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,349
that was really kind of his house

63
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,450
that you liberated from him.

64
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,790
Also, you and this neighbor

65
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,239
briefly went to war over who owns the big
oak tree

66
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,239
that grows in the middle of your shared property line.

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,700
But more importantly,

68
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,980
India has the potential to be

69
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,890
a major economic rival to China.

70
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,090
India’s GDP is growing rapidly.

71
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,940
It recently even surpassed Great Britain.

72
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,990
Which is a delicious irony—

73
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,650
if you’re not from Great Britain.

74
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,290
India, like China,

75
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,180
has a huge population,

76
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,520
around 1.2 billion people.

77
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,829
But India has a distinct advantage:

78
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,840
India’s population is mostly young,

79
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,400
while China’s is aging rapidly.

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,719
And that’s why, boys and girls,

81
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,980
brutal population control is not the best

82
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,910
long-term policy.

83
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,659
Anyway, China has been undermining India

84
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,269
in a variety of ways.

85
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:12,189
They’ve sent nuclear submarines

86
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,560
into the Indian Ocean.

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
And more recently,

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
China blocked a motion

89
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,189
to add a Pakistani terrorist leader

90
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:22,400
to a UN Security Council Blacklist.

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
India, for its part,

92
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,400
hasn’t let China’s actions go unnoticed.

93
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,620
They’re seeking a 2.5 billion dollar deal
with Israel

94
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,269
for their own missile defense system.

95
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,260
The Indian one will be called LRSAM,

96
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,410
which is based on the Israeli one called SPYDER.

97
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,340
C’mon Israel!

98
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,239
That is really stretching the acronym thing.

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,359
Although I guess it is the only one

100
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,510
that's an actual word.

101
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,790
At the end of last year,

102
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,989
India also purchased a Russian-made missile
defense system

103
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:55,900
that will be delivered by 2020.

104
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,269
It’s called the S-400 Triumf.

105
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,390
Which is not an acronym at all.

106
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,470
It’s just what you get when you ask a first-grader

107
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,260
to spell a word they've never heard before.

108
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,760
But it’s still pretty impressive.

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,780
Look at the long list of missiles and aircraft

110
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,019
this Russian-made missile system can shoot
down…

111
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,109
Wait a minute,

112
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,820
those are all American planes!

113
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,680
Ohhhh, Russia!

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,620
Anyway, India is building up its missile defenses.

115
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,060
For many observers, this is understandable,

116
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,140
because India has had several wars with Pakistan.

117
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,070
Just like it’s understandable that South
Korea and the US

118
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,350
are building THAAD

119
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,610
because North Korea has threatened to turn
Seoul and Washington

120
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,250
into a heap of ashes.

121
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,820
Which is a totally stupid threat.

122
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,820
It should be “heaps of ashes,” plural.

123
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,070
Obviously Seoul and Washington would be

124
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,210
two separate heaps.

125
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,820
Anyway, while China is helping Pakistan

126
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,670
build a missile defense against India,

127
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,560
China is hypocritically complaining about
the US

128
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,540
helping South Korea build a missile defense

129
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,510
against North Korea.

130
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,890
But it’s not just some crybaby complaint.

131
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,820
It’s a strategic crybaby complaint.

132
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,450
As this report says,

133
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,980
China hopes to create the impression that

134
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,100
American defensive missiles,

135
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,160
not China's new offensive missiles,

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,090
threaten peace in Asia.

137
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,110
Sound like a report on the current situation

138
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,020
with THAAD and South Korea?

139
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,960
Well, it’s actually a report from 1999.

140
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,760
This has been the Chinese regime’s strategy

141
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,090
for a long time,

142
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,090
since even before I came on the scene.

143
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,690
The Chinese Communist Party has two goals

144
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,250
in complaining about America’s

145
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,970
missile defense in South Korea:

146
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,340
One, to ensure these missile defense systems

147
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,160
can never be used against China.

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
And two,

149
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,960
to undermine American influence in Asia.

150
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,440
So you can see why the Chinese regime

151
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,190
might criticize THAAD,

152
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,890
even as it helps Pakistan build LOMADS,

153
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,560
while also keeping an eye on India's LRSAM,

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,690
based on SPYDER,

155
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,000
not to mention the S-400

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,080
Triumf, the Insult Comic Missile Defense System.

157
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,720
So what do you think of China’s concerns
over THAAD

158
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,200
and support of Pakistan’s LOMADS?
