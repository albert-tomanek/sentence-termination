1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,280
Chinese leaders announce new solutions...

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,830
to fix the crisis in Hong Kong.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,380
There’s just one problem:

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,880
They’ve already tried them before.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,300
And guess how that turned out?

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,660
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,560
Another weekend of pro-democracy protests
in Hong Kong

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,080
left dozens of people injured,

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,599
and one man in critical condition.

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,390
In one shocking incident,

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,840
a man shouting pro-Beijing slogans

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,450
slashed four people with a knife.

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,960
And then he bit off part of the ear of a pro-democracy
politician.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,120
Somebody’s been picking up tips from watching
old Mike Tyson fights.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,020
It’s gotten so bad,

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,520
journalists even wore hardhats

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,180
to a police press conference in protest of
police violence.

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,290
Stop.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,400
Police.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,520
Lies.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Get it?

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
The police did.

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,790
But the only thing they stopped was the press
conference.

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,149
Anyway, the Hong Kong crisis is clearly in
need of a solution.

26
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:19,069
Fortunately, someone’s finally going to
step in and solve everything:

27
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:20,069
These guys.

28
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:23,350
I’m sure it’s going to be the perfect
solution.

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,409
Last week was the Fourth Plenum.

30
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,650
It sounds like some weird astrological thing.

31
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,069
But it’s actually the annual super secret
meeting

32
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:34,460
of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central
Committee.

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,600
During that meeting,

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,479
top leaders put their noggins together,

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,850
and came up with three brilliant proposals
for Hong Kong.

36
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,610
The first of the three proposals is that Beijing

37
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,139
will support Hong Kong’s efforts to quote
unquote

38
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,509
“strengthen law-enforcement capabilities.”

39
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,970
That’s not exactly a new idea.

40
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,880
It’s actually a lot like the anti-subversion
law

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,740
they proposed back in 2003.

42
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,609
It was called Article 23.

43
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,299
Article 23 was designed to prohibit

44
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,749
“any act of treason, secession,

45
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,759
sedition, and subversion”

46
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,899
by the people of Hong Kong.

47
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,239
Basically, it would mean that a bunch of things

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,370
that were illegal in China but allowed in
Hong Kong,

49
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,849
would now also be illegal in Hong Kong—

50
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,379
things like criticizing the government.

51
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,680
The only problem was,

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,189
the people of Hong Kong didn’t like Article
23.

53
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,590
They were afraid it would be used to crack
down

54
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,240
on pro-democracy marches and undermine the
rule of law.

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,989
I wonder where they got that idea.

56
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,269
So they protested.

57
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,970
Actually, half a million people protested.

58
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,069
And the Hong Kong government backed down,

59
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,550
and withdrew Article 23.

60
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,390
That’s why, as one expert puts it,

61
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,349
with last week’s proposal,

62
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,440
the Chinese leadership “is just re-doubling
its efforts

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,939
to implement more strenuously a policy

64
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,959
that caused the problems in Hong Kong in the
first place.”

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,530
Ok, so the first idea might not work.

66
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,159
But don’t worry.

67
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,650
Chines leaders have a second proposal, too.

68
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,439
See, as any good Maoist will tell you,

69
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,930
the best way to get people on your side is
to brainwash them.

70
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,200
That’s why the new proposal calls for patriotic
education in schools,

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,840
to help kids understand from an early age...

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,760
that they should love the Chinese Communist
Party.

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,019
The only problem is,

74
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,209
they tried a similar scheme back in 2012.

75
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,819
And it didn't go well.

76
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,049
People protested.

77
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,560
School students led the protests.

78
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,000
That included weeks of sit-ins,

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,270
and massive street demonstrations.

80
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,269
Finally the Hong Kong government got the message

81
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,840
that the kids don't need no thought control.

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,109
Though a bit of education in spelling wouldn't
hurt.

83
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,629
So that patriotic education proposal

84
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:59,190
that fell through seven years ago?

85
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,069
It might not work so well this time, either.

86
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,079
So the first and second ideas might be a bust.

87
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,670
But don’t worry!

88
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,189
Because the brilliant Party leadership

89
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:12,459
has a third great proposal.

90
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,560
They plan to change how Hong Kong’s Chief
Executive

91
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,299
is appointed and removed.

92
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,100
What does that mean?

93
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,880
“There was no elaboration.”

94
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Oh.

95
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,140
So they could mean that Hong Kong’s leader

96
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,960
would be removed in the middle of the night

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,740
to an undisclosed location.

98
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,520
Ok, probably not.

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,539
But it does smell a lot like the proposal

100
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,510
they had back in 2014.

101
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,250
See, in 2013, the Hong Kongers

102
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,810
had been promised universal suffrage.

103
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,819
That is, they would get to directly elect
their Chief Executive.

104
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,169
But then in 2014,

105
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,650
Beijing modified that promise, saying,

106
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,380
“Yes, you can elect your Chief Executive...

107
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,130
but first we get to pick the candidates.”

108
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,190
Which is like saying,

109
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,599
“As I promised, you can have anything you
want for dinner.

110
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:07,490
Choose between broccoli, cauliflower, or brussels
sprouts.”

111
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,720
By the way, for anyone watching

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,810
who finds those options delicious,

113
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,169
you’re wrong.

114
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,789
The joke is that they’re all terrible.

115
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:17,270
Anyway, Beijing’s proposal about getting
to pick

116
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,790
Hong Kong’s candidates was massively unpopular.

117
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,500
Hongkongers didn't like it, and protested.

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,970
The police met the protesters

119
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,810
with some light tear gas and pepper spray.

120
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,930
And so protesters pulled out umbrellas to
use as shields.

121
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,849
This was the start of the Umbrella Movement.

122
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,040
People were so upset that the CCP

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,690
tried to rig the election that they continued
to protest.

124
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,400
They set up tents, and occupied three main
Hong Kong thoroughfares.

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,050
It lasted 79 days.

126
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,030
Eventually, police came in and cleared them
out.

127
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,360
And arrested a bunch of people.

128
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,660
Oh, and Hongkongers never got the right

129
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,300
to elect their Chief Executive.

130
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Just a guess here,

131
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,289
but Beijing’s new plans last week

132
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,979
to “change how Hong Kong’s leader is appointed
and removed”

133
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,639
...probably don’t include giving the people
universal suffrage.

134
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
All this is to say, that the Chinese Communist
Party’s

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
newest solution to end the current Hong Kong
protests

136
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,889
involves three proposals—

137
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,040
that are just like proposals that all *caused*

138
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,069
massive protests in the past.

139
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,099
So is this one of those things where,

140
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,879
“If at first you don’t succeed, try try
again”?

141
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,879
Or is it like,

142
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,830
“The definition of insanity is doing the
same thing

143
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,009
over and over again

144
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,389
and expecting different results”?

145
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,720
My guess is it’ll be more like,

146
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,190
“Putting out a fire by pouring gasoline
on it.”

147
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,610
Which is either stupid...or evil genius.

148
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,160
If their proposals push the protests to spiral
out of control,

149
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,560
Beijing will have no choice

150
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,569
but to send in the People’s Armed Police

151
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,169
to “restore harmony.”

152
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,750
After all, according this video

153
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,259
purposefully released by state-run media,

154
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,099
they’ve been training.

155
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,099
So what do you think?

156
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,389
Leave your comments below.

157
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,129
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

158
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,979
from a fan who supports episodes like this

159
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,520
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

160
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,750
Anders Andersson asks:

161
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,681
“How comes the Hongkong Police

162
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:22,949
[are] so loyal to CCP to quell the protestors
(and violent)?

163
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:23,949
Are they mainlanders?

164
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:24,949
Good question, Anders.

165
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,000
I’ve had the distinct...pleasure, let’s
call it...

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,009
of being in Hong Kong during the 2014 Umbrella
Movement...

167
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,220
and then later during the recent,

168
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,900
um, 2019 Tear Gas Movement.

169
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,050
The police changed in five years.

170
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,620
In 2014, the police officers were mostly polite.

171
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,349
There were a few clashes,

172
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,199
and there were a few police groups that were
more troublesome.

173
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,270
But the main body of police just tried to
protect everyone.

174
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,349
When I was in Hong Kong last month,

175
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,419
it was completely different.

176
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,669
The police are out of control, and violent.

177
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,030
Yes, there are rumors that some of them

178
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,379
have been brought in from mainland China.

179
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,970
That might explain why they’re acting like
mainland thugs.

180
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,330
But so far, those are just rumors.

181
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,400
But either way, Hong Kong police commanders

182
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,330
have pretty much given the officers carte
blanche

183
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,360
to do whatever they want.

184
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,819
Plus, they’re wearing masks but no ID badges,

185
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,659
and there’s a law against doxxing them.

186
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,610
So they have the protection of being anonymous.

187
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,520
On top of that, they’re overworked and stressed

188
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
from five months of continuous protests.

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
This is a recipe for disaster.

190
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,380
It doesn’t even require loyalty to the CCP.

191
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,409
Thanks for your question, Anders.

192
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,909
And thank you to everyone who’s watching.

See you next time.
