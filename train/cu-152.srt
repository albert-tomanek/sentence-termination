1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,730
A huge protest in Hong Kong.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,820
A million people on the streets.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,470
They’re protesting a proposed extradition
law.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,440
But Hong Kong’s leader won’t back down.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,440
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,720
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,900
This was Hong Kong on Sunday.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,660
Not a good day for commuters.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,910
Especially because the subways looked like
this.

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,470
Which makes my daily commute to Manhattan

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,820
seem like walking on sunshine.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,000
Never thought I’d miss the A train.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Organizers in Hong Kong said more than

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,580
one million people hit the streets on Sunday.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,460
They’re protesting Hong Kong’s controversial
extradition bill.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,090
If the bill gets passed,

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,620
it would allow Chinese authorities to order
Hong Kong authorities

18
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,850
to arrest and deport suspected criminals to
mainland China.

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,730
This is a big deal because a lot of so-called
“crimes” in mainland China

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,370
are not crimes in Hong Kong or other free
countries-slash-regions.

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,970
Crimes like, wanting more democracy and rule
of law.

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,399
Or being a Catholic bishop.

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,100
The version of the bill on the Hong Kong Legislature’s
website

24
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,890
says the extradition bill applies only to
crimes

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,740
that are “punishable in Hong Kong with imprisonment

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,750
for more than 3 years.”

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,810
But because of pressure, at the end of May,

28
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,110
Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security said
they would change

29
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,510
the threshold to crimes punishable only by
7 or more years.

30
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,510
And then everyone was like,

31
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,159
ok that sounds reasonable,

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,420
problem solved everyone,

33
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,670
nothing to worry about.

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,040
Just kidding.

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,210
People are still unhappy,

36
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,710
because that doesn’t change the fundamental
problem with the bill.

37
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,130
The fundamental problem is that Hongkongers
don’t trust Beijing.

38
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,159
And by extension,

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,400
they no longer trust the Hong Kong government.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,810
A lot of Hong Kongers believe the bill itself

41
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,960
is simply the first step the Chinese Communist
Party’s larger plan

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,360
to water down Hong Kong’s freedoms and rule
of law—

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,860
so Hong Kong eventually operates like the
rest of China.

44
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,390
With arbitrary arrest.

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,650
And torture.

46
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,360
Who could forget torture?

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,670
Hong Kong’s really been missing out on the
torture

48
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,240
that mainland Chinese dissidents enjoy everyday.

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,070
Of course, when the Chinese Communist Party

50
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,319
forced the UK to turn over Hong Kong to China
in 1997,

51
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,239
they signed the “Sino-British Joint Declaration.”

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,859
It promised “50 years, no change”—meaning,

53
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:21,879
they would not infringe on Hong Kong’s laws
for at least 50 years.

54
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,279
But this extradition bill is a clear violation
of that promise.

55
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,590
Not that we didn’t see it coming.

56
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,129
Two years ago Chinese authorities officially
stated their intention

57
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:33,540
to completely disregard that Declaration.

58
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,349
But what is a surprise is just how many people

59
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,999
came out to protest the extradition bill.

60
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,689
A million people is a lot,

61
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:45,749
especially in a city of only 7 million people.

62
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,299
It was by far the biggest protest in Hong
Kong

63
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,889
since it was handed over to China in 1997.

64
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:52,889
So obviously,

65
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,489
the most important question Chinese authorities
are asking is:

66
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,120
Who’s behind this massive disruption to
social harmony?!

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Fortunately, state-run media has the answer!

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,379
According to China Daily,

69
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,180
it’s hostile foreign forces!

70
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,680
They’re “seizing the opportunity to advance

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,650
their own strategy to hurt China

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,689
by trying to create havoc in Hong Kong.”

73
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,919
Now state-run media doesn’t specifically
name

74
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,879
who those “foreign forces” are.

75
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,989
But I’m going to assume they’re referring
to me.

76
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,200
Well, me and the CIA.

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
That’s right,

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,370
United Front groups and pro-Chinese Communist
Party media

79
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,339
have accused random foreigners in Hong Kong

80
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,569
of being part of the CIA.

81
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:32,569
Take it from me,

82
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:34,909
those guys are not in the CIA.

83
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,840
And what’s even better is that I’ve heard
from

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,389
a very reliable source in Hong Kong

85
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,699
that none of the guys circled in those photos

86
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,909
are even American.

87
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:46,540
So the CIA isn’t part of the foreign forces,

88
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,489
but I’m going to assume that I still am.

89
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,010
Although I can’t take *all* of the credit.

90
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,169
Because it was more than just a few

91
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,980
China Uncensored fans in Hong Kong

92
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,059
who joined Sunday’s ginormous march.

93
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,750
And it was more than just students and activists,

94
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,269
who were the bulk of the 2014 Umbrella Protests.

95
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,919
This protest also included many ordinary Hongkongers.

96
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,969
According to this poll,

97
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:10,419
a third of the marchers had never protested
before.

98
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,079
The extradition bill has even riled up many
of Hong Kong’s elite:

99
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,980
businesspeople who feel that Hong Kong’s
rule of law

100
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,100
is critical to the future of their corporate
interests.

101
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
Even lawyers participated—

102
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,210
following a smaller lawyers’ protest last
week.

103
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,330
So basically, a huge cross section of Hong
Kong—

104
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,580
including a lot of influential people—

105
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,670
feel the extradition bill could affect them.

106
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,470
And that’s what makes this different

107
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,100
from many of the other protests Hong Kong
has seen

108
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,970
over the last 20 years.

109
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,670
It means everyone’s angry now.

110
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,750
And it’s a big challenge to Hong Kong’s
leadership—

111
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,600
especially Chief Executive Carrie Lam,

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,360
who’s the equivalent of Hong Kong’s governor.

113
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,470
On Monday, she defended the Extradition Bill.

114
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,290
“I have not received any instruction

115
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,430
or mandate from Beijing to do this bill.”

116
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,050
Wait... she *didn’t* receive any instructions
from Beijing?

117
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,520
She just decided—on her own—

118
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,290
that it would be a good idea to let the Communist
Party

119
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,950
run roughshod over Hong Kong’s rule of law?

120
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,940
So you’re telling me,

121
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,140
this meme is *not* accurate?

122
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,570
I mean, if I were in Carrie Lam’s shoes,

123
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,570
I would have totally been like

124
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,600
“Yeah, Beijing totally made me do it.”

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,460
I really don’t understand why she’d throw
*herself* under the bus.

126
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,580
But I guess this is why she’s so unpopular.

127
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,800
And why protesters are specifically calling
on her

128
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,270
to resign over the bill.

129
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,340
This protest sign says “Carrie Lam, step
down”—

130
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,050
sponsored by Coca-Cola!

131
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,200
And other Hong Kongers decided to really get
political,

132
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,050
with “Carrie Lam...You’re Fired!”

133
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,470
The protests lasted all day,

134
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,010
and eventually ended in the early hours of
Monday morning,

135
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,170
when some protesters got a little more aggressive.

136
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,620
And police came out with riot gear to clear
people out,

137
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,750
using pepper spray,

138
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,520
and threatening to shoot tear gas.

139
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,110
Which is a nice preview of things to come

140
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,490
once Hong Kong’s legal system

141
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,500
looks more like mainland China’s.

142
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,670
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong legislature responded
to

143
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,250
the protesters’ calls to slow the bill down

144
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,110
by...speeding it up.

145
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,800
And Hongkongers responded to that

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,910
by calling for more protests on Wednesday,
June 12—

147
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,180
when the bill is due to be read again in the
legislature.

148
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,240
That’s not all, though.

149
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Some people are shutting down their businesses
on Wednesday

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,550
because...they love the extradition bill so
much.

151
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,650
And that’s a big deal because everyone says
that

152
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,270
Hongkongers never stop working.

153
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,400
One woman even created a facebook event

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,110
saying she’s going on a picnic Wednesday.

155
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,520
At a park right outside the Hong Kong legislature.

156
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,500
And invited people to join her.

157
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,800
And 12 thousand people said they would.

158
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,110
I mean, who doesn’t love a picnic?

159
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,360
What’s that, Shelley?

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,280
Apparently the Hong Kong government doesn’t
love picnics.

161
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,389
They’ve closed off the public park for “maintenance”

162
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,010
And they’ve also closed off the legal protest
area

163
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,100
right outside the legislature.

164
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,960
Somehow I don’t think that’s going to
stop people from protesting.

165
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
So what do you think about the Hong Kong protests?

166
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,470
Leave your comments below.

167
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,470
And before I go,

168
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,850
it’s time to answer a question from a member

169
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,650
of my China Uncensored 50-Cent Army—

170
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,650
the fans who support the show

171
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,460
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

172
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,710
Natalia Thunderbrook—

173
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,690
who asked that we don’t use her real name—asks:

174
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,470
“Chris, how did you come to care so much
about China?

175
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,760
Why are you a prophet sounding the alarm from
the walls,

176
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,110
risking the ire of YouTube and the CCP’s
nefarious agents?

177
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,310
Good question.

178
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,280
But really the question is,

179
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,400
why shouldn’t everyone care about China?

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,760
The Chinese Communist Party and its nefarious
agents

181
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,900
are infiltrating so many countries around
the world,

182
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
including the United States.

183
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,580
And if that sounds far-fetched,

184
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,810
consider this:

185
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,060
Name one Hollywood film made in the last 10
years

186
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,060
where communist China is portrayed as the
enemy.

187
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,419
Name one TV network news show that consistently
reports on

188
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,980
how Chinese state hospitals are killing dissidents
for their organs.

189
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,680
Name one major tech company that has publicly
stated

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,800
it doesn’t want any involvement in China.

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,340
You probably can’t.

192
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,900
And that’s because many of the elite in
the United States

193
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,780
have bought into the promise of the China
market,

194
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,290
and are willing to ignore all the terrible
things happening there.

195
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,250
Now I’m not claiming claiming I’m some
kind of prophet.

196
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,180
I just thought it would be fun to stand up
to

197
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,700
the world’s largest and best-funded authoritarian
regime,

198
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,860
using only the power of sarcasm and small
contributions

199
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,490
from Patreon supporters like you.

200
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,030
