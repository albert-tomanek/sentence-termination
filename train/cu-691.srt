00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,260
the bromance continues.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,620
Hi, welcome back.

4
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:10,940
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,639
Donald Trump has completed his much anticipated

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,889
first state visit to China.

7
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:18,180
And President Trump and Chinese leader Xi
Jinping

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,960
spent most of the time celebrating the thing
closest to their hearts.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,460
Each other.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,750
“A relationship with you and China is a
very important one to me.”

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,890
“The United States, the feelings we have
for China

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,250
is a very warm feeling,

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,440
and I really believe it’s only going to
get warmer.”

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,040
Here they are watching home movies of themselves.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,350
Aww, look, it’s their first handshake!

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,460
They’re really enjoying this.

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,460
And why not?!

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,510
It’s Donald Trump,

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,039
the most interesting man in the world.

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,319
And Xi Jinping, the most…

21
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,960
adjectiveless man in the world.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,530
Meanwhile Melania went for a walk by herself.

23
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,180
On a big wall.

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,040
Xi Jinping offered Trump a rare

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,520
personal escort through the Forbidden City.

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,160
Where they admired relics from ancient China.

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,640
I think Xi was trying to say that’s the
two of them.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,270
Meanwhile Melania got to see schoolchildren.

29
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,660
And a panda.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,660
And finally, Xi treated Trump to a Peking
Opera.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,350
A fun time time was had by all.

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,380
So now that it’s all over, what are we left
with?

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,810
Well, there were two big topics everyone knew

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,110
would come up during the meetings

35
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,540
between President Trump and Xi Jinping:

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,610
trade and North Korea.

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,650
On the trade front,

38
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,650
the Trump administration has in the past

39
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,380
accused China of unfair business practices,

40
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,730
currency manipulation,

41
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,870
and intellectual property theft.

42
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,870
In fact,

43
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,270
blaming China was a true Trump campaign classic.

44
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:06,370
We can’t allow China to rape our country,

45
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,810
and that’s what they’re doing.”

46
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,910
And who allowed it, anyway?

47
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,900
“I don’t blame China...

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,620
I do blame past administrations for allowing
this

49
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,319
out-of-control trade deficit to take place
and to grow."

50
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,620
In other words, thanks Obama.

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,000
But guess who’s got two thumbs

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,330
and isn’t gonna take it anymore?

53
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,910
Yes, the dealmaker-in-chief himself.

54
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,750
Trump announced $250 billion dollars worth

55
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,680
of US China deals during his trip.

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,300
Details are still a bit sparse,

57
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
and some of those deals

58
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,630
had already been in the works

59
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,380
long before the meeting.

60
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,450
And some of them were just memorandums of
understanding,

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,030
and not contracts.

62
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,030
But still,

63
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,090
250 billion is a lot of dough.

64
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,930
That’s like Trump’s net worth times...

65
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,790
uh, we’ll get back to you on that.

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,170
Anyway, let’s take a look at some of the
deals.

67
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,110
There was a $37 billion dollar deal with Boeing

68
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,730
to sell 300 planes to China.

69
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,209
And $84 billion dollar deal with China’s

70
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,390
state-owned China Energy Investment Corp

71
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,820
to invest in shale gas and chemical projects
in West Virginia.

72
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,520
And a $43 billion dollar deal with state-run
Sinopec

73
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,510
to develop Alaska’s liquid natural gas industry

74
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,069
that could create up to 12,000 American jobs.

75
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,230
Ok, so the Boeing deal is fine.

76
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,240
But I would be somewhat wary about

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,459
the Alaska and West Virginia deals.

78
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,080
It’s hard to say since we don’t know the
details,

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,220
but in the past countries who have let China

80
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,780
invest heavily in their natural resources,

81
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,180
have had some problems.

82
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,940
But the really big win was for US companies

83
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,500
looking to invest in China.

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,000
China announced a new rule allow foreign companies to own 51% stakes in foreign ventures.

85
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,440
I know, that doesn’t even sound very generous.

86
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:56,459
But previously,

87
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,069
no US company could own a controlling share

88
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,709
in a US-China joint venture.

89
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,310
Even though a Chinese company could

90
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,599
inside the United States.

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,980
So why is China more open to foreign investment
now?

92
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,140
Is it because China is implementing meaningful
rule of law

93
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,350
and wants to level the playing field?

94
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,840
Haha, no.

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,609
It’s because China’s economy is slowing
down

96
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,799
and they really need the money.

97
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,270
Like when you swear you weren’t going

98
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,060
to move back in with your parents,

99
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,380
but rent is really high right now, you know?

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,900
But still, it’s a win for US companies.

101
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,480
At least for the ones that hope to become

102
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,590
the next Starbucks in China...

103
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,310
and not the next Home Depot.

104
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,520
As for North Korea,

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,490
Trump and Xi were in agreement.

106
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,630
"We agreed not to replicate failed approaches
of the past,

107
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,630
and there were many.”

108
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,230
In other words: Thanks Obama.

109
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,470
And Hillary.

110
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,620
The Trump administration has been pushing
China

111
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,580
to put even tougher sanctions on North Korea,

112
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,280
even going so far as to cut off all trade.

113
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,780
But while Trump tweeted that Xi agreed to

114
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,490
upping the sanctions,

115
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,490
as of this recording,

116
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,479
there’s been no official announcements.

117
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,980
So for trade and North Korea,

118
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,150
the Trump administration made some definite
progress.

119
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,050
But one of the fair criticisms of Trump’s
China trip was that,

120
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,380
like past presidents,

121
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,460
Trump didn’t publicly talk about China’s
human rights issues.

122
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,310
And so far there’s no indication that

123
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,889
he talked about them in private, either.

124
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,570
But there was one interesting thing.

125
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,310
The day before President Trump landed in China,

126
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,449
he declared a new holiday,

127
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,990
the National Day for the Victims of Communism.

128
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,850
It “marks 100 years since

129
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,550
the Bolshevik Revolution took place in Russia,”

130
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,710
which gave us the Soviet Union.

131
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,880
Since then, “communist totalitarian regimes

132
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,650
around the world have killed more than

133
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,979
100 million people

134
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,480
and subjected countless more to exploitation,

135
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,600
violence, and untold devastation.”

136
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,260
The White House said that the holiday was

137
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,949
to “remember those who have died

138
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,540
and all who continue to suffer under communism.”

139
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
So in other words,

140
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,600
a real Hallmark Holiday.

141
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,970
Frankly, this is important and long overdue.

142
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,810
And there’s an added level of deliciousness

143
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,130
in the fact that it happened right before
Trump

144
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,949
went to two communist countries.

145
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,680
But it still would have been nice to have

146
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,610
the US president be more direct about

147
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,889
America’s commitment to freedom and human
rights.

148
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,490
What’s that, Shelley?

149
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,259
Trump personally brought up the cases

150
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,650
of high-profile detainees with Xi Jinping?

151
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,310
That’s great!

152
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,669
Was it Taiwanese activist Lee Ming-che?

153
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,030
Or disappeared human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng?

154
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,030
What?

155
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,970
The UCLA basketball players?!

156
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,009
Well I guess it’s good to know that they
are safely back home.

157
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,330
Finally, after leaving China,

158
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,290
President Trump went to Vietnam for the ASEAN
summit.

159
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,320
And he’s set his sights on solving the South
China Sea Dispute.

160
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,600
“If I can help in any way,

161
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,930
I’m a very good mediator

162
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,930
and a very good arbitrator.”

163
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,289
And Trump’s offer to mediate could actually
be helpful.

164
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,300
But to do that, he’ll have to win the love

165
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,820
of Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte.

166
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,600
But I don’t think that’s going to be too
hard.

167
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,860
Let’s just say,

168
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,360
at this dinner party,

169
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,400
Duterte one upped Xi Jinping.

170
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,520
"Ladies and gentlemen, I sang -- uninvited
--

171
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,880
a duet with Miss Pilita Corrales

172
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,520
upon the orders of the Commander in Chief
of the United States."

173
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,620
Wow, international politics have gotten really
strange.

174
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,380
But what about the original bromance between
Trump and Xi?

175
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,090
Well, it was always in some ways a bromance
of convenience.

176
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,620
Xi Jinping has been using Trump’s visit
to boost his own profile.

177
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,430
And while Trump is extremely warm about Xi
now,

178
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,630
it is not unknown for him to suddenly change
his mind.

179
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,410
And now that they’re going long distance...

180
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,960
