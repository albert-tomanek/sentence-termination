1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,640
While Venezuelans starve

2
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:04,870
President Maduro struggles to maintain

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,890
his grip on power

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,789
And a Chinese tech company

5
00:00:07,789 --> 00:00:09,540
Is giving him the tools

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,060
to keep tabs on every citizen

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,820
Welcome to China Uncensored.

Ah, Venezuela.

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,689
The socialist paradise that has it all.

15
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:32,689
Bonfires.

16
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:34,200
Outdoor fitness.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,180
And a great national weight loss plan.

18
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,070
Plus a lovable dictator

19
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,890
who can dance his way into your heart.

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,600
Ha, ha, who would want to oust him?

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,930
No, seriously, tell me now!

22
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,950
Who wants to oust him?!

23
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,020
And to that effect, Venezuela,

24
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,510
the country that has it all,

25
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,660
now has one more thing to add to the list:

26
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,100
Mass government surveillance.

27
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,200
And guess which country is helping Maduro
build it?

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,130
Ok, you don’t have to guess.

29
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,250
It’s China.

30
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,580
In case you haven’t heard,

31
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,170
the Venezuelan economy has tanked.

32
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,100
There have been mass protests against Maduro,

33
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,859
and last month this man, Juan Guaidó,

34
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,759
said Maduro is not legitimate,

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,750
and declared himself the country’s interim
president.

36
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,140
Maduro does not agree.

37
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,960
In fact, a major reason Maduro is still in
power

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,060
is thanks to support from the Chinese Communist
Party.

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,270
There’s the financial support,

40
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,579
measured in billions of dollars...

41
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,579
and of course,

42
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:33,579
all the guns.

43
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,579
Well, to be fair,

44
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,289
a lot of those guns come from Russia, too.

45
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:39,210
Guns that may or may not be used in

46
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,049
all those extrajudicial killings that are
happening.

47
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,060
And if that’s not enough to help Maduro
maintain power,

48
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,639
the Chinese Communist Party has also provided
him

49
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:51,579
with the tools to recreate the same kind of

50
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,380
mass surveillance system they have in China.

51
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,310
In 2016, Maduro revealed this:

52
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,959
a national identity card called the fatherland
card.

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,959
Surely a fatherland card couldn’t be anything
sinister!

54
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,190
To be fair, Maduro almost called it

55
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,060
the Happy Sunshine Rewards Card

56
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,330
but decided that would be even more sinister.

57
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,610
Maduro has pushed the fatherland card hard,

58
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,160
saying it’s essential to “build the new
Venezuela.”

59
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,810
Which I imagine still has Maduro as president.

60
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,270
18 million Venezuelans now have a fatherland
card.

61
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,190
That’s more than half the population.

62
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,580
And the guess what?

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,080
The Fatherland Card is actually a chip card

64
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,810
created by China’s state-linked company
ZTE.

65
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,200
It’s same kind of smart card technology

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,720
Chinese authorities use inside China

67
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,610
to track people's social, political,

68
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,530
and economic behavior.

69
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,770
Just to give you an idea of

70
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,500
what kind of wonderful company ZTE is,

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,550
their largest stakeholder and largest client

72
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,130
are both the Chinese government.

73
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,350
And two years ago,

74
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,470
ZTE was forced to pay a billion dollar settlement

75
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,550
to the US Commerce Department after

76
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,070
violating US sanctions on Iran and North Korea.

77
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,180
In fact, ZTE might right now

78
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,010
even be violating US sanctions

79
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,730
by working with the Venezuelan government.

80
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,120
This is the trustworthy, upright company

81
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,150
behind Venezuela's fatherland card.

82
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,480
So what does the fatherland card do?

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,760
According to an investigation by Reuters,

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,210
the fatherland card database

85
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,150
“stores such details as birthdays,

86
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,970
family information, employment and income,

87
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,170
property owned, medical history,

88
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,860
state benefits received,

89
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,400
presence on social media,

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,370
membership of a political party

91
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,040
and whether a person voted.”

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,170
Does it know who you voted for?

93
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,780
No, of course not!

94
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,370
Would this guy deceive you?

95
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,530
That man loves salsa.

96
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,530
Also dancing.

97
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,620
But whether the fatherland card tracks

98
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,320
who you voted for or not,

99
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,500
it can definitely tell whether you’re the
type of

100
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,880
good quality citizen who voted

101
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,490
in last year’s rigged election.

102
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,280
You now also need the fatherland card

103
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,210
to receive public benefits,

104
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,970
like medicine, pension, and food relief.

105
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,680
In fact, one 76-year-old diabetic told Reuters

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,590
that a doctor refused to give him his insulin
prescription

107
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,730
because he didn’t have the card.

108
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,460
The doctor also called him “Right Wing.”

109
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Remember kids,

110
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,460
if you don’t do everything

111
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,569
your socialist dictator asks of you,

112
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,539
you’re a right-wing menace to society.

113
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,240
The story of the fatherland card dates back
to

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
Venezuela’s first socialist visionary,

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
Hugo Chavez.

116
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,300
In 2007, voters rejected his bid

117
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,889
to remove presidential term limits.

118
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,699
And that’s when Chavez had the idea

119
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,400
for a national ID card to keep tabs on people.

120
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,090
You know, to make sure people get

121
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,710
all the government services they’re entitled
to.

122
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,020
Yeah.

123
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,719
And if anyone knows how to make sure people

124
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,340
get what’s coming to them,

125
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,300
it’s the Chinese Communist Party.

126
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,580
A few months after Chavez

127
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,650
failed to get term limits removed,

128
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,879
he sent a delegation to China to learn how

129
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,490
the Communist Party was using Big Data

130
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,669
to monitor its citizens.

131
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,259
Reuters spoke to one of the people

132
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,520
on that original delegation.

133
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,099
After being initially impressed,

134
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,050
he began to have fears that there might be

135
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,460
a teensy weensy chance the technology

136
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,039
could lead to government abuses of privacy.

137
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,490
I know, that sounds pretty unfounded.

138
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,020
And clearly it was.

139
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,539
Because when he brought up his concerns

140
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,120
with Venezuelan officials,

141
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,490
a few days later,

142
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,110
several armed men kidnapped him,

143
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,449
knocked several of his teeth out with their
guns,

144
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,270
accused him of treasonous behavior,

145
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,999
and extorted money from him.

146
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:48,509
You see?

147
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,710
Clearly the Venezuelan government

148
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,249
doesn’t need China’s help to abuse power.

149
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:55,590
In fact, the only reason it took about a decade

150
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,870
for China to build Venezuela’s national
ID card,

151
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,939
was because it was too expensive

152
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,380
and they first tried to get Cuba to build
it.

153
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,229
Yeah, you know you’ve got problems

154
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,460
when Made in China is too expensive.

155
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,460
But the Cuban built version never got off
the ground,

156
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,590
so China’s ZTE was brought on as part of

157
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,120
a 70 million dollar government effort

158
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,189
to boost national security.

159
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:22,240
Um, I mean, to oversee the distribution

160
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,680
of food and services, haha.

161
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,110
Fun fact, Reuters found out that ZTE

162
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,909
is using US-built data storage units

163
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:33,699
made by American hardware maker Dell.

164
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,409
Reuters reached out to Dell for comment.

165
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:40,249
Apparently ZTE is a client of Dell in China,

166
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,500
but totally not in Venezuela.

167
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,389
Ah the joys of US tech companies doing business

168
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,289
with shady Chinese companies.

169
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,169
You never know where your products may end
up.

170
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,069
Meanwhile, as Venezuelans starve,

171
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,830
they need to use their Chinese-made fatherland
card

172
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,029
to get food and medicine.

173
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,490
Assuming they can get past the police

174
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,139
armed with Chinese-made weapons.

175
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,069
So what do you think of the ZTE-made fatherland
ID card?

176
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,590
Leave your comments below.

177
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,620
And before we go,

178
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,099
now is the time when I answer questions from
you,

179
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,749
my loyal 50-cent army—

180
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,060
fans of the show who support what we do

181
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,439
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

182
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,080
Rodney Hall asks

183
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,680
“Chris, your recent piece about Chinese
food fraud

184
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,589
both revolted and nauseated me.”

185
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,009
You’re welcome.

186
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,589
“After taking some Pepto

187
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,139
and doing some deep breathing exercises,

188
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,809
it occurred to me to ask:

189
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:34,680
what about all the imported Chinese food

190
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,409
sold in the USA?

191
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,759
How likely is it that I could be

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,419
buying food at *redacted*-Mart

193
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,240
made with sewer grease?”

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,770
A stomach churning question, Rodney.

195
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,270
While I’ve never heard of a sewer grease

196
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,469
making its way into the US,

197
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,580
Chinese imports have been

198
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,550
cause for concern in the past.

199
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,229
“Between 2004 and 2007,

200
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,639
an estimated 100,000 homes in more than 20
states

201
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,659
were built with toxic drywall imported from
China.”

202
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,729
Made in China toys are also sometimes toxic.

203
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,599
As well as cheap jewelry.

204
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:07,889
What about stuff you’re actually

205
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,699
supposed to put in your mouth?

206
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,599
Well, China does export food like garlic,
tilapia,

207
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,589
and cooked chicken to the US.

208
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:18,990
And the FDA has halted Chinese shipments in
the past.

209
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,400
I would say it’s unlikely there is sewer
grease

210
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,330
in exported Chinese food products,

211
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,999
but China does have a lot of food safety issues.

212
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:30,380
And considering the degree of China’s environmental
pollution,

213
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,669
And water pollution
I wouldn’t trust anything from China

214
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,539
with an organic label.

215
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,260
Thanks for your question, Rodney.

216
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,719
