1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,550
Where is everyone?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,260
What happened here?!

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,280
Whoooaa!!

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,960
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,860
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,080
Behold, the streets of China:

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,100
empty!

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,439
Huge, sprawling megacities

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,599
populated only by the promise of what might
have been.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,900
You're looking at China's meteoric GDP growth.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,680
You see, when there's construction, GDP goes
up.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,820
But what those GDP figures don't factor in

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,900
is whether or not anyone actually ends up
living in those cities.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,289
You know the saying, "If you build it they
will come?"

15
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:45,269
Well, in China, they didn't come.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,740
These are China's ghost cities.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,180
This is Lüliang.

18
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,250
Its 160 million dollar airport gets no more
than five flights a day.

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,999
Most of the apartments meant for the 300,000
planned residents sit empty,

20
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:04,170
built on land that used to be irrigation ditches
for the farmers.

21
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,790
The farmers are still around,

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,130
but the water isn't.

23
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,420
Then there's the city of Ordos in Inner Mongolia.

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,200
A million people were supposed to live here.

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,450
But only one in every fifty buildings is filled.

26
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,420
But surely there can't be that many of these
ghost cities in China right?!

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,009
Well, Baidu,

28
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,119
basically the Chinese version of Google,

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,040
set out to find the answer.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,270
They analyzed location data from their 700
million users.

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,030
And found more than 50 ghost cities across
China.

32
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,230
50!

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,559
So why is this such a common phenomenon?

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,080
Part of it has to do with the government's
massive push for urbanization.

35
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,180
According to the "National New-type Urbanization
Plan”—

36
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,620
yes that's what it's called—

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,759
by 2020, 60 percent of the Chinese population
will be living in cities.

38
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,750
That's more than 800 million people.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,869
So it's not exactly an issue of

40
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,280
too much supply and too little demand nationwide.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,310
It's all about location.

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,670
Real estate prices are already so high in
the top-tier cities

43
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,800
that the average worker will never be able
to own a home in their lifetime.

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,230
That's why so many people live in urban areas
just outside the major cities—

45
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,620
for example, in recently urbanized places
like this one near Beijing.

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,239
It offers lousy hospitals,

47
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,849
over-crowded schools,

48
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:27,900
no bus terminals,

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,980
no movie theaters,

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,680
only two tiny parks,

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,020
and 700,000 neighbors.

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,519
But living here with a three-hour commute
to central Beijing

53
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,940
is still more appealing than living in a beautifully
designed city

54
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,640
in Shanxi Province that has no jobs.

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
Remember Lüliang?

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,879
In 2010, its GDP growth was a staggering 21
percent.

57
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,330
Last year, it was negative 2 percent.

58
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,599
That's because it was coal mining town—

59
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,110
and coal used to be big business in China.

60
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,120
But with the economic slowdown,

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,100
a lot of steel makers reduced production.

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,519
They stopped buying so much coal,

63
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,939
and coal mines went out of business.

64
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,190
Then there's corruption.

65
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,239
Officials in China get promotions based on
GDP growth.

66
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,970
So Lüliang officials had been boosting GDP

67
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,290
by building way more infrastructure than was
actually needed.

68
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,900
Business also used to be booming in Lüliang's
Liquor City area,

69
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,340
where they made baijiu,

70
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,080
a strong Chinese liquor that was very popular
with officials.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,110
But then baijiu became a target in Xi Jinping's
"anti-corruption campaign"—

72
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,070
and now business is on the rocks.

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,260
And you know what else became a target in
the "anti-corruption campaign"?

74
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,420
The mayor.

75
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,290
And a bunch of other government officials,
who also got sacked.

76
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,269
Anyway, the city government soon ran out of
money.

77
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,470
And that's just one city.

78
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,450
According to Wade Shepard, author of "Ghost
Cities,"

79
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,310
there are 20 to 40 million empty apartments
in China.

80
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,489
Now you'd think the central government would
learn its lesson,

81
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,890
and put an end to all this excess building.

82
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,519
But it's not so simple.

83
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,349
Because local officials have their own plans
and incentives.

84
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,480
According to Xinhua,

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,180
the governments of various cities across the
country

86
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,579
have development plans that, when put together,

87
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,079
would provide housing for 3.4 billion people.

88
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,300
That's more than double China's actual population.

89
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,750
So unless China plans to switch to a mandatory
Seven-Child Policy soon,

90
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,830
they're in big trouble.

91
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,700
So what do you think?

92
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,300
If you were a ghost, which Chinese ghost city
would you live in?

Once again I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.

96
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,380
Xi Jinping

97
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,240
Zhou Yongkang

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,540
Mao. Mao. Mao.

99
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,180
Barack Obama

100
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,880
Obama

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,620
I love Chris

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,180
OFC?!

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,820
Wow, some crazy things happened in 2015.

104
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,200
Let's just say I don't think Xi Jinping will
"let old acquaintance be forgot."
