00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,720
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,380
who says spies need to be undercover?

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:11,690
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,679
Can I just say what an awesome job

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,320
the Chinese Communist Party is doing in Xinjiang?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,960
I mean, it’s basically like Cheers.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,700
“Sometimes you want to go where everybody
knows your name.”

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,580
Only they don’t just know your name.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,480
They know your face, too!

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,680
I mean, between the convenience police stations
on every corner…

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,300
and the vocational training camps

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,670
that promote stability and employment

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,820
through the use of police batons,

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,600
electric cattle prods, handcuffs, and pepper
spray,

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,880
I’m sure the ethnic Uighurs of Xinjiang
feel very safe

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,920
and well cared for by the Chinese Communist
Party.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,740
Of course, it’s possible that some don’t.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,771
But not to worry—the Communist Party

20
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,370
has a solution for them, too.

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,480
Because even though there’s all this fancy,

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,980
newfangled surveillance, facial recognition,

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,320
DNA-scanning, yada yada, technology,

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,200
the Communist Party hasn’t forgotten the
importance

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,390
of good old-fashioned people-to-people connections.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,380
And by connections, I mean spying.

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,380
That’s why the Party has ordered a million
Han Chinese

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,810
to move into the villages and homes of Uighurs
across Xinjiang.

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:26,890
Now I know what you’re thinking.

30
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,090
That’s a terrible idea.

31
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,110
Won’t that lead to overcrowding?

32
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,700
Don’t worry, the Party is smarter than you.

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,229
It just so happens that,

34
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,830
with all those Uighurs in voluntary vocational
training camps,

35
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,299
there are a lot of empty beds and broken homes
to fill.

36
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,430
The Communist Party’s program is called
United as One Family.

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,470
And keeping with the family theme, the Uighurs

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,900
are required to call their guests “relatives”;

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,360
brothers and sisters.

40
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,630
Big brothers and sisters.

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,520
And the Xinjiang Communist Youth League

42
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,820
has posted a bunch of photos showing

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,200
how much all the Uighurs love this plan.

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,769
Whether it's sharing a bed with your two Han
Chinese sisters...

45
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,829
Reading together Xi Jinping’s report for

46
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,379
the 19th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party...

47
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,099
or making sure the kids are learning Mandarin
Chinese

48
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,639
instead of their native language.

49
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,349
There are actually many photos of people sharing
beds together,

50
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,430
which I guess is an important part of being
united as one family?

51
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,409
And hey, here’s a bit of friendly advice
for

52
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,810
all you Uighurs watching from Xinjiang.

53
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,299
“The government reportedly tried to promote
drinking and smoking,

54
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,659
because people who didn’t drink or smoke—

55
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,629
such as devout Muslims—

56
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,040
were deemed suspicious.”

57
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,680
So when your big brother offers to share a
drink with you, take it.

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,159
I’m kidding of course.

59
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,670
There’s no way Uighurs in Xinjiang are watching
this.

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,629
They’re too busy studying Marxism and Xi
Jinping thought.

61
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,579
But before you start hating on the Han Chinese

62
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,599
who are in Xinjiang occupying people’s homes—

63
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,469
you should know that many of them love

64
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:03,150
the Communist Party’s program

65
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,340
just as much as the Uighurs do.

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,379
I mean, they volunteered for it...

67
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,590
you know, like how Uighurs are

68
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,669
volunteering to be in those concentration
camps.

69
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,670
Concentration camps in the sense that

70
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,700
they have to really concentrate hard,

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,569
since they’re learning all those new job
skills.

72
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,239
But who are the Han Chinese being dispatched

73
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,900
to stay in Uighur homes for days or weeks
at a time?

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,590
At first, they were mostly Communist Party
members.

75
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,230
But now, since the Party has run low on those,

76
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,579
the latest wave of 1 million “relatives”

77
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,829
have been low to mid-level civil servants.

78
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,739
Imagine being a doctor in a state-run hospital

79
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,309
and then being told part of your job

80
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:46,099
is now spying on people every month.

81
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,909
In the far away deserts of Xinjiang.

82
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,730
Of course, some of the Han Chinese truly believe

83
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,799
the Party propaganda that they’re doing
a good thing,

84
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,680
and creating ethnic harmony with their homestays.

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Like it’s Habitat for Humanity,

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,620
except with more spying.

87
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,799
For others, well, according to anthropologist
Darren Byler,

88
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,769
who wrote this ChinaFile article,

89
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,329
“Two of those [Han Chinese] I interviewed
told me that they,

90
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,699
or their friends who had been asked to go
down to the villages,

91
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,479
would have lost their jobs if they had

92
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,720
refused to participate in the monitoring program,

93
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,810
but they also said that by participating they
had been

94
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,629
guaranteed promotions upon the completion
of their tour of duty.”

95
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:27,900
And any Chinese people

96
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,220
who express sympathetic views towards the
Uighurs

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,810
might be in trouble.

98
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,729
Like Zhang Haitao, an ethnic Han Chinese,

99
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,970
spent years criticizing the policies in Xinjiang
on social media.

100
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,370
But at the end of last year,

101
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,169
“He was arrested and prosecuted for subversion
and espionage.

102
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,940
His punishment—20 years in prison.”

103
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,310
Meanwhile, Uighurs who have these people

104
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,530
staying in their homes feel afraid,

105
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,930
stripped of their dignity,

106
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,110
and like every aspect of their life is a political
test.

107
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,120
So clearly,

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,990
both Han Chinese and Uighurs love the United
as One Family program.

109
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,740
But perhaps some big brothers and sisters
may wonder:

110
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,189
What am I supposed to be doing here?

111
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,710
Fortunately, the Communist Party has created
a helpful manual for you.

112
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,810
Aww look!

113
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,520
The two hands holding each other make a heart.

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,620
This can’t be sinister!

115
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,680
After all, how sinister can it be if it’s
from Shutterstock?

116
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,569
Back to the daily routine for the Han Chinese
“volunteers.”

117
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:29,569
In the mornings,

118
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:32,570
you can take your Uighur hosts to sing patriotic
songs

119
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,080
at the daily flag-raising ceremonies

120
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,849
outside the village Party office.

121
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,409
At night, take them to classes on Xi Jinping
thought.

122
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,120
The rest of the day is your typical mix of
watching

123
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,530
state-approved television shows,

124
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,750
singing more patriotic songs,

125
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,720
and of course, asking questions!

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,949
For example, you can ask them:

127
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,439
Do you have any relatives living abroad?

128
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,380
Have you ever attended a mosque outside the
village?

129
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,810
How’s your Arabic?

130
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,259
And if any of their answers,

131
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,750
“felt incomplete, or if they seemed to be
hiding anything,

132
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,599
the children should be questioned next.”

133
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,060
See?

134
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,460
The Communist Party is even thinking of the
children!

135
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,780
The Chinese regime has declared Islam a contagious
disease.

136
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,740
So while these Uighurs might act friendly
and secular,

137
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,090
they might secretly be trying to hold onto

138
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,789
their religion and culture.

139
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,449
Here’s how the Party says you can find out.

140
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,379
Offer a member of your host family a cigarette
or a sip of beer.

141
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,920
Provide random bags of ground meat for dinner.

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,460
Find ways to make physical contact with a
member of the opposite sex.

143
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,629
If any of that makes them uncomfortable,

144
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,270
you should “report any resistance” to
the relevant authorities.

145
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,270
That way, your hosts can be sent off to one
of

146
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,340
the many vocational training camps to receive
training

147
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,550
on how they should ditch their religion

148
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,850
for Marxism and Xi Jinping Thought!

149
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,439
Oh, and here’s another tip for dealing with
resistance:

150
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,850
Try to convince your new family

151
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,690
that you already know everything about them.

152
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,419
“The manual instructs the relatives

153
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,960
to tell their ‘little brothers and sisters’

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,300
that they have been monitoring all Internet

155
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,770
and cell phone communication

156
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,419
that is coming from the family,

157
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,880
so they should not even think about lying

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,139
when it comes to their knowledge of Islam

159
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,870
and religious extremism.”

160
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,340
Look, this policy is incredibly disturbing.

161
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,789
The Chinese Communist Party is creating a
system where,

162
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,800
in the name of ethnic harmony,

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,620
they are pitting Han Chinese and Uighurs against
each other.

164
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,190
Of course, ethnic harmony is a good thing.

165
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,389
But the way to get there is probably not

166
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,610
to force one group of people to help destroy
the families

167
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,449
and communities of another group of people.

168
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,449
China Digital Times translated this article

169
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,310
from a Han Chinese university student in Xinjiang.

170
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,430
He talks about living under the growing security
state,

171
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,789
watching his Uighur teachers slowly disappear
into the camps,

172
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:56,689
and about how no one could talk about it

173
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,249
for fear that they would also be reported
to the Party.

174
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:02,629
That student realized that he was being trained

175
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,949
to be part of the security apparatus

176
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,280
and managed to leave the country.

177
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
But most people in Xinjiang aren’t so lucky--

178
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,090
especially the Uighurs.

179
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,919
Like this ChinaFile article says,

180
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,490
“Citizens of totalitarian states

181
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,729
are nearly always compelled to act in ways

182
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,340
that deny their ethical obligations.”

183
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,110
No one is allowed to think about what they’re
doing.

184
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,759
I know, this all sounds like so much fun for
everyone.

185
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,050
So between all the hair combing

186
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,160
making probably non-halal dumplings!

187
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,700
and putting up Pictures of Xi Jinping

188
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,330
….the Han big brothers and sisters and their
Uighur hosts

189
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,170
have important work to do for their country.

190
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,830
So what do you think of the Communist Party’s

191
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,550
plan to force Han Chinese to live with Uighurs?

192
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,600
Leave your comments below.

193
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,260
And now is the moment you’ve all been waiting
for!

194
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,320
When I answer questions

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,270
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 cent
army—

196
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,070
the fans who make this show possible

197
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,150
by contributing through the crowd funding
website Patreon.

198
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,540
Karan Joshi asks,

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,040
“Could the People's Republic of China

200
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,410
ever split up like the Soviet Union?

201
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,040
A very interesting, politically sensitive
question!

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,940
As this lovely gif shows,

203
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,620
the territory of what we call China

204
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,830
has changed a lot over the centuries.

205
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,980
If or when the Communist Party falls,

206
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,650
the reaction could be different in different
places.

207
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,220
And there are some big question marks over
certain regions.

208
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,820
Xinjiang is known by Uighurs as East Turkestan.

209
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,830
Some people there might want to break off
into their own country.

210
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,090
Same goes for Tibet.

211
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,900
Although doing that would not be as easy as
it sounds.

212
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,720
Other places are harder to say.

213
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,450
Would Taiwan want to rejoin a Communist free
China?

214
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,220
Would Taiwan lead a Communist free China?

215
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,470
Or would Taiwan get to finally call itself
a country?

216
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,570
What about Hong Kong and Macau?

217
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,290
So it could be similar to the fall of the
Soviet Union,

218
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,410
where some of the outlying parts do break
off

219
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,530
to become independent countries.

220
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,650
Or the non-People’s Republic might survive
largely intact.

221
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,770
But either way,

222
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,850
there’ll still be a very large country

223
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,240
that calls itself China.

224
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,290
Thanks for your question.

225
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,350
And if you’d me to answer your question,

226
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,140
join up in the China Uncensored 50-army.

227
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,880
We have a very low mortality rate.

228
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,890
And for only a dollar or more per episode,

229
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,620
we’ll give you some cool perks

230
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,320
and you’ll have the chance to send me questions

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,910
that I could answer right here on the show.

232
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,310
So head over to Pateron.com/chinauncensored
to learn more.

233
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,800
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

234
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,960
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

235
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
see you next time.
