00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,660
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,800
don’t panic!

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,080
Now’s not the time to lose your head.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,340
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,300
Meet Dr. Ren Xiaoping!

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,480
He was part of the the team

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,940
that performed the first successful hand transplant
in the US in 1999.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,430
Let’s give him a hand!

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,140
And now, he’s going out on a limb.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,120
Because he wants to be the first person to
perform a head transplant on a human.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,180
That would involve taking a living head

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,730
and transplanting it on a recently deceased
body.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,510
Now this would make headlines;

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,550
truly a medical breakthrough.

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,149
There’s one tiny problem

16
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,219
it’s impossible to do,

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,280
according to pretty much everyone.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,649
So it’s a little concerning that Dr. Ren
already has a volunteer:

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,079
a 62-year-old Chinese man paralyzed from the
neck down from a wrestling injury.

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,030
So if Dr. Ren goes through with the operation,

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,869
he will be transplanting this guy’s living
head onto a dead body.

22
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,189
And it will most likely result in a new, fully
dead body.

23
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,659
Is Dr. Ren throwing away moral ethics simply
to get ahead in life?

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,639
Or does he just have a big head?

25
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,069
Well, according to him,

26
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:23,359
he’s a pioneer,

27
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,049
heading into a new era in medicine.

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,700
“50 years ago, there was a huge debate ahead
of the first heart transplant.

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,119
Even the first hand transplant 20 years ago
faced ethical concerns.

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,859
The impact of a head transplant will be even
greater.”

31
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,979
There’s a difference, though.

32
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,429
Those operations came only after years of
research and animal trials

33
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,049
and they still were incredibly risky.

34
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,169
This is sewing a severed head onto a dead
body.

35
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:51,799
To be fair, over the years,

36
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,369
Dr. Ren has performed head transplants on
hundreds of mice.

37
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,769
The problem is the result:

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,759
Every mouse dies.

39
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,649
Not every mouse really lives.

40
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,380
Well, some of them lived for about a day.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,369
I would not call that a complete success.

42
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,689
Dr. Ren has also begun experiments “on human
cadavers,

43
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,150
but declined to give details.”

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,800
I wonder if any of them came back to life?

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,600
It's alive! It's alive, it's alive, it's alive, it's alive.

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,000
And that’s the thing,

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,510
Ren might be getting a little ahead of himself.

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,989
The first head transplant was performed on
a monkey by an American scientist in 1970.

49
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,859
But it’s hard to call that monkey business a success,

50
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,569
since the monkey died several days later,

51
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,939
after the body’s immune system rejected
the head.

52
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,650
And you don’t want to know what happened
to the monkey’s paw.

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,659
It’s also more difficult to make the transplanted
head

54
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,260
actually be able to control the new body,

55
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,090
since those spinal connections are really
hard to reattach.

56
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,700
Though apparently Dr. Ren was able to restore
some function in those mice.

57
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,730
The ones that died within a day.

58
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,060
So ethical issue number one

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,840
is that the head transplant patient will probably
die.

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,060
But even if the transplant is a success,

61
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,719
who is the survivor?

62
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,799
The head or the body?

63
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,849
But let’s say we get past all those ethical
concerns,

64
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,810
and it’s time for Dr. Ren to operate on
his first patient.

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,390
Where will Dr. Ren get the donor’s body
from?

66
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,370
People in China don’t have a tradition of
donating their bodies to science.

67
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,349
And if you’ve watched this episode,

68
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,680
you know there’s some extremely sketchy
things

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,569
going on with China’s organ “donation”
system.

70
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,999
Like how state-run hospitals there are killing
prisoners of conscience

71
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,459
and selling their organs for profit.

72
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,599
So it’s not unlikely that the body could
come from someone in a labor camp.

73
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,780
Now I’m not saying China shouldn’t try
to make scientific progress.

74
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,489
It’s just that Dr. Ren might be a bit too
headstrong to let ethical considerations

75
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:54,730
or medical reality

76
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,230
get in the way.

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,340
So what do you think?

78
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,930
Is this the future of medicine?

79
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,129
Or is this just a shameless opportunity for
me to use puns?

80
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:04,290
Leave your comments below.

81
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,170
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

82
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,100
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you next time.
