00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,760
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,110
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,930
boys and girls,

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,930
step right up to witness

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,270
the showdown of the century!

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,020
Place your bets now!

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,660
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,480
It was the showdown we were all waiting for.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,449
The world’s two biggest economies

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,239
contending for the title of world superpower.

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,310
Last week, the leader of the unfree world,

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,160
and head of the Chinese Communist Party,

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,600
Xi Jinping, met with the leader of the free
world,

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,829
and head of the Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach Improvement
Society,

16
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,579
Donald Trump.

17
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,370
The whole world tuned in to watch the two-day
fight

18
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,471
at Trump’s Mar-a-lago estate here

19
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,809
in Palm Beach, Florida.

20
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,690
Donald Trump expected it to be “very difficult”.

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,730
A high stakes gamble for both sides.

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,680
No pattycake playing here.

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,850
It was head-to-head.

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,980
Mano-a-mano.

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,469
Dare I say...a real face-off.

26
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,530
But the most important question for this epic
showdown is:

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,900
who won?

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,340
So today on China Uncensored,

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,570
we’ll give you a blow-by-blow

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,240
rundown of the match.

31
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,240
And the two contenders are out!

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,190
Trump arrives at West Palm Beach Airport

33
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,480
with a crowd cheering his name.

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,090
Definitely, a point for Trump.

35
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,830
Xi arrives at the same airport.

36
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,140
Sorry, Xi, not as flashy.

37
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,790
But wait, he’s a gentleman,

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,440
taking his wife’s hand as they walk down
the jetway.

39
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,830
Point for Xi Jinping.

40
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,890
Ok, so they're tied.

41
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,540
But I'm sure that will change.

42
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,080
Let's move on to the most hotly anticipated

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,430
part of the summit,

44
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,630
the all-important handshake.

45
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,030
Trump is famous for his patented

46
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,520
“yank-and-pull” style of handshake.

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,380
And the occasional no-handshake.

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,410
How will Xi Jinping handle it?

49
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,410
Shoot!

50
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,930
Let’s see if there’s another angle.

51
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,530
Trump goes in for the yank-and-pull…

52
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,560
but like a Taichi master,

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,090
Xi effortlessly steps in to absorb the handshake,

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,979
meeting it with a firm handshake of his own.

55
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,140
He had extensive training from China’s

56
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,560
National Department of Handshake Defense Techniques.

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,800
So that’s a point for Xi Jinping.

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,440
Next, the family meeting.

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Ivanka Trump brings out her five-year-old
daughter Arabella

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,870
to woo Xi Jinping and his wife

61
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,850
with a traditional Chinese song.

62
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,850
Trump gets a point

63
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,190
for having an adorable granddaughter.

64
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,510
Oh, and Arabella didn't sing just any song.

65
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,850
Apparently that song was a favorite of former
Chinese leader

66
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,260
and Xi’s staunch political enemy,

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,840
Jiang Zemin.

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,400
Trump gets another point for having

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,370
a political mastermind for a granddaughter.

70
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,460
What did the Chinese side offer as a comeback?

71
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,850
Showing off the power of Chinese collectivism,

72
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,410
busloads of Chinese nationalists came to

73
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,680
welcome Xi Jinping outside his hotel.

74
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,220
Or maybe they just got lost

75
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,160
on their way to a Star Trek convention.

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,700
But wait,

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,490
what is that terrible music they’re blasting?

78
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,210
It sounds like the theme song for

79
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,520
Battle on Shangganling Mountain,

80
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,930
a propaganda film idolizing China’s fight
against

81
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,540
American troops during the Korean War.

82
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,350
The song slanders US troops as “wolves,”

83
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,000
and goes on to say,

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,990
“if the ravenous wolves come,

85
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,620
those greeting them have hunting guns.”

86
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,130
Bad form.

87
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,930
But, that’s still a point for Xi

88
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,380
for largest volume of supporters.

89
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,099
But, then I also have to give Trump a point

90
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,180
for his supporters,

91
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,500
who make up for their lack in numbers

92
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,660
with a whole lot of enthusiasm.

93
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,910
Showing off the power of American individualism,

94
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,980
this guy.

95
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,760
This driver is winning so much,

96
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,580
he’s probably sick of winning.

97
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,540
And it’s a pretty close match so far

98
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,770
between Trump and Xi.

99
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,160
So what did they talk about the first day?

100
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,630
And so far I have gotten nothing,

101
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,130
absolutely nothing.

102
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,040
But we have developed a friendship.

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Friendship?

104
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,860
Friendship with China

105
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,120
doesn’t have much political value for Trump.

106
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,019
He’s already got friends.

107
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,139
Loads of friends.

108
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,789
The best friends.

109
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,939
But for Xi Jinping,

110
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,120
friendship with America

111
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,060
is a huge propaganda coup.

112
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,430
So a point for Xi,

113
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,419
and it’s looking...like a tie.

114
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,419
Shoot.

115
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,449
That can’t be right.

116
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:34,720
This was the epic showdown

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,370
between the world’s two biggest economies.

118
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,189
Superpower meets superpower.

119
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,030
There’s got to be a winner!

120
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,069
Hold on.

121
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:45,620
Trump still has a trump card to play!

122
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,080
Syria!

123
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,779
While enjoying a fancy dinner

124
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,080
of Dover Sole and New York Steak

125
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,830
and definitely not the McDonald’s

126
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,349
he’d threatened two years ago,

127
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:57,849
Trump launches a missile strike against Syria,

128
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:01,120
punishing Assad for his chemical attack on
civilians.

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,660
Boom!

130
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,860
Trump shows Xi that he is a man of action.

131
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,800
And it backs up the threats he made earlier
last week

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,979
that “if China is not going to solve North
Korea,

133
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,689
we will.”

134
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,219
Plus it knocks the wind out of the claims

135
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,250
Trump is a stooge of Russia.

136
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,350
Three points for Trump!

137
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,710
Ok, now this is getting interesting.

138
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,000
Moving on to Friday,

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,830
when Trump and Xi sat down to have that "candid"
"frank" conversation

140
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,440
they were both looking forward to so much.

141
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,659
First, what didn't they talk about.

142
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,870
Apparently, no mention of Taiwan

143
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,750
or the One-China Policy.

144
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,650
Point for Xi.

145
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,509
What about the South China Sea?

146
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,580
Well, according to Secretary of State Tillerson,

147
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,749
Trump brought it up…

148
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:48,349
but didn't really say anything

149
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,440
that Xi Jinping can't just ignore.

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,120
So actually, that’s a point for Xi.

151
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,629
What about human rights—

152
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,360
something that Trump was urged to bring up

153
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,740
during the meeting?

154
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,900
Tillerson said that Trump

155
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,840
"also noted the importance of protecting human
rights

156
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,050
and other values deeply held by Americans."

157
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Well, that's good.

158
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,080
But when a reporter asked Tillerson

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,279
whether the Trump Administration would pressure
China

160
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,259
on specific human rights violations,

161
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,259
here's what he said:

162
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,740
As to the discussions around human rights in China,

163
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,460
I think America’s values are quite clear

164
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,260
and they really occupied a core of all of
our discussions.

165
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,939
I don't think you have to have a separate
conversation...

166
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,789
They’re really embedded in every discussion.

167
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,129
So human rights are part of being American

168
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,789
so we don't have to talk separately about
human rights

169
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,850
because we're American?

170
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,119
I'm going to interpret that as no,

171
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,369
we did not talk to China

172
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,520
about their human rights violations.

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm disappointed in you, T-Rex.

174
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,860
Another point for Xi.

175
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,399
And the two are tied again.

176
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,550
Now comes the contentious North Korea issue.

177
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,559
Ninety percent of the rogue regime’s trade

178
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,569
is done with China.

179
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,189
But getting the Chinese Communist Party

180
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:08,050
to turn on its little brother

181
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,020
has been difficult.

182
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,039
But at Mar-a-Lago,

183
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,120
Xi Jinping agreed that

184
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,659
“action had to be taken” against North
Korea.

185
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:18,729
Probably launching that missile strike on
Syria

186
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,439
helped Trump get his point across, too.

187
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,370
Now it looks like China is taking some action.

188
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,389
They just sent back North Korea coal ships

189
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,189
as part of UN sanctions.

190
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:31,389
And they're also talking again to South Korea

191
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,039
about hitting North Korea with more sanctions.

192
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,850
That is a solid point for Trump.

193
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,149
But it’s also a win for Xi Jinping,

194
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,569
because giving the appearance

195
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,499
of being tough on North Korea

196
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:46,280
prevents the US from acting on its own,

197
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,110
which would have put China in a very awkward
spot.

198
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,279
Plus Xi Jinping already wanted to contain
North Korea,

199
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,610
so this is a good excuse for him.

200
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,750
I’d say it’s more of a win than a concession.

201
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,349
So Xi deserves a point for that, too.

202
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:03,280
Now, how about trade?

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,249
Surely, someone will break this tie.

204
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,300
China has enjoyed a huge trade surplus with
the US

205
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,539
for more than two decades.

206
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:15,729
Last year, it stood at 347 billion dollars.

207
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,180
And all those exports have been propping up

208
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,830
China’s economy.

209
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,150
So Trump comes into the ring

210
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,259
with harsh rhetoric about these trade imbalances.

211
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,550
At the meeting,

212
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,080
according to Financial Times,

213
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,669
Xi Jinping “offered the Trump administration

214
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,620
better market access for financial sector
investments.”

215
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,510
Xi Jinping also agreed to,

216
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,430
“Lift China’s 13-year-long ban on U.S.
beef

217
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,680
and buy more American grain and agricultural
products.”

218
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,690
And to further sweeten the pot,

219
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,190
Xi and Trump agreed to a 100-day plan for
trade talks

220
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,790
to discuss how to handle China’s trade surplus.

221
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,910
So that’s a point for President Trump,

222
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,079
because he got the Chinese

223
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:58,190
to make big trade concessions.

224
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,000
But it’s also a win for Xi Jinping.

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,019
In a masterful move

226
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,730
that can only further demonstrate

227
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,250
Xi Jinping’s knowledge of Taichi,

228
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,620
he absorbs the blow

229
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,639
and redirects it to his advantage.

230
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,200
See, by making these concessions,

231
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,300
Xi Jinping avoids the trade war

232
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,190
Trump has been threatening.

233
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,550
And the kicker is, he does it for practically
nothing.

234
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,740
All these “concessions” to Trump

235
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,460
are actually things the Chinese government
was

236
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,529
already working on

237
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,910
with the Obama administration.

238
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,290
So another point for Xi, and...

239
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,300
We’re tied again.

240
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Really?

241
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
No.

242
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,829
This cannot end in a tie.

243
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:39,450
There has to be something else we can look
at.

244
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,709
What about their outfits?

245
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:42,170
Or their wives' outfits?

246
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,449
Who won best dress?

247
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,070
Who won best tie?!

248
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,579
Or the walk that they took after lunch?

249
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,079
Who won the walk?!

250
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,079
What's that, Shelley?

251
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,670
What do you mean, the scoreboard only goes

252
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,820
up to nine?!

253
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,420
We need to know who won the summit!!

254
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,639
Fine.

255
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,030
There's only one way to settle this:

256
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,190
rematch.

257
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,640
Trump accepted Xi's invitation

258
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,100
to visit China later this year.

259
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,970
There, he will enter the dragon’s court,

260
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,569
and once and for all decide

261
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:10,610
who is the world’s sole superpower!

262
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,620
So stay tuned,

263
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,340
and be sure to subscribe to China Uncensored.

265
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,100
Roku, or Apple TV.

266
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,319
Well, unless you’re in Taiwan or Hong Kong.

267
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,459
Apple has decided we’re illegal

268
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,060
in both of those places

269
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,250
and removed the China Uncensored app there.

270
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,459
If you think that’s points off for Apple,

271
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,329
take a moment to click the link below

272
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,509
to sign a petition demanding Apple

273
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,009
to allow viewers in Taiwan and Hong Kong

274
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,240
to watch China Uncensored on Apple TV.

275
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,940
