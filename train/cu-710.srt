1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,880
Expelled for Democracy.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,880
Hong Kong Legislators are being purged

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,360
But they aren’t staying silent

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,240
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,480
Democracy in Hong Kong has been\h\h

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
killed. The Hong Kong Government is\h
now firmly in the hands of Beijing.\h

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,720
Last week, the Hong Kong government\h
expelled four pro-democracy legislators.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,320
They were accused of violating\h
the new National Security Law,\h\h

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
a draconian bill forced upon Hong\h
Kong by the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,600
It basically makes any form of dissent or\h
criticism of the Communist Party illegal.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,320
In solidarity with the four expelled legislators,\h\h

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,640
the remaining pro-democracy lawmakers also\h
resigned. Hong Kong’s darkest day...so far.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes, because it seems things somehow always manage\h
to get worse in Hong Kong. It’s like a weird\h\h

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,200
pessimistic way of being optimistic. Now matter\h
how bad things seem now, it can always get worse!

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,240
Joining me today from Hong Kong is one of the\h
four lawmakers who was expelled, Dr. Kwok Ka-Ki.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
Thank you for joining me. I\h
know this is a difficult time.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,160
It's all right, yeah. Has been almost over.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,880
So you and three other pro-democracy legislators\h
were expelled. Did any of you see this coming?

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,040
In fact, it come to us a bit\h
surprise, because we were told\h\h

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,200
to remaining to serve the legislative council\h
about three months ago in August, when the\h\h

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,760
government decided to cancel the election\h
this year and to extend the terms of the\h\h

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,640
president for another year. But then\h
three months later the scenario change\h\h

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,480
totally. And the standing committee of the NPC,\h
the National People's Congress of Beijing make\h\h

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:17,040
a decision without actually asking us to talk or\h
anything to disqualify us from being a legislator.

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,600
If you really want to disqualify anyone, you\h
should give that legislator an ample time for\h\h

26
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,360
them to, maybe she, he or she would like to\h
talk to the government and ask why, and to\h\h

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:42,640
present the case, to see whether there's any\h
strong case or any good reason why to disqualify\h\h

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
them, unless they say that so and so forth.\h
But we were never given the chance. And once\h\h

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,600
that decision made by the same committee of the\h
NPC. Everything was actually being decided and\h\h

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,720
no more rooms for talking negotiation what\h
not. So, that was a bit surprise to us.

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,040
You were expelled for\h
endangering national security.\h\h

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,760
What explanation did they give\h
you about what that means?

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:23,360
There was no one ever given a proper explanation\h
or the detail explanation as to at what point\h\h

34
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,560
we were told, or we are being charged with not\h
loyal the Basic Law or not loyal to the SAR.\h\h

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,680
But there was a case always, you were told that\h
you are not loyal to the SAR, not loyal the Basic\h\h

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Law. And, and I think for me, and in my case\h
is more likely to be, to be like that. Although\h\h

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,560
every one of us may have slightly\h
different charges, but you know,\h\h

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,000
more or less my charges is what I can comprehend\h
or understand is more or less like that.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
Yeah. So why do you think you four were targeted?

40
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,840
You better ask them? Don't ask me because we\h
all, actually all of us as a democratic come\h\h

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,600
legislator, we are trying to preserve the\h
one country, two systems. We trying to get\h\h

42
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,600
what has been promised by the Basic Law. What\h
has been promised in a Basic Law. We should have\h\h

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,200
universal suffrage. We should have all legislators\h
and the chief executive being elected by a popular\h\h

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,960
election. One man, one vote, and no others.\h
There shouldn't be any functional constituency.\h\h

45
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,600
And not only that, we should have our own system.\h
As of the 1997 will be unchanged for 50 years.\h\h

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,040
And we still have all the conditions\h
given by the human rights convention\h\h

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,080
under the United Nations. But it seems\h
all these promises has been denied and\h\h

48
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,840
there's a lot of empty promises. If you compare\h
the situation nowadays to ’97, I can definitely\h\h

49
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,960
tell you that we are actually moving backwards\h
instead of moving forward. We are actually\h\h

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
further and further away from the\h
real democracy and real autonomy.

51
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,680
Do you feel like you're in danger in Hong Kong?

52
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,200
We wouldn't in danger in Hong Kong, but you know,\h
if you talk about our own position nowadays,\h\h

53
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,480
we never know what will happen next moment. So\h
it's kind of fright of course, is a kind of fright\h\h

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,600
to the democratic legislator. We\h
never know what can happen to us.

55
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,640
So in solidarity, the remaining 19 pro-democracy\h
legislators quit, how do you feel about that?

56
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,040
First of all I feel encouraged and\h
I really felt the solidarity or the\h\h

57
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:16,640
unity that we have been sharing for the past\h
four years. But in fact, the decision was not\h\h

58
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:24,640
made at that very moment when we were discussing\h
whether we should join the remaining one year\h\h

59
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:34,320
as a final year of services to the LegCo. We\h
already had the kind of agreement that any of us,\h\h

60
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,240
who subsequently being disqualified from\h
the LegCo. Then we would like to...we\h\h

61
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,160
signed on mass as a whole. There was\h
something which were important because,\h\h

62
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,240
we try to be united. We would like the people\h
of Hong Kong to know that we are not serving\h\h

63
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:09,360
Hong Kong, without any purposes. We have a strong\h
mission on us that we should try our very best.

64
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
In the whole year that we\h
should strive for justice,\h\h

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,080
solidarity and we would try to have freedom,\h\h

66
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,280
democracy and all those things\h
which is very important for us.\h\h

67
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,200
And as we have made the decision three months ago.\h
So we... It's easier for us to make a decision,\h\h

68
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:43,920
just last week, because we had that in mind\h
already. And secondly, if we only have the very\h\h

69
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:54,560
close margin of whether we would be able to oppose\h
or withstand some unequal arrangement with LegCo.

70
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,200
We only have a really tight margin. If all of\h
us stay, then we may have the possibility of\h\h

71
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:11,840
rejecting or opposing any attempt to disqualify\h
any of us. But if we have somehow four of us\h\h

72
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,400
forced to leave the legislative\h
council, then the remaining 15 plus two\h\h

73
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:27,680
will not be able to withstand any unfair\h
agenda, decision made by the LegCo. So\h\h

74
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,240
in reality it don't have any real meaning at\h
all. So that's why we have that arrangement\h\h

75
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:48,880
actually way before we decided to join the last\h
year before the opening of this year's LegCo\h\h

76
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,840
section, which was in mid-October,\h
we all have that ideas already.

77
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
So right now, there are no more\h\h

78
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
pro-democracy legislators. What do\h
you think that means for Hong Kong?

79
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,320
It was sad. It was a saddest day for Hong\h
Kong. If you're going back to the basic normal,\h\h

80
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,720
going back to the joint declaration between the UK\h
and the Chinese government. The message was very\h\h

81
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,560
clear that we would like to preserve the original\h
system in Hong Kong for at least 50 years.\h\h

82
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,440
So we acknowledge the importance of\h
separation of powers in Hong Kong.\h\h

83
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,360
We acknowledge the independent role of the\h
administration of the legislative council,\h\h

84
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:42,640
and also the judiciary department by carrying\h
on the law part. That hasn't been the same,\h\h

85
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:53,440
at least for the past one year. And particularly\h
under the national security laws, the government,\h\h

86
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,480
perhaps in back of them is a\h
Chinese government will be able to\h\h

87
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,160
influence the judiciary by they have the ability\h
to appoint a certain numbers of judges to handle\h\h

88
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:18,400
cases relating to the National Security Bureau.\h
So, that means it's not a double blind system.

89
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,800
You know, they have dedicated judges\h
whose specific role is to look into\h\h

90
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,640
this kind of national security appeal. So\h
to us is a bit strange because in Hong Kong,\h\h

91
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,320
all along we are observing the rule of law.\h
Although we don't have them real democracy,\h\h

92
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,280
but you know, people of Hong Kong\h
is quite comfortable with the\h\h

93
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,400
so-called present system on nowadays is the\h
system before that this free establishment\h\h

94
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,240
has their own role, and they will monitor each\h
others to make sure that no one is going to abuse\h\h

95
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:05,760
their own power. So if we, as a whole, the\h
normal legislative council in the whole year.

96
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,400
The government is actually without any real\h
monitoring; they can do whatever they want.\h\h

97
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:22,640
No matter the appeals or the funding application\h
is really set benefiting the people of Hong Kong.\h\h

98
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,160
No one care about that because even if you\h
are not.... Even if there were solution or any\h\h

99
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,760
powers to be passed, it's not helping Hong Kong\h
people is still will pass without any difficulty,\h\h

100
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:42,880
because within the LegCo already 41 pro-democratic\h
legislators and two more independent legislators,\h\h

101
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,840
you still needed two legislators inclined to\h
follow what the democratic camp has decided;\h\h

102
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,800
but number one is not sufficient. Number\h
two, we can protect what exactly will happen\h\h

103
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,520
after we don't. We, we actually\h
were forced to leave the LegCo.

104
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,840
So how will the fight for Hong\h
Kong's freedoms continue now?

105
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,120
We learned from the past experience, at least\h
from the fights against say, amendment use of,\h\h

106
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,560
of the extradition ordinance said\h
we could not. And actually we never\h\h

107
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,680
rely on one single platform. We have been\h
able to kind of change Hong Kong, the whole\h\h

108
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,080
history of Hong Kong, because we have... It's not\h
only about the LegCo members, because at that very\h\h

109
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:47,760
moment the LegCo actually being locked down, we\h
will have the input from the ordinary citizen,\h\h

110
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:59,040
which is framed for them because you know, all\h
street of walk, they just come to support their\h\h

111
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:08,080
whole ideas of fighting against these extradition\h
bills. So we were able to do so because we have\h\h

112
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,960
the power on the street. So nowadays, if\h
the LegCo is actually without any power,\h\h

113
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,960
any endorsement or any progress, then we know\h
we need to decide whether we should go forward.

114
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,880
Maybe we need to go on the street. But of course\h
at this right moment, when we are under the threat\h\h

115
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:38,640
and the impact of the COVID-19 we will be ready\h
to go. We start the civil movement and secondly,\h\h

116
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:48,400
under the new national security bills, these\h
puppet, or the people who go on the street may\h\h

117
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,080
be charged eventually by the government and under\h
this national security bills. So the life would be\h\h

118
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,640
very difficult. But I think at this moment up to\h
this moment, the morale of the people of Hong Kong\h\h

119
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,160
is still very high. And we have been, actually,\h
we extending a lot of the impact over the years\h\h

120
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:19,200
by other country, like including mainland China,\h
like the Tiananmen Massacre, like the 2003 SARS,\h\h

121
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:28,960
we have a lot of experience to deal with the\h
so-called the people behind which is controlling\h\h

122
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,640
Hong Kong. But we had that experience. So I'm not\h
too afraid of that. Not too worried about that.

123
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,640
What can the international\h
community do to support Hong Kong?

124
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,840
I think the international communities\h\h

125
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,960
should continue their efforts to\h
support the people of Hong Kong and to\h\h

126
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:56,160
really ask for the Chinese government to look\h
into the whole situation and whether they are\h\h

127
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,960
using their power, whether it is any, we will also\h
have these, a lot of these unpopular arrangement.\h\h

128
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,920
You know, it's still the international\h
community still have a lot of role to play.

129
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,040
Great. Well, thank you so\h
much for joining me today.

130
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you. Thank you.

131
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:13,840
Take care.

132
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,800
And thank you for watching. I know there’s\h
a lot going on in the US right now,\h\h

133
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,520
but we can’t let what the Chinese Communist\h
Party is doing to Hong Kong slip through the\h\h

134
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,920
cracks. Keep talking about it. Keep telling your\h
elected representatives you care about Hong Kong\h\h

135
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,600
and want them to take action. And\h
