1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,859
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:04,970
KFC has a new menu item in China.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,990
Only this one,

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,649
you can’t eat.

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,110
Unlike its other menu items

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,250
which you just shouldn’t eat.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,790
China has a new umbrella-sharing program,

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,960
and it’s all wet.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,270
Plus China has a knockoff version of Disneyland...

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,610
and it’s even worse than you’d expect.

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,840
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,550
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,550
Have you ever thought,

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,670
I’d love to buy a new smartphone,

16
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,370
but I also love fried chicken!

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,340
If only there were some way to combine the
two!

18
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,160
Well, now your burning desire can be quenched!

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,270
KFC China has released...this.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,060
Yes, this is real.

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,240
KFC is partnering with Chinese telecom giant
Huawei

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,480
to create a limited edition smartphone

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,660
to celebrate 30 years of KFC in China.

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,170
It's finger lickin’ good!

25
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,640
And it absolutely will not spy on you.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,469
It comes in original KFC red,

27
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,469
and of course,

28
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,880
has the classic 11 secret herbs and spices.

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,439
I wonder if they’ll make a version

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,439
that’s two smartphones,

31
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,539
with a third smartphone in between.

32
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,210
We’ve all been there.

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,770
You’re out and about,

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,749
then suddenly, it starts raining!

35
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,759
And you don’t have an umbrella.

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,679
Well, one Chinese company,

37
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,840
called “Sharing E Umbrella,”

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,139
tried to start an umbrella revolution,

39
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:32,500
with an umbrella-share program.

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,649
Simply pick up any one of the conveniently
located umbrellas

41
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:38,700
across 11 different Chinese cities.

42
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,299
Probably should have put that

43
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,440
under an awning or something.

44
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,280
But in trying to help stop people

45
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:46,049
from being washed away,

46
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,020
they got washed out.

47
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,630
As the founder of Sharing E Umbrella

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,790
told the South China Morning Post,

49
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,800
“Umbrellas are different from bicycles.”

50
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,520
An astute observation.

51
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,340
Basically, you downloaded their umbrella-sharing
app,

52
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,590
and get a code to unlock a nearby umbrella

53
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,489
for a small rental fee.

54
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:08,440
Unfortunately, the app didn’t really explain,
well,

55
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,509
where you can return your umbrella.

56
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,560
And so a lot of people just kept them.

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,920
Almost all 300,000 of them.

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,360
And I don’t think the founder

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,040
will be singing in the rain now.

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,820
And hey,

61
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,380
remember that time you and your family

62
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,310
went on that magical vacation

63
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,920
to Nanchang Wanda theme park?

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
No?

65
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,460
Well apparently no one else does, either.

66
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,640
It opened last year but it’s losing money
fast.

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,860
It was created by the Chinese mega conglomerate

68
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,920
Dalian Wanda Group.

69
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
After it opened,

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,700
its founder told state-media

71
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,840
that he planned to set up

72
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,260
20 new theme parks across China,

73
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,830
so he could, quote,

74
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,370
“ensure Disney is not profitable

75
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,320
for 10 to 20 years in this business segment
in China.”

76
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,820
Well, speaking of being not profitable,

77
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,540
Dalian Wanda’s own theme parks.

78
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,410
This week, they announced they’re selling

79
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,950
their theme park business.

80
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,850
Dalian Wanda has too much debt,

81
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,390
and kinda needed the $9.3 billion dollars.

82
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,280
If only I had some theme parks

83
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,330
I could sell for a billion dollars.

84
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,700
“Uncensor Land.”

85
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,880
What?

86
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,820
It would be about exposing lies in the media.

87
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,060
Speaking of the happiest place on Earth—

88
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
Tibet.

89
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,070
Well, at least according to Chinese state-run
media.

90
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,370
And yet, despite how happy the Chinese Communist
Party

91
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,060
tells them they are,

92
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,330
Tibetans for some reason are outraged!

93
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,840
About many things, I suppose.

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,770
But the latest issue is that China

95
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,580
is making a region that was once part of Tibet

96
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,800
into a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Well that actually sounds quite

98
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,700
decent of the Chinese Communist Party.

99
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,780
Maybe they’ve turned over a new leaf!

100
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Or...not.

101
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,620
The Chinese regime went through a huge long
process

102
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,370
applying for the UNESCO status

103
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,130
through the United Nations.

104
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,790
And not just so they could tie with Italy

105
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,530
for the world’s most UNESCO heritage sites.

106
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,670
Yes, everything is a competition.

107
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,630
But China just lost,

108
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,000
because right after it added Hoh Xil

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,400
to its UNESCO stash,

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,880
Italy added two more.

111
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,100
But anyway,

112
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,459
what’s wrong with making this beautiful
region a World Heritage Site?

113
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, in getting the UNESCO designation,

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
China got an exception

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,109
to have two-and-a-half-mile-wide corridor

116
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:17,739
with a highway and railroad

117
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,480
running through the middle,

118
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,650
as well as to develop some of the area around
them.

119
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,590
Because nothing protects pristine natural
habitat

120
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,990
like industrial development.

121
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,460
But the main reason Tibetan groups opposed
it

122
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,150
because the UNESCO designation allows Chinese
authorities

123
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,120
to kick out the nomads who’ve lived in the
area

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,760
for generations.

125
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,430
Of course, they’ll supposedly be resettled
into villages.

126
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,979
But then they wouldn’t be nomads anymore,

127
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,610
would they?

128
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,150
And finally in this week’s news,

129
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,300
the host of the world’s most popular New
York-based

130
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
English language comedy news show

131
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,669
about China-related current events,

132
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,610
became a viral Internet sensation,

133
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,629
...when he found out that instead of reading

134
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,150
Harry Potter on his Kindle,

135
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,550
he had accidentally read fan fiction.

136
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,540
Slightly inappropriate fan fiction.

137
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,260
Hey, it could happen 
to anyone!

138
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,720
We’ll be right back.

139
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,280
I know, this video was fantastic. You're welcome.

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,640
But it doesn't stop here.

141
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,120
You can watch this, and two more segments, one ChinaUncensored.tv right now.

142
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,820
Yes, we're posting entire half-hour episodes to our website

143
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,100

So click here and check it out.
