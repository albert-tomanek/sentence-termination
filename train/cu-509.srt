00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,700
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,720
a tiny tiny chip caused a big problem.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,560
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,240
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,800
Computers connect the world!

6
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,509
Why, you and I are connected right now.

7
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,880
But computers don’t just bring you the world’s
best

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,539
China-related edutainment on YouTube.

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,710
Computers do all sorts of things!

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,800
Like transmitting sensitive data that’s
critical to national security,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,529
which gets bounced around on servers throughout
the United States.

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,359
With that in mind, maybe someone should have
realized

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,800
it might be a problem that the backbone of
these computer networks

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,170
is being built in China.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,170


16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,839
Oh wait, US intelligence agencies

17
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,410
have been warning about this for years!

18
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,749
But instead of listening to those intelligence
agencies—

19
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,719
what do they know anyway?—

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,120
a lot of major US companies ignored them,

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,050
because who can say no to low prices?

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,420
So these tech companies went for all the gold
that was

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,649
surely waiting for them at the end of the
Chinese rainbow.

24
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,780
What’s that, Shelley?

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,090
Chinese rainbows don’t have a pot of gold?

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,930
What do they have instead?

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,630
Ok, that sounds painful.

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,759
Yes, it turns out, the relentless pursuit
of cheaper products

29
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,810
had a horrible, horrible downside.

30
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,520
At least according to this Bloomberg article.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,190
It says China used microchips to infiltrate
US companies.

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,050
This is a server motherboard.

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,390
Get a bunch of these together,

34
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,120
and they’re basically like the neural network

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,640
of a giant multi-computer brain.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,770
But wait!

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,899
What’s that?

38
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,040
Don’t see it?

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,770
How about now?

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,810
No?

41
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,520
Keep going.

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,310
There we go.

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,939
That is a tiny microchip about the size

44
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,060
of the tip of a sharpened pencil.

45
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,530
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

46
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,530
Ah.

47
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,180
To clarify for our younger viewers, this is
a pencil.

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,899
In the olden days we would take sticks of
wood

49
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,159
filled with graphite and drag them across
thin sheets

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,810
made from more dead trees to draw letters.

51
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,359
It was a primitive form of writing

52
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,980
before the widespread use of computers.

53
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,250
Anyway, the chips were small.

54
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,020
But it turns out the size doesn’t of the
chip doesn’t matter.

55
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,880
It’s how you use it.

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
And according to Bloomberg,

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,390
which cited 17 unnamed intelligence agents
and other sources

58
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,430
within different tech companies,

59
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,280
the Chinese Communist Party may have managed

60
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,810
to pull off the most sophisticated hack

61
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,910
the world has ever seen.

62
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,270
They allegedly installed these microchips

63
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,140
on servers used by around 30 companies,

64
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
including Amazon and Apple,

65
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,830
as well as US government agencies.

66
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,550
“[These] servers could be found in

67
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,910
Department of Defense data centers,

68
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,880
the CIA’s drone operations,

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,200
and the onboard networks of Navy warships.”

70
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,310
The microchip would have given the Chinese
Communist Party

71
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,060
secret access a huge number of these private
networks.

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
Oops.

73
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,510
So, how did the microchips get there?

74
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,620
Well you see, there are essentially

75
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,760
two ways to hack a computer.

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
The most common kind is software hacking.

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,730
This is probably what you associate Chinese
hackers with.

78
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,310
Like when they hacked the Office of Personnel
Management

79
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,840
and stole data on over 22 million Americans.

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,780
Then there’s hardware hacking.

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,310
That involves making physical changes

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,880
or additions to the guts of computers—

83
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,120
which builds in loopholes that can later be
exploited

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,290
by software hacking.

85
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,990
Hardware hacking is really really hard to
do.

86
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,930
According to one expert Bloomberg interviewed,

87
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,960
“Having a well-done, nation-state-level
hardware implant surface

88
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,620
would be like witnessing a unicorn jumping
over a rainbow.

89
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,320
Hardware is just so far off the radar,

90
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,010
it’s almost treated like black magic.”

91
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,630
But while hard to pull off, if pulled off,

92
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,540
it would give foreign agents major control
of

93
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,230
critical computer infrastructure.

94
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,750
And it’s a little easier to pull off when
you’re the country

95
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,070
that makes about 75% of the world’s mobile
phones

96
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,480
and 90% of its PCs.

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,220
Here’s what’s alleged to have happened.

98
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,680
There’s a company called Elemental.

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,310
They make cubes that shoot other cubes with
lasers I guess?

100
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,710
Actually they specialize in video processing
and storage.

101
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,840
Their technology has been used for everything

102
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,280
from helping stream the Olympic Games,

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,409
to communication with the International Space
Station,

104
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,180
to even handling drone footage for the CIA.

105
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,900
In 2015 Elemental was bought by Amazon.

106
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,120
Wow, Amazon really does everything.

107
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Elemental is an American company.

108
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,720
And their main product is assembled by

109
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,840
another American company,

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,870
Super Micro Computer Inc.

111
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,840
They sell more server motherboards than almost
anyone else.

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,889
One US intelligence official told Bloomberg,

113
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,070
“Think of Supermicro as the Microsoft of
the hardware world.”

114
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,430
So...like Microhard?

115
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,810
No, forget that, it’s a terrible name.

116
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,729
Anyway, it turns out, Supermicro’s core
product—

117
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,889
their motherboards—

118
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,099
are mostly made by contractors in China.

119
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,930
So what seems to have happened is this:

120
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,729
Agents for the People’s Liberation Army

121
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,860
strolled into these contractors’ factories

122
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,919
and offered some bribes to change

123
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,759
the motherboard design ever so slightly.

124
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,020
Just add this one teensy weensy little extra
microchip, ok?

125
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,569
Of course, “If that didn’t work,

126
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,949
they threatened factory managers

127
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:23,069
with inspections that could shut down their
plants.”

128
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,719
And while one tiny microchip sounds like it
can’t do a lot,

129
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,449
it doesn’t have to.

130
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:29,449
According to Bloomberg,

131
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,689
“They were capable of doing two very important
things:

132
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,940
telling the device to communicate

133
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,069
with one of several anonymous computers

134
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,120
elsewhere on the internet that were loaded
with

135
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,090
more complex code;

136
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,499
and preparing the device’s operating system

137
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,870
to accept this new code.”

138
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,439
And this would give the Chinese military complete
access

139
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,639
in a very hard to detect way.

140
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,039
For example, they could make a secure machine

141
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,259
not ask for a password.

142
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:58,020
That way, hackers from China could just waltz
right in.

143
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,020
Now for a long time,

144
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,379
many Americans believed that China

145
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,669
would never do something like this

146
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:04,379
because it would jeopardize China’s place

147
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,380
as the workshop of the world.

148
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,830
And so everyone was happy being naïve,

149
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,909
taking advantage of China’s low-cost manufacturing.

150
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:14,879
Meanwhile, China continued to play a major
role

151
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,529
building global computer infrastructure.

152
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,150
And so companies became dependent on China.

153
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,440
Oops.

154
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,340
The fact that China has been a major state
sponsor

155
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,279
of cyber espionage is nothing new.

156
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,759
Back in 2015, there was even an agreement

157
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,740
between Xi Jinping and President Obama

158
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,810
that China would stop stealing US intellectual
property.

159
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,919
That was the same year

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,819
the Chinese microchips were first discovered.

161
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,029
One official told Bloomberg that the White
House

162
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,729
may have suspected at the time that

163
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:47,349
“China was willing to offer this concession

164
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,539
because it was already developing

165
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,289
far more advanced and surreptitious forms
of hacking

166
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,199
founded on its near monopoly of the technology
supply chain.”

167
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,039
Not that the US government could do much about
it.

168
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,249
Because it was the big American companies

169
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,120
that were actually to blame for exposing themselves

170
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,139
to the China supply chain—

171
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,470
and they refused to listen to the government’s
warnings.

172
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,210
So it shouldn’t surprise you

173
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,159
that both Apple and Amazon

174
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,729
have denied the Bloomberg report.

175
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,620
Except “The companies’ denials are countered

176
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,110
by six current and former senior national
security officials.”

177
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,689
In fact, not only did the companies know about
it—

178
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:25,990
according to those officials—

179
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,280
but Apple had reported their discovery of
it

180
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,349
to the FBI in the first place,

181
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,260
and Amazon went even further,

182
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,970
by cooperating in a government investigation
about it.

183
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,979
But of course, neither company said this to
the public.

184
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,139
If it happened at all.

185
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,009
Because, as I said, they totally deny it.

186
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,169
Interestingly, “Apple did sever its relationship

187
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,169
with Supermicro in 2016,

188
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,159
but claimed this was due to an unrelated

189
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,680
and minor security incident.

190
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,289
Amazon reportedly distanced itself

191
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,499
from Supermicro’s compromised servers

192
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:00,530
by selling its Chinese infrastructure to a
rival,

193
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,830
for unknown reasons at the time.”

194
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,500
Again, Apple and Amazon totally deny they
were hacked.

195
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,629
Reporters asked a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson for comment,

196
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,159
and he said, “We did it!

197
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,060
You finally caught us!”

198
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,510
Haha, just kidding.

199
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,909
He denied it—as usual—

200
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,259
saying the “reports are totally groundless.”

201
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,900
And that China, too, is a “victim of cybercrime.”

202
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,650
And you can’t blame a victim!

203
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,460
The Department of Homeland Security sort of
backed up

204
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,780
Apple and Amazon’s denial, saying they,

205
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,730
“have no reason to doubt the statements”
from those companies.

206
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,540
Which is not exactly a strong confirmation
or denial.

207
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,380
But of course, it’s one thing to warn that

208
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,010
Chinese telecommunication companies like Huawei
and ZTE

209
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,480
could potentially spy on us.

210
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,220
But publicizing this giant microchip hack

211
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,950
would be incredibly humiliating—

212
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,280
and it would also damage American companies.

213
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,290
But the Trump administration

214
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,640
may be taking action in another way.

215
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,390
They’ve put computer and networking hardware,

216
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,510
like motherboards, on the list of Chinese
tariffs—

217
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,980
meaning they’ll be a lot more expensive
to import.

218
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,240
The goal is partially to get these companies

219
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,170
to shift their supply chains to other countries.

220
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,440
Because clearly, getting hacked isn’t

221
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,991
a good enough reason on its own.

222
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,410
It’s like if a big kid at school

223
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,300
keeps getting beaten up by a smaller kid,

224
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
but he’s so embarrassed that he doesn’t
tell anyone,

225
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,750
so it keeps happening.

226
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,350
Eventually grandpappy Trump has to step in

227
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,120
and put a stop to it.

228
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,890
So what do you think of US tech companies

229
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,050
and their reliance on Chinese manufacturing?

230
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,150
Leave your comments below.

231
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,160
And before you go,

232
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,500
now is the time when I answer questions from
you—

233
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,190
the loyal members of the China Uncensored
50-Cent Army

234
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,620
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

235
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,820
Largezo asks:

236
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,340
“What kind of a court system does the PRC
have?”

237
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,900
Why China has one of the greatest court systems
in the world!

238
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,630
They convict over 99.9 percent of defendants!

239
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,360
Now, they’re not perfect.

240
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,920
In 2015,

241
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,130
about a thousand people out of 1.2 million
were found not guilty.

242
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,200
But I am confident that the Chinese Court
system

243
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,330
will soon be able to reach a 100% conviction
rate.

244
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,130
After all, when you think about it,

245
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,570
isn’t everyone guilty of something?

246
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,790
Thanks for your question, Largezo.

247
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,120
