00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,810
The Coronavirus Outbreak

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,019
reveals China’s darkest secret

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:09,270
And why is a Mr. Bean impersonator

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,860
becoming a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist
Party?

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,580
That and more on this week’s China News
Headlines

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,920
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,480
I’m Chris Chappell

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,630
The coronavirus has exposed plenty of authoritarian
tendencies

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,410
in the Chinese Communist Party.

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,119
They covered it up for more than a month.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,410
Then, the police started forcibly quarantining
people—

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,890
whether they were sick or not.

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,760
Local officials welded people into their homes.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,730
And if people complained...into the box you
go.

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,780
Or if you tried to show the world what was
happening,

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,660
you disappeared...indefinitely.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,100
But the coronavirus is also raising awareness

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,620
about one of the Chinese Communist Party’s
darkest secrets:

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,290
forced organ harvesting from political prisoners.

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,720
Earlier this month,

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,340
Chinese state-run media trumpeted a huge achievement:

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,520
the first double lung transplant on a coronavirus
patient.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
It was a story that got picked up by Western
media.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,270
But Bitter Winter,

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,950
a website that researches religious persecution
in China,

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,140
points out that there are some...

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,190
concerns about the transplant.

28
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,390
“The patient, who on February 24th,

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,750
was given days to live following

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,700
rapid deterioration of his lung function,

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,540
had only to wait a matter of five days before
a perfectly matching,

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,110
‘consenting,’\h brain-dead donor could
be found,

33
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,420
conveniently a mere seven hours by high speed
train.”

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,230
If you know anything about organ transplants,

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,270
you know that’s suspicious.

36
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,500
It normally takes months or years to get an
organ.

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,780
This of course came out shortly after an international
tribunal

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,970
ruled that “Beyond reasonable doubt...

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,170
in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners
of conscience

40
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,640
has been practiced for a substantial period
of time

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,920
involving a very substantial number of victims.”

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
For more on the tribunal,

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,580
check out our recent episode,

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,980
How to Make Money in China: Selling People’s
Organs.

45
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,970
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has gone to Wuhan,
China—

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,050
the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak—

47
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,570
to visit patients.

48
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,080
Well, he didn’t visit them in person, obviously.

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,740
He’s visited them through this TV screen.

50
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,810
Wow, he’s standing kind of far away.

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,480
Maybe he thinks you can still get infected
through the screen.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,170
But Xi Jinping’s visit to Wuhan

53
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,090
is a sign that the Chinese Communist Party

54
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,960
believes that the worst of the coronavirus
outbreak in China is over.

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,480
And his visit is just one of many reasons
the residents of Wuhan

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,459
should feel grateful to the Chinese Communist
Party

57
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:01,120
for their response to the coronavirus.

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,930
And if they don’t feel grateful enough,

59
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,430
then they need gratitude education.

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,820
That’s according to Wuhan’s Party Secretary.

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,180
He’s the new top official in Wuhan,

62
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,880
after the last guy got fired

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,940
for covering up the spread of the virus.

64
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,069
That announcement came after

65
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,480
the Vice Premiere of China visited Wuhan.

66
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,260
She was given a tour by local officials

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,569
who were showing off how cleaned up the city
had become

68
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,099
and how much food grocery stores had.

69
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:34,690
Local residents had this to say.

70
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,390
And as you might guess from that clip,

71
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,920
the Wuhan Party Secretary’s call for gratitude
education

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,790
didn’t go over well.

73
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,240
In fact, the backlash was so big that the
original article

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,550
was pulled from the internet.

75
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,700
And “Media have been ordered not to share
the original article,

76
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,800
publish commentaries,

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,700
or otherwise address the issue at all.”

78
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,270
Yeah, they really need some gratitude education.

79
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,770
China already had a vast network of surveillance,

80
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,480
with things like AI facial recognition cameras.

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,459
But that system has gone into overdrive

82
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,990
during the coronavirus outbreak.

83
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,120
And to help ensure that all Chinese people

84
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,500
show the appropriate levels of gratitude to
Communist officials,

85
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,400
that system will probably be here to stay.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,639
And don’t worry,

87
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,469
authorities will be able to see how grateful
you are,

88
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:28,319
even if you’re wearing a mask.

89
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,219
But some people just don’t know how to be
grateful.

90
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,110
Like this guy, Xu Zhiyong.

91
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,309
He’s a well known Chinese activist

92
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,460
who called Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,770
response to the coronavirus

94
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,009
“clueless.”

95
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,740
He now faces up to 15 years in jail for subversion.

96
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,430
And he should be grateful it wasn’t more.

97
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,820
Then again,

98
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,990
maybe he’ll gratefully volunteer his lungs
for transplant.

99
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,470
And you know who’s really not grateful?

100
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,559
Tibetans living overseas.

101
00:04:58,559 --> 00:04:59,879
In New York on Tuesday,

102
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,440
a thousand Tibetan protesters came out

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,560
to commemorate the anniversary of the Chinese
Communist Party

104
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,800
“liberating” Tibet in 1959.

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,779
“Liberating” Tibetans from their lives,
that is.

106
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:14,020
At least they’re grateful to be in America,

107
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,430
where they can protest the Communist Party

108
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,720
without getting their organs harvested.

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,629
Speaking of crimes against humanity,

110
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:25,509
there’s a Mr. Bean impersonator in China:
Mr. Pea.

111
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,220
That’s pea, like the vegetable, not...nevermind.

112
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,520
Here’s Chinese state-run CGTN for more.

113
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,259
“Nigel arrived in Wuhan tourism purposes

114
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,379
and chose to stay there after the outbreak.”

115
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,819
Yes, he chose to stay there.

116
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,180
And ever since, he’s become a propaganda
tool

117
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,180
for the Chinese Communist Party.

118
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,159
“Widely circulated clips of Mr. Pea

119
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,819
show him enjoying the lockdown life in Wuhan,

120
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,949
and applauding the government’s ‘brave’
decision

121
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,669
to quarantine the city.”

122
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,039
Yes, nothing says “brave government decisions”

123
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,009
like locking up citizens.

124
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,810
“The safety measures taken here on a daily
basis

125
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,379
by the population of Wuhan,

126
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:11,990
are nothing short of being incredible.

127
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,150
The government has done an amazing job.”

128
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,289
I hope Mr. Pea enjoys his 15-minutes of fame

129
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,719
as a Mr. Bean impersonator

130
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:22,619
who shills for the Chinese Communist Party.

131
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:25,009
And I thought nothing could be more humiliating

132
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,369
than doing community theater.

133
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:31,319
But the point is, everything is fine in Wuhan.

134
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,189
Which is why the government is telling people
there

135
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,309
to get back to work, ya lazy bums!

136
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,719
I’m sure the Communist Party is doing that

137
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:42,020
because the coronavirus is really under control,

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,180
and not because the economy has cratered

139
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,860
because workers have been staying at home.

140
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,879
A lot of builders have gone out of business
as well,

141
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,360
because the real estate market is collapsing.

142
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,370
But business everywhere is hurting.

143
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,559
In fact, in the US, the Council on Foreign
Relations

144
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,589
was going to hold a roundtable discussion

145
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,810
called “Doing Business Under Coronavirus.”

146
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,500
But then the Coronavirus conference was canceled

147
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,680
because of the coronavirus.

148
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,490
Very reassuring.

149
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,939
But the coronavirus hasn’t slowed down

150
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,099
China’s military ambitions.

151
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,580
The Chinese navy is outbuilding everybody.

152
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,039
I mean, priorities, right?

153
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,710
Johns Hopkins University has created an interactive
map

154
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,550
showing the coronavirus outbreak.

155
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,039
It’s been used for months by governments

156
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,819
and news organizations around the world.

157
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,580
And now the Taiwanese government is lodging
a protest over it.

158
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,659
Why?

159
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,439
Because Taiwan is no longer called Taiwan.

160
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,610
It’s called “Taipei and environs.”

161
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,569
That’s just what the World Health Organization
calls Taiwan.

162
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,979
You know, I don’t think it’s the coronavirus

163
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,059
that’s making me feel sick.

164
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,119
But the good news is that

165
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,650
after lots of negative publicity about the
decision,

166
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,219
Johns Hopkins has decided

167
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:01,160
to change its map back to saying “Taiwan.”

168
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,039
They’re now using the US State Department’s
naming conventions

169
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,870
instead of the WHO.

170
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
And coming up next,

171
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,619
I’ll answer a question from a fan

172
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,500
who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

173
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,270
But first, did you know YouTube has been secretly

174
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,929
unsubscribing people from the show?

175
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:20,680
Take a moment to make sure you’re still
subscribed.

176
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,069
And if you haven’t subscribed,

177
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,159
what are you waiting for!

178
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,800
And now for the question

179
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,460
from China Uncensored 50-Cent Army Member,

180
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,870
William Adderholdt,

181
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,940
“The WHO's name for the coronavirus "COVID-19"

182
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,590
hasn't caught on.

183
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,590
Any idea why?

184
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,680
And what would be a good replacement name?”

185
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,789
Good question.

186
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,959
Coronavirus is actually the name of a family
of diseases.

187
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,850
For example, SARS is a coronavirus.

188
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,490
So in mid-February,

189
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,490
the World Health Organization dubbed this
coronavirus COVID-19.

190
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,820
This was their reasoning behind the name.

191
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,300
“We had to find a name that

192
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,600
did not refer to a geographical location,

193
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,190
an animal, an individual or group of people

194
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,550
and which is also pronounceable and related
to the disease.

195
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,550
Having a name matters to prevent the use of
other names

196
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,920
that can be inaccurate or stigmatising.”

197
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,230
And obviously the W.H.O. wouldn’t want to
do anything

198
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,920
that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese
Communist Party.

199
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,380
But they only issued the new name months

200
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,230
after the virus first began to spread in China.

201
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,209
That was a long time for the public

202
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,670
to only have “coronavirus” as a name.

203
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,389
People got used to it.

204
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,029
And it sounds better than COVID-19.

205
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,840
What would be a better name for a deadly disease

206
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,730
spreading around the world and killing people?

207
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,829
Well, sounds like Communism to me.

208
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,910
But I think that might just be confusing.

209
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,370
Thanks for your question.

210
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,660
And thank you for watching.

211
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,839
Remember, YouTube has been demonetizing

212
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,310
almost all of our videos.

213
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,279
They’d have run us out of business

214
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,560
if it weren’t for support from fans like
you

215
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,129
who contribute on the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

216
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:14,899
I call them the China Uncensored 50 cent army.

217
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:17,579
