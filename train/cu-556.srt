1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,060
That’s no moon,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,740
it’s a Chinese satellite.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,219
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,860
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,750
Romantic moonlit walks are about to become
a lot more common,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,570
at least in one part of China.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,640
Because the city of Chengdu

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,770
plans to launch an artificial moon—

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,390
to light up the night sky.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,100
Yes, this is no joke.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,770
Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province,

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,710
which is of course most famous for having

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,910
all those stupid pandas that no one likes.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,190
And Chengdu plans to launch a fake moon

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,620
into the night sky by the year 2020.

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,640
Wow, only two years away.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,250
And it was reported in China’s official
state-run media,

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,340
so you know it’s true.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,600
According to Wu Chunfeng,

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,520
chairman of Chengdu Aerospace Science

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,910
and Technology Microelectronics System

22
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,880
Research Institute Co., Ltd.,whew—

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,120
according to that guy,

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,560
“the brightness of the ‘artificial moon’

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,270
is eight times that of the real moon,

26
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,880
and will be bright enough to replace street
lights.”

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,170
Because street lamps are really so inefficient.

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,799
Much easier to launch a fake moon into space.

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,049
But, Wu says it could save Chengdu about 240
million dollars

30
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,829
in electricity costs every year.

31
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:21,340
He says the artificial moon will be 300 miles
above the Earth.

32
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,119
It will be able to focus light on an area
between 6 and 50 miles wide.

33
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,820
I know, that seems like kind of a big range.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,820
The concept is,

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,139
it could be programmed to focus its beam more
widely or narrowly,

36
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:35,929
depending, I guess, on which neighborhoods

37
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,259
pay their moon bill on time.

38
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,659
Now Wu’s artificial moon is actually a satellite

39
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,639
that will complement the Earth’s natural
moon.

40
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,740
Here’s another scientist talking about the
Wu’s innovation.

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,020
“Who else but him would have thought of
creating

42
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:54,380
an energy source that perfectly imitates full
moon light?”

43
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,630
Wow, science is exciting.

44
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,310
Wu said the testing for the new moon

45
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,119
has been going on for years,

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,889
but it's finally matured.

47
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,319
That’s horrifying.

48
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,020
But this isn’t entirely a new idea.

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,360
Russia triedto do a similar thing

50
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,260
with orbital mirrors almost 20 years ago.

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,849
But they couldn’t get it to work.

52
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,330
A Norwegian town is successfully redirecting
sunlight,

53
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,260
but the mirrors aren’t in space.

54
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,110
Just on a tall mountain.

55
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,860
Of course, Chengdu’s artificial moon

56
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,970
is raising some questions.

57
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,770
For instance, who’s going to pay for it?

58
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,040
It’s unclear whether funding

59
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,299
is coming from Chengdu’s local government,

60
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:30,659
or the central government,

61
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:32,900
or possibly from a tax on pandas,

62
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,689
which I think is only fair.

63
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,370
However, the company making it is also the
main contractor

64
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,030
for the Chinese space program.

65
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,950
And China’s space program is run by the
military.

66
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,049
So there are some concerns.

67
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,230
First of all, what will an object 8 times
brighter

68
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,269
than the full moon do to animals

69
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,570
that rely on the natural moon cycle to live?

70
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,459
We already know that one full moon can make

71
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,250
at least three wolves howl in the night.

72
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,010
With 8 times the brightness,

73
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,470
this T-shirt’s going to get a lot more crowded.

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,370
That’s actually a point People’s Daily
brought up.

75
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,650
The point about affecting animals,

76
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,750
not the T-shirt design.

77
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,549
But, don’t worry, says one Chinese expert.

78
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:13,549
Even though the fake moon will be

79
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,650
8 times brighter than the real moon,

80
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,420
it will only have a dusk-like glow,

81
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,410
so it won’t affect animals’ routines.

82
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,920
Wait, which is it, Chengdu?

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,670
Will your fake moon be 8 times brighter

84
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,069
than the regular moon?

85
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,200
Or will it just emit a dusk-like glow?

86
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,379
Other Chinese officials say it will be powerful
enough

87
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,900
to illuminate construction sites and disaster
areas,

88
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,989
or be turned to catch sunlight instead of
moonlight

89
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:41,700
and make the day longer.

90
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,230
So it’s a fake moon that’s 8 times brighter
than the moon,

91
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,480
but only gives off a dusk-like glow,

92
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,819
except when it can be used to create eternal
daylight.

93
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,620
And while I love the potential that has

94
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,219
as a weapon to fight vampires,

95
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,959
I’m also concerned.

96
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,170
Remember, it’s a satellite being built by
an agency

97
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,360
closely tied to the Chinese military.

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,469
And the Chinese military has been making

99
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:06,540
a lot of strides at satellite warfare.

100
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,879
What if Chinese Communist Party could use

101
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,970
the fake moon satellite to focus light from
the sun

102
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,040
and fry dissidents like a kid

103
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,629
with a magnifying glass does to ants?

104
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,629


105
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,760
Now that would create some real social stability.

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,960
In any case, I’m sure the pandas won’t
even notice.

107
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,670
They already sleep most of the day, those
lazy bums.

108
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,760
So what do you think of China’s plan for
a fake moon?

109
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,220
Leave your comments below.

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,460
And before we go,

111
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,220
now is the time when I answer questions

112
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,100
from fanswho support China Uncensored

113
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,060
on the crowdfunding website Patreon!

114
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,970
Jonathan Swanberg asks,

115
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,010
“I was wondering,

116
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,160
how difficult is it to become a journalist
in China

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
and maintain your freedom?

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,190
I keep on seeing journalists being denied
visas

119
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,290
and having their credentials revoked

120
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,460
but is it as difficult as it seems?

121
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,470
It’s probably more difficult than it seems.

122
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,730
For Western journalists,

123
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,500
their movement in China can be restricted.

124
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,270
They can be harassed or even roughed up

125
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,320
by police when they try to cover sensitive
topics.

126
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,500
And over the years, many Western journalists

127
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,440
have lost their media visas following critical
reporting.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,510
Most recently, my friend Megha Rajagopalan
(

129
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,770
was denied her visa renewal after her illuminating
reports

130
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,800
on the persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang.

131
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,350
Chinese people who work as journalists

132
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,600
and news assistants for foreign media

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,500
have also been harassed and imprisoned.

134
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,420
They have even less protection since they’re
Chinese citizens.

135
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,900
And it’s worse for independent Chinese journalists.

136
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,270
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists,

137
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,380
China is consistently one of the worst

138
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,180
jailers of journalists in the world.

139
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,930
As for Chinese journalists who work for state-run
media,

140
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,930
I think the former president of state-run
media CCTV

141
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,700
put it best when he said,

142
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,500
“Journalists who think of themselves as
professionals,

143
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,490
instead of as propaganda workers,

144
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,500
are making a fundamental mistake about identity."

145
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,720
By the way, I don’t report out of Beijing.

146
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,540
And yes, I do still get asked if I’m based
in Beijing.

147
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,000
Thanks for your question.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,740
