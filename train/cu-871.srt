00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,129
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,440
China launches Missiles for Peace.

Hi, back welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,910
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,759
Ah, the South China Sea.

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,310
Home to warm, turquoise waters,

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,210
delicious sea life,

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,160
and a bunch of anti-ship cruise missiles

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,230
and surface-to-air missile that were recently
installed

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,820
by the Chinese Communist Party.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,500
According to US Navy Admiral Philip Davidson,

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,109
“China is now capable of controlling the
South China Sea

14
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,170
in all scenarios short of war with the United
States."

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,489
Now wait a minute,

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,039
I remember back in 2015 when Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

17
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,809
met with President Barack Obama.

18
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:46,249
At the time, Xi Jinping swore,

19
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,260
“We are committed to maintaining peace and
stability

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,039
in the South China Sea...

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,440
and addressing disputes through negotiation,

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,850
consultation, and peaceful manner.”

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,219
Could it be that his incredibly high pants
are on fire?

24
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,429
Of course not.

25
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,070
You see, it’s very easy to make people

26
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,570
cooperate with you in a peaceful manner

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,170
when you have a missile pointed at them.

28
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,560
Or in this case,

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,170
missiles plural.

30
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,590
This is the South China Sea.

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,960
These five countries have territorial claims.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,149
But China claims the whole thing.

33
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:22,859
Now as China’s Foreign Ministry recently
said,

34
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:25,509
China has the right to peaceful activities

35
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:28,149
in the South China Sea.

36
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:29,149
Peaceful activities,

37
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,439
which apparently include taking submerged
reefs

38
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,149
and building islands on them

39
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:37,679
and then building 10,000-foot runways on them.

40
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,649
Plus hangars for fighter planes.

41
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,310
Plus ammunition bunkers.

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,079
And, sometime in the past month or so,

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,689
putting missile systems on them.

44
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,479
This is the Fiery Cross Reef.

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,200
It’s one of three fortified outposts China
has built,

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,219
including Subi Reef and Mischief Reef.

47
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,840
They’re part of the Spratly Islands.

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,659
As you can see from this map,

49
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,359
clearly much closer to China

50
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,829
than any other countries.

51
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,049
CNBC broke this story

52
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,789
after talking to unnamed sources

53
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,289
with access to US intelligence reports.

54
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,229
And according to their report,

55
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,099
the Chinese regime has put some serious hardware

56
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,620
on these islands.

57
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,610
You know, for peace.

58
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,450
It was that same drive for peace that lead

59
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,349
the Chinese Communist Party to put

60
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,510
jamming equipment on two of those same reefs.

61
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,840
Hmmm...maybe this is all a simple misunderstanding.

62
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,890
Maybe it’s all part of the Chinese Communist
Party’s

63
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,040
new Missiles for Peace foundation.

64
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,709
After all, nothing says an end to violent
conflict

65
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,560
and promotion of stable security

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,750
than a few of these bad boys.

67
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,150
Ok, let’s be honest.

68
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,230
The only thing worse than Missiles for Peace

69
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,409
is Jazz for Peace.

70
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,680
But would the Chinese Communist Party

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,129
really lie about their peaceful activities

72
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,010
in the South China Sea?

73
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,400
Sure, they seized a shoal claimed by the Philippines,

74
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,439
using a gunboat.

75
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,880
And sure, since 2012 they’ve reclaimed

76
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,019
more than 3,000 acres of land to make artificial
islands,

77
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,019
despite this 2002 agreement they signed with

78
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,019
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations

79
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,310
not to change any geographic features

80
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,640
in the South China Sea.

81
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,050
I mean, they probably forgot what they promised

82
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,750
at that 2015 meeting with Obama

83
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,900
when they said they wouldn’t militarize

84
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,170
those made-made islands.

85
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,640
And of course they completely ignored

86
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,159
the 2016 ruling by the Hague,

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,060
telling the Chinese regime to stop building.

88
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,840
But as Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Hua Chunying recently said,

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,019
"Those who do not intend to be aggressive

91
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,659
have no need to be worried or scared.”

92
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,659
The current commander of the US Pacific fleet,

93
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,709
Admiral Harry Harris agrees.

94
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,320
“Ladies and gentlemen,

95
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,580
China’s intent is crystal clear.

96
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,590
We ignore it at our peril.“

97
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,739
Right.

98
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,069
China’s intent is very clear

99
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,819
and it would be perilous to ignore

100
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,829
how peaceful all these missile systems are.

101
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,340
I mean, even that CNBC article was very careful
to say

102
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,549
these were “defensive weapons.”

103
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,359
Yes, surely we can all trust the Chinese Communist
Party

104
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,969
has no further ambitions with these

105
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:12,400
rapidly expanding military installations.

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Though some think the Party may actually be

107
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,530
lying about its peaceful defensive weapons.

108
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,750
Ashley Townshend,

109
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,940
defense expert at the United States Studies
Centre

110
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,770
at the University of Sydney, tweeted,

111
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,210
“Calling missiles ‘defensive’ that are
deployed

112
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,290
on illegally seized features in international
waters...

113
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,810
strains the definition of the word.

114
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,680
This is power projection.”

115
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,660
Yes, it’s Power Projection.

116
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,290
Which is also the name of my fantasy hair
metal band

117
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,660
featuring Kim Jong-un, Xi Jinping, and Donald
Trump.

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,760
No wonder they built those jamming stations!

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,120
But the United States has repeatedly challenged

120
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,180
China’s military ambitions in the South
China Sea

121
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,070
by conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations,

122
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,320
or FONOPS.

123
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,160
There’s been at least six in the past 10
months.

124
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
At the end of April,

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,150
the US Air Force conducted training

126
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,570
over the South China Sea.

127
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,080
Before that, it was three US warships.

128
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,280
And while the Communist Party hates that,

129
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,770
Major General Jin Yinan of China’s National
Defense University

130
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,890
might have said it best

131
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,090
when he spoke to state-run China National
Radio.

132
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,430
“Even if all three carriers came to the
South China Sea,

133
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,720
what about it?...

134
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
What else can you do

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,360
apart from a show of strength?

136
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,610
Can you attack me?

137
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,290
Do you dare to open fire?”

138
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,230
Which brings us back to what Admiral Davidson
said.

139
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,751
“China is now capable of controlling the
South China Sea

140
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:44,370
in all scenarios short of war with the United
States."

141
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,310
And just when it looked like we avoided war
with North Korea.

142
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,750
So, want to stay up to date with China

143
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,610
and how it affects you?
