1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,520
Hong Kong Police have stepped it up.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,800
They’ve laid siege to multiple universities

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,700
And threatened to use deadly force.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,420
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,000
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,960
This episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,720
It’s great for university students and everyone
else

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,939
who want to protect their identity online.

9
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:29,569
Autumn is in the air. Students are back at
school.

10
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:31,659
And nothing reminds me of my college days

11
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,730
like cramming for midterms...

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,890
toga parties...

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,059
and utter chaos in the streets....

14
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,949
Just like this week in Hong Kong.

15
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:42,059
Well, maybe not the toga parties.

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,530
But definitely utter chaos in the streets.

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,750
The difference here is that it’s not unruly
students,

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,480
but mainly the *police* who are instigating
the utter chaos.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,410
The Chinese Communist Party rules all of China.

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,780
But a few decades ago,

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,120
they made a promise to let Hong Kong

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,100
keep its freedoms until the year 2047.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,150
Turns out, that was a lie.

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,800
That’s why protests have been ongoing in
Hong Kong

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,280
since early June this year.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,390
Hong Kongers are concerned that the Communist
Party

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,800
is *already* encroaching on their freedoms.

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,030
And now, after years of being blocked from
Hong Kong’s political process,

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,190
they’ve turned to protesting as a last resort.

30
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,450
And as the summer months wore on,

31
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,960
police began to greet protesters almost every
time...

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,570
by firing tear gas as them.

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,970
And the protests have gotten more aggressive.

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,020
And things escalated again early *last* week,

35
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,950
after police entered several of Hong Kong’s
biggest universities,

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,990
firing tear gas and arresting students.

37
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,340
That was after students tried to initiate

38
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,980
a class boycott and general strike.

39
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,530
“The clashes turned what had been sanctuaries

40
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,170
for the students at the core of the movement
into scenes

41
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,810
that evoked medieval citadels under siege.”

42
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,530
Police eventually backed down from most of
those universities.

43
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,060
But if you thought “medieval citadels under
siege” was bad,

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,110
well, a few days later it got even worse.

45
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,980
Over the weekend, Hong Kong police once again

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,610
surrounded Polytechnic University of Hong
Kong,

47
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,140
known as PolyU.

48
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,800
They began arresting students, and...

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,320
stomping on their heads?! Jeez.

50
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,690
Overnight clashes began at PolyU on Sunday
evening.

51
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,010
Police fired volleys of tear gas and blocked
the exits

52
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,240
after protesters set fires on a bridge.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,430
More than a thousand people were trapped inside
the university,

54
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,380
including reporters, medics, and high school
and university students.

55
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,470
Now, Hong Kong students are pretty straight
edge.

56
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,970
How else would you describe students who empty
beer bottles

57
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,860
to make molotov cocktails,

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,020
but don’t drink the beer?

59
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,190
That’s how you know this is not America.

60
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,650
Anyway, the point is,

61
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,510
Hong Kong parents don’t have to worry about

62
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,100
their kids inhaling weed,

63
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,730
but they do have to worry about them

64
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,970
inhaling tear gas.

65
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaking of tear gas...

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,270
It’s designed to make people disperse.

67
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,230
But Hong Kong police used tear gas

68
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,310
to *stop* people from escaping campus.

69
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,270
That’s right, they fired tear gas to keep
people from running away.

70
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,680
It’s not because they’re stupid. Probably.

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,880
It’s because the police are trying to punish
the students

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,740
until they have no choice but to surrender,

73
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,540
and be arrested.

74
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,880
For some reason, the police seemed to believe

75
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,430
that if they could arrest all of the protesters
at this particular university,

76
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,600
they could strike a huge blow against the
protest movement.

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,099
So they went all out.

78
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,130
In this footage shot by a student journalist,

79
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,100
police detain two people on campus,

80
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,440
including an Emergency Medical Services person.

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,270
Then they order to student journalist

82
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,680
to lie down on the floor of the medical center,

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,020
then to stay put, then to come with them.

84
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,790
Then police in Darth Vader-inspired helmets
lead him outside,

85
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,630
where it looks like the volcanoes of Mustafar.

86
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,900
Just...like...my college experience

87
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,180
at a small liberal arts university in California.

88
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,840
This video shows protesters escaping campus

89
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,769
by climbing down ropes from a bridge.

90
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,710
And then volunteers on motorcycles come to
rescue them.

91
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,849
Yes, times are so desperate in Hong Kong,

92
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,090
students are using what they learned in gym
class to escape police,

93
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,610
and then get rescued by biker gangs.

94
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,430
We live in the strangest timeline.

95
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,830
Other protesters attempted to escape through
the sewer system.

96
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,580
The situation in Hong Kong has become Mission
Impossible

97
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,449
and The Fugitive at the same time.

98
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,020
Mission: The Fugitive.

99
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,940
No, that doesn’t work.

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,409
What does work is apparently more medieval
siege tactics.

101
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,270
Protesters on campus faced off with heavily
armed police

102
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,779
by throwing bricks and molotov cocktails.

103
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,430
One protester reportedly shot a bow and arrow,

104
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,930
and hit a policeman in the leg.

105
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,639
And police responded to these medieval weapons

106
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,280
with a threat of modern deadly force.

107
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,270
“I would warn the rioters,

108
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,469
don’t test our bottom line.

109
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:19,229
If we have to respond,

110
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:28,190
I believe the only option is to use deadly
weapons.”

111
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,770
So once again, Hong Kong police are threatening

112
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,150
to use deadly weapons on Hong Kong protesters.

113
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,210
Which is no empty threat,

114
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,479
considering Hong Kong police

115
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,229
have already shot protesters with real bullets—

116
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:42,960
once on October 1st,

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,990
and again on November 11th.

118
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,900
Both protesters survived thanks to emergency
medical treatment.

119
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,860
But those incidents make protesters worried
that police really are willing to open fire.

120
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,539
So thousands of ordinary citizens took to
the streets on Monday to ask police to let

121
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,430
the students out of the university.

122
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,879
Including parents of some of the students
stuck inside.

123
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,729
“Save our kids”? Who are they asking?

124
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,400
Because the police don’t seem to be willing
to help.

125
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,539
Unless by help, you mean tear gas.

126
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,860
In the end, most of the students were let
out

127
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,409
to be arrested or registered by the police.

128
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,639
On the plus side:

129
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,889
Midterms are canceled.

130
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:24,930
