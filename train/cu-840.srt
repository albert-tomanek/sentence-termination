1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,400
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,700
Chinese warships love the US Navy.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,279
That’s why they’re getting so close, right?

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,940
You can’t spell re-education

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,220
without education!

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,970
And tasers.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,330
And finally, the latest way China’s elite

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,699
are showing off their wealth.

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,260
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,720
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,140
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,829
The United States Navy sent a message to China
this week.

13
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,390
Two US warships sailed through the Strait
of Taiwan.

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,070
According to defense officials speaking to
CNN,

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,100
they were shadowed by multiple Chinese warships.

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,219
I’m not sure how many multiple means.

17
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,149
The US Navy said it was a routine drill,

18
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,550
but the real message was clear.

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,929
The US Navy was demonstrating that

20
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:50,559
the Taiwan Strait is international waters.

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,149
It’s just like the Navy does with

22
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:53,890
its freedom of navigation operations

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,190
in the South China Sea.

24
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,440
The Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan
a province

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,399
and has vowed to retake it by force if necessary.

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,230
So needless to say, the Communist Party

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,620
was not happy about the US actions.

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,940
“The Taiwan issue concerns

29
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,600
China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,990
and is the most important,

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,100
most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations.”

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,070
It’s an even more important issue than the
trade war?

33
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,070
Wow.

34
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,700
The US Navy did the same thing back in July.

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,159
But lately, China has become more aggressive

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,579
in dealing with US freedom of navigation operations.

37
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,630
Earlier in October,

38
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,360
the US and Chinese navies played a game of
chicken

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,820
in disputed waters of the South China Sea.

40
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,770
“The pictures tell the story.

41
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,969
A dangerously close encounter between a US
navy ship

42
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,149
and Chinese warship in the South China Sea.

43
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,500
So close, the US navy says,

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,990
just 45 yards,

45
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,619
or 41 meters apart.”

46
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,220
To give the Chinese side the benefit of the
doubt,

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,890
those warships are also made in China,

48
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,479
so maybe the steering just broke.

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,100
Meanwhile, Taiwan intelligence officials say

50
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,600
the Chinese Communist Party has been interfering

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
in their elections.

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,310
Which is one thing they have in common

53
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,310
with the Trump administration.

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,240
But I mean, if Taiwan really is just

55
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,760
a province of the People’s Republic of China,

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,130
as the Communist Party claims,

57
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,170
then really,

58
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,260
aren’t Chinese authorities just interfering

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,690
with their own democratic elections?

60
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,690
See?

61
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,450
There is democracy in China.

62
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,180
Case closed.

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,190
Now over to China’s Xinjiang Autonomous
Region,

64
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,970
where more than a million ethnic Uighurs

65
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,709
are happily enjoying the totally voluntary,

66
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,209
vocational training centers that are absolutely
in no way

67
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,540
political re-education camps.

68
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,010
The editor of my favorite Chinese state run
media,

69
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,010
the Global Times,

70
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,879
even snuck onto Twitter,

71
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,450
which is banned in China,

72
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,980
to show us some of the fun,

73
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,870
which is definitely not staged.

74
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,980
Obviously there’s a lot that goes into making

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,210
one of these vocational training centers a
success.

76
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,180
So a reporter for the AFP

77
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,040
had a look at police requisition forms

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,549
to see just what was needed

79
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,720
to make the magic happen.

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,450
Turns out, it’s a lot of tear gas, tasers,

81
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,190
stun guns and spiked clubs.

82
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,940
And also police batons, electric cattle prods,

83
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,040
handcuffs, and pepper spray.

84
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,870
Wow, sounds like my elementary school.

85
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,680
You know, suddenly that ping-pong game

86
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,319
looks a lot less fun.

87
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,220
And in a sign that Malaysia is moving

88
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,290
further away from Chinese Communist Party’s
influence,

89
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,400
the government released 11 ethnic Uighurs
to Turkey,

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,830
instead of giving them to China.

91
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,659
The 11 people were part of a group of 200
Uighurs

92
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,659
that escaped China,

93
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:39,680
but were caught and detained in Thailand in
2014.

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,739
The Thai government sent most of them back
to China.

95
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,860
To which the rest of the world was like,

96
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,299
ooohhh, not cool Thailand.

97
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,640
But these 11 broke out of Thai prison and
snuck into Malaysia.

98
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,939
The Malaysian government decided to

99
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,610
release the Uighurs to Turkey,

100
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,209
instead of to China.

101
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,720
And it follows just a few months after Malaysia

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,900
canceled two major Chinese backed projects.

103
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,709
So needless to say,

104
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,549
China-Malaysian relations are not getting
a high score.

105
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,120
Of course, no one in China is going to be
getting

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,299
a high score for a while.

107
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,120
Because the government has pressed pause

108
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,250
on approving any new video games.

109
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,750
This “pause” started in March

110
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,230
and is expected to go on until 2019.

111
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,840
China is the biggest video game market in
the world—

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
mostly cell phone games.

113
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,920
And the March shutdown has cost gaming companies

114
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,190
about 1.4 billion dollars.

115
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,640
Video games in China are regulated by

116
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,470
the State Administration of Press and Publication,

117
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,420
which itself is under the Propaganda Department.

118
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,480
So the video game ban is

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,130
a real shame for the Propaganda Department.

120
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,030
Since video games can be such great propaganda.

121
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,530
But maybe the Propaganda Department just wanted
kids

122
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,780
to spend less time on propaganda videos

123
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,890
and more time on good old fashioned propaganda
posters.

124
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,290
Yes, children, enjoy those space crystals.

125
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,790
With your space dog.

126
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,080
Speaking of creepy,

127
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,970
according to China’s State Council,

128
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,670
the head of China's liaison office to Macau

129
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,820
was very depressed,

130
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,780
and also just leapt to his death.

131
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,590
The political environment in China is a bit
tense right now.

132
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,330
Top officials often find themselves being
purged

133
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,350
in Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption
campaign.

134
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,790
And sometimes they kill themselves.

135
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,550
Not that that’s necessarily what happened
here.

136
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,070
Sometimes people simply...slip and fall.

137
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,930
Like that politically well connected Chinese
businessman

138
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,850
who accidentally fell to his death

139
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,740
while on a trip with his family this summer.

140
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,851
Speaking of falling, there’s a new viral
trend in China

141
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,870
called falling stars, or flaunt your wealth.

142
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,170
It’s a chance for China’s nouveau riche
to show off

143
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,800
just how much better they are than you.

144
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,780
They pretend to fall out of their luxury sports
cars,

145
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,470
and all their luxury goods fall from their
pockets

146
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,180
into perfectly placed positions for the camera.

147
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,790
It became so popular,

148
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,300
the Chinese Communist Party decided to get
involved as well!

149
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,760
By making government employees do the same,

150
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,630
but to show off how hard they work.

151
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,860
State-run People’s Daily even collected
them all

152
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,760
and praised the government employees

153
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,960
for “flaunting their wealth” with what
really matters.

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,490
“These pictures may seem posed,

155
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,740
but they show that the young generation

156
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,770
dare to express themselves...

157
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,670
they flaunt their love and commitment for
work.

158
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,380
If everyone is hardworking at the work at
hand,

159
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,600
it will be the biggest wealth for the society.”

160
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,460
Why if only all government employees felt
that way,

161
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,520
then maybe fewer of them would be getting
depressed

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,350
and falling from buildings.

163
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,350
So what do you think?

164
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,700
Leave your comments below.

165
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,320
And now is the moment you’ve all been waiting
for!

166
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,880
When I answer questions from a member of

167
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,150
the China Uncensored 50 cent army—

168
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,610
the fans who make this show possible

169
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,420
by contributing through the crowd funding
website Patreon.

170
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,450
Daphne asks,

171
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,840
“Why do you think other countries have largely

172
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,580
turned a blind eye to China's mischiefs?

173
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,150
Haven't they learned from the Nazi's that
this kind of attitude

174
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,080
will lead to more problems down the road?”

175
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Good questions.

176
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,070
It’s actually interesting to look at what
happened

177
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,920
when the Nazis first first took power in Germany,
in 1933.

178
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,190
There were mixed reactions from other countries.

179
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,600
For example, these pictures are from...New
Jersey.

180
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,630
And many Western companies were initially

181
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,880
pretty okay with the Nazis as well.

182
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
I mean, we can engage the Nazis so much better

183
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
if we’re involved in the German market

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,310
and all the money there, right?

185
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,850
But there were also people early on

186
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,470
who saw some of the not-so-great stuff

187
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,910
happening in Germany,

188
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,470
thanks to newspapers.

189
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,120
And tens of thousands of Americans

190
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,110
did protest the Nazis,

191
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,840
boycott German-made goods,

192
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,071
and sign petitions asking the US president

193
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,660
to speak out against the persecution of the
Jews.

194
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,470
But President Roosevelt didn’t say anything,

195
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,340
partly because the US didn’t want to

196
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,670
interfere in a foreign country.

197
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,780
Also, Germany owed US banks billions of dollars

198
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,210
and the US government was afraid Hitler

199
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,270
would just cancel his debts.

200
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,340
Remember, this is also during the Great Depression,

201
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,460
so America’s own domestic problems seemed
more pressing

202
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,670
than what was happening in Europe.

203
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,120
And unfortunately, these are many of the same
reasons

204
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,620
why other countries are not speaking up about

205
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,170
the Chinese Communist Party now:

206
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,390
Countries are facing political influence from
China,

207
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,140
or they don’t want to get involved in

208
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,620
what’s happening in another country,

209
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,700
or they have their own domestic issues to
deal with,

210
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,810
and there’s definitely and especially money
involved.

211
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,320
Now I’m not saying the Chinese regime today
is like the Nazis.

212
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,180
I mean, it’s not like they’re rounding
people up

213
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
based on their ethnicity

214
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,060
and putting them into camps.

215
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,360
And then producing propaganda videos

216
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,990
showing how great life is in those camps.

217
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,560
OK, fine.

218
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,590
But there’s so much money to be made in
China!

219
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,130
Like by helping the Chinese regime

220
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,870
build its internet monitoring and censorship
infrastructure.

221
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,730
The same kind of stuff being used right now
in Xinjiang.

222
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,130
But Daphne, as you pointed out,

223
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,690
history has shown that ignoring authoritarian
regimes

224
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,370
can lead to bigger problems down the road.

225
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,710
And with the Chinese Communist Party’s

226
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,180
growing attempts to influence other countries,

227
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,820
people are starting to see that.

228
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,930
That’s why we need to stay aware of

229
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,000
what the Chinese Communist Party is doing,

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,510
and to share that with others,

231
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,680
so countries can’t keep turning a blind
eye.

232
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,280
And if you’d me to answer your question,

233
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,830
join up in the China Uncensored 50-army.

234
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,170
We have a very low mortality rate.

235
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,840
And for only a dollar or more per episode,

236
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,220
we’ll give you some cool perks

237
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,870
and you’ll have the chance to send me questions

238
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,120
that I could answer right here on the show.

239
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,720

Uncensored.
