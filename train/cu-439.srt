1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,250
The biggest political event in China!

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,660
But it’s a real snoozefest.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,420
This is China Uncensored.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,559
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,990

and click the notification bell icon.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,860
That way, you get an alert

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,430
each time we publish a new episode.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,180
It’s that time of year again!

11
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,760
The biggest political event in China!

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,900
The Two Sessions!

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,070
3,000 delegates descend on

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,200
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,380
Even representatives of all

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,040
the 56 happy ethnic minorities.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,250
First, there’s the meeting of the NPC,

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,040
or National People’s Congress.

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,340
And as you can see, loads of NPCs are there.

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,640
Second, there’s a meeting of the CPPCC,

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,960
or Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,200
It's sort of an advisory body

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,750
to the Chinese Communist Party, and...

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,520
Ok, I can see your eyes glazing over.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,010
I mean, am I the only one who finds

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,999
high level Chinese political discourse interesting?

27
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:09,810
Am I the only one who enjoys spending hours

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,990
meticulously reading through NPC work reports?

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,740
I mean, listen to this kind of action!

30
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,810
“The acceleration of the economy was matched

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,249
with targets for power consumption,

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,329
shipping, and other materials.

33
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:29,459
The resident consumption level rose by 2.1
percent,

34
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,270
which is equal to basic international

35
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,580
revenue and expenditures."

36
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,200
Oh great, even the translator fell asleep.

37
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,280
Okay, the Two Sessions are incredibly boring.

38
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,279
I mean, the most interesting thing going on

39
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,999
was literally a soldier standing still.

40
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,929
Even the clapping for Chinese leader Xi Jinping
was monotone.

41
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:59,450
That’s why, my favorite way

42
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,249
to gauge the impact of the Two Sessions

43
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,990
is through what I call the Yao Ming index.

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,380
I’m referring of course,

45
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,399
to Chinese basketball star Yao Ming,

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,819
who’s a member of the CPPCC.

47
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,470
Looks like he *really*

48
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,070
Enjoys.

49
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,500
Being there.

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,489
Fortunately, the Communist Party

51
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,180
has finally become self-aware-ish

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,569
about how boring the Two Sessions are.

53
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,640
So, this year, they’ve tried to spice things
up.

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,019
And what better way,

55
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,900
than by having a white guy on state-run media

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,650
tell us about the Two Sessions

57
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,090
using terrible green screen technology!

58
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,790
“It’s widely known that the key to China’s
success

59
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,379
is its system of democracy.

60
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:47,030
Which results in political stability and vitality.”

61
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,280
“How exactly does China's democratic system
work

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,760
and how can its people's voices be heard?”

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,500
Well, as Mr. Quisling explains,

64
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,459
the secret to Chinese democracy is the Two
Sessions.

65
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:05,049
“NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee
members

66
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:07,230
consist of top leaders,

67
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,319
renowned economists,

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,209
entrepreneurs, artists, sportsmen,

69
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,609
and representatives from all walks of life.

70
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,750
As President Xi Jinping said,

71
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,290
‘Democracy is not a decoration,

72
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,030
but a means of solving problems.’”

73
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,500
I wonder what life choices lead a man to do
that job.

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,680
Anyway, are you excited for the Two Sessions
yet?

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
No?

76
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,930
Okay, well using a white guy clearly didn’t
work.

77
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,470
Let’s try two white women with more interesting
accents!

78
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,379
That’s sure to appeal to...

79
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,480
whoever the target demographic is for these
things.

80
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,280
“It’s that time of year again,

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
the biggest annual event in Chinese politics.

82
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,159
Yes that’s right.

83
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,239
The two sessions are just around the corner.

84
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,329
And Roisin and I are about to test our know-how.”

85
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,329
Oh boy!

86
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:57,889
I wonder what we’re going to learn about
the Two Sessions.

87
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:01,269
“A highly expected draft law will be submitted
to

88
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,139
the upcoming plenary session of the NPC.

89
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,689
Which of the following statements

90
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,220
is most relevant to that law?”

91
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,280
Hmmm...Looks like they’re not excited about
this quiz, either.

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,620
OK, well time to bring out the big guns then.

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,680
A completely spontaneous,

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,600
absolutely not government backed,

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,100
Two Sessions rap song.

96
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,520
“Eject all the rapaciousness like shaking
off nephrolithiasis,

97
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,180
longing the hanging gardens so we turn the
entire space into oasis.

98
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,540
We've got two sessions, we've got two session.

99
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,040
For the fragrance we're blessing, to the world
we show our affection.

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
See we've got two sessions let me show you
Chinese manners.

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
Tramp the bygone cession we're the fortitude
presence.”

102
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,660
How could anyone think the Two Sessions are
boring, now?

103
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,140
Sure, if you listen to the whole thing it

104
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,810
doesn’t actually explain the Two Sessions.

105
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,400
Plus it sounds like someone tried to create
a rap

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,700
using SAT-vocabulary Mad Libs.

107
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,640
But it’s definitely the first rap song

108
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,600
to use the word “nephrolithiasis”,

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,960
also known as kidney stones.

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,340
And listening to that rap is like trying to
pass one.

111
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,640
Now Quartz quotes a culture editor

112
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,820
who calls the rhymes “hilariously awkward”—

113
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,970
but asks, “what really rhymes with ‘supercomputer’”?

114
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,040
Umm, challenge accepted.

115
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,520
Yeah, uhhh, this one goes out to that lovable
Pooh bear—

116
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,020
Xi Jinping.

117
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,560
Sendin’ probes to the moon, got my super
computer.

118
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
On the high speed rails,

119
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,180
I’m a super commuter.

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,260
Shopping all day,

121
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,180
like I’m a wealthy consumer.

122
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,060
I can pack it all up, in a suitcase scooter.

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,580
What’s that shelley?

124
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,500
My rhymes are smelly?!

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,950
Fine, I guess it’s harder than it seems.

126
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,720
Of course this isn’t the first time the
Party

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,640
has used music videos to impart important
ideas.

128
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,720
There’s everyone’s favorite Belt and Road
song!

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,100
“The future’s coming now.

130
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,900
Oh oh oh oh.

131
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,160
The Belt and Road is how.

132
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,300
Oh oh oh oh.”

133
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,760
And who could forget about this gem from 2015?

134
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,100
“If you wanna know what China’s gonna
do,

135
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,140
best pay attention to the shi san wu.

136
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,300
The shi san wu.

137
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,680
The shi san wu.

138
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,860
The shi san what?

139
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,720
The shi san wu.

140
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,340
Anyway, what were we talking about?

141
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,120
Oh right.

142
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,160
The Two Sessions.

143
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,660
It’s so boring I let myself get distracted.

144
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,900
Anyway, it’s probably important

145
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,940
for understanding the political direction
of China,

146
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,820
but it’s going on for an entire two weeks
so...yeah,

147
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,610
let’s wrap this up.

148
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,650
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

149
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,920
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

150
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
See you next time.
