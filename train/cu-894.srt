1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,359
you won’t believe why the CCP

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,709
kidnapped and tortured this billionaire.

4
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:09,400
Actually, if you watch this channel a lot,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,940
you probably will.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,580
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,060
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,260
Chinese police have kidnapped and detained

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,180
a Chinese-born Canadian billionaire.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,180
Um, no.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,530
That’s a different Chinese-born Canadian
billionaire.

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,290
Apparently, this is not a great time

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,680
to be a Chinese billionaire.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,940
Today I’m talking about Sun Qian.

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,340
She’s the co-founder of Beijing Leadman

16
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,840
Biochemistry Co.

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,720
She and her husband are worth

18
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,820
an estimated 3.5 billion yuan,

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,820
according to the Hurun report

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,580
which tracks China’s wealthy.

21
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,040
And her situation is a little different

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,180
from those other billionaires.

23
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,270
Back in February,

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,710
twenty policemen ransacked her home in Beijing

25
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,560
and arrested her.

26
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,280
According to her lawyer in China,

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,190
in detention she’s been shackled,

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,190
pepper sprayed,

29
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,200
and not allowed to sleep.

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,550
So what heinous crime

31
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,520
did Sun Qian commit?

32
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,530
Corruption?

33
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,530
Embezzlement?

34
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,530
Extortion?

35
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,900
No, no, her crime was much,

36
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,580
much worse.

37
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,740
She was meditating.

38
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,500
That’s right,

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,420
meditating.

40
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,540
Sun Qian practices Falun Gong.

41
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,240
Falun Gong is a meditation system

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,590
the Chinese Communist Party has been persecuting

43
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,620
for nearly 20 years.

44
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,640
As the Beijing First Procuratorate Branch

45
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,160
said,

46
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,060
Sun Qian was “using a heretical religious
organization

47
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,039
to undermine the law.”

48
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,369
Which she did.

49
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:37,680
By meditating.

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,840
In the privacy of her own home.

51
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,340
Now, meditating may sound pretty innocent—

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,359
especially compared to all the horrible things

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,590
corrupt Chinese officials have done.

54
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,580
But if you’ve been watching

55
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,860
China Uncensored for a while,

56
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,840
you know that there’s nothing—

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,619
nothing—the CCP fears more

58
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,759
than Falun Gong and its dangerous principles

59
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,819
of truth, compassion, and tolerance.

60
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,649
Except possibly giant spiders.

61
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,080
What's that, Shelley?

62
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,340
They're not afraid of spiders?

63
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,000
So still just these people...

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
quietly standing there...

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
and peacefully sitting there.

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,140
I mean, they way they close their eyes

67
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,120
is kind of menacing.

68
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,659
How could you not kidnap and torture

69
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,820
people for doing that?

70
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,700
But wait, you say!

71
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,920
Sun Qian is a Canadian citizen!

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,500
What right do Chinese police have

73
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,819
to detain her for so long?

74
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,140
Well, even though she is a Canadian citizen,

75
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,540
she also has a Chinese passport,

76
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,230
and China doesn’t recognize dual citizenship.

77
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,760
It's part of the Communist Party’s attitude

78
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,659
that ethnically Chinese people anywhere in
the world

79
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,829
belong to China,

80
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,840
regardless of citizenship.

81
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,330
Or international law.

82
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,180
Or objective reality.

83
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,740
And yes, that does also apply

84
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,420
to ethnically Chinese pandas, as well.

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,660
Speaking of international law,

86
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,430
isn't there any way Sun Qian's lawyer

87
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,240
can at least get her deported to Canada?

88
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,140
Well, guess what!

89
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,140
She doesn’t have a lawyer anymore.

90
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,130
He was forced to drop her as a client, because,

91
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,750
“Partners in his law firm told him

92
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,579
that if he represents Ms. Sun

93
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:16,060
or any other Falun Gong case,

94
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,799
they ‘will cancel his contract

95
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,960
to continue working with the firm.’”

96
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,140
That was after the local Justice Bureau

97
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,870
put pressure on both the law firm

98
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,170
and the lawyer.

99
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,209
In China,

100
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,750
justice isn’t blind;

101
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,160
it’s dead.

102
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,700
Now what I want to make clear is,

103
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,489
Sun Qian wasn’t doing any

104
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,170
Falun Gong related activities in China.

105
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,500
She wasn’t handing out fliers

106
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,890
about the practice,

107
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,549
protesting against the Party's persecution,

108
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,600
or even doing the Falun Gong

109
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,120
meditation exercises publicly.

110
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,880
After years of suffering from health issues,

111
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,220
in 2014 she tried the Falun Gong exercises.

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,709
She credits Falun Gong with alleviating her
illnesses,

113
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,140
.and continued to practice.

114
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,580
So clearly, detaining her for meditating

115
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,740
in her own home in Beijing

116
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,060
is a bit of an overreaction.

117
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,159
But this is the Communist Party.

118
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,859
The same people who sent undercover police

119
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,569
to watch the 12-year-old daughter

120
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,640
of a Chinese human rights activist

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,140
while she was at school... in the bathroom

122
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,280
Yeah, I'm not sure the Party

123
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,500
knows the meaning of the word "overreaction."

124
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,220
So now, how should we,

125
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,570
as citizens of the free world,

126
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,000
respond to the Chinese regime’s

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,130
absurd torture of Sun Qian?

128
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,800
By keeping it as quiet as possible.

129
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,920
At least, that was the response

130
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,780
from Canada’s ambassador to China,

131
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,840
John McCallum.

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,130
When he was asked about Sun’s case,

133
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,910
he said it doesn’t help the person in detention,

134
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,750
“if we broadcast their situation in public,

135
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,750
so I think for those cases,

136
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,130
almost all the time,

137
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,020
it is better to proceed in a low-profile way.”

138
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,420
You see, outside pressure

139
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,870
won’t help Sun.

140
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,350
And it could even jeopardize

141
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,370
all of the potential sweet deals

142
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,540
between Canada and China.

143
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,150
Like that one where a Chinese company

144
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,860
can buy a Canadian company

145
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,140
that handles military contracts

146
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,750
without a security review.

147
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,000
Or that free trade agreement.

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,560
Or that extradition treaty,

149
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,700
which should be sounding completely psychotic

150
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,450
right about now.

151
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,820
So you can see why some people

152
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,880
in the Canadian government

153
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,340
might want to, you know,

154
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,160
“proceed in a low-profile way.”

155
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
But all the evidence suggests that if the

156
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
goal

157
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,070
is to actually get Sun Qian released,

158
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,080
then lots and lots of media attention

159
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,680
is exactly what’s needed right now.

160
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,320
According to her former lawyer,

161
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,300
in the early days of her detention,

162
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,870
she was kept in a small darkened room,

163
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,980
and that only stopped

164
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,660
“after the Canadian embassy became involved.”

165
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,490
And in another case of

166
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,220
a Canadian Falun Gong practitioner

167
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,980
being detained in China,

168
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,720
it was the Canadian public outcry

169
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,800
that helped stop him from being tortured.

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,962
And after his case started to be

171
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:57,700
a diplomatic embarrassment to China and Canada,

172
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,210
he was released from a labor camp

173
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,220
and sent back to Canada.

174
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,660
Fortunately, there is a group

175
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,970
of Canadian Members of Parliament

176
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,500
who are publicly calling for Sun Qian’s
release.

177
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,960
MP Peter Kent said,

178
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,200
“We think that the Canadian government

179
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,730
should be far more forceful

180
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,380
in representing this Canadian citizen.”

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
But there’s one Canadian

182
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,340
who’s willing to stand up

183
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,770
to the Chinese Communist Party

184
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,410
even more:

185
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,410
Miss World Canada,

186
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,670
and friend of the show,

187
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,380
Anastasia Lin.

188
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,380
This week,

189
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,520
she gave a speech at United Nations

190
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,040
Human Rights Council in Geneva

191
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,020
calling for Sun’s release.

192
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,180
And what was China’s response

193
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,690
to a beauty queen being the only one man enough

194
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,040
to call them out for torturing a Canadian citizen?

195
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,760
They said, Falun Gong is not a religion

196
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,300
but an evil cult

197
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,490
and also an anti-China organization...

198
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,570
The Government of China has arranged help

199
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,620
for those tricked into practicing Falun Gong.”

200
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,520
Ohhh, right, I get it.

201
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,520
Sun Qian—

202
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,530
a woman who built

203
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,740
a multi-million dollar company from scratch—

204
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,330
is actually really dumb!

205
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,000
She was tricked into thinking her health improved

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,780
when practicing Falun Gong.

207
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,930
But, you see,

208
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,440
what’s actually improving her health

209
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,900
is being chained to a chair

210
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,220
and pepper sprayed in the face

211
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,960
until the can is empty,

212
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
and then sitting in her pepper-sprayed clothes

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
for 10 days.

214
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,820
It's all right here in the Communist Party's

215
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,200
best-selling book,

216
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,770
“10 Steps to Perfect Health,

217
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,180
With Chinese Characteristics.”

218
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,410
Let’s see, Step 1:

219
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,360
Admit that you’re not

220
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,290
as healthy as you look.

221
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,600
Or feel.

222
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,510
Or doctors tell you you are.

223
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,880
Step 2:

224
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,390
Ask the Chinese police for help.

225
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,390
And...

226
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,950
It looks like steps 3 through 10

227
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,450
are all just various torture methods.

228
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,560
Makes sense.

229
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
No wonder this book is

230
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,490
a mandatory bestseller in China.

231
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,940
Of course Anastasia Lin

232
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,640
is also taking a risk by speaking out.

233
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,390
She’s guilty of the same thing Sun is:

234
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,480
Being a Chinese-born Canadian citizen

235
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,260
who practices Falun Gong.

236
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,520
Though really,

237
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,860
Anastasia’s situation is even worse.

238
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,080
She’s gotten so much publicity.

239
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,250
That really doesn’t protect her

240
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,970
from the Chinese Communist Party.

241
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,400
I mean, imagine if they

242
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,160
tried to do something to her?

243
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,340
Why, there’d be an insane public outcry,

244
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,600
which—according to the Canadian ambassador—

245
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,160
would only make things worse for her,

246
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
somehow.

247
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,100
And in a way,

248
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,340
Anastasia Lin and Sun Qian

249
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,860
are even more of a problem

250
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,320
for the Communist Party than other

251
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,370
Falun Gong practitioners.

252
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,030
Because as you saw earlier,

253
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,200
the Party wants to pretend that

254
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,780
people who practice Falun Gong

255
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,260
are just dumb,

256
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,530
misled sheeple.

257
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,270
Old people who don't know any better.

258
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,920
Surely no one educated or successful,

259
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,669
like a Chinese billionaire

260
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,690
or an international beauty queen,

261
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,180
would ever practice Falun Gong.

262
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,380
So Sun Qian is in trouble.

263
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
And I bet you’d like to help me

264
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,830
put pressure on both the Chinese Communist
Party

265
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,080
and the Canadian government

266
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,690
to rescue her.

267
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,820
Anastasia Lin has started

268
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,060
this online petition.

269
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,050
It demands that Canadian Prime Minister,

270
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,050
Justin Trudeau

271
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,050
to do everything he can

272
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,590
to bring Sun Qian home.

273
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,770
C’mon, Trudeau.

274
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,950
Stop hugging those pandas.

275
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,380
You're just going to have to send them

276
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,860
back to China, anyway.

277
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,900
I signed the petition,

278
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,160
and I hope you do, too.

Once again,

286
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,340
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

287

See you next time.
