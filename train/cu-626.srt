1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,960
A massive database leak

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,040
Exposes millions of Chinese\h
Communist Party members

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,880
And shows how the Party\h

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,920
Infiltrates foreign companies

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,360
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris\h
Chappell. News broke this week of a\h\h

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,240
leaked database of almost 2 million\h
Chinese Communist Party members.\h

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,040
What’s amazing about this database is not just\h
that it exposes people who are members of the\h\h

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,080
Communist Party, and are now living and working\h
all over the world from Australia, to the US,\h\h

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,240
to the UK. But it’s amazing because it\h
lifts the lid on how the Party operates\h\h

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:49,280
under President and Chairman Xi Jinping. This\h
leak shows that Party branches are embedded\h\h

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,480
in some of the world’s biggest companies\h
and even inside government agencies.\h

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,160
Now the idea that there are Party branches\h
embedded inside foreign companies in China is\h\h

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,480
shocking news...if you haven’t\h
been watching China Uncensored.\h

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,160
Today, the Chinese Communist Party\h
controls the entire Chinese government.\h\h

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,480
It controls the Chinese military.\h
It controls the court system.\h\h

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,440
It controls education, from kindergarten to\h
universities. It controls all major companies,\h\h

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,720
by requiring companies with 50 or more\h
employees to have a Communist Party branch.\h

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,560
Thanks, past Chris.\h

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
But this latest leak is still pretty significant.\h\h

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,600
And not just because most people...don’t watch\h
China Uncensored. It’s that the more information\h\h

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
that comes out about the Chinese Communist\h
Party and how they actually operate, the better.\h\h

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,280
Because many people tend to forget the fact\h
that China is controlled by the Communist Party.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,600
They like to pretend that Chinese\h
leaders are a bunch of highly efficient,\h\h

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,880
extremely wise, technocratic engineers.\h

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Who build glittering skyscrapers and high\h
speed trains, but never concentration camps.\h

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,040
I mean, Chinese leaders don’t\h
even *believe* in communism.\h\h

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,120
So we should definitely do business with them.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,200
So this database of 1.95 million\h
Chinese Communist Party members and\h\h

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,720
79,000 Party branches is an inconvenient\h
reminder that it’s an authoritarian regime\h\h

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,840
with tentacles in every part of Chinese society.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,520
And it shows how Communist\h
Party branches have infiltrated\h\h

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Western companies. Which I’ll\h
talk about later in the episode.

33
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,560
But first, how was this database leaked? And is\h
it real? The answer, after this commercial break.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Welcome back. There’s been a massive database\h
leak of nearly 2 million Communist Party\h\h

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
members. How was it leaked? And is it real?

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,640
The database appears to be from 2016.\h
In September, it was leaked to the IPAC,\h\h

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,000
the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance\h
on China. It’s a group of 150\h\h

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
legislators from different countries who are\h
concerned about the Chinese Communist Party.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
The IPAC then gave it to a group\h
of journalists for verification.

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
The Australian also independently\h
obtained another version of the\h\h

41
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
database, which was analyzed by\h
cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Internet 2.0 was able to determine that the data\h
was physically taken from a server in April 2016.

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,080
And then it was shared online with\h
different groups of Chinese activists.\h

44
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,480
The media organizations with access to\h
the database have said that they will\h\h

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,960
not be publishing the whole thing publicly. That’s\h
because it includes names, birthdates, ID numbers,\h\h

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,200
and sometimes even addresses and phone numbers.

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,440
There is at least one version of\h
the database that can be found\h\h

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,440
online. We’ve looked at it. But\h
we can’t confirm that this version\h\h

49
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,560
is the same as the one sent to the IPAC or\h
seen by these other media organizations.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,160
There’s also a question of whether the database\h
is accurate. Some of the people the Australian\h\h

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,840
contacted did not know how they got on the list\h
or strongly denied ever being a member of the CCP.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,040
Although there are also people in the database who\h
are known security risks, like scholar Chen Hong,\h\h

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,120
whose Australian visa was revoked in September.

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
Just to be clear: Even if all of\h
the names on the list are accurate,\h\h

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
that doesn’t mean all of these people are spies.

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,400
Remember, there are 92 million\h
Chinese Communist Party members,\h\h

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
according to the Party. Most of them aren’t spies.

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
Like I’ve said before, people typically join the\h
Party for personal reasons—like getting a better\h\h

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,600
job, more access for the company they own, and so\h
on. China is a very competitive place, and most of\h\h

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,280
China’s elite became elite because either they\h
joined the Party, or their family members did.\h

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,360
Jack Ma wouldn’t have become China’s richest\h
man if he hadn’t joined the Communist Party.

62
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
Of course, that also means that the\h
Party gets to show Jack Ma who’s boss.

63
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,680
I mean, the Communist Party shows\h
everybody else in China who’s boss, too. So\h\h

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,040
you can’t really escape that.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,160
But joining the Communist Party is a big deal.\h\h

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,920
You have to swear an oath, vowing to\h
fight for communism throughout your life,\h\h

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,000
to be ready to sacrifice your all for the\h
Communist Party, and to never betray the Party.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,200
And like with every Faustian bargain, at some\h
point you have to give the devil his due.\h

69
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
So in some ways it’s not surprising that this\h
database shows there are Chinese Communist\h\h

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,080
Party members working for the Australian,\h
British, and US consulates in Shanghai.

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,640
Including three female employees\h
of the US consulate in Shanghai.

72
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,000
Especially since the Chinese regime picks who\h
can work in foreign consulates and embassies.\h\h

73
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,960
All foreign missions have to hire local Chinese\h
staff through state-owned enterprises like\h\h

74
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,000
the Shanghai Foreign Service Group.\h
Your reliable HR management expert!

75
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,720
It’s like outsourcing your human resources\h
department to the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

76
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,760
And you thought HR couldn’t get more evil.

77
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,760
Is that a security risk?\h\h

78
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,520
Yes, yes it is. But I’m sure the US\h
consulate in Shanghai is aware of that.\h

79
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,560
And even if these Chinese employees aren’t\h
officially Communist Party members, they could\h\h

80
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,840
still be forced to spy on the US consulate\h
under China’s national intelligence law.

81
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,640
The law states that “Any organisation and\h
citizen shall, in accordance with the law,\h\h

82
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,440
support, provide assistance, and\h
cooperate in national intelligence work.”

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,680
So on one hand, this report isn’t alarming because\h
this is just the way things are done in China.\h

84
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,000
On the other hand, this report\h
is *extremely* alarming because\h\h

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,640
this is just the way things are done in China?!!

86
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,480
Ahem. But that’s not all we learned\h
from this database. We learned\h\h

87
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,720
just how many Communist Party branches there are\h
in foreign companies with operations in China.

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
Which I’ll tell you about after the break.

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,640
Welcome back. This database leak\h
shows how are Chinese Communist\h\h

90
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,000
Party branches everywhere—including\h
in every major foreign company\h\h

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,040
operating inside China. These include HSBC,\h
Citibank, Ikea, Pfizer, Qualcomm, and Boeing.

92
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,640
In many cases, these companies have\h
multiple Party branches in China.

93
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,640
“For example, Boeing has 17\h
branches, totaling 252 CCP members.”

94
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
Qualcomm has over 200 members\h
across seven Party branches.\h

95
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
Pfizer has four Party branches in Shanghai.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Even my alma mater, NYU, has a Party\h
branch at its Shanghai campus.\h

97
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,400
I’m glad I gave NYU so much money.

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,520
But how much influence do these Party\h
branches have in these foreign companies?\h\h

99
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
It’s hard to say.\h

100
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,680
Foreign companies with more than 50 employees\h
had always been required by Chinese law to have\h\h

101
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,600
a Communist Party branch, but for a\h
while it didn’t seem like a big deal.

102
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Then back in 2017, Chinese leader Xi Jinping\h
started a campaign to increase the influence\h\h

103
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,280
of the Communist Party in Chinese society. And\h
foreign firms started feeling the pressure.

104
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,800
By the end of 2017, Disney’s Shanghai\h
theme park had 300 Communist Party members.

105
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,040
Oh, that explains a lot.

106
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,240
“Some companies were under ‘political pressure’\h\h

107
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
to revise the terms of their joint\h
ventures with state-owned partners\h\h

108
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,600
to allow the party final say over business\h
operations and investment decisions.”

109
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,640
Company executives “expressed concerns\h
about increasing demands from the party\h\h

110
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,760
or noted increased activity from party groups.”

111
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
But this was so politically\h
sensitive that companies\h\h

112
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
would only discuss it with the media anonymously.\h

113
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,080
Although at one point it got so bad that the\h
German ambassador actually called it out publicly.

114
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
But that didn’t stop the problem.

115
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,760
And this database leak now shows that senior staff\h
at HSBC, Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank\h\h

116
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,840
are Chinese Communist Party members. Senior staff!

117
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
And what about Chinese companies\h
that have foreign operations?\h\h

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,360
Do they have Communist Party branches in other\h
countries? According to this database, yes.

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,960
Chinese state-owned shipping\h
giant COSCO has nearly three\h\h

120
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,840
thousand Party members across\h
118 Party branches worldwide.\h

121
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
That includes two small Party branches in the UK.

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
As you can imagine, the Chinese Communist\h
Party is not happy about this database leak.\h

123
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
According to my favorite Chinese\h
state-run media, the Global Times,\h\h

124
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
the West is hyping the leaked list to sow discord.

125
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,320
And they’re just fantasizing\h
about CPC infiltration.\h

126
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,720
Although if you want to show that the\h
Chinese Communist Party is totally\h\h

127
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
harmless and the threat is all fantasy,\h
maybe you want to use a different photo.

128
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,040
But like I said earlier, this data leak shows\h
us some interesting information about how\h\h

129
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,800
the Chinese Communist Party is operating\h
within these foreign companies.\h

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
And if this shocks you,\h
there’s only one thing to do:\h\h

131
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,920
Stop watching China Uncensored, wait a few\h
months, and you’ll probably just forget.

132
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,800
Oooh, look at that glittering skyline!\h
Please, China, take our money!

133
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,720
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a viewer who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

134
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Jason asks: What's some investment companies\h
that won't send our money to China and other\h\h

135
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,720
authoritarian countries. I vaguely remember\h
y'all did an episode in the past about an\h\h

136
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,840
investment company that won’t invest our money\h
in countries like Saudi Arabia, and China.

137
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,200
Great question, Jason. It’s pretty hard to\h
find an investment company that doesn’t put\h\h

138
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,960
your money in China or in Chinese companies\h
in the US. And that’s because China is a huge\h\h

139
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,080
part of most emerging markets indexes.\h
I believe you’re referring to an episode\h\h

140
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,480
of our podcast where we talked to Perth\h
Tolle, from Life and Liberty Indexes.\h

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,400
They provide the world’s only\h
freedom-weighted ETF. If you\h\h

142
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,800
haven’t heard that episode, you\h
should definitely check it out.\h\h

143
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,280
It’s fascinating and terrifying how we’re all\h
invested in China without even knowing it.\h

144
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,640
I just want to make it clear that I’m\h
not qualified to give investing advice.\h\h

145
