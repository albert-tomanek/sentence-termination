00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,020
how not to make your village look good.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,940
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,080
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,130
Chinese officials love promoting their local
jurisdictions.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,170
It reflects well on them

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,010
and helps them not get purged.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,000
It’s a proud tradition,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,130
dating back to the days of the Great Leap
Forward,

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,400
when local officials would report huge crop yields,

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,680
even as crops lay rotting in the field

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,910
because the farmers were being forced to produce steel.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,610
People literally moved their crops next to
the train tracks,

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,790
so that when Chairman Mao passed by,

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,610
things looked great!

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,670
Look at these kids,

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,399
jumping on a huge crop yield!

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,850
Too bad it's a fake photo—

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,930
one of the most famous ones used during the
Great Leap Forward.

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,329
Anyway, it led to famine.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,840
It was a Great Famine though!

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,890
Of course, those were the old days.

23
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,510
Times have changed.

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,570
Now there’s Photoshop!

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,850
So local officials show their commitment to
their constituents

26
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,120
by visiting the elderly,

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,720
inspecting the ecological development,

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,770
and of course,

29
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,330
overseeing the destruction of bootlegged alcohol.

30
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,869
It kind of looks like they were way better
at faking photos

31
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,820
before Photoshop.

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,650
But the relentless drive to improve spurns
them forward.

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,130
Because officials in China’s Anhui province

34
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,030
have taken the time to brush up their photo
skills.

35
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,230
This lovely slide show is from a publicity
shoot

36
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,479
that’s totally meant to attract visitors
and investors

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,230
to the sleepy village of Jiulonggang—

38
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,200
and absolutely not a vanity project by the
deputy village chief,

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Wang Xue,

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,600
who just happens to be the woman in the photos.

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,930
Wow, she's got some great...

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,170
Instagram filters.

43
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,870
After the photos went viral,

44
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,530
state-run media emphasized that this was a
personal album

45
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,380
that she spent her own cold hard yuan on.

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,250
And that she was doing it just to make sure

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,330
that people saw the beauty of...

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,090
her hometown.

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,200
But Chinese netizens missed the point,

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
because they seemed more focused on Ms. Wang

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,330
than the rural beauty of the village.

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,330
One wrote,

53
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,330
“Before I come, I need to know,

54
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,840
do you have a boyfriend?”

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,130
He should be executed…

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,060
Except, they may have a point.

57
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,370
Because, let’s take her out of the photographs
for a moment...

58
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,630
and now the romantic,

59
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,250
rustic charm,

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,700
just seems a bit more run down than anything
else.

61
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I mean,

62
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,670
is this a stairwell you want to be in?

63
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,670
Yeah,

64
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,849
looks more like Silent Hill now.

65
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,800
By the way, Chinese netizens,

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
Ms. Wang is single,

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,390
and “jokes she would be

68
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,170
surprised and happy to get a boyfriend through
this photoshoot.”

69
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,739
I would say she has a higher chance of getting
a boyfriend

70
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,530
than the village has of getting tourists.

71
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,700
Of course,

72
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,459
this is just one of many attempts at good
publicity

73
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,620
happening in any number of villages in China.

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,390
It's all part of a tourism push being promoted

75
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,980
by Chinese authorities,

76
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,170
who are trying to encourage people to spend
money to help the economy.

77
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,080
Different villages are trying to play to their
strengths.

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,770
Like this tea village that's trying to encourage
tea tourism,

79
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,209
by "repainting houses and building roads."

80
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,209
Or this village,

81
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,599
which is encouraging street art to attract
tourists.

82
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,290
What the heck is that?!

83
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,519
It's like a set for American Horror Story:
Menagerie.

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,680
These Chinese villages have got to stop getting
their inspiration

85
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,129
from horror movies.

86
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,090
It's getting unbearable!

87
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,830
But that's not the best idea a village has
had.

88
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,560
No, that prize goes to the village leader
in Xianfeng, Sichuan,

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,730
who thought that if he filled the village
with monkeys,

90
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,900
it would surely draw tourists!

91
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,900
He organized villagers

92
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,680
to lure 73 monkeys down from nearby mountains.

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,530
And it worked!

94
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,200
But then tourism started to dwindle,

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,319
and villagers couldn’t afford to feed the
monkeys,

96
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,519
of which there were now more than 600,

97
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,970
and so the monkeys took to eating their crops instead.

98
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,310
Who was that village leader, anyway?

99
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,980
Well, I was wrong.

100
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,269
The lizards are a godsend!

101
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,199
But isn't that a bit shortsighted?

102
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
What happens when we're overrun by lizards?

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,460
No problem.

104
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,210
We simply unleash wave after wave

105
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,680
of Chinese needle snakes.

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,909
They'll wipe out the lizards.

107
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:31,180
But aren't the snakes even worse?

108
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,050
Yes, but we're prepared for that.

109
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,889
We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla

110
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,360
that thrives on snake meat.

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,840
Then we're stuck with gorillas!

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,740
No, that's the beautiful part.

113
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,969
When wintertime rolls around,

114
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,789
the gorillas simply freeze to death.

115
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,439
So what do you think?

116
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,440
If you were a village chief,

117
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,749
how would you promote your locale?

118
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:50,430
Leave your comments below.

119
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,749
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

120
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,949
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

121
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,429
See you next time.
