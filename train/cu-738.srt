1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,879
Serbia.

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,070
It hopes to join the European Union,

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,110
so it can enjoy the economic benefits.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,570
But is also needs money now.

5
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,090
So it’s turned to China.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,620
And that might not be the wisest choice.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,960
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Serbia.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,099
You may not know where it is on a map,

11
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:27,689
but the Chinese Communist Party sure does.

12
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,210
It’s here, by the way.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,210
In the Balkans.

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,320
Ok, that’s not super helpful.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,070
It’s here.

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,230
You might sort of vaguely remember from the
’90s

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,890
that Serbia was part of the former Yugoslavia,

18
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,430
and then there was a war,

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,600
and NATO bombed everyone,

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,350
and something something.

21
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,190
Unless you weren’t born yet in the ’90s,

22
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,190
in which case,

23
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,190
don’t tell me,

24
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,230
because then I’ll feel old.

25
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,540
Anyway, Serbia is a country in Eastern Europe

26
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,740
with a complicated history.

27
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,430
And things are still complicated.

28
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,050
Some Serbians want to join the European Union

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,210
to enjoy all the financial benefits,

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,810
but the standards to get in are really high,

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,281
and other Serbians aren’t sure

32
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,030
whether they can even meet those standards.

33
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,229
In fact, there are so many forces pulling
every which way—

34
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:18,259
that even the two-headed eagle on the Serbian
flag

35
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:20,780
seems unsure which way to go.

36
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,770
And that’s when China showed up with billions
of dollars.

37
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,799
The Chinese Communist Party has offered to
make Serbia

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
the European heart of its massive Belt and
Road Initiative,

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,049
also known as One Belt, One Road.

40
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,350
That’s the plan to spread Chinese investment
around the world.

41
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,100
And this offer has put Serbia at a difficult
crossroads.

42
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,090
It’s like, it’s Rush Week at your college.

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,939
One option is to try to join the honor society
frat.

44
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,759
Sure it’s really hard to get into,

45
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,490
but girls really like going to their parties,

46
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,149
because all the guys are actually nice.

47
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,710
But there’s a curfew,

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,679
they won’t let you drink too much,

49
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:04,499
and they kick you out if you get bad grades.

50
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,029
And then there’s the “party” frat—

51
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:08,800
where there’s no rules,

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
no standards,

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,140
and the beer flows freely—

54
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,069
but everyone warned you to stay away

55
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,760
because things can get a little crazy

56
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,480
and you heard rumors about the time that Sri
Lanka

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,310
woke up in a bathtub with a kidney and a port
missing.

58
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,470
Anyway, Serbia is a long way from even

59
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,430
qualifying for the European Union frat.

60
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,430
For example,

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,060
they have massive environmental problems,

62
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,239
like a “trash mountain and toxic canals.”

63
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,150
Serbia’s two biggest cities

64
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,610
“dump raw sewage directly into the Danube
and Sava rivers,”

65
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,810
the country has “countless unregulated landfills,”

66
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,069
and it “recycles only around 3 percent of
its municipal waste.”

67
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,210
This is a far cry from EU standards,

68
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,019
which are to recycle 50 percent of municipal
waste.

69
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,780
And according to this European Commision report
card

70
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,440
on how close Serbia is to meeting the standards

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,780
for being allowed into the EU...

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,219
Let’s just say,

73
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,500
they’re not going to get on the honor roll
yet.

74
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,750
There are plenty of areas for improvement,

75
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,520
including respect for fundamental rights,

76
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,050
rule of law,

77
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,190
transparency in government,

78
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,190
and market reform.

79
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,970
Serbia has officially been a *candidate* for
EU membership

80
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,470
since 2012.

81
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,209
But its bad report card means that

82
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,020
the earliest it could get in to the EU is
2025—

83
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,360
and maybe not at all if it doesn’t shape
up.

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
Still, there are benefits to being even just
a candidate.

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,260
Thanks to the EU’s several

86
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,650
pre-accession financial assistance programs,

87
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,859
Serbia has already received over 4.2 billion
dollars

88
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,459
in European grants—

89
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,659
money they never have to pay back.

90
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,010
The EU is also the biggest lender to Serbia,

91
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,530
with over 4.9 billion dollars in loans.

92
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,939
The trouble is,

93
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,299
the EU has conditions for their loans.

94
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,719
And it’s been pressuring Serbian politicians

95
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,290
to be transparent and play by the rules.

96
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,980
The Chinese Communist Party frat, meanwhile,

97
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,010
doesn’t care whether Serbia reforms!

98
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,879
And the cash has been rolling in.

99
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,479
“Investment in Serbia has reached

100
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,319
between 2.2 billion and 2.5 billion euros.”

101
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,470
That’s just under 3 billion US dollars.

102
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,310
Anyway, please continue.

103
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,199
“Direct investments to Serbia show that
Serbia

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,650
is the center of cooperation between China

105
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,960
and Central and Eastern European countries.”

106
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,830
And the feeling is mutual.

107
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,170
“The distance cannot separate us,

108
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,750
so we can have more understanding.

109
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,410
China and Serbia will have a very profound
relationship

110
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,180
and a very special brotherly bond.”

111
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,570
Xi Jinping gave that speech at the site of

112
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,979
Serbia’s only steel mill—

113
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,440
which a Chinese state-owned company

114
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,479
bought in 2016 for 52 million dollars.

115
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,449
Xi Jinping said he would make Serbia

116
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,660
the European hub of the Belt and Road infrastructure
plan.

117
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,650
He suggested China would pour money into roads
and railways

118
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,440
to connect China and Western Europe with a
transport corridor

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,790
running through the heart of Serbia.

120
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,940
According to Vladimir Krulj,

121
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,100
former economic advisor to the Serbian government,

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,039
“Chinese companies have snapped up

123
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,319
critical industries in Serbia

124
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,550
such as a copper mine,

125
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,569
a steelmaker

126
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,540
and a thermal power plant,

127
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,470
along with high-speed rail lines,

128
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,150
roads and ports.”

129
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,509
But all that Chinese money pouring into Serbia

130
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:43,440
has European officials worried.

131
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,889
One concern is that quick and easy Chinese
money

132
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,349
has caused a lot of Serbian leaders

133
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,440
to give up on making all those political and
social reforms

134
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,620
they’d need to join the EU.

135
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,500
So it essentially undermines efforts

136
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,610
to make the country better for its citizens.

137
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,430
Another concern is that all this Chinese investment

138
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,620
could put Serbia into deep debt—

139
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,910
what’s called “debt trap diplomacy.”

140
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,190
We’ve seen it before in Sri Lanka,

141
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,290
Pakistan, and Djibouti.

142
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,030
Chinese loans come in,

143
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,390
but the country can’t repay them.

144
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,090
So then Chinese state-run companies—

145
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,289
or the Chinese military—

146
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,660
take over important strategic assets

147
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,479
in exchange for forgiving the debt.

148
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,180
As one overseas investment expert says,

149
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,889
“[China is] not in it to help countries
out,

150
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,280
they’re in it to grab their assets.”

151
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,229
If that sounds dirty...it is.

152
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,919
He says China is purposefully

153
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,260
plunging recipient countries into debt,

154
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,040
then going after what’s in their dirt,

155
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,009
like minerals and rare earth metals.

156
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,900
Also there’s the danger that China’s investment

157
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,979
might target critical technologies

158
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,870
and strategic industries.

159
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,590
That’s a serious problem throughout Europe,
actually.

160
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,590
So much so,

161
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,320
that this week the European Parliament adopted

162
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,210
an EU-wide mechanism to screen foreign investments,

163
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,500
most importantly from China.

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,199
The aim is to protect critical European industries

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
like aerospace, health, and nano-technology

166
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,150
from getting taken over by Chinese companies—

167
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,580
and undermining European security.

168
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,710
Vladimir Krulj —

169
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,729
the former Serbian economic advisor —

170
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,270
says “it would be daft not to support

171
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,580
[this new foreign investment policy],”

172
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,960
The problem is,

173
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,410
if Serbia were to adapt that,

174
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,319
it would disrupt some of China’s

175
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,000
current development projects there.

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,759
Which some people don’t want to do.

177
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,940
So Serbia is at a crossroads.

178
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,319
It needs money,

179
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,310
but it’s stuck between making reforms to
join the EU,

180
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,030
or a Faustian bargain with China—

181
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,039
a bargain it has already begun to make.

182
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,350
And “By dithering over Serbia’s accession,”
says Krulj,

183
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,879
“the EU is actually forcing Serbia into
the arms of China.”

184
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,539
So maybe it’s time EU authorities consider

185
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,400
whether their frat’s Rush Week

186
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,150
that’s lasted since 2012

187
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,970
and pushes most students away

188
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,390
is really the best way

189
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,699
to build a strong fraternity.

190
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,450
So what do you think about Serbia

191
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,940
being stuck between a rock and a hard place?

192
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,690
Leave your comments below.

193
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,690
And while you’re here,

194
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,290
it’s time for me to answer another question

195
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,659
from a fan who supports China Uncensored—

196
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,169
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

197
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,169
Casey asks:

198
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,530
“[Why have] american coin collectors

199
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,079
loved gold and silver pandas

200
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,990
seemingly more than any other foreign mint

201
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,830
since the late 90's?

202
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,740
They always trade at a slightly higher price

203
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,279
than the going rate for an ounce.

204
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,080
Could this be an example of a successful

205
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,850
soft power strategy by the CCP?”

206
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,200
Well, Casey, I assume you’re referring to

207
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,670
these Chinese panda coins.

208
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,779
Why do people like them?

209
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:53,890
I don’t know!

210
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,470
Why does anybody like pandas?!

211
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,050
“Oh, they’re so cute and cuddy.”

212
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,050
No they’re not!

213
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,600
They’re giant racoons that’ll rip your
arms off

214
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,160
if they had the chance.

215
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,110
Or at least your jacket.

216
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,720
Anyway, all gold coins go for

217
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,160
a higher price than the metal itself.

218
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,260
Which is why physical coins

219
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,500
aren’t the best gold investment anyway.

220
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,780
They’re just a collectors’ item.

221
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,320
Are they Chinese Communist Party propaganda?

222
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,079
Yes, but only in the sense that pandas in
general

223
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,300
are a propaganda symbol.

224
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,750
The Party uses them to make itself

225
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,430
look cute and cuddy,

226
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,430
but in the end,

227
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,420
they’ll rip your arms off.

228
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,480
Thanks for your question, Casey.

229
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,779
And I hope all of you can be like Casey

230
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,000
and support China Uncensored

231
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,460
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

232
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,880
Casey supports this show by pledging

233
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,230
a certain amount per episode—

234
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,860
and you can, too.

235
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Help us keep covering the kind of episodes

236
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,700
that expose China’s pandas

237
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,120
for what they really are.

238
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Once again, I’m Chris Chris Chappell.

239
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,560
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
