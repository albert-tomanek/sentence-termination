1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,660
Everyone is furious at the NBA.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,640
People in China...

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,440
And in America.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,799
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,799
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,559
Well, I’m sorry to say,

7
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,830
the NBA has not made a slam dunk in China
this week.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,200
This is Daryl Morey.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,500
You may know him as the general manager of
the Houston Rockets.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,960
But in China, he’s public enemy number 1!

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,890
Last week he tweeted this.

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,510
“Fight for freedom.

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,610
Stand with Hong Kong.”

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,829
A pretty bold move, considering NBA China—

15
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,149
yes that’s a thing—is worth more than
4 billion dollars.

16
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,940
But faster than you can say,

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,539
“good on him for risking a Chinese backlash

18
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,409
to stand up for liberty,”

19
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,100
he deleted the Tweet.

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,089
Because it created an uproar in China.

21
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,730
And the owner of the Houston Rockets was like,

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,399
whoa, this guy does not speak for us.

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,180
And Morey quickly walked his tweet back,

24
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,120
saying he did not intend his tweet to cause
any offense

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,729
to Rockets fans and friends in China.

26
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:07,030
He’s got loads of friends in China.

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,200
None of whom support freedom in Hong Kong,
obviously.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,170
But the Houston Rockets damage control didn’t
stop there.

29
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,750
One of their star players, James Harden,

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,780
announced the Houston Rockets Love China!

31
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,780
“We love China, we love...

32
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,440
We love everything they’re about

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,280
and appreciate the support they give us.”

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,600
Yes, the Houston Rockets love everything China’s
about.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,050
Here’s footage of Chinese police leading
a group of Uighurs

36
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,160
into a concentration camp.

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,060
Side note, the NBA runs a training center
in Xinjiang...

38
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,920
the same region where Chinese police

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,350
are putting all those Uighurs in concentration
camps.

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,910
But back to the current NBA-China controversy.

41
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,710
The NBA itself issued an official apology,

42
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,710
saying that they recognized that the tweet

43
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,110
deeply offended fans in China,

44
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,070
which was regrettable.

45
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,530
But on their Chinese language social media
account,

46
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,020
the statement was a little different.

47
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,569
It said, “We are extremely disappointed
in the inappropriate comment

48
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,489
by the General Manager of the Houston Rockets...

49
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,689
he has undoubtedly seriously hurt

50
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:16,719
the feelings of Chinese basketball fans...

51
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,239
we have the utmost respect for the history
and culture of China.”

52
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,810
Good thing no one outside China can read Chinese!

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,349
No one will ever know how spineless

54
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,409
the NBA’s Chinese apology was.

55
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,430
But Daryl Morey at least didn’t hurt the
feelings

56
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,660
of *this* Chinese basketball fan,

57
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,769
who posted a photo of himself with a message
saying,

58
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,829
“I live and die with the [Houston Rockets],

59
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,040
come arrest me.”

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,459
Three hours later, they did come arrest him.

61
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,080
“We love everything they’re about.”

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,409
So after all the back-tracking and kowtowing,

63
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,220
did the NBA manage to get cool with

64
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,519
the world’s most brutal authoritarian regime?

65
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,819
Nope.

66
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,849
The NBA’s Chinese partners still suspended
ties with them.

67
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,459
And Chinese media won’t be broadcasting

68
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,609
the NBA’s preseason games in China.

69
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,810
What I’m saying is that the NBA is being
cancelled in China.

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,680
That’s not surprising.

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,810
What is surprising,

72
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,760
is the universal condemnation the Rockets

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,069
are getting from both sides of the aisle in
the United States.

74
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,739
Like Democratic Presidential hopeful Beto
O'Rourke

75
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,709
and Republican Senator Ted Cruz,

76
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,579
who until this week, never agreed on anything.

77
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:32,760
The NBA has spent years developing a huge
fanbase in China.

78
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,239
But that doesn’t mean they can ignore the
backlash in America.

79
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,660
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver came out and
unapologized-ish.

80
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,349
"We are not apologising for Daryl (Morey)

81
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,109
exercising his freedom of expression....

82
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,599
"The long held values of the NBA

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,569
are to support freedom of expression,

84
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,959
and certainly freedoms of expression by the
NBA community,

85
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,489
and in this case Daryl Morey

86
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,519
as the General Manager of the Houston Rockets

87
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,629
enjoys that right as one of our employees.

88
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,109
What I also try to suggest is I understand

89
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,409
that there are consequences from that exercise
of

90
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,519
in essence his freedom of speech,

91
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,889
and we will have to live with those consequences."

92
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,540
Now that may not seem like much, but remember,

93
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,860
China once got Marriott to apologize and fire
an employee

94
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,780
for accidentally using the Marriott Twitter
account

95
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,310
to like a Free Tibet tweet.

96
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,020
Obviously the real problem here is Twitter.

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,009
But the consequences of the NBA controversy
are just beginning.

98
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,860
And they’re showing ordinary Americans

99
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,949
how much power the Chinese Communist Party

100
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,259
has on American companies...even in America.

101
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,940
For example, in an internal memo,

102
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,330
ESPN instructed their shows to

103
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,120
“avoid any political discussions about China
and Hong Kong”

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,509
when discussing the NBA story.

105
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,050
And then fans who took Free Hong Kong signs
to an NBA game

106
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,900
were kicked out—in Philadelphia.

107
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,889
And had their signs confiscated in Washington
DC.

108
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,360
So now all because of one tweet about Hong
Kong,

109
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,450
many Americans have gone from not knowing

110
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,669
that China has a Communist Party to realizing

111
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,090
how much power the Chinese Communist Party
has.

112
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,050
In a not-good way.

113
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,949
So while China is crying foul,

114
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,379
perhaps in the end,

115
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,300
this was nothing but net.

116
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,949
The kind where you miss entirely and only
hit net.

117
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:37,949
So what do you think?

118
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:38,949
Leave your comments below.

119
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,599
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

120
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
See you next time.
