00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,830
I've dressed my cat in a Christmas jumper.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,830
It's possible.

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,089
- "Hello, is that PETA?"
- Did it have panniers?

4
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,500
It would have, if they had been-

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,190
But my cat has tried on a Christmas jumper.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,980
It's had two Christmas jumpers and she's had
a Christmas dress.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,289
What are you putting in…?

8
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,289
AUDIENCE: Aww...

9
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,920
The dress was… shut up!

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Don't encourage him!

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,020
The dress was medicinal.

12
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,590
Because she had a cut on her side and kept
scratching it and she didn't want to…

13
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,980
So you dressed her in frills?

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,440
Does it distract…?

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,880
Is she just constantly batting at her own
culottes instead of...?

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,660
So she tried and scratch the dress, couldn't,
the cut healed and she was a lot better.

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,090
Is this a cat-sized Christmas jumper and dress
or, like, human size?

18
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,670
No, it's human size you pillock(!)

19
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,670
Of course it was...

20
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,770
No, he just drops jumpers on it(!)

21
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,580
Actually, no, it wasn't cat sized, it was
small dog sized.

22
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,660
Okay.

23
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,700
Not so silly now.
