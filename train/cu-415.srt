1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,640
what the next u.s president is going to do in\h
terms of china policy is obviously a somewhat\h\h

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,120
relevant issue and it's an issue that the\h
chinese communist party has been considering\h\h

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,200
right which is obviously they haven't loved the\h
last four years of u.s china policy and not just\h\h

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,040
the chinese communist party but there's a lot of\h
corporate interests that would really like to see\h\h

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,640
things go back to the way things were before the\h
trump administration as well right i mean not just\h\h

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,760
corporate interests i think there's universities\h
who want to work with chinese universities\h\h

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,080
um confucius institute think tanks uh you know\h
like there are a lot of people who are invested in\h\h

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,760
um u.s china engagement so definitely and\h
we've seen the king of uh u.s china cooperation\h\h

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,880
henry kissinger rear his head again you know\h
he's 97 years old i was just wondering how old\h\h

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,800
he was yeah yeah i mean he he he doesn't look\h
young but i mean he's he's in good shape for\h\h

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,080
a 97 year old it's amazing what adrenochrome\h
can do am i right i don't know what that is\h\h

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
is it something that's going to bring\h
us down like a weird rabbit hole again\h\h

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,960
let's carry on okay look like i don't know what\h
it is but like in context i know it's one of\h\h

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,000
those things that you would find on 4chan\h
no no no is this an alex jones reference uh\h\h

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,040
let's just say it's a reference to uh maze\h
runner my favorite movies okay okay so it's\h\h

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,840
something totally different i thought it was\h
going to be something that like alex jones\h\h

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,440
sells on his show wow like that's\h
what i thought okay uh wow if he does\h\h

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,240
i mean who knows what's in super male\h
vitality uh so uh what a us china policy\h\h

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,400
no no we have to go back to kissinger because yeah\h
well i mean that is u.s china policy but go on\h\h

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,360
i mean he is responsible in large part for\h
decades of u.s china policy i mean i think even\h\h

21
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,880
trump had gotten advice from kissinger like i\h
think he's advised pretty much every sitting\h\h

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,480
president since nixon wow on china policy so\h
yeah and also i think that his china policy\h\h

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:29,120
in the 1970s was based on the the geostrategic\h
needs of the us at the time in the height of\h\h

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,280
the cold war or the soviet union was perceived\h
as a very serious threat the soviet union was\h\h

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,640
funding these kind of communist cells around\h
the world and kissinger and nixon hoped that\h\h

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,480
by establishing warmer ties with communist china\h
it would be a counterbalance to the i guess at\h\h

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,040
the time arguably worse communism the soviet union\h
well i mean it was also that the us was directly\h\h

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
competing against and in the cold war with\h
the soviet union and china was kind of\h\h

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,320
not directly involved right they didn't\h
have the kind of military they have nowadays\h\h

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,320
yeah i mean i i think that at the time the chinese\h
communist party wasn't really a threat i mean\h\h

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,400
yes the u.s had kind of you know had been involved\h
in the war over gene men the little taiwan island\h\h

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,600
that had been bombarded with shells and stuff by\h
mainland china but like besides that there wasn't\h\h

33
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,760
that level of conflict and there certainly\h
wasn't a concern that china had a modern\h\h

34
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,640
military well i mean they were still just\h
got done killing a bunch of their own people\h\h

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
yeah and they still haven't stopped that tree they\h
really haven't tried so they haven't stopped but\h\h

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,600
they killed different people now well so\h
the point is like you're saying that maybe\h\h

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,520
at the time the sort of kissinger\h
style school of thought about how\h\h

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,800
the u.s should deal with china may have made\h
sense but in the 21st century it's stupid

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,320
so kissinger came out and said at the\h\h

40
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,480
uh bloomberg new world forum new economic\h
forum the bloomberg news new world order

to get us banned from youtube\h\h

42
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120

so at the bloomberg new economic forum\h\h

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280

is you go to their website and one of the first\h\h

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
things you see is like a little like qr code in\h

and then it's henry kissinger and hank paulson the\h\h

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,640
former us treasury secretary uh and which there's\h
tony blair was there former uk prime minister uh\h\h

52
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,760

goldman people end up becoming treasury secretary\h\h

53
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,120

this so uh what did kissinger say\h\h
