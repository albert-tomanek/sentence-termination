00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,710
Bernie Sanders Gets China Wrong

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:05,680
G7 Defends Hong Kong

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,610
And chaos reigns at China’s first Costco

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,480
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,400
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,419
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,340
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,920
Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,770
was one of the first US Senators

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,300
to come out hard against China.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,290
Here he is in 1994,

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,660
arguing against granting China

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,770
most favored nation trade status.

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,850
“Mr. Speaker, when multinational corporations

15
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,740
throw American workers out on the street,

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,440
and move to China where workers are paid 15
cents an hour,

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,410
where slave labor exists,

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,280
where basic democratic rights are ignored,

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,380
where workers cannot organize free trade unions—

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,600
that scenario may be good for

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,640
the profit margins of the large corporations,

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,690
but it is a disaster for American workers.

23
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,739
It is absurd to be talking about

24
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,630
most favored trading nation status

25
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,710
for a country which allows for

26
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,000
the ruthless exploitation of its workers.”

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,720
Wow, if Twitter had existed in 1994,

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,140
Donald Trump would have tweeted pretty much
the same thing.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,080
So what does Sanders think now?

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,549
“I think China is a country that is moving
unfortunately

31
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,660
in a more authoritarian way in a number of
directions.”

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,810
Well, they’ve been authoritarian since the
beginning,

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,060
but carry on.

34
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,869
“But what we have to say about China in
fairness to China

35
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,520
and it’s leadership is if I’m not mistaken

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
they have made more progress in addressing
extreme poverty

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,580
than any country in the history of civilization,

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,920
so they’ve done a lot of things for their
people.”

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,420
Oh, Bernie.

40
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,960
Yes, they’ve done a lot of things for their
people.

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,720
Like the slave labor and ruthless exploitation
of workers

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,979
you mentioned back in 1994!

43
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,850
Unfortunately it seems Sanders may have fallen
victim

44
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,560
to a common piece of Communist Party propaganda—

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,810
“China has lifted more than 700 million
people out of poverty.”

46
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,170
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party

47
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,799
is like a giant arcade claw machine,

48
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,499
gently lifting millions of Chinese people
out of poverty.

49
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,499
The thing is,

50
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,060
if you’re lifting something out of Chinese
state-run media,

51
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,660
you probably can guess it's not really true.

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,810
I gave a full rundown of why that isn’t
true

53
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,439
in the episode China’s Poverty Lie.

54
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,959
But to be brief, the Chinese Communist Party

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,249
destroyed the entire Chinese economy in the
1950s,

56
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:31,400
in their attempt to enforce

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,790
collective farming and steel production.

58
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,900
When that failed miserably

59
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,749
and ended in the deaths of millions,

60
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:39,250
they launched the Cultural Revolution.

61
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,349
That also failed miserably

62
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,959
and ended in the deaths of millions.

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,690
Then after Chairman Mao died,

64
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,609
the new leader Deng Xiaoping decided to scale
back

65
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:50,900
some of those failed collectivization policies.

66
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,090
He gradually allowed people to buy and sell

67
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,969
and do business again.

68
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:59,120
Given this little bit of market-based economic
wiggle room,

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,449
Chinese people lifted *themselves* out of
poverty.

70
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,730
They got an even bigger boost

71
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,379
when jobs started coming in

72
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,510
from all those multinational corporations

73
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,379
Sanders talked about in 1994.

74
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,879
But even despite allowing private enterprise,

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,709
900 million people in China

76
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,209
still make less than 10 dollars a day.

77
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,400
But Chinese authorities categorize

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,639
most of them now as “low-income”.

79
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,779
So technically, they’re not in poverty.

80
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,589
Oh, and note that every time China releases

81
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:32,120
their annual white paper on human rights...

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,469
it focuses on how many people its lifted out
of poverty—

83
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,650
claiming *that’s* the most important human
right.

84
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,650
Which is to say,

85
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,290
as long as people seem less poor

86
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,909
than they were 40 years ago,

87
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,309
human rights in China are improving!

88
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,419
Look, economically Chinese people

89
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,180
are doing better than they were when Mao died.

90
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,790
And that’s a good thing!

91
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,540
But the propaganda is when the Chinese Communist
Party

92
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,370
takes all the credit for “lifting people
up”

93
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,010
and then also tries to use it to cover up

94
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,959
their human rights crimes.

95
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,799
Like Xinjiang’s re-education camps?

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,279
Those people aren’t being tortured.

97
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,840
They’re being lifted out of poverty!

98
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,559
Hopefully Sanders’s economic plan

99
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:14,680
doesn’t take inspiration from China’s
“poverty elimination.”

100
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,410
The Pentagon is accusing China

101
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,730
of bullying tactics against Vietnam.

102
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,680
Yes, the Pentagon is standing up for Vietnam—

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,710
the communist regime they tried so hard

104
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,600
to defeat half a century ago.

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,850
But now, of course,

106
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,860
there’s a scarier communist regime.

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,430
A Chinese survey vessel

108
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,580
entered Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone
on Saturday.

109
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,110
It claimed to be doing a seismic survey.

110
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,490
You know, for science.

111
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,110
Nothing to do with all the oil there.

112
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,510
The Pentagon statement said,

113
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,620
“China resumed its coercive interference

114
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,760
in Vietnam's longstanding oil and gas activities

115
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,430
in the South China Sea.”

116
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,560
And if anyone knows a thing or two

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,600
about coercive interference for oil,

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,150
it’s the US military.

119
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,730
What you’re looking at isn’t footage

120
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,360
from some upcoming Sci-fi movie.

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,280
This is an autonomous passenger drone

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
made by the Chinese company Ehang.

123
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,190
And it could be the first company in the world

124
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,200
to start regular flights on pilotless passenger
drones.

125
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,500
But do you really want your pilotless drone

126
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,800
being built and controlled by a Chinese company,

127
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,310
which, by law,

128
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,020
has ties to the Communist Party?

129
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,950
I can just imagine some Falun Gong practitioner

130
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,050
on his way to the grocery store,

131
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,350
suddenly rerouted... to a labor camp.

132
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,580
Where he will get lifted out of poverty.

133
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,970
So you see,

134
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,060
these drones aren’t from a sci-fi movie.

135
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,260
They’re from a real life horror movie.

136
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,100
I’d rather fly on this plane full of durians.

137
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,490
But the Ehang drone nightmare

138
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,700
may not be coming to the US anytime soon.

139
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,180
“The Pentagon recently banned the use of
drones

140
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,170
built by China’s DJI

141
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,550
and may soon ban all Chinese-built drones

142
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,990
and Chinese-manufactured components from military
use.”

143
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,210
And if it ends up being anything like

144
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,270
the Chinese telecom company Huawei,

145
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,740
the military ban could someday

146
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,810
become a consumer ban as well.

147
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,890
The officially atheist Chinese Communist Party

148
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,530
has just ordained its first Catholic Bishop
in China,

149
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,280
under a new deal with the Vatican.

150
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,850
You might be asking yourself, wait what?

151
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,700
Well, the Chinese Communist Party

152
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,770
has always insisted it had the right

153
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,850
to appoint Catholic bishops in China.

154
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,950
Look, it makes no sense,

155
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,330
but that’s just how the Party operates.

156
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,020
But over the past several years,

157
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,890
the Vatican has been working on a pretty great
deal

158
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,120
that will benefit Catholics living in

159
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,050
one of the most oppressive countries for Christians
in the world.

160
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,280
The Vatican will now allow the Communist Party

161
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,960
to appoint bishops.

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,300
In exchange, the Vatican gets...

163
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,460
to help make the Chinese Communist Party look
good.

164
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,370
This is what Beijing calls “win-win mutual
cooperation.”

165
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,050
If only the leaders of other countries

166
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,240
were so good at making deals.

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,870
As it is, during the recent G7 meeting,

168
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,230
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,

169
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,710
and the United States all issued a joint statement

170
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,800
telling China to cut out its oppression in
Hong Kong.

171
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
The statement said,

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,550
“The G-7 reaffirms the existence and the
importance

173
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,160
of the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong
Kong

174
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
and calls for avoiding violence.”

175
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,650
The Sino-British agreement was a deal

176
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,280
between China and the UK

177
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,040
that the UK would give Hong Kong to China,

178
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,740
under the condition that Hong Kong

179
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,900
could keep its freedoms for 50 years.

180
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,530
China later said that has no meaning.

181
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,840
I guess they had their fingers crossed behind
their back

182
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,380
when they made the deal.

183
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,330
Unfortunately, international law permits that
kind of thing.

184
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,870
Good news for Australian Author Yang Hengjun.

185
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,180
After being detained for 7 months in China

186
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,960
on undisclosed charges,

187
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,120
he’s finally learned *why* he’s being
detained.

188
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,590
Turns out it’s on espionage charges.

189
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,650
Wow, what a master spy!

190
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,210
It took China 7 months

191
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,680
to figure out what they arrested him for.

192
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Amazing.

193
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,200
It has nothing to do with the fact the author
is considered,

194
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,650
a “dedicated democracy activist

195
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,410
who believed that China’s autocratic system
would, with time,

196
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,370
necessarily liberalize.”

197
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,280
Yang has been an Australian citizen since
2002

198
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,580
but still held a Chinese passport.

199
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,930
Which means, in the eyes of the Chinese Communist
Party,

200
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,970
Yang belongs to China.

201
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,020
Speaking of spycraft, according to the New
York Times,

202
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,070
China has been using Linkedin to recruit spies.

203
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,700
Great, like we need *more* recruiters on LinkedIn.

204
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,850
Can’t wait to hear about another new and
exciting opportunity!

205
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,380
But wait, why is China using LinkedIn?

206
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,570
“Instead of dispatching spies to the U.S.

207
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,010
to recruit a single target,

208
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,009
it’s more efficient to sit behind a computer
in China

209
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,589
and send out friend requests to thousands
of targets

210
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,099
using fake profiles.”

211
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,039
You know, now I’m second guessing

212
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,430
if I should have given all that top secret
info

213
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,029
to my new LinkedIn friend American Joe.

214
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,230
He seems like he’s on the level.

215
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,760
Bad news for VPN users in China.

216
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,240
A 26 year old was just sentenced to 7 years
in prison

217
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,120
for sharing VPN software.

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,449
He had been sharing it on popular messaging
sites in China.

219
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:58,680
Police found those messages

220
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,350
and then found him using his phone’s geographical
positioning.

221
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,990
That’s horrible, terrifying, and also...

222
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,209
I want to know what VPN he was using,

223
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:11,079
because I don’t think it works very well.

224
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,709
This is just the latest in an ongoing crackdown
on VPNs in China.

225
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,569
I mean, what’s the point of having

226
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,790
a draconian Internet censorship firewall

227
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,810
if people can just\h jump over the wall?

228
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,309
The Confucius Institute.

229
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,279
A Chinese language program with schools

230
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,139
and classes all over the world.

231
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,420
Well, the education minister in New Brunswick,
Canada

232
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,110
decided to end his school system’s relationship

233
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,019
with the Confucius Institute,

234
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,550
because of its ties to the Chinese government.

235
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,990
Then he received a visit from a top Chinese
diplomat.

236
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,360
“He told me about how the Confucius Institute

237
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,520
had nothing at all to do with Chinese government,

238
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,610
then very strongly expressed concerns

239
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,680
this might adversely impact trade relationships

240
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,959
with China and the Chinese government.”

241
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,570
I don’t know how Canadian officials

242
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,379
saw through the Chinese diplomat's ploy.

243
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,410
It was foolproof!

244
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,890
Hmm, come to think of it,

245
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,769
that’s the same message my LinkedIn friend

246
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,949
American Joe has been telling me.

247
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:08,010
Costco opened its first store in China on
Tuesday

248
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,720
and it was chaos.

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,589
There was a three hour wait just for parking.

250
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,130
When the gates opened people literally crawled
their way in.

251
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,389
It got so bad,

252
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,730
local police had to be called in.

253
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,529
They demanded people be rational.

254
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:24,879
Rational?

255
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,879
Rational in Costco?!

256
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,930
I don’t think so.

257
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,949
I need a king-sized mattress

258
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,769
and 5 gallons of Kirkland Signature ranch
dressing!

259
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,019
And I need them now!

260
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,620
Ultimately, the store was forced to close
8 hours early.

261
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,660
And as the Wall Street Journal points out,

262
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,100
what trade war?

263
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,709
And finally, according to a group of Chinese
academics,

264
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,420
“the English language—

265
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,430
and somehow by proxy all Western civilisation—

266
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,089
originated from China!”

267
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:51,089
The evidence?

268
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,560
“Yellow” in English sounds a bit like
(ye, luo),

269
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,769
which is the word for falling leaves, but
backwards,「葉落」

270
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,520
“Shop” sounds vaguely similar to (shangdian)

271
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,150
“Heart” and “head” begin with the
letters “he”

272
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,040
as a nod to\h he, meaning “core”,

273
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,689
in 20th-century Pinyin (“hé”)

274
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,619
Yes, China invented gunpowder,

275
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:11,619
the compass,

276
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,680
and all of Western civilization

277
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,040
but especially Shakespeare.

278
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,270
Everything has been a part of China since
ancient times.

279
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,699
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

280
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,680
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

281
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,089
a fan who support China Uncensored

282
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,720
with a dollar or more per episode,

283
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,500
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

284
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,079
Maldoone7 asks,

285
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,869
“Chris, do you think Trump's statement

286
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,619
about ordering US business

287
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,850
to search for alternatives to China

288
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,470
shows his political will...

289
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,119
Or was it more talk?

290
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,759
An interesting question.

291
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,149
Trump has actually been talking about

292
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,470
how US businesses ought to leave China,

293
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,670
since before he was president.

294
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,139
In fact, he had a similar line about Japan
back in the 80s.

295
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,579
But even as president,

296
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,029
he’s not able to force US business

297
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,129
to come back to the United States.

298
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,519
But it does seem like he can theoretically

299
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,259
force them not to do business in China.

300
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,300
Trump suggested he could invoke

301
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,139
the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

302
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:11,709
He could use that to block financial transactions

303
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:13,720
between a US company and China.

304
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,249
So basically those companies would need to
go elsewhere.

305
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:19,939
But will he actually invoke the Emergency
Economic Powers Act?

306
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,259
I don’t know.

307
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,439
But the message he’s sending US companies
is pretty clear.

308
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,069
Thanks for your question.

309
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:27,069
And if you have a question for me

310
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:28,959
you want to hear answered on the show,

311
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,790
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

312
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,540
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

313
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,369
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

314
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,029
we would have to shut down the show

315
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,929
if it weren’t for your support.

316
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:42,779
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

317
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,330
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

318
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,220
See you next time.
