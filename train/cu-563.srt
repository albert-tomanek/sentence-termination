1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,670
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:05,089
A US Senator had a Chinese spy on her staff.

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,910
For decades.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,000
The Chinese military tests a new hypersonic
waverider.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,879
That’s a missile, not a surfboard.

6
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,069
And finally, Chinese police are fearless.

7
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,820
When it comes to arresting dissidents.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,640
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,849
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,419
Our top story, turns out a former staffer

12
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:32,289
of California Senator Dianne Feinstein...

13
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,610
was a Chinese spy!

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,930
This happened five years ago,

15
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,960
when she was the chairwoman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,590
You’d think she should have known, right?

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,820
But she had to learn about it from the FBI.

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,430
Then she fired the staffer.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,610
A spokesperson for Feinstein said, don’t
worry,

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,640
no staffer in California had security clearance.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,070
However, Feinstein’s connections with China
go deeper than that.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,489
And it ties into a much larger story

23
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,320
about how the Chinese Communist Party uses
what’s known as

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,470
“elite capture” to influence American
government officials.

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,180
We’ll have more on that in an upcoming episode.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,400
The Chinese military has just tested a new
hypersonic aircraft,

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,940
called Starry Sky 2.

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,400
Which sounds like either a Japanese anime

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,750
or a lesser Van Gogh painting.

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:26,680
But no, Starry Sky 2 is China’s first hypersonic
waverider vehicle.

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,830
Chinese state-run media called the test a
success.

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,720
That may or may not be an actual photo of
the Starry Sky 2—

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,860
since according to the article,

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,880
it has a wedge-shaped fuselage.

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,760
It supposedly uses its unique shape

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,120
to ride the shock waves

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,540
generated by its own hypersonic flight.

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,110
Basically, it’s like a missile on a surfboard.

39
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,670
That can carry a nuclear warhead.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,260
Gnarly, dude!

41
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,190
Oh, and US missile defense systems have no
way to defend against it.

42
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,850
Speaking of war with China, Trade War!

43
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,560
As you know, many US companies,

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,770
particularly tech companies, have been doing

45
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,590
anything and everything to get into the China
market.

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,530
And the Chinese Communist Party takes full
advantage of that.

47
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,560
Apple recently hit a market cap of over 1
trillion dollars.

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,989
Yayy!!

49
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,349
Except that’s largely thanks to China.

50
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,380
And according to state-run People’s Daily,

51
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,760
that means companies like Apple are now

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
a bargaining chip in the trade war.

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,370
I mean, Apple is doing so well in China,

54
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,730
and some Chinese businesses are really hurting
from the trade war.

55
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,510
Does that sound fair?

56
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,829
It would be a shame, if, er, oh I don’t
know,

57
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:39,719
“Chinese people make it a target of anger
and nationalist sentiment.”

58
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,849
Yes, Chinese people—

59
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,330
with absolutely no prompting

60
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,810
from the Chinese government or state-run media—

61
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,730
might target Apple with anger and nationalist
sentiment.

62
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,780
All by themselves.

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,459
But the joke’s on the Chinese regime.

64
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,079
Because somehow I can’t imagine President
Trump

65
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,060
losing sleep over the fortunes of Apple.

66
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,099
He only loses sleep over what he’s going
to Tweet at 3 am.

67
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,470
And speaking of Trump’s 3 am tweets...

68
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,950
ok, 5:30 am tweets,

69
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,730
the US has imposed sanctions on Iran once
again.

70
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,329
And President Trump’s Twitter message is
clear.

71
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:18,970
You either trade with the US or Iran, but
not both.

72
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,330
But it seems the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t
care.

73
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,400
I mean, I get it.

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,930
China and Iran have so much more in common.

75
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,010
The people of both countries love eating rice,

76
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,769
drinking tea,

77
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,379
and being locked up in prison for having opinions.

78
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,590
And the Chinese regime loves Iranian oil.

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,129
And since they currently buy a quarter of
Iran’s oil exports,

80
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,980
they’re not going to stop because of US
sanctions.

81
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,150
In fact, they’re probably going to buy even
more oil.

82
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,209
Not to mention all the new business China
is doing with Iran

83
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,920
as part of the Belt and Road Initiative.

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
Speaking of Chinese businesses,

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,810
Chinese telecom giant Huawei has surpassed
Apple

86
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,340
as the world’s number two smartphone maker.

87
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,859
Korean Samsung is still number one, though.

88
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,700
How did Huawei make it to number two?

89
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,359
Thanks to its close relationship with the
Chinese government.

90
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,730
As well as the Chinese military.

91
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,050
And the fact Huawei spies on its competitors,

92
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,250
and has been stealing intellectual property
for a long time.

93
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,650
Yes, this article is from 15 years ago.

94
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,500
So with all the stealing intellectual property

95
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,650
and support from the Chinese regime,

96
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,780
no wonder Huawei has surpassed Apple.

97
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,680
Speaking of a Chinese company getting a few
extra perks

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,140
to beat its Western counterpart,

99
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,380
this is Baidu,

100
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,520
the Chinese search engine with a...

101
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
familiar looking homepage.

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,580
Baidu says they’re going to beat Google
if Google’s

103
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,870
new censored search engine comes back to China.

104
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,050
Which really is just perfect.

105
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,760
Google is going to give in to Chinese censorship
demands

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,050
to get back into the China market.

107
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,830
And then a homegrown Chinese search engine

108
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,500
will outcompete Google,

109
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
because of course.

110
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,040
It reminds me of that ad Baidu ran in 2009,

111
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,690
where Google was the arrogant white guy who
spoke bad Chinese,

112
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,220
and Baidu steals his girl and Google spits
blood.

113
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,580
That was probably the most truthful thing
ever

114
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,460
to be put on Chinese state-run television.

115
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,530
Meanwhile Google has been taking a beating

116
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,650
both inside the company and outside—

117
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,490
after its plans for a censored Chinese search
engine were leaked.

118
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,170
Google has responded by...saying nothing at
all.

119
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,500
Sounds like a winning strategy.

120
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,590
And finally,

121
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,440
Chinese police just don’t care anymore.

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,610
This is Sun Wenguang, an 80-year-old academic

123
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,080
living in the Chinese city of Jinan.

124
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,560
During a recent interview with Radio Free
Asia,

125
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,500
a group of policemen showed up and, well,
take a listen.

126
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,820
What are you doing?

127
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,900
What are you doing?

128
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,580
Let me tell you, it’s illegal for you to
come to my home.

129
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,340
I have my freedom of speech!

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,480
Did you hear the live audio?

131
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,370
Now, I’m no authoritarian leader, but if
I were,

132
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,470
I’d probably know that arresting an elderly
professor

133
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,690
during a live interview would be really bad

134
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,760
for my international image!

135
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,580
I would wait until after the interview.

136
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,690
Duh.

137
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,810
Then again, with almost every major company

138
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,780
and many countries begging to do business
with China,

139
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,280
what the heck?!

140
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,970
Chinese police can do whatever they want!

141
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,570
Who’s going to say anything?

142
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,570
Journalists?

143
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,450
Who listens to them?

144
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,450
So what do you think?

145
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,060
Leave your comments below.

146
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,060
And before you go,

147
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,940
it’s once again time to answer questions

148
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,960
from fans who support China Uncensored

149
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,860
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

150
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Fiona asks,

151
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,460
“What are the best places to visit in China

152
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,660
that still have much of ancient Chinese civilization/history

153
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,000
preserved that wasn't destroyed in the Cultural
Revolution?”

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,240
That’s a tough question.

155
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,100
China has thousands of years of history.

156
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,310
Before the Cultural Revolution,

157
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,150
even a brick wall might have been around for
hundreds of years.

158
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,180
It’s hard to imagine just how full China
was with cultural relics.

159
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,900
But during the Cultural Revolution,

160
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,140
Mao sought to destroy what he called the Four
Olds—

161
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,690
Old Customs, Old Culture, Old Habits, and
Old Ideas.

162
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,710
A huge number of irreplaceably temples

163
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,150
and artifacts were lost forever.

164
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,020
There are still some that have survived, though.

165
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,030
For example, the Jokhang Temple in Tibet.

166
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,580
But the problem is, the Jokhang Temple—

167
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,990
like a lot of cultural sites—

168
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,470
has been subverted by the Communist Party,

169
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,220
and turned into a propaganda tool to show

170
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,140
how the Party is so good at preserving Chinese—

171
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,930
or in this case, Tibetan—culture.

172
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,820
I wish I could say go visit such and such
temple.

173
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,100
But the truth is,

174
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,550
a lot of temples are controlled by the Communist
Party.

175
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,790
When my producer Matt visited the Jokhang
Temple in 2002,

176
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,180
people warned him not to have conversations

177
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,080
with any of the monks there,

178
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,730
because a lot of them were spies,

179
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,600
and were trying to catch foreigners

180
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,910
who might support a free Tibet.

181
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,530
And after taking this photo,

182
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,720
the monks asked him for money.

183
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,650
Obviously, there are still a number of cultural
relics

184
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,150
left from ancient China.

185
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,670
Like the Great Wall, the Forbidden City,

186
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,620
and the Terracotta Warriors.

187
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,250
There are also places with beautiful scenery
and history,

188
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,300
like Hangzhou, Suzhou,

189
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,930
and that one place with the mountains from
Avatar.

190
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,720
So those are some places you could visit.

191
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,550
But sadly, the spirit of ancient Chinese civilization

192
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,240
has been severely damaged by the Communist
Party.

193
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,800
Over the last 40 years of economic reform,

194
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,699
as China has been opening more and more to
tourists,

195
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:38,159
they’ve restored a lot of the old historical
sites.

196
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,329
But they certainly don’t want to restore
traditional values

197
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,219
like compassion and honesty, or traditional
ideas

198
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,819
like if a government doesn’t serve the people,

199
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,900
it has lost the mandate to rule.

200
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,970
What nonsense!

201
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,319
But there is one part of China you can go
to

202
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:56,870
to experience authentic Chinese culture:

203
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,870
Taiwan!

204
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,850
When I was in a Taiwan a couple years ago,

205
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,279
I was pleased to see that even as the country

206
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,709
is covered with high-speed trains and modern
hotels,

207
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,670
the people and government there both have
a lot of respect

208
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,960
for preserving traditional culture,

209
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,889
even when foreigners come and goof around.

210
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,529
Also, the food is delicious.

211
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,069
Thanks for your question, Fiona.

212
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,660
And thanks to all the Patreon supporters,

213
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,519
whom I call the China Uncensored 50-cent Army—

214
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,500
the soldiers who help keep this show alive

215
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,620
by contributing a dollar or more per episode.

216
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,480
With Google trying to get back into China,

217
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,540
let’s just say we will probably continue
to rely

218
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,420
mainly on viewer support.

219
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
So if you can,

220
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,950
head over to patreon.com/chinauncensored.

221
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,970
Anything you can contribute helps keep the
lights on.

222
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,610
And that lets us keep the spotlight on China.

223
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,040
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

224
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,160
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

225
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,120
See you next time.

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,660
