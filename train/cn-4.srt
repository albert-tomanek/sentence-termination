1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,910
2014, what did the local Highland League
football club do?

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,720
What, did they get a cow as a mascot?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,720
Yes!

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,330
Did they get, like, a big comedy-costume cow?

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,330
Really?

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,770
Yes, you’re absolutely right, spot on.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,070
Comedy mascot for the football team,
and that is now… that’s the local….

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,930
That can be a road to success and power.

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,520
I know someone who played the Hartlepool mascot,
who is a monkey.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,270
Well, we know the Hartlepool
monkey story, right?

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,270
We’ve done that.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,380
No, you should mention that, ‘cos that’s
not going to…

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,970
Hartlepool, town on the north east Coast,
Napoleonic Wars,

14
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,990
There is a shipwreck off the coast of Hartlepool.

15
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,100
No human survivors but washed up on the beach
is a monkey.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
Okay?

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,609
Normal, normal, everyday kind of monkey.

18
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,719
The people of Hartlepool get the monkey,
try and talk to it.

19
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,190
Monkey just replies with, ook-ook-ook,
as monkeys would.

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,679
Wait, wait, hold on, sorry, the words
“try to talk to it” were in there.

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,870
Well, they saw this figure…

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,219
Hartlepool doesn’t have the greatest reputation…

23
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,719
It was a ship’s mascot, so it was in clothes.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,500
It was dressed as a sailor.

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,280
Duh.

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,740
As they try to talk to the monkey, the monkey
– mehh! – didn’t reply.

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,900
So they thought the monkey was talking French,
and hung it as a spy.

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,460
They are therefore called the monkey-hangers,

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,299
Their mascot for the club is a monkey called
H’Angus the Monkey,

30
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,270
Who ran for mayor of Hartlepool… and won.

31
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,630
That is Stewart Drummond, according to this.

32
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,630
Yes!

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,630
Did you say you know him?

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,329
My brother knows him, yeah.

35
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:27,960
He got sent off a lot of times for being a
naughty monkey at the football.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,440
In very inappropriate fashions, by the way.

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,460
There have been several H’Anguses since,
they’ve been all successively sacked.

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,490
There’s something about the costume,
I believe it’s bewitched.

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,150
I think that’s the way I’d call it.

40
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,119
I’m sorry, is this like the
Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher?

41
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,250
Someone’s placed a curse on them,

42
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,979
and no one will survive in the monkey costume
for more than one season?

43
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,979
I think so!

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,030
It’s not like Yorkie the Lion at York, he’s
well-behaved.

45
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,570
Yes, you’re… wh… you know what, I’m
not even telling that story, yes, that was…

46
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes, very naughty monkey.

47
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,350
Yes!

48
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,510
Let’s move on…
