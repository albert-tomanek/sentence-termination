1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,389
Google is accused of treason.

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,240
Protests erupt in a Hong Kong mall.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,640
And US companies are leaving China

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,340
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,420
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,530
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,260
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,870
Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder and billionaire
tech investor,

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,130
has questioned Google’s “seemingly treasonous
decision”

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,440
of working with China on artificial intelligence.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,800
Thiel made those comments at the National
Conservatism Conference.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,370
He also went on Fox News.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,859
“The weird fact, that's indisputable,

14
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,319
is that Google is working with Communist China,

15
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:42,179
but not the US military on its breakthrough
AI technology.”

16
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,289
“But why is that?”

17
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:44,489
“Well that's the question.”

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,050
Now Google has denied working with China’s
military.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,559
However, their work in China is still benefiting
China’s military.

20
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,260
For example, scientists from Google,

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,920
along with other US tech giants,

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,859
have been working with Chinese universities,

23
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:01,339
researching and developing what’s called
“dual use” technology.

24
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,240
That’s technology that has both civilian
and military use.

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,200
Like these touch screens that can also be
used for jet fighters.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,610
Another example of dual use technology?

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,760
Artificial intelligence.

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,810
So I agree:

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,680
This is a serious problem.

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,290
And even President Trump said his administration
will “take a look.”

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,109
Now Peter Thiel is not a disinterested third
party.

32
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,649
He’s a founding board member of Facebook,

33
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,240
which just happens to be one of Google’s
main competitors.

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,880
But just because he’d be happy to see Google
go down,

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,590
doesn’t mean he’s wrong about what Google’s
doing in China.

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,200
Let’s just also keep an eye on what Facebook

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,510
and other US tech companies are doing in China.

38
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,460
But Google may be trying to win some good
karma.

39
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,200
Or at least one Google security employee is.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,420
Google has warned Hong Kong protest champion
Joshua Wong

41
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,659
that he needs to watch out for government
backed hackers.

42
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,780
Wong posted the warning on his Twitter account.

43
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,500
Now Google didn’t say which government to
watch out for.

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,210
I’ll give you one guess.

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,880
Hong Kong has been engulfed in protests over
the past month.

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,510
People there are afraid the Chinese Communist
Party

47
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,550
is trying to destroy their freedoms.

48
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,130
But there’s one serious flaw with these
protests.

49
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,970
It’s really hot and humid in Hong Kong.

50
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,170
Which is why after we ate dinner at New Town
Plaza,

51
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,440
a mall in Sha Tin a few weeks ago,

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,680
Shelley had the brilliant idea they should
start holding protests inside,

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,130
because of the delightful air conditioning.

54
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,130
Well, someone must have been paying attention.

55
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,910
This is from July 14.

56
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,590
In that very same mall.

57
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,460
Ok, so the protesters didn’t want to go
to the mall.

58
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,560
Or at least that’s what they told their
parents.

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,050
Earlier in the day, there was a protest march
to Sha Tin,

60
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,930
a very residential area of Hong Kong.

61
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,000
And then riot police showed up and chased
the protesters into this high-end mall.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,730
Probably because they wanted everyone to enjoy

63
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,720
the cool, refreshing air conditioning inside.

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,860
Definitely nothing bad is about to happen...

65
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,170
Organizers say there were more than 100,000
people at the protest on Sunday.

66
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,520
Police say there were only 28,000.

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,350
I don’t know what’s accurate, but either
way,

68
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,160
that’s a lot of people to fit in that shopping
mall.

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,570
Which turned into a pitched battle between
police and protesters,

70
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,670
after police trapped protesters in the mall
and wouldn’t let them leave.

71
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,630
Umbrellas were flying.

72
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,290
So was pepper spray.

73
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,730
The amazing part is, there was no looting.

74
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,290
And can I just say how rare it is for a protest
inside a mall

75
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,480
not to involve looting?

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,320
Police say they arrested 37 protesters and
11 policemen were injured.

77
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,270
In this footage from Hong Kong Free Press,

78
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,840
you can see what appears to be a journalist
intervening in protesters

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,390
beating up a plain clothes policeman.

80
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,820
And then dozens more journalists mob the guy
for pictures.

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,270
The Hong Kong government has of course condemned
the violence.

82
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,300
But the important thing to remember is,

83
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,780
at least there was air conditioning.

84
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,730
One of the protesters’ demands is for Hong
Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam

85
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,970
to step down.

86
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,570
Well, according to the Financial Times, she
tried.

87
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,570
Several times.

88
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,900
But “Beijing has refused to let her stand
down.”

89
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,700
The Financial Times says it’s because Beijing
considers

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,370
the situation in Hong Kong to be her fault,

91
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,930
and that no one else would want to step into
her shoes.

92
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,280
Yes, that does make sense.

93
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,660
But I think the real reason is that the Chinese
Communist Party

94
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,670
doesn’t want to set a precedent that protesting
can get a leader to step down.

95
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,270
Not that anyone would ask that of Xi Jinping.

96
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,440
Everyone loves him.

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,940
It’s required.

98
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,450
And just days after the mall protest,

99
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,380
thousands of older Hongkongers marched through
the streets

100
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,750
in what was called a “silver haired” protest
against the extradition bill.

101
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,740
Just look at these rioters.

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,730
Judging by the protests over the past month,

103
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,060
so far the Hong Kong government has alienated
young people,

104
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,060
old people, lawyers, mothers, and even mall
shoppers.

105
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,450
Is there anyone left?

106
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,270
Remember former National Security Adviser
Susan Rice?

107
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,680
Well, she’s condemning a Chinese diplomat
as a “racist disgrace” for his tweets.

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,780
The tweets, which have since been deleted,
had to do with Xinjiang.

109
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,350
Last week, 22 countries signed a letter condemning

110
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,060
the Chinese Communist Party’s persecution
of the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.

111
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,540
But then, “Ambassadors representing 37 countries
praised China

112
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,930
for its ‘remarkable achievements in the
field of human rights.’”

113
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,250
Among those 37 countries were stellar human
rights upholders

114
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,270
like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Syria.

115
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,389
Countries where they have a right to violate
your humanity.

116
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,090
Anyway, the Chinese diplomat Lijian Zhao

117
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,550
went on Twitter to call that letter of support
for China

118
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,680
a “big slap on the face of the US and its
western cohorts.”

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,370
And in a classic tactic of changing the conversation,

120
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,240
Zhao went on to talk about how in Washington
DC,

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,380
you know “the white” don’t go to certain
areas

122
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,940
because of the “black and Latin”.

123
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,820
Now you might be thinking that’s racist.

124
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,620
But I’m just wondering why a top Chinese
diplomat

125
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,990
would have a Twitter account.

126
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,770
Doesn’t he know Twitter is banned in China?

127
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,010
Bad news if your dream job is working at Huawei:

128
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,210
You have terrible judgment.

129
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,040
Also, Huawei is planning extensive layoffs
in the US.

130
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,740
It is kind of hard to operate in a country

131
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,670
where you company has effectively been banned.

132
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,150
The Trump administration banned Huawei over
national security concerns.

133
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,020
It’s now considering maybe lifting part
of the ban,

134
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,070
in certain cases,

135
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,740
where there’s no security threat.

136
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,870
But it’s still basically a ban.

137
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,560
American and European companies are fleeing
China.

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
According to a survey,

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,560
80% of American companies in China are planning
to leave,

140
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,360
while 67% of European Union companies are.

141
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,800
And the Chinese economy is taking a hit.

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,930
According to Business Insider,

143
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,169
China’s growth is at a 27-year low.

144
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,690
But the Chinese regime knows how to tackle
its problems head on.

145
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,790
By detaining another Canadian citizen,

146
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,110
plus 12 Taiwanese citizens.

147
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,580
The China-Canada relationship has been a bit
frosty

148
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,010
since Canada detained Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou
last December.

149
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,900
She’s accused of violating US sanctions
on Iran.

150
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,080
According to Globe and Mail,

151
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,160
China has detained at least 13 Canadians since
then.

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,070
As for the Taiwanese citizens, well,

153
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,020
the Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan
a part of China,

154
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,270
so maybe in their view,

155
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,430
they’re just detaining Chinese citizens.

156
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,370
Which to be fair, the Communist Party is very
good at.

157
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,110
Speaking of Taiwan being considered a part
of China,

158
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,230
Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu will be running
in the 2020

159
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,990
Taiwanese presidential election against current
president Tsai Ing-wen.

160
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,980
Han supports closer ties with Beijing.

161
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,190
According to the New York Times,

162
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,210
“Han has promoted the view that Taiwan

163
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,960
and China belong to the same country,

164
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,010
and had argued that closer ties with China
would lift Taiwan’s economy.”

165
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,320
And he also travelled to China earlier this
year,

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,740
“where he met with top Communist Party officials

167
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,330
in the former British colony of Hong Kong.”

168
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,560
Beijing has always promoted the one country
two systems model

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
they have in Hong Kong as a way of potentially
governing Taiwan under Chinese rule.

170
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,850
And you can see how well it’s working in
Hong Kong.

171
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,729
Meanwhile, President Tsai Ing-Wen was in New
York last week.

172
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:11,050
And outside her hotel, a group of pro Beijing
protesters,

173
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,360
waving the American and Chinese flags,

174
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,380
started attacking a group of Taiwanese supporters.

175
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
They jumping him!

176
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,640
That kind of behavior should be flagged.

177
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,570
So, keep your eye on the upcoming election
in Taiwan.

178
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,250
It’s going to be interesting.

179
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,849
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

180
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,149
a fan who support China Uncensored with a
dollar or more per episode,

181
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,839
by contributing through Patreon.

182
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,589
CaptDantastic asks,

183
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,490
“Wasn't the extradition law Hong Kong was
trying to pass

184
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,209
comparable to Canada's agreement with the
US concerning the Huawei exec?

185
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,149
Basically bringing a person to justice to
another country

186
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,610
where the law in the delivering country wasn't
broken?

187
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,069
How come no one has spoken of the obvious
hypocrisy of this?

188
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,309
Good question.

189
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,759
So there’s actually a pretty big difference

190
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,120
between the extradition agreements most countries
have,

191
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,930
and the extradition bill that was being attempted
in Hong Kong.

192
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,050
Extradition agreements are usually between
two countries

193
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,339
that have similar legal systems.

194
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,879
That way, a suspect can get a fair trial after
being extradited.

195
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,029
Or, I suppose, if both countries have really
bad legal systems,

196
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,550
the suspect can get a totally unfair trial.

197
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,920
In the case of Hong Kong versus China,

198
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,959
Hong Kong has a British-style legal system
that protects the rights of the accused.

199
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,160
Mainland China does not.

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,490
Its courts have a 99.9% conviction rate,

201
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,220
which means that wrongly accused people

202
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,439
almost never get a successful defense.

203
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:45,640
Hong Kongers don’t want to be subject to
that system.

204
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,639
And it’s not just dissidents in Hong Kong
that are nervous.

205
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,959
Many businesspeople are freaked out,

206
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,300
since operating in China typically requires
bribes.

207
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,519
So a lot of influential people in Hong Kong

208
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,259
could be at risk of being sent to a Chinese
court

209
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:01,910
if the extradition bill gets passed.

210
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,399
And the Communist Party uses the law as a
tool

211
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,100
to go after people for political reasons.

212
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,301
So the Hong Kong extradition bill

213
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,690
was not like the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng
Wanzhou,

214
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,740
where she’ll have access to a fair legal
system

215
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,029
after being extradited from Canada to the
US.

216
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:19,379
Because at the end of the day,

217
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,069
even Meng would much rather be in a Canadian
or American court

218
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,009
than in a Chinese court.

219
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,610
Thanks for your question.

220
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,079
And thanks to everyone watching!

221
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,089
We could not make this show without your support.

222
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,929
Whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

223
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:35,040
or just watching and sharing the show with
your friends and family.

224
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,780
So thank you from me and everyone on the China
Uncensored team.

225
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,060
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

226
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,140
