00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:05,270
the Pentagon says the Chinese regime is crossing
the line

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,860
when it comes to the South China Sea.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,880
But...what does that actually mean?

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,680
Hi. Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,339
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:20,470
This is the South China Sea.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,519
The Chinese Communist Party claims nearly
all of it.

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,179
And they’ve gotten more and more aggressive

10
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,750
over the past few years.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,079
They’ve put troops on islands in disputed
territory.

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,829
And when they ran out of islands, they just
built more of them

13
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,860
by dumping some sand on submerged reefs.

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,010
Which is pretty smart if you think about it.

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,750
Like if you run out of cake,

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,010
you can just make more cake.

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,420
And then build runways and missiles and stuff
on them.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,720
Ok, so that analogy doesn’t exactly work.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,620
But the point is, the Chinese Communist Party

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,100
has been building more islands,

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,120
and then putting missiles on them.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,719
And a lot of countries are concerned that
the Communist Party

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,890
might eventually use military force to restrict
everyone else

24
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,460
from navigating through the region.

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,560
And this finally pushed the US Defense Secretary

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,100
to say something about it on Saturday.

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,030
He was speaking at the Shangri-La security
summit in Singapore.

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,619
“China’s policy in the South China Sea
stands in stark contrast

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,420
to the openness of what our strategy promotes.

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,909
It calls into question China's broader goals.”

31
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,920
That’s a diplomatic way of saying,

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,299
“What you’re doing is extremely uncool,

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,890
and we know you’re up to something.”

34
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,200
The Defense Secretary also reminded everyone

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,830
that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had made a
promise in 2015

36
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,630
when he was visiting the White House

37
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,750
that the Chinese Communist Party would not

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,539
militarize the Spratly Islands.

39
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,119
But as he told a reporter,

40
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,720
“We have seen in the last month they have
done exactly that,

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,420
moving weaponry in that was never there before.”

42
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,330
Moving in weaponry like this.

43
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,470
And this.

44
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,320
Plus anti-ship cruise missiles here, here,
here and here—

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,940
with a range that covers a huge chunk of the
South China Sea.

46
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,770
And where cruise-missile coverage might be
patchy,

47
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,680
they brought in nuclear-capable bombers,

48
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,640
like this one seen landing on Woody Island.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,810
What I’m saying here is,

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,420
the Chinese Communist Party is trying to have
its cake,

51
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,680
and eat it too.

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,710
By building more cake.

53
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,060
And with military-ready airstrips it built
on these artificial cakes—

54
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,780
sorry, islands—

55
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,600
in the Spratly archipelago,

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,620
Chinese bombers can now hit targets

57
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,720
in several Southeast Asian countries.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,340
That includes the Philippines and Vietnam,

59
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,510
both of which are objecting the loudest

60
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,790
over China’s increased military presence.

61
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,600
Both have territorial claims in direct conflict
with China.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,480
This is the territory Vietnam claims,and this
is what the Philippines says belongs to it,

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,160
and this is China’s claim,

64
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,120
everything in the nine-dash line—

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,040
about 90% of the South China Sea.

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,530
That’s how Chinese Lieutenant-General He
Lei put it.

67
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,120
He was in the Chinese delegation

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,280
to that Shangri-La security summit.

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,620
He Lei also blasted Mattis’ quote unquote

70
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,460
“provocative remarks.”

71
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,930
He said those who are “shouting about

72
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,650
‘the militarization of the South China Sea’”

73
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,230
are the ones militarizing the South China
Sea.

74
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,200
Which is his own diplomatic way of saying

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,060
“whoever smelt it, dealt it.”

76
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,130
Real mature.

77
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,380
Well Lieutenant-General He,

78
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,660
you should know that whoever denied it,

79
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,730
supplied it.

80
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,680
He Lei also toed the Party line that

81
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,160
the “various islands in the South China
Sea

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,240
and their related waters are sacred territories
of China

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,540
acknowledged by history and international
laws.”

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,020
But the thing about international law is,

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,700
well, it’s complicated.

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,860
I’m fairly sure Lieutenant-General He Lei
is referring to

87
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,770
the international law that says a country
is entitled to

88
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,300
territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles
off its coast.

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,220
Except there’s this other international
law he forgot about:

90
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,509
That is, how the International Tribunal for
the Law of the Sea

91
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:20,180
ruled in 2016 that there was “no legal basis

92
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,449
for China to claim historic rights” in the
South China Sea.

93
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,759
But ok, the Chinese Communist Party says one
thing.

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,540
The International Tribunal—

95
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,900
and most other countries—

96
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,539
say another thing.

97
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,289
That itself doesn’t prove who’s right
about

98
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,139
China’s historical claims.

99
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,800
The real issue at hand isn’t the historical
claims.

100
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,889
The real issue is that the Communist Party

101
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:48,710
is militarizing islands that are close to
Vietnam,

102
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,039
the Philippines, and Malaysia—

103
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,919
and that it may soon want to control other
countries’

104
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,099
ability to navigate commercial ships through
the region.

105
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,270
And the Party’s increased aggression

106
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,770
is what prompted Mattis to say that when it
comes to

107
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,560
guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the
South China Sea...

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,990
“We are going out of our way to cooperate
with Pacific nations...

109
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,919
but we are also going to confront what we
believe

110
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
is out of step with international law—

111
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,699
out of step with international tribunals

112
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,710
that have spoken on the issue.”

113
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,069
So how exactly is the US going to confront
the Chinese regime?

114
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:30,560
One way is that American ships will maintain
a, quote,

115
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,249
“steady drumbeat” of naval operations
around the disputed islands.

116
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:38,449
Including doing more “freedom of navigation
operations.”

117
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,849
These are missions meant to underscore

118
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,139
the rights of other countries to operate

119
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,389
in international waters and airspace.

120
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,509
And they also are a signal to China

121
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,639
that they don’t have territorial rights
there.

122
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,440
The US is also encouraging other countries—

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,039
like Vietnam and the Philippines—

124
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,879
to do their own freedom of navigation operations.

125
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,300
And it looks like France and the United Kingdom

126
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,569
will be joining the US as well.

127
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,569
And you’d think that France

128
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,960
would just let them eat cake.

129
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,110
The US is also reducing military cooperation

130
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,710
with the People’s Liberation Army.

131
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,969
The Pentagon had earlier invited Chinese troops

132
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:21,650
to join the 2018 multi-country military exercises
near Hawaii.

133
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,729
But now, the Pentagon has withdrawn that invitation.

134
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,379
So what do you think about the US taking

135
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,169
a harder line on China’s militarization
of the South China Sea?

136
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:33,389
Leave your comments below.

137
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,240
And before you go, it’s time for me to answer
another question

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,020
from a China Uncensored fan on Patreon.

139
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,480
Lee Lhasa asks...

140
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,140
well, his main question is...

141
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,050
“Do you find yourself frustrated

142
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,539
by our governments and the media,

143
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,419
many whom are seemingly forever selling out,

144
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,530
remaining silent and cowering to China?”

145
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,530
Great question Lee.

146
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,050
There’s definitely a lot more I think

147
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,550
the media and governments around the world
could do,

148
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,550
but actually,

149
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,150
I’ve been more encouraged than I ever have
been before.

150
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,349
The EU, the US, Australian,

151
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,300
and even Canadian governments

152
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,490
have in the past few months,

153
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,219
become more aware of the threat

154
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,569
posed by the Chinese Communist Party

155
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,110
and have been taking active steps to combat
it.

156
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,389
And many individual journalists

157
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,669
have been doing great work as well.

158
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:23,669
For example,

159
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:26,490
I meet Buzzfeed’s Megha Rajagopalan recently

160
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,029
at the Oslo Freedom Forum

161
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,419
and she’s done some amazing reporting on

162
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,300
the Chinese regime’s persecution

163
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,490
of the people in Xinjiang.

164
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,939
I think the biggest problem right now

165
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,629
is how businesses approach China.

166
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,790
I feel like a lot of them ignore the warnings

167
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,860
of government and intelligence agencies around
the world

168
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,919
because they’re more focused on the short
term gain

169
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,910
the China market offers.

170
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,009
So who cares about the long term consequences!

171
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,939
Except sooner or later,

172
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,400
those short term gains will catch up to

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,750
the long term consequences.

174
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,830
And when that happens,

175
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,639
I think we’re going to see a lot of change.

176
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,279
Thanks again for your question Lee.

177
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,279
And remember,

178
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,279

Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell,

see you next time.

190
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,820
Thanks for watching.

191
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,979
China Uncensored is supported

192
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,080
mainly through contributions from viewers
like you.

193
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,220
Without our viewer support,

194
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,940
we’d have to stop the show.

195
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,290
So click this orange button

196
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,820
and visit Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

197
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,640
You can contribute a dollar or more per episode.

198
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,330
You can also set a monthly limit if you need.

199
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,330
When you join,

200
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,960
we’ll give you some cool perks—

201
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,280
and you’ll be making a big difference for
us.
