00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,679
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:05,980
China calls to reduce tensions on the Korean
Peninsula.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,980
And to prepare for war just in case.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,860
Hi welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host,
Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,590
You know, when I heard that North Korea 
conducted its

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,640
fourth nuclear test in January, I
thought,

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,850
now's the perfect time to come to South Korea!

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,060
That's why I'm here,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,500
overlooking the border between North Korea
and South Korea.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,910
With tensions rising,

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,750
this could become a flashpoint for war—

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,890
and not just between two countries, but four:

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,700
North Korea,

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,740
South Korea,

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,580
China,

16
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,480
and America.

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,480
The relationship between these countries is complicated,

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,840
to put it mildly.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,880
Everyone knows North Korea is run by a cruel,
oppressive regime.

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,010
I mean, look at it!

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,270
Seriously, it's right over there.

22
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,730
Anyway, even though North Korea supposedly
has a scary military,

23
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,180
that doesn't mean it has a strong one.

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,649
But no one actually wants the North Korean
regime to collapse.

25
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,709
Imagine millions of refugees streaming across
the border

26
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,850
into South Korea or China.

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,139
Who would take in those

28
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,519
tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe
free?

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,180
Probably not.

30
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:22,719
So the order of the day is just prevent North
Korea

31
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,939
from launching any nuclear weapons,
while at the same time,

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,990
hoping it magically transforms itself

33
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,709
into a democracy somehow.

34
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,369
They could call it the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

35
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,889
What's that, Shelley?

36
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:37,790
Oh.

37
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,740
Anyway, everyone is preparing for the worst.

38
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:44,369
Especially after North Korea followed up its
nuclear test

39
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,349
by launching that long-range rocket 
on February 7th,

40
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:51,489
and celebrating it in the creepiest way possible.

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,580
In this editorial by my favorite Chinese state-run
media, the Global Times,

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,250
the author says that
"[China] should prepare for a war...

43
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,260
Even though there is a very low probably that
a war will occur,

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,310
[China] should be 100 percent prepared."

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,049
Meanwhile, South Korea and the US are talking
about setting up a

46
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,879
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system
in South Korea.

47
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,140
It would launch missiles like this,

48
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,379
which could shoot a North Korean ballistic
missile out of the air—

49
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,790
including one carrying a nuclear warhead.

50
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,849
Previously, South Korea had rejected using
the US military’s THAAD.

51
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,349
What changed their minds?

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,100
Oh, right.

53
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:41,219
But China strongly opposes the use of THAAD.

54
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:44,569
They say it threatens China's national security.

55
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:48,719
Which would be true if China fought alongside
North Korea

56
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,939
in a war against South Korea and the United
States,

57
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,189
like they did in what they still call

58
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:58,209
"The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea."

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,860
But no one wants Korean War II.

60
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,400
Or World War III.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,020
Which is why the US wants to put THAAD in
place as quickly as possible.

62
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,319
Because the US and South Korean governments
see it as a deterrent,

63
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,619
as well as a useful but hopefully-never-used
defense.

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,100
China also hopes it never gets used,

65
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,290
because that could be the first step in destabilizing
North Korea.

66
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,859
Not that China actually likes North Korea,

67
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,030
It just enjoys the political power it gets
from a rogue state.

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,420
That's why the Chinese Communist Party is
propping up the North Korean regime

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,129
by giving it weapons and aid.

70
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,769
China is also North Korea's largest trading
partner by far,

71
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:39,449
on the order of more than $5 billion dollars
a year.

72
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,660
And China is also the main way North Korea
evades international sanctions.

73
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,040
So by putting itself in this position,

74
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,000
the CCP is forcing the rest of the world to
come to it for help.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,819
But this strategy may come back to
bite them.

76
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,709
For one, North Korea is becoming harder for
China to control.

77
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,969
They couldn't stop them from launching the
long-range rocket,

78
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:02,889
even though they tried.

79
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,260
And now other countries are taking actions
that could hurt China.

80
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,340
For instance, the US just passed new sanctions
against North Korea,

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,329
including sanctions against Chinese companies
that do business with North Korea.

82
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,970
Plus the THAAD missile defense system does
shift

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,560
the balance of military power in the region,

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
and not in China’s favor.

85
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,460
But the whole whole missile testing, exploding
nukes

86
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,930
is really just a way for Kim Jong-Un to consolidate
his power.

87
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,300
Because his youthful good looks won't last
forever.

88
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,699
So will there be war on the Korean Peninsula?

89
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,059
I don't plan to stick around long enough to
find out.

90
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,280
What's that, Matt?

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,860
What do you mean, we're going to North Korea?!
