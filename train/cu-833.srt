1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,070
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,860
one of the worst intelligence breaches

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,130
in decades!

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,720
And it happened in China.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,100
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,760
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,690
US spy operations in China

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,699
have been crippled,

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:18,880
according to this recent report

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,760
by the New York Times.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,080
18 to 20 CIA secret agents

12
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:25,310
and sources operating inside of China

13
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,539
were either killed or imprisoned

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,249
between 2010 and 2012.

15
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:33,080
Sometimes in a rather extravagant fashion.

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,180
“One was even, we're told,

17
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,170
shot in a sort of courtyard

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,630
of a government building

19
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,040
in front of his colleagues

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,110
as a sort of message to—

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,400
for those who might be thinking about

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,240
spying for the CIA.”

23
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,270
Which does fall in line

24
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,460
with the Chinese idiom,

25
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,440
“killing a chicken to scare the monkeys.”

26
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,460
Because man...

27
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,690
scaring monkeys is great.

28
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,780
Now this story comes to us

29
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,970
courtesy of my two favorite words in journalism.

30
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,610
No, not “lunch provided.”

31
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,030
The other two:

32
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,040
“Anonymous sources.”

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,560
The New York Times talked to

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,260
10 “current and former American officials”

35
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,520
who describe the intelligence breach as

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,250
“one of the worst in decades.”

37
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,540
And the worst part of it is,

38
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,070
no one knows how it happened.

39
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,520
According to the unnamed sources,

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,910
no one can figure out whether it was mole,

41
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,110
a hack that uncovered how the CIA

42
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,060
communicated with its operatives,

43
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,630
or even if it was some kind of bizarre

44
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,540
“turf war within the CIA.”

45
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,940
Okay so, shooting informants in a courtyard,

46
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,050
an unknown mole,

47
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,350
a turf war in the CIA...

48
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,030
this is totally going to get made into a

49
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,800
“based on a true story” Hollywood movie,

50
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,830
isn't it?

51
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,960
But to give you an idea

52
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,460
of how bad the breach was,

53
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,090
the CIA and FBI actually worked together

54
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,680
to figure out what happened.

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,479
That joint operation was called

56
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,590
Honey Badger,

57
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,770
presumably because...

58
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,240
okay I'm not sure.

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,760
But a honey badger can definitely

60
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,229
kill a chicken.

61
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,510
And monkeys.

62
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,510
And anything else that

63
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,440
stumbles across its path.

64
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,590
But this honey badger

65
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,600
did not succeed.

66
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,749
There was one possible mole

67
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:11,000
they investigated:

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,310
a former CIA operative

69
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,150
who now lives in another Asian country.

70
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,370
But there wasn’t enough evidence

71
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,820
to arrest him.

72
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,720
Ok, so the movie is going to be called

73
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,480
Operation Honey Badger,

74
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:24,859
but they're going to move the action

75
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:26,870
from China to North Korea,

76
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,959
because studio executives think North Korea

77
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,280
is definitely more dangerous than China

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,379
and also they don’t have

79
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,549
a big movie market there.

80
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:33,760
The CIA and FBI

81
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,940
declined to make any comment.

82
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
About the actual true story,

83
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,349
not the potential “based on a true story”

84
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,909
that I’m sure is being optioned in Hollywood

85
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:42,659
as I speak.

86
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,540
And China is also playing it cool.

87
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,049
"I am unaware of the specific situation

88
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,799
regarding the New York Times report

89
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,879
that you refer to.”

90
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,830
And then there’s my favorite state-run media,

91
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,360
the Global Times.

92
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
They wrote,

93
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
“We’re not saying we did it,

94
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,829
but if we did do it,

95
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:00,950
we’re awesome.”

96
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,919
OK, I’m just paraphrasing,

97
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,569
but you get the idea.

98
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,560
Although for some reason,

99
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:08,379
the Global Times wants to make it really clear

100
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,849
that the part about shooting someone

101
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:10,849
in a courtyard

102
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:12,510
was definitely and totally

103
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,140
“purely fabricated.”

104
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,450
The article also compares

105
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,060
the New York Times article

106
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,459
to a Mission: Impossible movie,

107
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,819
saying, and this is an actual quote,

108
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,879
“The journalists who wrote the report

109
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,900
must have been deeply addicted to the franchise.”

110
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
OK, so the movie's going to be called

111
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,079
Mission: Impossible--Operation Honey Badger.

112
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,200
And Tom Cruise will be doing his own stunts,

113
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,199
including singlehandledly disarming

114
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,920
the North Korean nuclear weapons program.

115
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,340
Anyway, this story breaks as US China relations

116
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,900
are actually doing...okay-ish?

117
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
And with no way to know

118
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,879
who actually leaked the story,

119
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,069
or how long the New York Times

120
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,400
has been working on it,

121
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,409
it’s hard to verify what motives

122
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,219
might be behind it.

123
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,260
It's definitely embarrassing

124
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,799
for the CIA and the US government,

125
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,870
and could strain ties

126
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,889
between the United States and China

127
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,870
during a sensitive period.

128
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,029
And right after President Trump

129
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,239
and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

130
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,079
became such good friends, too.

131
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,409
Anything that could drive a wedge between

132
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:13,939
Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

133
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,139
would be a boon to Xi’s political rivals,

134
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,139
that loose faction

135
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,509
under former Chinese leader,

136
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,509
and creator of the world's

137
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,039
most annoying ringtone,

138
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,620
Jiang Zemin.

139
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,090
The New York Times has been utilized

140
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,000
as a tool in this political battle before.

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,330
In 2012, just as the dominoes started falling

142
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,509
that would take out these two major players

143
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,160
in the Jiang faction,

144
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,470
the New York Times released

145
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,930
this exposé detailing the massive family
fortune

146
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,380
of one of the guys behind bringing them down.

147
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,380
But on the other hand,

148
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,759
this spy thing is an old story.

149
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,909
It happened way before either Trump or Xi

150
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,539
were in power.

151
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,289
So it’s hard to say how much political fallout

152
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,860
this would cause to either leader.

153
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,340
One thing that is pretty interesting about

154
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
this story

155
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,210
is that it shows the CIA may have been

156
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,789
losing informants at a critical time

157
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,569
during the Chinese Communist Party’s

158
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,000
internal power struggles.

159
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,140
2012 was the year when Xi Jinping

160
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,680
took over the Communist Party.

161
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,500
And it was eventful.

162
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,690
A corrupt police chief fled to the US consulate

163
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,460
disguised as an old lady

164
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,119
to rat out his boss who was going to kill
him.

165
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
Said boss and his boss

166
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,680
allegedly tried to pull off a coup

167
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,949
to grab power from Xi Jinping,

168
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,770
failed, and ended up in prison

169
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,000
for murder and corruption.

170
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,840
And that set off Xi's power struggle

171
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,960
against Jiang that's still going on.

172
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,940
And the whole time this was happening,

173
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,139
the US government was possibly even more

174
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,569
in the dark than usual.

175
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:41,569
It's like you've been watching

176
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,070
your favorite soap opera,

177
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,759
General Hostility, for years,

178
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,030
and the storylines are getting really exciting,

179
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,409
and then the day you're finally going to find
out

180
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:52,900
who's the shadowy figure behind it all,

181
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,539
the cable cuts out.

182
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,699
And by the time you finally get it fixed,

183
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,729
the storylines are completely different

184
00:05:58,729 --> 00:05:59,729
and you have no idea

185
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,060
what's happening anymore.

186
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,820
Anyway, despite the Chinese Communist Party's

187
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,280
apparent success at killing foreign spies

188
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,680
between 2010 and 2012,

189
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,889
they seem to be struggling in recent years.

190
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,449
According to the New York Times article,

191
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,830
the CIA has been rebuilding

192
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,930
its spy network inside China

193
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,080
and agents and informants

194
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,660
have not all been turning up dead.

195
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,040
Which might explain why the Chinese authorities

196
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,830
have lately been relying on tactics like,

197
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,330
creating a hotline people can call

198
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,789
if they think someone is a spy.

199
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,669
Or creating a helpful list for the general
public

200
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,319
of “spy characteristics” to keep an eye
out for,

201
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,620
with such gems as,

202
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,979
“People who like to throw out

203
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,650
controversial subjects at public gatherings

204
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,090
in order to ignite debate

205
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,270
and then quietly observe,”

206
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,800
and “People who...often throw out reactionary
remarks

207
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,660
and exaggerate the merits of foreigners.”

208
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,900
Yes, those are definitely spies.

209
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,710
Or internet trolls.

210
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,840
And then of course there was this

211
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,749
friendly comic put up everywhere

212
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:01,090
for National Security Education Day

213
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,110
called “Dangerous Love.”

214
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,969
It’s an actual comic

215
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,280
meant to warn hapless Chinese women

216
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,780
about the dangers of dating foreigners

217
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,159
because they’re probably spies

218
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,159
and you’ll end up in jail

219
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,560
for helping them.

220
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,650
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say

221
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,480
that these probably aren't the same crack
techniques

222
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,620
that they used back in 2010 through 2012.

223
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,090
So what do you think about the deaths

224
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,560
of CIA informants in China?

225
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,090
Leave your comments below.

226
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,090
And don’t worry,

227
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,469
no chickens or monkeys were hurt

228
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:32,060
in the filming of this episode.

229
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,440
No monkeys, at least.
