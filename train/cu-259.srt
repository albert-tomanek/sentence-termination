1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,330
China’s richest man is a Communist!

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,080
A top executive from Huawei gets arrested
in Canada.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,920
And finally,

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,429
the Pope’s deal with the devil has gone
sour.

5
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:12,409
Who would’ve thought?

6
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:14,020
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,580
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,400
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,210
You know, as I always say,

10
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,970
just because you’re a communist,

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,800
doesn’t mean ya can’t make a little profit.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,779
And that’s why I applaud Jack Ma.

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,140
The billionaire founder of Alibaba Jack Ma

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,320
was accidentally outed as a Communist Party
member

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,900
by Party mouthpiece People’s Daily

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,550
in a list it published of “100 Chinese people

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,640
who had made extraordinary contributions

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,820
to the country’s development over the last
40 years.”

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,890
Now Ma had always been a bit vague about

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,740
his relationship with the Communist Party.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,190
In fact, Ma even gave the advice to his employees

22
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,920
that when dealing with the government,

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,190
“Love them, don’t marry them.”

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,510
Easier said than done.

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,240
I’d be his Christopher Robin any day.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,680
Now as a Party member,

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,500
Jack Ma would be required to put

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,210
the Party’s interests above all else.

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,680
And of the Party’s interest, is interest!

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,010
Party members have to pay Party dues—2%.

31
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,530
And since Ma is worth over 35 billion dollars,

32
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,520
that’s a lot Party interest.

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,160
Ma isn’t alone.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,360
“A recent survey found that one-third

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,580
of China’s private-sector entrepreneurs

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,590
are party members.”

37
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,970
The question is, why did Jack Ma get outed
now?

38
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,070
Earlier this year,

39
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,460
Jack Ma announced he was retiring as Alibaba
CEO,

40
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,659
leading many to speculate he was being forced
out by the Party.

41
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,659
Which I get.

42
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,340
The only thing more common than a rich Communist,

43
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,100
is a purged Communist.

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,630
And in Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign,

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,500
a lot of people who used to be untouchable
have been taken down.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,780
Though typically the way it works is

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,430
you don’t go for the big guy,

48
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,250
you go for smaller people and work your way
up.

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,190
So I wouldn’t worry too much about Ma.

50
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,220
Unless lower level guys in Alibaba were getting
arrested and...

51
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
Oh.

52
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,200
Well, stay tuned to China Uncensored for updates.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,010
Speaking of rich Chinese people,

54
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,060
the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei has been
arrested in Canada.

55
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,760
Her name is Meng Wanzhou.

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,629
She’s the daughter of Huawei’s founder.

57
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,040
The US wants to extradite her to face charges
in New York.

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,219
She’s suspected of violating US trade sanctions

59
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:33,469
by shipping US-made items to Iran.

60
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,080
Canadian authorities apparently nabbed her

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,599
while she was transferring flights at the
Vancouver airport.

62
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,519
Which is why you should always fly nonstop.

63
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,579
Meanwhile, in Australia,

64
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,840
a well placed member of parliament

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,590
turned out to have some pretty shady connections

66
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,889
to the Chinese Communist Party.

67
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:54,769
This is West Australia’s Labor MP Pierre
Yang.

68
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:56,279
He said that when he was filling out

69
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,859
his parliamentary register of interests—

70
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,279
he “overlooked” declaring his memberships

71
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,859
in the Northeast China Federation Inc

72
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:06,980
and the Association of Great China.

73
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,939
He even was a legal adviser

74
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,489
for those groups until August 2017,

75
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,779
several months after his parliamentary term

76
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:18,219
started in May of 2017.

77
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,219
The problem is,

78
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,950
both of those organizations

79
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,329
are linked to the Chinese Communist Party.

80
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,790
And this follows a disturbingly similar pattern
of the Party

81
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,379
getting people who share its interests into

82
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,040
the Australian government and society.

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,120
And not everyone in the Australian government

84
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,620
believes that Yang merely overlooked his membership.

85
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,630
“I find Mr Yang's excuse that he ‘overlooked’
his membership

86
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,049
of two associations which promote the foreign
policy interests

87
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,549
of the Chinese Government to be highly improbable.

88
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,500
All incoming members of Parliament are briefed

89
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,700
by the clerks about their disclosure responsibilities.”

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,689
It’s even less likely since he was

91
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:58,030
the Government’s whip in the Legislative
Council.

92
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,519
So he should have known the laws.

93
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,579
Now, West Australia’s Premier Mark McGowan

94
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,599
has says he vouches for Yang’s character.

95
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,069
But recently, two other Australian government
officials

96
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,819
were revealed to have connections to the same
group.

97
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:14,819
Over the last two years,

98
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,459
more and more evidence has come out that

99
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,769
the Chinese Communist Party is trying to influence

100
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,900
politics in Australia.

101
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,220
But I mean, I understand.

102
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,449
Chinese money is very tempting.

103
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:26,990
And no one knows that better

104
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,599
than Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de
Sousa.

105
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,300
While the rest of the European Union

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,910
is scrutinizing Chinese investment,

107
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,889
China’s Belt and Road initiative has found
support in Portugal.

108
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,669
And when Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to
visit this week,

109
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,060
president de Sousa was literally drooling
over Chinese money.

110
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,410
Let’s see that again.

111
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,340
But it’s not just Australia and Europe

112
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,120
the Chinese Communist Party is trying to influence.

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,409
According to this new report

114
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,530
from top China experts in the United States,

115
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,069
Beijing is trying to do the same in the US.

116
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,039
The report says, “While Americans are well
acquainted with

117
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,250
China’s quest for influence through the
projection of diplomatic,

118
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,590
economic, and military power,

119
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,110
we are less aware of the myriad ways Beijing

120
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,710
has more recently been seeking cultural and
informational influence,

121
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,139
some of which could undermine our democratic
processes.”

122
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,280
The goal is to not only

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,990
“redefine China’s place in the world as
a global player,

124
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,660
but they also have put forward the notion
of a ‘China option’

125
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,539
that is claimed to be a more efficient developmental
model

126
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:34,620
than liberal democracy”

127
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,970
I mean, I’ve only been saying that for the
past six years.

128
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,350
And they didn’t cite me at all.

129
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,250
But hey, it’s cool.

130
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,879
But even as China tries to influence America,

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,039
it’s still the US that brings home the bacon.

132
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,520
China is suffering from a severe case of swine
flu.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,259
This little piggy went to market,

134
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,969
this little piggy stayed home,

135
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,389
and this little piggy became patient zero
and had to be shot.

136
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,129
Now even though China has put tariffs on US
pork

137
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,830
as retaliation for the trade war,

138
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,270
China is dealing with a major shortage of
pork.

139
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,439
And Chinese people love pork.

140
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,060
The written character for family is literally
a pig in a home.

141
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,280
China imported almost 10 thousand tons of
American pork

142
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,479
just for the week of November 22.

143
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,080
“This represents a 72 percent share of all

144
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,479
U.S. pork export deals during that week.”

145
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,310
Although it makes sense when you realize the
pork shortage

146
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,229
could also be due to the large number of Uighur
Muslims

147
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,069
under surveillance who now love eating pork.

148
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,750
Twitter is banned in China,

149
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,689
but that hasn’t stopped some Chinese netizens

150
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:45,020
from having personal Twitter accounts.

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,150
But recently,

152
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,169
Chinese Twitter users have been invited to
tea with police,

153
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,419
and then forced to close their accounts.

154
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,600
The good news is, this ban does not include

155
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,430
the Twitter accounts belonging state-run media,

156
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,729
like China Daily, People’s Daily,

157
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,440
Xinhua, Global Times, and CGTN.

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,949
And finally, hey Vatican,

159
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,080
you know how you made that deal with the Chinese
Communist Party

160
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,830
that has been persecuting Christians since,
like the beginning?

161
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,280
It might have been a bad idea.

162
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,030
In September, Pope Francis agreed to recognize
7 bishops

163
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,569
appointed by the officially atheist Chinese
Communist Party.

164
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:23,939
In exchange,

165
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,540
the Party said it would recognize the authority
of the Vatican.

166
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,240
Well, guess what?

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,849
The Party lied.

168
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:34,499
And now one of the bishops the Pope appointed

169
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:38,090
has been “disappeared.”

170
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,009
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal.

171
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,409
You know I feel like I get to use that clip
a lot on this show.

172
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:49,020
Look, I know the Pope is a Liberation Theologist,

173
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,490
which is sort of a synthesis between

174
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,389
Christian theology and Marxism.

175
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,440
But it seems the Vatican is learning the hard
way

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,789
that a deal with the Communist Party

177
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,389
might just be a deal with the devil.

178
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:01,389

180
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,800
And before you go,

181
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,409
now is the time when I answer questions from
fans

182
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,840
who support China Uncensored

183
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,560
on the crowd funding website Pateron..

184
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,009
Evan Rillera Marsh asks,

185
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,090
“Hey Chris, Is china uncensored biased?

186
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,629
Are there any rules you guys use

187
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:21,050
when making videos to try and minimize bias?”

188
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,150
Of course I’m biased!

189
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,270
I’m biased in favor of freedom,

190
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,789
and against authoritarian regimes

191
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:28,139
lying and killing their own citizens.

192
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,659
But this is a good question, Evan.

193
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,020
Even when you’re biased like me,

194
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,630
it’s important to look at all the facts.

195
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,440
But that doesn’t mean giving equal weight

196
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,700
to the side that always lies.

197
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,950
The Chinese Communist Party says

198
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,530
there is no human rights problem in China.

199
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,010
That’s a lie.

200
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,120
The Chinese Communist Party says it lifted

201
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,190
millions of people out of poverty.

202
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,940
That’s another lie.

203
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,850
And I prefer to directly tell you when someone
is lying,

204
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,520
rather than hide behind language

205
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,510
that gives equal weight to both sides.

206
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,260
That being said, on China Uncensored,

207
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,880
we strive to be rigorous with our facts.

208
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,270
We can back up any claim we make.

209
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,530
And when some other media get things wrong,

210
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,180
like the reporting on China’s social credit
system,

211
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,510
we do our best to make sure we tell the whole
story.

212
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,720
Of course, that doesn’t mean we’re infallible

213
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,870
and we never make mistakes.

214
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,220
But we do our best.

215
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,210
Also, if you ever see a mistake on China Uncensored,

216
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,120
just know that the person who made the mistake
was not me.

217
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,590
It was my producer, Matt.

218
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,430
And we’re able to keep doing what we do

219
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,280
thanks to support from the fans of the show.

220
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,920
So thanks for your question, Evan.

221
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,970
And if you’d like to support China Uncensored,

222
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,970

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,760
