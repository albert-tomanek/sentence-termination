1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,480
It was called fringe, foolish, and debunked

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,319
But now people are finally admitting

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,280
The coronavirus could have come from a lab

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,140
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,519
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,109
This episode is sponsored by CuriosityStream.

7
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:27,050
It’s great for people like you who love
watching videos and learning cool stuff.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,579
Curiosity Stream has a huge selection of documentaries
and non-fiction TV shows.

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,059
And I’ll show you more at the end.

10
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:39,370
So, have you ever talked about something that’s
kind of controversial, and people call you

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,010
crazy, and then it turns out you were right
all along?

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,510
Sorry Galileo, I guess the Earth does go around
the sun.

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,039
A year and a half after the initial virus
outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019, almost

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,180
3 million people around the world have died
of Covid-19.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,970
I’ve been calling it the CCP Virus because
the Chinese Communist Party’s coverup allowed

16
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,940
it to spread.

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,890
In response to the CCP Virus, government lockdowns
have crippled economies around the world.

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,420
And now, the media would like you to know
that the Wuhan lab-leak theory is suddenly

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,350
credible.

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,140
The theory is that the CCP Virus may have
come from an accidental lab leak from the

21
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,850
Wuhan Institute of Virology.

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,110
That theory has been discussed since the beginning
of the outbreak.

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,540
But it was for the most part dismissed as
a conspiracy theory.

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,700
If you talked about the idea of a lab leak,
you were lumped in with Qanon supporters who

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,399
thought that Bill Gates created the coronavirus.

26
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,689
Which is obviously ridiculous.

27
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,740
Bill Gates didn’t create the coronavirus.

28
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,420
He was too busy hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein.

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,909
Last February, the predominant theory about
the coronavirus was that it came from bats

30
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,049
or possibly pangolins before jumping to humans.

31
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,690
And this seemed to make sense, because that’s
how other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS

32
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,780
first spread to humans.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,910
At first, the spread of the CCP Virus was
supposed to have happened here, at the Huanan

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,070
Seafood Market.

35
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,800
It’s a wet market in Wuhan where exotic
animals were sold.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,910
Many of the early cases were traced back to
the market.

37
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,730
Again, it seemed to make sense, because a
wet market is how SARS was first spread in

38
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,360
China back in 2002.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,620
But there were problems with this theory.

40
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,700
One, “some early cases [of Covid-19] occurred
in people with no known link” to the wet

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,680
market.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,390
Another problem: the wet market didn’t sell
bats or pangolins.

43
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,200
And even a year and a half after the initial
outbreak, scientists have not found a bat

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,950
or pangolin, or any other host species, infected
with the CCP virus.

45
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,160
That’s unusual.

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,220
The host species of the original SARS virus
was identified within four months of the SARS

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,480
outbreak, and the host of MERS within nine
months.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,000
So while the zoonotic theory, that it jumped
from bats to humans naturally, makes sense,

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
there’s not really any evidence for it so
far.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,560
But who needs evidence when you can just leap
to conclusions?

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,040
Follow the science!

52
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,790
Then there’s the lab leak theory.

53
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,160
Again, the theory is not that the CCP virus
was created as a bioweapon and unleashed on

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
the world.

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,650
The lab leak theory is that scientists were
experimenting on a bat coronavirus at a lab

56
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,290
in Wuhan, and it *accidentally* leaked.

57
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,980
To their credit, a handful of scientists and
journalists have been pushing all along for

58
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,800
an investigation into the lab leak theory.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,800
But for the most part, if you talked about
the lab leak theory, the media basically treated

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,150
you like you were this guy.

61
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,120
Later in this episode, I’ll talk more about
how the US mainstream media’s dismissive

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,210
reports basically wrote the Chinese Communist
Party’s propaganda for them.

63
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,219
But first, there’s been growing evidence
over the past year that makes a lab leak look

64
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,650
much more likely.

65
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,810
We’ve been talking about this on China Uncensored
for more than a year.

66
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,860
And some of the Chinese Communist Party’s
actions are a bit suspicious.

67
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,740
Well, okay, I need to narrow that down.

68
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,750
How the Party treated this specific lab in
Wuhan was suspicious.

69
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,950
In January, the Chinese military posted its
top epidemiologist to the Wuhan lab.

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,600
In February, Chinese leader Xi Jinping began
talking about biosafety reform in labs.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,270
That’s an odd response to a coronavirus
that supposedly came from a wet market.

72
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,870
And as the US began to investigate the origin
of the coronavirus, the Communist Party began

73
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,759
to heavily censor academic research about
the origin of the virus.

74
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,110
I mean, science and public health are always
best served when Communist officials are looking

75
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,599
over scientists’ work.

76
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:20,080
By the way, YouTube demonetized that episode
for portraying “harmful or dangerous acts.”

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,030
I can only assume it means that the Communist
Party covering up the origin of a global pandemic

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,490
is a harmful or dangerous act.

79
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,870
Right, YouTube?

80
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,389
More after the break.

81
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,719
Welcome back.

82
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,599
Did you actually see an ad?

83
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:44,020
Last year, the lab leak theory was largely
dismissed based on two letters.

84
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,300
Not research papers, but letters.

85
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,280
Essentially opinion articles from scientists.

86
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,300
The first was published in the Lancet on February
19, 2020 and signed by virologists and other

87
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,550
scientists.

88
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,000
It says: “We stand together to strongly
condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,580
COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.”

90
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,759
The letter also called for the scientific
community to support and stand with the scientists

91
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,909
of China.

92
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:18,419
It turns out that letter was written by Dr.
Peter Daszak.

93
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:24,169
I’ve talked about Daszak before because
he was also on the World Health Organization

94
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,939
team that went to China to investigate the
origin of the coronavirus.

95
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:33,860
Of course the Party didn’t actually let
them investigate, and Daszak didn’t complain,

96
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,250
but that’s another story.

97
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,620
Daszak is the president of EcoHealth Alliance,
a non-profit group that among other things,

98
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,509
studies viruses in the wild.

99
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:50,699
In emails, Daszak told other scientists that
he wanted this letter to “avoid the appearance

100
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,500
of a political statement” and that it was
just about supporting Chinese scientists who

101
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,370
were under serious pressure.

102
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,590
Maybe that’s what he wanted to do, but by
calling the lab leak theory a conspiracy theory,

103
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,860
Daszak was making a political statement.

104
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,050
Also, Daszak and the EcoHealth Alliance had
a massive conflict of interest here.

105
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:22,289
They were funding research at the Wuhan Institute
of Virology through US government grants.

106
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,919
So if a lab leak did happen there, they’d
be in a lot of trouble.

107
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,930
But you’d never know that from this Lancet
letter, because the authors, including Daszak,

108
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,440
declared they had “no competing interests.”

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,169
Remember this, it’s important later.

110
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,800
The second letter was published in Nature
Medicine.

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,939
It said that the authors’ analyses “clearly
show that [the coronavirus] is not a laboratory

112
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,810
construct of a purposefully manipulated virus.”

113
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,930
But it turns out that letter did not clearly
show that at all.

114
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,650
One of the letter’s main arguments was that
the CCP virus genome did not show any signs

115
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,569
of cutting and pasting.

116
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:10,610
But there are newer methods of manipulating
a virus that don’t leave any marks.

117
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,300
Including the “no-see-um” or “seamless
approaches” and something called “serial

118
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,919
passage.”

119
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,029
Despite the problems with these two letters,
the media used them as the basis for article

120
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,860
after article “debunking” the lab leak
theory.

121
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,300
But there’s actually a lot more evidence
now for the lab leak theory than the zoonotic

122
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
theory.

123
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,080
Specifically, evidence shows it’s very possible
the Wuhan Institute of Virology was manipulating

124
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,410
this virus to make it more infectious to humans.

125
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,890
Here’s evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein
.

126
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,480
“But the fact that there is no evidence,
that it shows up in Wuhan and immediately

127
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:01,470
spreads, tells us that this virus was well-adapted
to our cells, and well-adapted to transmit

128
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,690
between individuals, and that is conspicuous.

129
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:14,020
One way you could get there is if somebody
A) had added components to a virus in order

130
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,520
to make it transmissible to humans, so the
research in question would be research that

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,680
was interested in discovering what a pandemic
in humans of a bat-borne coronavirus would

132
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,340
be like, so that we could do something about
it, maybe we could prevent it, maybe we could

133
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,450
create a vaccine ahead of time.”

134
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,140
If you think it sounds insane to take a virus
and make it more infectious to humans, don’t

135
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
worry!

136
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,660
Virologists do this all the time.

137
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,210
They’re called “gain of function” experiments.

138
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:47,100
“[Virologists] have recreated the 1918 flu
virus, shown how the almost extinct polio

139
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,570
virus can be synthesized from its published
DNA sequence, and introduced a smallpox gene

140
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,490
into a related virus.”

141
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,240
So virologists are using DNA to recreate deadly
extinct viruses!

142
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,710
It’s just like Jurassic Park, except you
can’t run away from the velociraptors, because

143
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,740
the velociraptors are *inside* you.

144
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,960
But was the Wuhan Institute of Virology creating
Coronavirus Park?

145
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,340
Well, yes.

146
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,030
This gain-of-function research, making viruses
more infectious to humans, was being done

147
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,190
at the institute by Dr. Shi Zhengli.

148
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,060
She’s been called Batwoman for her work
on bat coronaviruses.

149
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,020
Dr. Shi learned to do this research on bat
coronaviruses with Dr. Ralph Baric at the

150
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,570
University of North Carolina.

151
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:46,491
They published this paper back in 2015 on
combining parts of a bat coronavirus and a

152
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:49,100
mouse coronavirus.

153
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,180
Baric was one of the inventors of the “no-see-um”
approach I mentioned earlier.

154
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,720
It lets scientists manipulate viruses without
leaving a mark.

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,790
So Dr. Shi likely learned how to do this.

156
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,500
Baric is also one of the scientists who published
a letter in Science magazine this month calling

157
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:16,010
for a complete investigation into the origin
of Covid-19, including the lab leak theory.

158
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,330
I guess we should follow the science.

159
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,570
And here’s where Peter Daszak comes in.

160
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,600
He’s the guy who wrote the letter calling
the lab leak a conspiracy theory.

161
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,610
As part of EcoHealth Alliance, Daszak applied
for research grants from the US government

162
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,880
to study bat coronaviruses.

163
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,140
Specifically, those grants came from the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

164
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:48,820
And Daszak sub-contracted those grants to
Dr. Shi at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

165
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:54,530
The descriptions of the research grants show
that “Dr. Shi set out to create novel coronaviruses

166
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:58,450
with the highest possible infectivity for
human cells.”

167
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,430
Here’s Peter Daszak talking about the work
they were doing with bat coronaviruses back

168
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,000
in December 2019.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,100
This was before the CCP virus outbreak became
public knowledge.

170
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:19,680
“And we have now found, you know, after
6 or 7 years of doing this, over 100 new sars-related

171
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,440
coronaviruses, very close to SARS”
“Well I think…coronaviruses — you can

172
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,460
manipulate them in the lab pretty easily.

173
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,030
Spike protein drives a lot of what happen
with coronavirus, in zoonotic risk.

174
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,420
So you can get the sequence, you can build
the protein, and we work a lot with Ralph

175
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,030
Baric at UNC to do this.

176
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,870
Insert into the backbone of another virus
and do some work in the lab.”

177
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,460
So that’s pretty conclusive evidence that
the Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing

178
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,710
experiments on bat coronaviruses, the kind
that could have led to the CCP virus.

179
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,560
It doesn’t prove that the CCP virus is engineered.

180
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,410
But there are several things about the CCP
virus’s genetic code that are unusual or

181
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,790
almost non-existent in natural bat coronaviruses.

182
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,640
But these things would make sense for a virus
that was spliced together in a lab.

183
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,480
I’m not going to talk in detail about spike
proteins and furin cleavage sites because

184
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,390
this isn’t Viruses Uninfected.

185
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:30,020
But suffice it to say, one of these was so
unusual that an eminent virologist called

186
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,100
it a smoking gun for the non-natural origin
of the virus.

187
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,540
So the Wuhan lab was essentially creating
a Coronavirus Park, and the CCP virus could

188
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,250
have been one of their velociraptors.

189
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,970
But could those velociraptors escape the lab?

190
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,790
It actually wouldn’t have been that hard.

191
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,520
The Wuhan Institute of Virology is a BSL 4
lab.

192
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,130
That’s Biosafety Level 4.

193
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,300
It’s the highest level.

194
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,420
It turns out that the Wuhan lab had had safety
issues before.

195
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,700
“American embassy officials in Beijing made
several visits to the research facility and

196
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,630
sent two official warnings back to Washington
in early 2018 about the lab’s inadequate

197
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,690
safety measures.”

198
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,320
)
And even more concerning, it turns out that

199
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,590
a lot of the bat coronavirus research was
not being done in the BSL 4 labs, but in the

200
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:32,250
much less strict BSL 2 and 3 level labs.

201
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,230
Biosafety Level 4 looks like this.

202
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,790
Basically, a full body space suit.

203
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,040
Biosafety Level 2 looks like this.

204
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,900
It just requires you to wear a lab coat and
gloves, and possibly a face shield or goggles

205
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,450
if liquids might splash.

206
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:53,820
Last March, Americans were practically sterilizing
their groceries at biosafety level 2.

207
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,130
For a lab, that doesn’t seem like enough
protection.

208
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,350
And it might not have been.

209
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,480
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that
“Three researchers from China’s Wuhan

210
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,170
Institute of Virology became sick enough in
November 2019 that they sought hospital care.”

211
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,290
That was based on a US intelligence report.

212
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,800
That’s not completely new information.

213
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,670
It’s partly based on this fact sheet the
Trump administration released back in January.

214
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:27,030
But as more information gets reported, it’s
clear there needs to be an investigation into

215
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,980
the lab leak theory.

216
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,880
So why has it taken a year and a half for
most mainstream media to take the lab leak

217
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
theory seriously?

218
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,260
I’ll tell you after the break.

219
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,200
Welcome back.

220
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,340
Ever since people started talking about the
lab leak theory in January 2020, the mainstream

221
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:51,110
media has treated it like a conspiracy theory.

222
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,930
Like I said earlier, one reason was that they
believed the flawed Lancet and Nature letters

223
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,150
from scientists, without looking into them
further.

224
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,931
Another reason was the media kept conflating
the lab leak theory with the accusation that

225
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,650
the CCP Virus was created to be a bioweapon.

226
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,120
And a third big reason the media treated the
lab leak theory as a conspiracy theory was

227
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,540
because of who was saying it: Republicans.

228
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,910
Back in February 2020, Senator Tom Cotton
said that there needed to be an investigation

229
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,730
into the lab leak theory.

230
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,070
The New York Times accused him of repeating
a fringe theory.

231
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,290
The Washington Post called it a conspiracy
theory that was already debunked.

232
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,120
As time went on, most mainstream media just
ignored this story, unless they were trying

233
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,820
to further debunk it.

234
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,290
Especially after President Trump said this.

235
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,160
Reporter: Have you seen anything at this point
that gives you a high degree of confidence

236
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,380
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the
origin of this virus?

237
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,350
Trump: Yes I have, Yes I have.

238
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,810
And I think that the world health organization
should be ashamed of themselves.

239
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,449
Because they’re like the public relations
agency for China.

240
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,679
Well, he’s not wrong about the World Health
Organization.

241
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,610
But to the media, suddenly the lab leak theory
became President Trump’s theory.

242
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,199
And they *had* to debunk it.

243
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,250
They claimed experts called it foolish.

244
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,079
They said Fauci crushed Trump’s theory.

245
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,480
(
Dr. Fauci, by the way, is the director of

246
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,150
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, the government organization that

247
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,920
gave Peter Daszak the grants that he then
gave to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

248
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,490
But the point is, the lab leak theory became
a victim of the mainstream media’s culture

249
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,960
war against Trump.

250
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,830
A former New York Times science writer says
he thought the lab leak theory was far right

251
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,999
and equated it to Pizzagate and QAnon.

252
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:03,350
That same New York Times writer now grudgingly
admits it could be true.

253
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,680
But for well over a year, people who talked
about the lab leak theory were discredited.

254
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,379
In some cases they were banned from social
media.

255
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:16,590
It couldn’t have worked out better for the
Chinese Communist Party.

256
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,780
Chinese state-run media didn’t even have
to spend much energy denying the lab leak

257
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,970
theory.

258
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,499
The Western media did it for them.

259
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:26,690
And much more effectively, too.

260
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,340
All the Global Times had to do was show a
screenshot of the New York Times.

261
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,279
It’s quite disturbing that the mainstream
media, because of their own biases, ended

262
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,940
up handing the Chinese regime a propaganda
coup for so long.

263
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,899
Something that let the Party cover up its
own responsibility for the CCP virus and continue

264
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,779
to lie to the rest of the world.

265
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,919
But that might be over soon.

266
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,740
Because the media have discovered that hey,
this lab leak theory suddenly became credible.

267
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,070
Yes.

268
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,409
Suddenly.

269
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,190
And the media is now in full backpedaling
mode.

270
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,669
They might even start doing some actual reporting
on the lab leak theory.

271
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:13,230
You know, investigate something.

272
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,529
So what happens now that the lab leak theory
is no longer a conspiracy theory?

273
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:21,679
Everyone is calling for an investigation.

274
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,900
Some scientists say that even without China’s
cooperation, Congress could start an investigation

275
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,960
in the US.

276
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,510
And, hey, if this global pandemic did start
with a lab leak in Wuhan, maybe the US government

277
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,770
shouldn’t fund gain-of-function research
in China!

278
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,080
Just a thought.

279
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,300
But now, this issue is a lot more dangerous
for the Chinese Communist Party.

280
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:54,070
They can’t rely on Western media to be their
propaganda arm anymore, on this topic at least.

281
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,580
So I wouldn’t be surprised if some Chinese
scientists suddenly find the missing animal

282
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,249
host for a natural zoonotic transmission of
the coronavirus.

283
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,580
Like, maybe it’s mink.

284
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,629
Mink sounds good.

285
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:09,090
Thanks, state-run media.

286
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,010
When the Chinese propaganda machine ramps
into gear to counter the lab leak theory,

287
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,899
the real question is, will the Western media
fall for it?

288
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,509
Or have they learned their lesson?

289
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:24,480
And this episode has been sponsored by CuriosityStream.

For example, “Ancient Engineering”.

293
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:41,749
There’s an episode on how China’s most
brutal and possibly most insane emperor built

294
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:44,340
the Great Wall of China.

295
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,559
And to find workers, he had a brilliant idea:
He made more than 200 crimes punishable by

296
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,320
forced labor.

297
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,179
And if you died building the wall, no problem.

298
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,260
A family member would have to take your place.

299
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,350
With galaxy brain policies like that, no wonder
Mao Zedong idolized him!
