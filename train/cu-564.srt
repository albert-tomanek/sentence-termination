00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,460
why does China suddenly want to be friends
with Japan?

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,940
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,650
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,840
Last week marked the 45th anniversary

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,900
of diplomatic ties between China and Japan.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,900
And suddenly,

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,070
it seems like they’re best buddies.And that’s
weird.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,300
Until 1972,

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,030
their diplomatic ties consisted of

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,610
a brutal military invasion—

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,460
which China still refers to not as World War
II,

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,460
but as “The War of Resistance Against Japanese
Aggression.”—

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,530
and the war was followed by nearly

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,510
30 years of anti-Japanese propaganda.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,880
But eventually, diplomatic ties were restored.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,079
And now relations between China and Japan

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,059
have never been better!

19
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,739
In a rare appearance,

20
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:53,559
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe

21
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:55,129
actually showed up to an event

22
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:58,610
hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo.

23
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,550
That was the first time in 15 years

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,820
that a Japanese Prime Minister

25
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,320
showed up to this kind of shindig.

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,680
Abe and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,210
also exchanged congratulatory messages.

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,530
You know,

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,690
congratulating each other on not

30
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,960
tearing each others’ throats out.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,760
Li’s message talked about improving ties,
quote,

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,890
“in the spirit of taking history as a mirror

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,330
and looking into the future”.

34
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,950
Yeah, if Li Keqiang ever asks

35
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,080
if you’d like to go to his poetry reading,

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,909
tell him you have somewhere else to be.

37
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,130
But as, um, beautiful as that poetry may sound,

38
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,320
the Chinese Communist Party has actually been

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,140
undermining Japan for years—

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,810
even during the period of diplomatic relations.

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,930
For example, the CCP has stolen

42
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,010
tons of Japanese technology.

43
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,970
I’m looking at you, high-speed train.

44
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,750
Sadly, China didn’t also steal Japan’s

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,869
safety standards for high-speed trains.

46
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,270
And then in 2012, the CCP allowed

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,720
widespread anti-Japanese riots across China.

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,990
It was sparked by a dispute over some small,

49
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,710
uninhabited islands.

50
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,900
And then some people decided

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,459
the most logical course of action would be

52
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,329
to march down the street,

53
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:14,510
carrying pictures of...Mao Zedong?

54
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,760
Ok.

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,069
But then they also destroyed

56
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,260
every Japanese product in sight.

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,879
Like this Chinese police car

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,159
that happened to be made in Japan.

59
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,379
An over-reaction?

60
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,430
Chinese police didn’t think so.

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,519
I’m thinking maybe the CCP told them

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,699
to look the other way.

63
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:36,079
But the CCP was still worried—

64
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,329
about all those Chinese citizens

65
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,829
who didn’t join the protests!

66
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,829
Maybe they didn’t hate Japan enough.

67
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,109
That’s why the CCP embarked on

68
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:49,249
a slew of borderline absurd Japanese-themed
TV shows.

69
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,879
Not absurd like that game show “Food Floor
Dinosaur!”

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,590
That was awesome.

71
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,719
These ones were not.

72
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,999
They were mostly about killing people.

73
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:03,949
In 2013, Quartz reported that 30% of Chinese
primetime TV

74
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:08,529
was dedicated to shows about killing Japanese
soldiers.

75
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,620
As you might imagine, at that time,

76
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,840
for the 40th anniversary of Sino-Japanese
relations,

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,719
China didn’t even bother sending a congratulatory
message.

78
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,969
In fact, as recently as two months ago,

79
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,120
China sent its military into

80
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,699
Japanese Air Defense Identification Zones

81
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,809
and told them to “get used to it.”

82
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:31,979
But now, the CCP is suddenly being friendly.

83
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,260
Hosting that anniversary party and all.

84
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,650
So how did the CCP go from

85
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,839
“Japanese and Dogs are Forbidden”

86
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:41,479
to hosting a black tie party for the Prime
Minister

87
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,609
with an awesome ice phoenix?

88
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,489
Well, it’s the fallout from this.

89
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:49,549
That’s the path a North Korean missile took

90
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,650
right over Japan just a few weeks ago.

91
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,299
Though it wasn’t targeting Japan,

92
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,390
it did freak everyone out.

93
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,419
And it reopened Japan’s internal debate

94
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,479
about developing its own military.

95
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,870
After the Japanese surrender in World War
II,

96
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,339
the US forced Japan to agree to a constitution

97
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,199
that prohibited the country from having any
military

98
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,619
except a self-defence force.

99
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,930
Japan is also not allowed to declare war

100
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,389
or have nuclear weapons.

101
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,609
And before you ask, Godzilla is allowed;

102
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,870
he’s part of the self-defense force.

103
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,610
Though having him around is a bit of a double-edged
sword.

104
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,110
Anyway, the CCP has always been happy

105
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,490
about Japan’s military restrictions.

106
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,360
When your biggest economic rival

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
can never go to war against you,

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,210
it makes you feel a bit more confident

109
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,699
telling them to “get used” to your military
activity...

110
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,250
Riiiiight up until they start pushing for
a military.

111
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,909
Then it’s time to make peace.

112
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,889
But Prime Minister Shinzō Abe

113
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,009
has always wanted a military.

114
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,770
And North Korea is giving him the perfect
excuse.

115
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,509
"The gravity of this threat is unprecedented.

116
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,120
It is indisputably a matter of urgency.

117
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,860
It’s also giving him a much needed boost

118
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,300
in the polls at home.

119
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,319
“Abe is taking advantage of bolstered approval
ratings—

120
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,139
partly on the back of his handling

121
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,500
of the situation with North Korea…

122
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
in a bid to achieve his long held goal

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,770
of revising Japan’s postwar pacifist constitution.”

124
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,819
This is something he’s been pushing

125
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,660
for a long time.

126
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,180
In 2014,

127
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,680
Japan made the first expansion of

128
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,600
its defense force in forty years.

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Not long after,

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,379
he made a reinterpretation of the Japanese
constitution.

131
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:38,569
Instead of limiting military force to Japan’s
self-defense,

132
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,099
Japan could now also use its military to defend
an ally.

133
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,659
And just a few months ago,

134
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,389
Abe put a deadline on his plans to change
the constitution.

135
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,500
This was right after saying North Korea

136
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,250
could launch a sarin gas attack.

137
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,850
Japan has also recently been doing live fire
drills

138
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,219
with the US military.

139
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:02,249
The US has a mutual defense treaty with Japan.

140
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,860
That means the US is bound to protect Japan,

141
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,139
including the Senkaku islands.

142
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,569
Those are the islands China also claims,

143
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,530
the ones that sparked the protests I mentioned
earlier.

144
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,699
“There’s a nightmare scenario brewing
in the East China Sea.”

145
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,800
“The risks of an accidental confrontation

146
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,699
between the two nations is rising

147
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,090
and it could draw in other countries

148
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,990
like the United States.”

149
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,419
And the reason the Chinese Communist Party

150
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,330
is so freaked out about a militarized Japan,

151
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,810
is that Japan’s self-defense force

152
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,250
can already rival China’s military.

153
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,780
Even though China has more soldiers

154
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,340
and outspends Japan,

155
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,189
“Japan has the strongest navy and air force
in Asia”

156
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,219
according to one expert.

157
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,219
And remember,

158
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,520
that’s with only a self-defense force.

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,719
Japan’s supremacy is thanks in part

160
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,370
to cutting edge technology

161
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,600
plus a missile defense system

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,279
installed by the US.

163
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,120
Meanwhile, the Chinese military

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,389
is still struggling to modernize.

165
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,389
And even though right now

166
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,659
Japan isn’t allowed nuclear weapons,

167
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,490
the country already has nuclear power.

168
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,949
It’s not stretch to imagine how quickly

169
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,120
Japan could arm itself with nuclear weapons.

170
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,349
In recent weeks,

171
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,100
some Japanese officials have even quietly
suggested

172
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,749
that they should allow the US

173
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,789
to keep nuclear weapons in Japan.

174
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:19,330
With Godzilla and a nuclear-armed Uncle Sam,

175
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,879
they’d be unstoppable.

176
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,900
This is all very convenient for Prime Minister
Shinzō Abe.

177
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,569
He’s using the North Korea nuclear situation,

178
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,729
and Japan’s relationship with the US,

179
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,249
to get Japan the military force he’s always
wanted.

180
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,249
“Together with Donald Trump,

181
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,069
we have been successfully demonstrating

182
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,319
our strong will to exercise pressure against
North Korea….

183
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,629
So I strongly look forward to making every
effort

184
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,340
with you and also with other members

185
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,789
of the international community

186
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,960
to achieve the de-nuclearizaton of North Korea.”

187
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,080
And that might be a reality the Chinese Communist
Party

188
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,449
will just have to get used to.

189
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,020
Let us know what you think.

190
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,580
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

191
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,440
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,590
See you next time.

193
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,340
So how much you want to bet

194
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,919
that if Japan gets a military,

195
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,860
it will have giant robots?

196
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,469
But until that becomes the most interesting
thing

197
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:14,939
to watch on the Internet,

198
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,690
