1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,160
Is this the end

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,960
for Chinese Companies on the US stock market?

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,080
The US and China head towards decoupling

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,760
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.\h

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,120
This episode is sponsored by\h\h

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,200
MOVA globes. Two countries on this globe seem to\h
be moving further apart. Can you guess which ones?

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,680
For years, China has been taking advantage\h
of the US economically. And it’s gotten so\h\h

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,400
bad that some people are saying, hey\h
if the relationship isn’t working out,\h\h

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,160
maybe the US and Chinese economies should get\h
divorced. Let’s call it Conscious Decoupling.\h

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,240
A few weeks ago we did an episode on why\h\h

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,200
the Chinese Communist Party\h
is terrified of decoupling.\h

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
Meanwhile, President Trump\h
doesn’t seem too worried.\h\h

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Here he is at a White House\h
press conference in September.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:04,560
So when you mention the word decouple, it's an\h
interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars,\h\h

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,160
and if we didn't do business with them,\h
we wouldn't lose billions of dollars.\h\h

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,840
It's called decoupling, soon\h
you'll start thinking about it.\h

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
Well, I certainly am thinking about it now.\h

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,920
And the Trump Administration has now\h
taken a big step towards decoupling.\h

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,800
The US Securities and Exchange\h
Commission is pushing ahead with\h\h

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,480
a plan that threatens to kick Chinese\h
companies off of US stock exchanges.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,160
The SEC is the US federal agency\h
that regulates the stock market.\h\h

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,360
And, by the end of this year, the SEC\h
is planning to “propose a regulation\h\h

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,720
that would lead to the delisting of companies\h
for not complying with U.S. auditing rules.”

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,640
Basically, this Christmas, they’re giving\h
Xi Jinping a stocking stuffed with coal.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
So what does it mean when the\h
SEC talks about Chinese companies\h\h

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
not complying with US auditing rules?

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,560
Well, major Chinese companies like Alibaba and\h
Baidu trade on the US stock exchanges. However,\h\h

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
China refuses “to let inspectors\h
from the Public Company Accounting\h\h

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,800
Oversight Board review audits [of them].”

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,960
Why? Well, this article from 2015\h
called “The SEC Caves on China”\h\h

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:26,800
explains. It says that “China-based auditors have\h
refused to comply with SEC subpoenas for their\h\h

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,360
clients’ paperwork, citing Chinese laws that treat\h
such corporate information as state secrets.”\h

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,040
Huh, that’s weird. Why would\h
documents from totally private\h\h

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,400
Chinese companies be considered state secrets?

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,040
But instead of pushing back, the SEC\h
“quietly carved out a China-size exception:\h\h

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
When Chinese companies list on U.S.\h
markets, basic auditing rules won’t apply.”

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,840
So that means that Chinese\h
companies can come to the US,\h\h

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,120
get listed on Wall Street, and rake in\h
lots of money from American investors.\h\h

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,440
And the US government can’t review the\h
audits of those Chinese companies.\h

40
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,320
Allowing Chinese companies\h
onto US stock markets without\h\h

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,600
standard regulatory oversight is a problem. And\h
it has already come back to bite US investors.\h

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
I’ll tell you how after the break.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,720
Welcome back. Chinese companies can\h
be listed on US stock exchanges,\h\h

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,000
even though they refuse to be audited.\h
And this has caused major problems.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,960
Even as of that article from 2015, “Tens\h
of billions of dollars in U.S. market value\h\h

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,920
have disappeared in recent years as more\h
than 170 U.S.-listed Chinese companies\h\h

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,160
have faced scrutiny for embezzlement, theft,\h
misrepresentation and other alleged abuses.”

48
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,760
And it hasn’t gotten better\h
in the last five years.\h

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Just this past summer, the\h
Chinese company Luckin Coffee\h\h

50
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,080
was caught in a 300 million dollar\h
revenue fraud after an SEC investigation.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah, Luckin Coffee inflated its\h
revenue by 300 million dollars.\h\h

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,080
Then its stock price collapsed\h
and it got delisted from NASDAQ.\h

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,000
Which can only mean one thing. It’s\h
a great investment opportunity!

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,680
What could go wrong?\h

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,600
There are more than 200 Chinese\h
companies listed on US stock exchanges,\h\h

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
with a combined market cap of $2.2 trillion.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,160
This year alone, Chinese companies have raised\h
$12 billion dollars in initial public offerings,\h\h

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
all while essentially ignoring US law.

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
And it’s not just Luckin Coffee type\h
fraud that puts US investors at risk.\h\h

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,320
The political machinations of the Chinese\h
Communist Party are also a threat to US investors.\h\h

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,000
Like how Alibaba founder Jack Ma\h
criticized Chinese regulators,\h\h

62
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,920
and then China put the brakes on the $310\h
million dollar IPO of a company tied to Ma.

63
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,520
Which caused Alibaba’s stock on the New York\h
Stock Exchange to fall 8%. Which means US\h\h

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,160
investors in Alibaba lost a huge amount of money\h
based on the whims of the Chinese Communist Party.

65
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,440
So the SEC is trying to delist Chinese\h
companies that don’t follow the rules\h\h

66
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,920
that all other companies in the US do.\h
But it’s not just because of Trump.\h\h

67
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,920
This is becoming a bipartisan issue.\h
Back in May, the Senate overwhelmingly\h\h

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,160
approved a bill that could bar Chinese\h
companies from US stock exchanges.\h

69
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,120
A big issue is *where* these Chinese companies\h
are getting their American investment money.\h\h

70
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,360
Much of it is “from pension funds and college\h
endowments in search of fat investment returns.”

71
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,360
Which is insane! It means the\h
value of Americans’ pension funds\h\h

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,840
can be affected by the decisions\h
of a hostile foreign government.

73
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,320
This delisting of certain Chinese companies is\h
just the latest in a post election sweep by the\h\h

74
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,760
Trump Administration to crack down hard on the\h
Chinese Communist Party. A couple weeks ago,\h\h

75
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,600
Trump issued an executive order banning\h
investment in Chinese firms with military ties.

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
Which makes you wonder: How\h
long had that been going on?!

77
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
But despite what you might think,\h\h

78
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,360
the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t sound\h
too bothered by the Trump administration’s\h\h

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,200
harsh actions. Because they’re betting they\h
can get Joe Biden to put a stop to it.\h

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,280
Fang Xinghai, who’s the Vice Chairman of the\h
China Securities Regulatory Commision, said,\h\h

81
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,120
“I think during the Biden administration we should\h
be able to resolve that problem because it’s not\h\h

82
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,360
an intractable problem. All it takes is good will\h
on both sides and a willingness on both sides.”

83
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,160
And considering Biden’s record with\h
China while he was Vice President,\h\h

84
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
there could be a lot of willingness on both sides.

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,320
The new SEC rules will be open for public comment\h
in December. But according to Andrew Bishop global\h\h

86
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,600
head of policy research at New York-based\h
Signum Global Advisors, “If the new rules\h\h

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,440
haven’t been set in stone by the time Trump\h
leaves offices, Biden could water them down.\h\h

88
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Even if they are imposed by January 20, Biden\h
could issue new rules to override them.”

89
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,160
And you know what that means! Time to start\h
investing in that new exciting Chinese company,\h\h

90
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,840
“Beijing Peaceful Rise Naval\h
Industrial Corporation Inc.”

91
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
And this episode has been\h
sponsored by MOVA Globes.

92
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,520
You’ve seen one of these MOVA\h
Globes on my desk before.

93
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,600
The technology is really amazing. When you pick\h
it up, it keeps spinning. And when you put it back\h\h

94
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,160
on its base, it corrects its motion, and starts\h
rotating again. It’s powered by ambient sunlight.

95
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,880
MOVA has dozens of other cool designs, too.
