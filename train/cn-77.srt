1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
To be fair, Lorz went on to win the Boston Marathon —

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,700
[Sharp, trumpet-like fart]

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,680
[Laughter]

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,920
You thought you were going to
get away with that, didn't you?

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,340
[Gasping]  Yeah, I did.

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,260
I can see the waveform!

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,660
Don't anybody tell him about
anything else anybody's won!

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,200
Gary Brannan: farting at marathon winners.

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,600
Farts at victory!

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,360
[Sings 'Chariots of Fire' melody']
[Blows raspberry]

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,820
Yeah, what happens if Gary actually wins anything?

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,680
He follows through.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,160
That's why I never have.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,320
What, followed through, or won anything?

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,980
Not the latter.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,940
Um, Frederick Lorz went on...

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,700
Frederick Lorz went on to win
the Boston Marathon the year after.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,240
But Thomas Hicks was...
You okay?

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,860
No, he's lost it.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,540
He's lost it.

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,960
Everybody take five.
We'll reconvene when he can breathe.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,640
[Hums 'Take Five']

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,460
[Guitar riff]

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,120
Will it help if I poke you?

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,460
Might happen again.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,880
TOM: Okay. Um...

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,740
CHRIS: Mi mi mi mi mi...

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,440
Frederick Lorz went on to actually win the
Boston Marathon the next year — don't you dare!

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,180
Why are you laughing?!

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,800
Let me get this line out. We'll edit it together.

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,180
TOM: Frederick —
MATT: Get it out.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,820
Frederick Lorz actually went on
to win the Boston Mara...  [Laughs]

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,000
[Laughter]

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,120
GARY: [Blows raspberry]

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,780
Are you on satellite delay?

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,260
Frederick Lorz actually went on
to win the Boston Marathon the next —

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,180
GARY: [Laughs]
TOM: I can't look at Gary!

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,660
I can't look at him! He looks like
he's having the worst s*** of his life!

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, that's the post-credits quote and no mistake!
