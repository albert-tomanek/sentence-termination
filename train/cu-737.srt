1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,389
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:04,050
Teresa May I?

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,290
Start a Golden Era of UK China relations?

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,860
China’s belt and road

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,120
will squeeze you,

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,420
and then run you over.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,450
And finally, China’s building weapons

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,280
that could shoot down satellites.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,930
Good thing I’m also on cable.

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,900
This is China Uncensored.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,760
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,510
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,060
In our top story,

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,410
according to my favorite Chinese state run
media,

15
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,429
Chinese civilization isn’t just ancient
anymore.

16
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,450
It’s extra ancient!

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,079
And that’s been proven.

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,449
You know what that means:

19
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:43,579
More things will be part of Chinese territory

20
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,749
since ancient times.

21
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:48,050
Like all of world history.

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,010
And while China may love Uncle Trump,

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,050
He’s taking a backseat right now to

24
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,699
British Prime Minister Theresa May,

25
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,060
also known as “Auntie May.”

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,940
“‘Auntie May’ is a warm expression,

27
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,560
just like we call Xi Jinping ‘Uncle Xi’”

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,740
to show our fondness.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,299
Whoa, that kid’s got it mixed up.

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,950
Trump is the Uncle.

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,270
Xi is the Dada.

32
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,340
So: Auntie Theresa May,

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,930
Uncle Donald Trump,

34
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,420
and Daddy Xi Jinping.

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,580
That’s a heck of a family reunion.

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,509
No politics at the dinner table, everyone.

37
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,390
Anyway, Prime Minister May made a

38
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,270
three-day trip to China this week.

39
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,659
She said she “will intensify

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,940
the golden era in UK-China relations.”

41
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,100
Golden Era is of course referencing

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,719
what China was calling a Golden Era

43
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,780
between China and the UK back in 2015.

44
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,060
That’s when Chinese leader Xi Jinping

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,210
visited the UK,

46
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,820
and knocked back a few pints

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,049
with then Prime Minister David Cameron,

48
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,320
and—in the highlight of his trip—

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,689
took a selfie with famous soccer player

50
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,899
Sergio Agüero.

51
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:04,200
Of course, that was years ago,

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,100
and with the old prime minister before Brexit.

53
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,140
But we can still have a golden era, right?

54
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,140
Right?

55
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,830
Well, the Chinese regime knows it might have

56
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,269
an advantage over the UK now.

57
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,450
As state-run newspaper Xinhua puts it,

58
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,780
“To mitigate the impact of a potential Brexit
cliff edge,

59
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,180
Britain is under immense pressure to consolidate

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,560
bilateral trade relations beyond Europe.”

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,190
By “beyond Europe”, they mean “with
China.”

62
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,720
But don’t worry.

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,150
That wouldn’t mean Prime Minister May

64
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,410
is going to sell out human rights for economic
gain.

65
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,230
Especially when it comes to raising concerns

66
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,670
about the erosion of freedoms

67
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,260
in the former British colony,

68
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,319
Hong Kong.

69
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,700
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

70
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,849
Oh, she actually did sell out.

71
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,010
And Chinese state-run media praised her for
it.

72
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,670
Pro-tip: If the Communist Party’s

73
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,810
state-run media is praising you,

74
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,930
you’ve probably done something horribly,

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,799
horribly wrong.

76
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,659
So what does all this mean for Hong Kong?

77
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,110
Well, it means freedom there isn’t free.

78
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,409
In fact, it’s priceless,

79
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:10,260
because the Chinese Communist Party

80
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,860
simply won’t allow it.

81
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,049
This is Agnes Chow.

82
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,370
She’s famous for her role

83
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,940
in the 2014 Umbrella Movement,

84
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,159
a several-months-long protest against Beijing

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,720
for going back on its promise of

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,570
universal suffrage for Hong Kong.

87
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,860
And now she’s been disqualified from running

88
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,439
for Hong Kong’s legislative council.

89
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,439
The Hong Kong government said

90
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,510
she was disqualified because her political
party,

91
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,040
Demosisto, advocated for self-determination,

92
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,650
which the government said was against

93
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,120
Hong Kong’s constitution,

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,159
the Basic Law.

95
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,870
But self-determination isn’t the same as
saying

96
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,720
Hong Kong should be independent from China.

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,519
It just means that Hong Kongers

98
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,040
should be able to choose their own future.

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Therefore, it shouldn’t violate the Basic
Law.

100
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,160
But surely, Agnes was only disqualified

101
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,980
because the Hong Kong government

102
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,549
thinks someone with her point of view

103
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,780
could never win;

104
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,280
so really they’re just doing her a favor

105
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,569
by saving her the trouble of running a campaign.

106
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,239
It has nothing to do with increasing pressure

107
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,219
from the CCP to undermine Hong Kong’s elections.

108
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,639
But this does follow the resentencing

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,400
of another Umbrella Movement leader,

110
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,299
Joshua Wong...

111
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,650
and the disqualification of other

112
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,410
democratically elected legislators

113
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,470
Beijing doesn’t like.

114
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,110
So maybe there’s a larger thing going on
here.

115
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,280
Chow was running to replace Nathan Law’s

116
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,270
seat in the Legislative Council.

117
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,960
He had lost his seat for for quoting Gandhi

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,430
while taking his oath of office.

119
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,300
Law was also from the Demosisto party.

120
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,430
But he was allowed to run for office

121
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,220
a year and a half ago.

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,050
Strange how supporting self-determination

123
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,620
wasn’t an issue then.

124
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,560
About 2,000 people showed up Sunday

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,820
to protest Chow’s disqualification.

126
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,960
And according to a new Pentagon report,

127
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
China and Russia are developing weapons

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,970
that could shoot down US satellites by 2020.

129
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,580
US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis

130
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,150
has called China and Russia a bigger threat

131
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,750
than Islamic terrorism,

132
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,690
a statement backed by Australia.

133
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,060
“Australia has backed

134
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,169
a new United States defense strategy

135
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,770
naming Russia and China a greater threat

136
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,940
to national security than Islamic terrorism.”

137
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,590
I don’t know though.

138
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,870
I hear ISIS is working on some pretty impressive

139
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,120
anti-satellite technology.

140
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,040
Hey, remember that song

141
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,930
about China’s Belt and Road Initiative

142
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,700
from state-run media?

143
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,900
“The future’s coming now.

144
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,789
Oh oh oh oh.

145
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,160
The Belt and Road is how.

146
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Oh oh oh oh.”

147
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,669
Just wanted to get that ear worm

148
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,419
stuck in your head again.

149
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,000
You’re welcome.

150
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,910
So despite all the talk about joint prosperity

151
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,910
and the like the Belt and Road

152
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,639
most definitely will bring—

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,680
turns out,

154
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,850
that might not be the case.

155
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,360
According to this report from a US think tank,

156
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,180
pretty much all the contractors hired

157
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,180
for the Belt and Road’s ambitious construction
projects

158
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,500
are Chinese.

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920
By comparison,

160
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,760
when multilateral development banks

161
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,419
dole out contracts,

162
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,990
most contracts go to locals.

163
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,690
So the Belt and Road promises

164
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,320
economic development,

165
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,729
but then makes those countries borrow money

166
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,750
from China to pay Chinese contractors

167
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,870
to do most of the work.

168
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,349
That can lead to economic ruin instead.

169
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,710
That’s a problem for African countries like
Uganda.

170
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,259
“Uganda says this road

171
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,980
is the jewel in the crown of an infrastructure
project

172
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,300
to drive economic growth.

173
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,150
Critics say it will lead to more debt.

174
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,210
China lent Uganda $350 million—

175
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,920
about 60 percent of the cost—

176
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,430
towards building the 30-mile road.”

177
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,000
Also, some of the buildings the Chinese regime

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,819
has been building in Africa,

179
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,699
like the African Union building,

180
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,040
may be have been bugged.

181
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,180
Now sure, that sounds bad.

182
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,580
But have you considered this?

183
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,120
“We'll share the goodness now

184
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,460
Oh oh oh oh.

185
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,120
The Belt and Road is how

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,260
Oh oh oh oh.”

187
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,740
That’s the trouble with cheesy propaganda.

188
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,870
You just can’t stop listening to it.

189
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,990
And another foreign company

190
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,050
is in trouble with the Chinese regime

191
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,300
over the status of Taiwan.

192
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Japanese retailer Muji

193
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,810
has been ordered to destroy a furniture catalog...

194
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,500
...because it had a map suggesting

195
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,610
Taiwan is a separate country.

196
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,729
The map also didn’t show a string of islands

197
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,800
both China and Japan claim.

198
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,560
Japan has lodged a protest over China

199
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,380
bossing around a Japanese company.

200
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
But I mean,

201
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,440
I don’t think China was too out of line
here.

202
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,850
I’d also want to destroy that furniture
catalog.

203
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,620
Not because of how Taiwan was labeled,

204
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,389
but because all Muji’s furniture

205
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:47,740
is just overpriced IKEA knockoffs.

206
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,020
And a Chinese national was spotted

207
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,740
illegally crossing the border into Laos—

208
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,500
according to this CCTV footage on CCTV.

209
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,160
They eventually caught him,

210
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
interrogated him,

211
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
and then forced him to join

212
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,340
China’s national basketball team.

213
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,780
So what do you think?
