1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:02,830
Is this what I had on my stag do?

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,600
I remember that!

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,980
Well, you do more than I do, let's be honest(!)

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,130
I just remember the injuries, Tom,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,210
and the pain involved.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,650
Oh, no, I thought you were talking about the
meal afterwards!

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,600
Not the paintball.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,820
Oh my god. Yes, and that.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,559
-- His stag do, we went on paintball.
-- We did.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,440
And then they said, right, stags and the birthday
boys, line up for the shooting gallery.

11
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:30,529
One shot at you.

12
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:32,619
Which I was fine with.
I thought, I can take that.

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,920
I've had more than that in the course of the
day

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,499
I'd been wearing a pink tabard with a target
on it for all of it

15
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,760
which is "what you do when you're on these
things"(!)

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,719
So I've taken a fair few shots to all over
my body.

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,209
And then they say, "one shot" -- no, it's
not one shot.

18
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,839
Everyone just unloads their guns towards you.

19
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,579
Yeah, I think the point I realised afterwards...
you're supposed to run away.

20
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,749
Everyone apart from you did.

21
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:54,109
And I just stood and took a hail of pellets!

22
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:55,690
Like, we took a few shots...

23
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,209
I was in that position!

24
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,869
Then most of our group went "no, no, that's
enough"

25
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,129
"This is wrong!"

26
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,070
Everyone else is like "he's not running"!

27
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,730
The point was, I'm just stood up, I'm supposed
to just stand there and go

28
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,420
"have at it again", basically, but I think
they'd have brought out, I imagine,

29
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,710
a paint cannon or something

30
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,060
that would have just loaded up with a tin
of Dulux, just firing it!

31
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,460
In the tin!

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,000
The thing I remember more from that paintball,
Tom,

33
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,659
is you trying to use your grenade.

34
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,509
Oh, I'd forgotten that!

35
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,880
There was a castle at the top of the slope,

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,759
Tom's idea was to try and somehow, I don't
know,

37
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,890
spook them out that a ghost was coming or
something

38
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,420
by throwing a very small can of smoke...

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,450
I had a smoke grenade! I wanted to use the
smoke grenade!

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah. I don't think the appropriate place
to use it

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,649
is a) a heavily armed fort

42
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:42,649
which gives away where we are, lest we forget,

43
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,079
because they'll see where it came from,

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,240
and b) one of those that's on a hill

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,329
where you didn't quite get it to the apex
of the hill

46
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,659
and it rolled back down towards us...

47
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:50,960
It was a smokescreen!

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,509
...disguising us within a smokescreen

49
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,069
which is novel(!). Let's put it this way.
In military terms.

50
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:00,549
Unless we'd sprang out from the other side
of the smoke,

51
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,960
we had very little hope.

52
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,990
That's fair.

53
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,539
You... you fumigated your own side.

54
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:06,960
Although, if you're getting me with this,

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,709
then I'm going to get you with the aerial
ropes course.

56
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,909
Where you had the zip line...

57
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,440
And it wasn't a zip line down. Zip line across.

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
So you put enough energy in, you'll go off.
Unless...

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,260
I'd like to stress at this point, it was a
very shallow angle on the rope. Right?

60
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,180
...unless you fail to stick the landing,

61
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,400
in which case you bounce off the far tree,
and you just...

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
Did you do a Boris Johnson?!

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
-- No! -- Yes! In the middle, dangling...

64
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,760
Oh, actually, yes.

65
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,950
And someone has to come along with a large
thing for him to grab on to

66
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,950
and drag him over

67
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,819
And then I nearly did it again!

68
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,120
Yeah, you nearly did.

69
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,319
All right? It was like one-all, on that one.

70
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,919
On the other hand, you got married, so you
won in the end.
