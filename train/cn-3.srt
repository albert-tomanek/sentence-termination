1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,980
[Cheering]

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,900
MATT: What up, crew?

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,860
[Laughter]

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,320
Yeah, get the door, door boy!

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,000
Just put this back on to cover up the man-boobs.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,040
[Whistle from audience]

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,920
Thank you!

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,420
She's up there.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,900
Now, those of you who have known
what we've done for a while

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,760
will remember that a long time ago
we did some audio episodes.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,200
And I didn't know how much time we would
have left, exactly, at the end of this...

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,520
GARY: To be fair, we didn't know how long it'd get
before the cold bottles of piss hit the stage.

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,360
What I like is that they're cold, which means
that people have pre-prepared them.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,600
[Laughter]
GARY: Yeah.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,040
Um, which means —

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,320
MATT: "This one's for piss..."

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,320
Er, which means that...

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,840
In front of me, I have some classic trivia questions!

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,720
[Cheering]
GARY: Ohhh, baby!

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,300
This is what they want!

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,780
"Finchley!"

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,280
And by classic, I mean they're from 1984.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,520
GARY: This s*** again!

24
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,560
[Laughter]

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,580
I am going to read out the answers;
all you have to do is guess the questions.

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,700
Are you all ready?

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,340
God, remember the days when we did this
in a small, fart-filled room in Chester?

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,860
We had a really big curry one of the nights, and *he*...

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,960
He destroyed the room so badly we had to
open the outside door to let the maft out.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,500
That was the night I fell off your airbed and head-butted
your drum kit — oh, memories, memories.

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,440
[Laughter]

32
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,340
We start...

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,120
...with Albert Blake Dick.

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,300
Which Blake didn't make Blake's 7?

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,260
Because "Dick's 7" wouldn't sound... yeah.

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,520
Should have seen the shape of the ship.

37
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,300
It sounds like an order.
'Albert — blake Dick!'

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,560
What's 'blaking' someone?

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
I don't know, but I know what you use!

40
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,820
Heyy!

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,740
GARY: It's when Gareth Thomas comes up behind you —

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,780
TOM: NO.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,460
Two people got that reference.

44
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,500
GARY: Thank you, both Blake's 7 fans in the audience.

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,440
TOM: Now, see, this has actually been corrected since.

46
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,120
The actual answer to this would be Thomas Edison...

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,160
GARY: Er, who shafted who out of some kind of patent?

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,080
Well, Dick was the one who named —
I can't say that seriously.

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960
[Laughter]

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,100
Blake Dick —
I can't say *that* seriously.

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,920
Albert?

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,860
Albert was the one who named it.

53
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,420
So we are looking for an invention.

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,740
A tephelone!

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,500
Oh, no. We're looking for something
that you'd still use in an office today.

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,160
GARY: Photocopier.
CHRIS: Chair.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,800
GARY: Window.
MATT: Electricity.

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,260
Gary, you're very close.

59
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm looking for something a little bit — like,
photocopier, that was the Xerox Corporation...

60
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
What was an earlier version of that?

61
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,580
Typewriter.

62
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,740
CHRIS: Carbon copying... thing... pad.

63
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,520
Yeah, I'll give you the point. [DING]

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,240
We're looking for mimeograph machine.

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
GARY and MATT: Mimeograph machine?

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,100
GARY: Sounds like a f***ing electro band.

67
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,300
GARY: Yeah, I'm down with the kids.

68
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,700
'Hello, we're Mimeograph Machine.'

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,300
CHRIS: [Beeping and booping]
GARY: 'Yeah. And we're here to annoy you pre-show.'

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,720
TOM: That's actually fair, isn't it.
GARY: Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,620
We move on to 'the 35'.

72
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,180
What yard line do you do some
bollocks at in American football?

73
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,340
[Laughter]

74
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,460
GARY: You don't get your bollocks out
in American football.

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,040
Very dangerous.

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,580
No, that's rugby, and that's afterwards.

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,300
Ha ha!

78
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh they do, though, don't they.

79
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,960
You're absolutely right,
it is a yard line in American football...

80
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,900
Do you want to go any...

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
CHRIS: Line of scrimmage.
MATT: Is that the line you go past, that if you go...

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,840
That's where you... kick the thingy.

83
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,620
[Applause]
GARY: This is why you never got that...

84
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,980
American football is one of the few
sports I sometimes watch.

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,500
And I still don't know what I'm going to say.

86
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,480
And yet, 'Is it the line you kick the thingy?'

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,420
The thing is, he's right. [DING]

88
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,160
[Applause]

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,760
That's what you get for watching the Superb Owl, isn't it.

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,660
Yes.

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,880
Super Bowel.

92
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,620
Yeah. Hell of a show.

93
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,380
Yeah. It's 'Which yard line do NFL teams kick off from?'

94
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,060
And before we get letters, this is from 1984.
It was moved ten years later.

95
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,840
'Before we get letters'?

96
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,240
[Laughter]

97
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,560
MATT: Z! Q! R!

98
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,800
I'd quite like that, because the YouTube barrier to entry

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
would be quite a bit higher if you
had to comment by sending a letter.

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
But on the other hand, I would
open my post in the morning —

101
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,060
You've got a letter opener as well!

102
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,780
[Laughter and applause]

103
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
Tom lives near an embassy.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,300
I like to think he does have a silver platter
that his post is delivered on.

105
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,480
'Private and Confidential for you, sir...'
[Envelope slitting noises]

106
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,100
No, I just like the idea that I'm going to open a letter,

107
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,780
and it's just going to be a vague insult on my person.

108
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,680
All in caps.

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,300
All in caps, obviously.

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,980
That would be, yeah — YouTube comments by post.

111
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,520
'u r crap'
Thank you!

112
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,760
That would be post with the word 'LOL' in it.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,700
Yeah.

114
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,880
TOM: Your next one is... jai alai.
MATT: Thatcher!

115
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,140
MATT: The answer's almost always 'Thatcher'.

116
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,660
TOM: Jai alai.

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,780
CHRIS: Fastest ball speed, compared to lacrosse.

118
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,400
[DING]

119
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,980
Absolutely spot on. Knocked it out of the park —

120
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,360
No, no, it bounces off the wall and comes back.

121
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,620
[Laughter]

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
[Applause]

123
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,760
Your next one is... the Impossible Missions Force.

124
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,440
What do they call us on a date night?

125
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,500
[Laughter]

126
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,640
Wow, that makes my answer even worse.
Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare?

127
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,560
Er, no, definitely not.

128
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,140
MATT: 64 newtons.

129
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
The Impossible Missions *Force*, right. Yeah.

130
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,140
TOM: Good... good.

131
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,080
Weak electromagnetic!
Same joke, but whatever.

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,920
No. The abbreviation for that would be IMF.

133
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,440
Where does the post get misdirected if you're
writing to the International Monetary Fund?

134
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,580
[Laughter]

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Anyone who has seen a certain film
is likely to know the answer to this one.

136
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,340
MATT: [Hums 'Mission: Impossible' bassline]

137
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,280
[DING]
GARY: Ahh.

138
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,800
TOM: He's absolutely right. 'What's —'

139
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,640
['Mission: Impossible' melody]
Doodle-doo... doodle-doo...

140
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,220
Doodle-doo... doo-doo.

141
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,380
TOM: He's absolutely ri —
MATT: Doodle-doo... doodle-doo...

142
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,780
[Applause]

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,160
Doodle-doo...!

144
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah. 'What was the name of the agency
from Mission: Impossible?'

145
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,580
The sound-man at the back, he's just
gone cross-eyed and his ears are going red.

146
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,600
Your next one is... Intourist.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,940
What is the worst place to store a bottle of water?

148
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,380
[Laughter]

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,380
Thoop!

150
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,160
It's when it comes out without the cap on...

151
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,820
I store all my water lying down, anyway.

152
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,500
Ohhh!

153
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,520
Where would a Yorkshireman put things 'in the ourist'?

154
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,840
TOM: In t' ourist! Yeah, okay.
GARY: In t'ourist.

155
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,860
No, you would be saying this
in an accent as well, certainly.

156
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,060
He just did!

157
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, okay.

158
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,060
And bear in mind, this is 1984.
They like questions about certain countries here.

159
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,980
GARY: Russia!

160
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,460
TOM: Yes.
GARY: Ohoho.

161
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,080
It is the state-run travel agency of the Soviet Union.

162
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,760
Ahh.

163
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,060
Mandatory tourism!

164
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,260
GARY: In Russia, travel does you.

165
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,240
I can only imagine that you basically went up there,
said 'I'd like to go somewhere,' and they said, 'No.'

166
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,340
[Laughter]

167
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,280
It's like a railway station.
Big blinds they pull down and go,

168
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,900
'NO'... 'NO'... 'NO'... 'POLICE'.

169
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,760
I would like to go on The Holiday.

170
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,900
CHRIS: From what I understand from what I've read,

171
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,400
essentially you went there and you got
your week's allowance of... like, leave.

172
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,920
But because it's leave from the country, in essence,

173
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,200
you got a week in this dacha,
at the place you were told to,

174
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,880
at the time you were told to be there.
And then you returned.

175
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,560
Ahh.

176
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,780
GARY: Butlins then.

177
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,820
[Laughter]

178
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,480
Yeah, but the coats were red.

179
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,620
Yeah.

180
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,360
I have spent one brief holiday in Butlins,
and it is not all it's cracked up to be.

181
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,100
And it's not cracked up to be much.

182
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,480
I was going to say!

183
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,120
I tell you what, when I had a holiday
in Butlins, (A) it was brilliant,

184
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,500
but (B) I was a bit worried by the barbed wire
and guard towers round the edge.

185
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,700
GARY: I'm not joking, there were genuinely guard towers.

186
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,740
Why...?

187
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,080
To stop — I'm not sure if it's to stop
other people getting in, or to stop us getting out.

188
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Why would they?

189
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,960
I don't know!

190
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,820
'Ooh, let's go break into Butlins!'

191
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,060
No, that is absolutely what kids in a small,
boring seaside town would do.

192
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,840
You would absolutely go and break into the Butlins.

193
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,280
They had great slides.

194
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,640
It's just the machine gun
might get you on the way down.

195
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,820
[Laughter]

196
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,360
This is turning dark! So let's move on.

197
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,860
North Butlins and South Butlins!

198
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,480
'Get on the slide!'
[Machine gun noises]

199
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,180
No, no, you've got the breakaway
Republic of Pontins, above.

200
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,360
[Laughter]

201
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,580
Blue coats — red coats. They don't talk. Don't talk.

202
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
Your last question then.

203
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,620
Aww.

204
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,700
Baseball and bridge.

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,560
We are looking for something they have in common.

206
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,060
CHRIS: An extra —
GARY: Bats!

207
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
An extra card in the box.

208
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,140
GARY: The way I play it.

209
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,900
So first of all, that's quite clever, but no.

210
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,680
And secondly, what bat do you use in bridge?!

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
Cricket, and it speeds it up.

212
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,560
[Laughter]

213
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
TOM: That's fair.

214
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,400
Was there ever an iron baseball?

215
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,640
Because you could say both have
been designed by Brunel.

216
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,780
[Laughter]

217
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,220
GARY: 'This ball is superior to all others!' Thonk!

218
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,480
It's also slightly too big for everything else as well.

219
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,360
TOM: Yeah. No, we are looking for terms...

220
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,140
I'll give you a point for one of the terms that is found —

221
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,300
MATT: Terms of endearment?

222
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,040
...in both.

223
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,740
GARY: Can I have a go?

224
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,560
Yeah, go for it.

225
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,260
Rubber?

226
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,460
[DING]
GARY: Thank you...

227
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,540
Absolutely spot on. It's 'Which two games
have both a rubber and a grand slam?'

228
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,920
And that is such a good bit of obscure knowledge that...

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,920
[Applause]

230
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,780
Because I like, despite all the gags,

231
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,100
that we've ended on Gary coming out with a really
obscure bit of knowledge and absolutely nailing it.

232
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,780
MATT: Shall I save this?

233
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,300
[Blows raspberry]

234
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,700
[Laughter]

235
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
Nailed it. Nailed it.

236
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,480
But at the end of that, it is clearly
Chris that wins, so congratulations.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
[Applause]

238
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,640
Congratulations! You win an enclosure in which
underwear is forbidden, run by the star of Face/Off.

239
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:33,980
Really!

240
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
GARY: No! Don't do this!

241
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,140
I've worked it out. Don't do this, Tom!

242
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,940
Gary, take it.

243
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,340
Knickerless Cage?

244
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,260
TOM: It's Nicolas Cage's Knickerless Cage.

245
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,900
[Laughter and applause]

246
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,200
With that, for the final time tonight...

247
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,080
Please give it up for Chris Joel!

248
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
Gary Brannan!

249
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,460
Matt Gray!

250
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,020
TOM: I've been Tom Scott —
MATT: And Tom Scott!

251
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,400
[Cheering]

252
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,680
Thank you! Goodnight!
