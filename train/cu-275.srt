1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,650
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,790
How do you celebrate a Communist takeover?

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,210
By going on vacation and buying lots of souvenirs!

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,240
The Chinese military wants you to know how
awesome it is.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,730
And finally, the most expensive bowl in the
world.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,620
It's worth its weight in Golden Grahams.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,400
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,660
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,320
The Chinese Communist Party knows how to get
on people's good side:

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,270
indoctrinate them from birth.

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,079
And also, give them time off work.

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,880
This week was Golden Week.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,409
An eight-day national holiday

14
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:42,809
that kicks off with the anniversary of when
the Chinese Communist Party

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,840
liberated the people of China...

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,109
from their money...

17
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,159
and their lives.

18
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,829
This week also includes the Mid-Autumn Festival,

19
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,149
a traditional Chinese holiday celebrating
Chinese princess

20
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,940
Chang-e and her voyage to the moon.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,359
Making it part of China's sacred territory
since ancient times.

22
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,399
And Golden Week isn't just about taking time
off work.

23
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,810
It's about travel.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,670
700 million people,

25
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,490
half of China's population,

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,549
are hitting the road,

27
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:13,509
and spending about 90 billion dollars on it.

28
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,909
Did I mention half of all of China is travelling?

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,130
This is what that looks like.

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,370
From scenic spots,

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,430
to train stations.

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,439
Or just taking a selfie with that guy who
killed 100 million people.

33
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,549
And then there's that tourist spot north of
Shanghai

34
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,479
where folks can watch pigs dive into a river!

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,479
That's all it is.

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,289
Time to move on, folks.

37
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:40,259
And among the 700 million Chinese people on
the move,

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,369
more than six million will be going overseas.

39
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,240
The top three tourist destinations are Thailand,

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,219
Japan, and the US.

41
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,640
South Korea, however,

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,590
is no longer the hot tourist destination it
use to be.

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,320
I know what you're thinking,

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,469
but it's not because the Korean 24K gold snail
face masks

45
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,969
aren't as good as they used to be.

46
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,179
It's because the Chinese regime

47
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:04,560
is discouraging citizens from going there,

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,490
because they're super mad that the South Korean
government

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,119
installed that US missile defense system.

50
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,420
There's been a 20% drop in Chinese tourists
in the first half of the year.

51
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,700
But even during the holiday week,

52
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,370
some people were still hard at work.

53
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,010
Like this drug smuggler.

54
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,870
Police busted him carrying 99 grams of methamphetamine.

55
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,870
He was surprised after being arrested,

56
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,870
telling the police:

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,640
"I had thought that you all would be resting

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,069
because of the long holiday

59
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,909
and that I could take advantage of Golden
Week

60
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:32,960
to move some drugs."

61
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,069
How stupid can you be?

62
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,920
What, is this guy on meth or something?

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,950
And you know who else still had to work?

64
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,610
Apparently the people of Xinjiang.

65
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,180
Civil servants, government employees

66
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,709
and some teachers and students,

67
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,409
"had to cancel their holiday plans and work
through October--

68
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,560
including weekends--

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,670
while others were ordered to attend ideology
classes."

70
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,409
Yes, there's no better way to maintain peace

71
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,720
and order in an unstable region,

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,849
by forcing them to watch propaganda films
over the holidays.

73
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:07,030
Then again, I guess I do watch Independence
Day every Fourth of July.

74
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,540
And in a similar vein,

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,110
the Chinese Communist Party knows what people
really want

76
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,830
to do on their Golden Week Holiday.

77
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,830
Watch a documentary on state-run TV

78
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,870
about how awesome the Chinese military is.

79
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,090
Granted, the PLA might not be able to fight
off aliens.

80
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,890
But there's nothing like an eight-episode
documentary

81
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,900
produced by the Political Work Department

82
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,870
of the Central Military Commission

83
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,599
to get me excited for my Golden Week vacation.

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,849
It's better than a movie!

85
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,209
At least, a movie produced by the American
running dogs.

86
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,510
China only allows 34 foreign films a year

87
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,540
to be played inside China.

88
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
And those that do,

89
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,720
only get to keep 25% of their box office revenue.

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,740
Ideally.

91
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,720
But the Motion Picture Association of America

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,040
just audited ticket sales from China

93
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,250
and found they were coming up a little short.

94
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,709
"The audit found that the Chinese ticket sales
from 2016

95
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,599
were underrepresented by about 9%,

96
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,599
amounting to roughly $40 million in lost revenue."

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,230
But despite getting stiffed by China at the
Box Office,

98
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,860
Hollywood considers China a critical market.

99
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,250
Especially since in the US,

100
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,489
people seem to care less and less.

101
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,539
China is the second largest movie market in
the world

102
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,970
and can turn a flop into a success.

103
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,060
Take Transformers: The Last Knight.

104
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,550
In the US, it only earned 45 million dollars

105
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,080
on its opening weekend.

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,530
In China, 120 million.

107
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,810
But hey, even 45 million dollars in the US
isn't bad.

108
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,080
You can do a lot with 45 million dollars.

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,330
Like buy a 900-year-old Chinese bowl.

110
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,460
And still have money left over

111
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,120
to buy a giant house in the suburbs.

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,310
Or a tiny condo in Manhattan.

113
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,919
This bowl comes from the Northern Song Dynasty.

114
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,400
But...I still think it was a bit overpriced.

115
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,090
I mean, you could have gotten this one

116
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,180
from Bloomingdale's for just $12.99.

117
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,389
And then had even more money left over

118
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,580
to buy a huge mansion in the 'burbs

119
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,550
with swimming pools, tennis courts,

120
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,199
and a 12 car garage.

121
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,430
Or a 1-bedroom condo in Manhattan.

122
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,090
But supposedly what makes this Song Dynasty
bowl so great

123
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,900
is the ice crackle style used to make it.

124
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,280
That's where cracks form during the cooling
process.

125
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,000
I wish I had known about that in my high school
ceramics class.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Instead of getting an F,

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,699
I could have been a millionaire.

128
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,750
900 years from now.

129
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,750
What do you think?

130
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,750
Leave your comments below.

131
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,750
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

132
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,039
Once again I'm Chris Chappell.

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
See you next time.

134
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,560
You know how I'd spend my Golden Week?

135
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,380
By staying indoors and watching

136
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,039
full half hour episodes of China Uncensored
for free,

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,610
at ChinaUncensored.tv.

138
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,020
The best part is,

139
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,750
unlike Youtube,

140
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,570
our website's not censored in China.

141
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,270
Don't tell anyone.

142
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,680
And for your next National Day celebration,

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,510
go to ChinaUncensored.tv.
