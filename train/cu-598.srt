00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,910
On this episode of China Uncensored, people
who walk on glass bridges shouldn't throw

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,810
stones... or mugs.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:15,940
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell. You know, many great

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,570
feats of man have been brought low by the
simplest of things.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,170
The mighty walls of Helms Deep—destroyed
by a single orc.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,199
The proud Death Star—annihilated by a single
space wizard.

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,250
And the mighty Samuel L Jackson…

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:41,629
Now, everyone knows that 'made in China' and
'quality' go hand in hand, in the same way

9
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:47,719
that 'one more drink' and 'good decisions'
do. That's why tourists felt confident in

10
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,379
the safety of this glass walk way, built thirty-five
hundred feet in the air along China's Yuntai

11
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,070
Mountain Scenic Spot.

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,190
I mean, wouldn't you walk on it? It even got
the approval of Chinese officials, known for

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,930
their trustworthiness, who told people it
was exceptionally safe. It was after all three

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:14,280
quarters of an inch thick and treated to resist
not just bending, but shattering as well.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,770
So what could go wrong?!

16
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,210
Well, apparently it shattered.

17
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,270
But only a little bit according to park officials
who admitted to finding "a small amount of

18
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,020
cracks." Or a terrifying amount, according
to a female tourist who said on social media

19
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,150
that there was a loud bang and everybody was
screaming. The social media post has been

20
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,930
removed. So really, who knows?

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,490
But one thing's clear: She posted this photo
of it on Weibo...which is really unclear.

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:49,040
So no one is quite sure exactly how much this
very, very high up glass bridge cracked after

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
less than a month of being open to the public.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,170
But how could engineers have foreseen the
cataclysmic event that would humble their

25
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,490
efforts? According to the People's Daily Online,
one of the tourists dropped a stainless steel

26
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,450
mug on it. How can you plan for that?! Next
you'll be telling me the Titanic should have

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,069
had more lifeboats on deck "just in case."
As if you could predict the sinking of an

28
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,060
unsinkable ship.

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,129
And anyway this kind of thing happens all
the time, the Chinese park management reassured

30
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:27,120
people. Back in 2014, a glass beer bottle
shattered one layer of glass on the walkway

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,390
at London's Tower Bridge... Which to be fair,
I wouldn't be walking on in the first place,

32
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,010
given the notorious reputation for London
bridges falling down, falling down.

33
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,730
The bridge in Yuntai Mountain has been closed
for now. But soon they'll open it back up

34
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,470
to the public again. Do you think you'll be
visiting? It's a great view! Let me know in

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,940
the comments below. Once again I'm Chris Chappell,
see you next time.

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:05,599
Ah! Great shoot, guys! Well done! (Boom)

37
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,450
If after watching that, you still want to
walk on the Yuntai Mountain glass bridge,

38
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,090
then you might be the kind of person who would
also participate in the most dangerous boat

39
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,800
race in the world. Check it out on Seeker
Daily.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,390
You see this? That’s China building its
first homemade aircraft carrier,

41
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,140
called the Type 001A.
