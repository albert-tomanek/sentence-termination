China Sells Killer Drones to Iraq

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,620
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,929
Earlier in the year,

6
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:19,500
China sold an "unknown number" of combat drones
to the Iraqi military.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,510
The Iraqi Ministry of Defense released this
video showing one of these Chinese-made drones.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:31,410
Here, it's firing an anti-tank missile at
what is allegedly an ISIS target.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,739
Ahhh, ISIS: bringing the world together...against
you.

10
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,670
These Chinese drones,

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,649
the CH-4B model,

12
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,530
have a range of more than 3,000 miles.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,820
And they can fire on targets up to 3 miles
away.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,870
And if a few of them get shot down, who cares?

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,170
They were made in China.

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,059
Actually, the purchases from China are part
of a broader effort by the Iraqi military

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,199
diversify their suppliers.

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,219
Over the past year,

19
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,189
Iraq has also bought weapons from Russia and
Iran.

20
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,390
It seems they don't want to just rely on the
US.

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,299
Well that's some thank you for all that liberation
and freedom we gave them.

22
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,020
But this is also a move by the Chinese regime

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,270
to grab a bigger share of the,

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,509
I guess you would call it,

25
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:21,450
killer drone market.

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,640
China is already the world's largest manufacture
of drones,

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,350
a realm of technological warfare that used
to be the sole domain of the US and Israel.

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,590
China's success is in producing cheaper, lower
tech models.

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,710
According to an analysis by Air Force World,
their drones follow the same concept behind

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,390
the AK47

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,020
instead of going for high tech,

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,729
they go for what's simple and easy to use.

33
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:49,290
And, of course, cheap.

34
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,570
Now drones have become the weapon of choice
for counter terrorist operations.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,140
ISIS doesn't have much in the way of air defense.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,399
So drones can easily cross international borders
and attack targets.

37
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,479
Which is of course one reason why they're
the subject of so many thorny diplomatic and

38
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,360
human rights questions.

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,620
So what do you think about China taking a
piece of the armed drone market in Iraq?

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,879
Will China's drones replace US drones?
