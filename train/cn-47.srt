1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,170
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're
playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,070
Joining me today, he reads books you know,
it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,660
Hello!

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,320
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,740
Ultra-pure.

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,900
Silver plated.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,469
And available from Lidl.

8
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,409
Is that just you? Are you just describing
yourself there?

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,140
I don't want to know which bit's silver-plated!

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,869
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray!

11
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:21,539
Putting the butt into butter.

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,119
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it.

13
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,539
Every fact they get right is a point and a
ding [DING]

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,059
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers, which is...

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,460
And today we are talking about BackpackersXpress.

16
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,860
Vwhoomph!

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,400
Oh, it would be doing that, yes.

18
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,490
Is it named because you can avoid them?

19
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,920
Literally the opposite.

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,370
Named so you can find them!

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,140
You're obliged to touch them! All the time
on the journey.

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,540
"Welcome to the Backpackers' Express!

23
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,230
"Sit on a backpacker's lap! Have him feel
you up from behind!"

24
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,840
You are actually slightly closer than you
may think there,

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,510
so I'm actually going to give you a point.
[DING]

26
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,220
So is this just a dating site for backpackers?

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,580
No, definitely not a dating site.

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,100
Definitely a form of transport.

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,280
Is it a bus?

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,960
No.

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,280
Is it two buses?

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,920
No.

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,200
Is it a train?

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,060
No!

35
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,480
Is it a tuk-tuk?

36
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,900
You're all thinking a bit too small and too
short-haul here.

37
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,089
Is it a gigantic camel?

38
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,240
Is it the overnight flight from Europe to...
eastern... climes?

39
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:26,920
Yeah, I'll give you a point. [DING] It was
the idea of doing

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,329
that sort of flight for backpackers.

41
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,829
It's the "gap yah" trip.

42
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,060
It is the "gap yah" trip. Yes.

43
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,740
So would there be hold luggage
or no hold luggage?

44
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,940
-- Well, this...
-- No holds barred!

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,939
Wrestling in mid-air!

46
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,369
Just to be clear, this is not just the name
of a flight,

47
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,060
this was going to be an airline.

48
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,240
Oh, that'll be the s***iest most run-down
plane you've ever seen

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,639
twanging up to the
edge of the runway, won't it?

50
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,099
All painted up on the side.

51
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,399
-- Old DC-3 done in graffiti!
-- Yeah!

52
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,779
They will have come up
with this idea before 2006.

53
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:03,920
Right, so Gary's getting a point for 'old
planes' [DING]

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,079
they were going to sub-lease them,

55
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,789
and you're definitely getting a point for
'06 [DING], it was 2003.

56
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:09,390
Why do you think that?

57
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,560
Because it was about 2006-2008 where all of
the airlines went dead,

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,189
because no-one had any money.

59
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:19,250
Yes, that's pretty much right. In fact, you're
going to have a point,

60
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,099
the answer was it closed down in 2005.

61
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,540
Is this the kind of airline where your seat
allocation would say 'rear gunner',

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,400
that kind of thing?

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,879
It was going to be Boeing 747s, they were
actually going that far.

64
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,390
-- Okay, okay.
-- Ooh!

65
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,890
What would you want if you were a backpacker
on an airplane?

66
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,629
Really, really, really cheap.

67
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:41,500
Yes. [DING]

68
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,439
Yes. Two ticket types: in and out!

69
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,439
What's out? Strap them to the wing?

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,980
Really, really intense!

71
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,960
Strapping you to the wing with duct tape?

72
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,400
To be fair, wing walking is a thing, but I
think it's normally...

73
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:54,989
Twelve hour wing walk!

74
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,109
It's not on a jet engine, is what I'm saying!

75
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:01,060
First-come, first-serve. Just a big space,
rip all the seats out,

76
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,349
pile 'em in, have it on a
weight thing, it's like,

77
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,459
"right, we are now full,
you're on the next one. Go!"

78
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:09,900
Big pile of backpackers, even in the hold.

79
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,579
Yeah, I'm guessing it's no-frills, bring your
own food, kinda stuff.

80
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,680
See, that's not... I'm going to give Chris
the point [DING],

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
it was certainly cheap, pack-'em-in, put
'em all together,

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
essentially a bus...

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,420
-- Like an Air-bus(!)
-- If only!

84
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:25,829
There were some other things
they were thinking of,

85
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,829
and it wasn't that kind of
no-frills, bring-your-own-food.

86
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,640
Oh no. It is tedious things that people...

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,980
I'm going to insult people who go backpacking
now, brace yourselves.

88
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,180
It it things that tedious people who might've
gone backpacking might enjoy,

89
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,109
so like crafts and things like that?

90
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,260
Hemp seating!

91
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,340
Yeah. Opportunities to exchange long stories
about just how ethnic you got

92
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,849
when you were out there
and off the tourist trail you went.

93
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,529
Y'all have some very nice stereotypes of backpackers.

94
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,849
-- I'm right!
-- I'm going to give you a point
[DING] for stereotypes of backpackers...

95
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:55,739
No, you've got the good side of backpackers.

96
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,749
Don't go through customs?...

97
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,950
Oh-oh! Yeah.

98
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,319
Erm, it's certainly something to do with what
you get duty free there.

99
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,819
Smuggling anything you want?

100
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,760
"We're still three miles out, get down the
rest of your joint,

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,829
"this is your captain speaking..."

102
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,810
-- Oh, is it free booze?
-- Oh, that's a point!

103
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,090
It's not free booze,
but I'll give you the point [DING]

104
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,690
it was having a small pub on board. The airline
was going to have an official...

105
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,820
Brewery!

106
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,640
Brewery! Spot on! [DING] Not even... I thought
you were going to go for beer,

107
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,900
but brewery was exactly right, have a point.

108
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,580
Well, 747-400s when they first came in, the
top deck was...

109
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,770
-- It was a cocktail bar, wasn't it?
-- A cocktail bar, yeah!

110
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,180
It was the kind of place that people like
David Frost

111
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,969
would lounge about and philander in mid-air.

112
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,380
Mid-air philanderer!

113
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,960
That's a fair point! What are -- you know
you've got, like, international waters?

114
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,910
Where once you get outside... is
it a five-mile limit or something?

115
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,440
-- It's three miles.
-- Three mile limit.

116
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,460
You can do whatever thou wilst, 'cos you're
in international waters,

117
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,470
right, hence pirate radio. What are the laws
when you're in the air?

118
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,410
Well, the three-mile coastal waters thing is how
far you could hit someone with a big ol' cannon.

119
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,460
-- Right.
-- From back in the day.

120
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,210
So if you extrapolate that you end up with
all sorts of worrying things

121
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,920
like ground-to-air missiles!

122
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,440
So I can answer this. It's the 1944 Convention
on International Civil Aviation:

123
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,550
"all aircraft have the nationality of the
state in which they are registered".

124
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,539
-- Aha.
-- So if you're on a US flag-carrying
plane, you can't drink under 21.

125
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:21,919
-- Ah, okay!
-- If you're an Australian one, you can't drink...

126
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,440
I thought births were registered over the
country that you're over?

127
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,639
If you have a birth outside,
in international waters,

128
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,670
your birth location is listed as "at sea".

129
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,849
-- Yes it is.
-- Nice.

130
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,630
And if you're on a plane, it can be listed
as "in the air".

131
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,210
Those are valid entries on birth certificates.

132
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,830
I have seen a baptism entry, 1780s I think,

133
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,350
where the place of birth was given
as the lat and long.

134
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,000
-- Wow!
-- That's cool.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
-- The child was called Atlantica.
-- That's nice. That's nice.

136
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,270
And we checked the lat and long and it did
come roughly in the middle of the Atlantic.

137
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,830
BackpackersXpress was going to be an airline
with a pub on board

138
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,210
where backpackers would get cheap tickets
and go over

139
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,139
and presumably anyone not wanting to be associated
with a load of backpackers...

140
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,450
Would get a different flight!

141
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,449
-- Go on a different airline, yeah!
-- Different flight, yes.

142
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,530
The air crew would encourage
passengers to socialise.

143
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,699
-- Oh, f*** off!
-- Oh, f*** off!

144
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,719
Spot the British people!

145
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,520
-- No way, no...
-- Gotta love a bit of enforced fun.

146
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,770
Oh no, they'd have getting-to-know-you games
while you were on the tarmac, wouldn't they?

147
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,539
I've done a bus... when I was lot younger,

148
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,460
I did that backpackers' bus through the
Australian Outback, and it's horrible.

149
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,900
Oh, f*** off! Honestly!

150
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,610
Did you have top bants(?)

151
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,150
No! No, I didn't.

152
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,110
-- They didn't exist back then!
-- That's fair.

153
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,479
You were yet to become the Archbishop of Banterbury
that you would later be!

154
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,110
God, it's like... the bus driver playing music
over the thing and saying,

155
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,340
"right, well these are the actions
you should do!"

156
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,409
These are the actions you're f***ing doing!

157
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,460
These are the actions... there we go!

158
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,569
How long would that flight be? It'd be a good
eight, nine hours, wouldn't it?

159
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,639
-- Eternity!
-- But it would feel like you
were there forever. Just people...

160
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,870
And it's a 24-hour flight from London anyway!

161
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,639
I would go on that airline only if there was
a dedicated misanthropes' cabin at the front.

162
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,370
That... that... that's generally called first
class on most airlines, Gary.

163
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,419
But on this one, not so much.

164
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,460
No, I'd be quite happy with access to the
pub and everything else,

165
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,310
as long as I didn't have
to talk to anyone else!

166
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,500
Again, that is first class. You're literally
describing first class there.

167
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,190
The beds on airplanes I'm most interested
in are the crew ones.

168
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,330
It depends on the plane but a lot of them
are right in the nose,

169
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,449
directly below the flight deck.

170
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,930
Yep. And if you're on an A380, they have two
and a half decks.

171
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,180
There is another half deck up in the very
top of the plane,

172
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,860
with half-height... you can crawl in
and get sleep there.

173
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,960
I want that one! I'd be fine with that!

174
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,780
No you wouldn't, 'cos you're
going to be down there,

175
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,480
and then you're going to get up and whack
your head on the thing.

176
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,010
Yeah, but I'm not with them
f***ing backpackers, am I?!

177
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,060
That's... not unreasonable!

178
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,800
So what you're advocating actually is that
you'll sleep in the wheel well if necessary?

179
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,500
Yeah! I'm not with them!

180
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,040
That's not... I think previous news incidents
have declared

181
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
that is not a good place to sleep!

182
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,840
That is a good place to freeze, die, and fall
out into someone's back yard.

183
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,620
I'm not with them, am I though?!

184
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,719
Backpackers. Freezing to death. Back...

185
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,729
Everybody round this table is going, "you
know what, that is a bit of a tough choice".

186
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,220
So what did some of the industry experts,

187
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,569
looking at this airline's plans,
what did they say?

188
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,569
"It's just going to be a tin can
full of arseholes at 30,000 feet."

189
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:31,400
Yes. What was the media term for "tin full
of arseholes at 30,000 feet"?

190
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,950
Sounds like he's nailed it to me, to be fair!

191
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,700
If you can define it better,
I'd love to hear it!

192
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,060
Get angry in a car, what do you call it?

193
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,800
Road rage!

194
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,269
What do you call it in a plane?

195
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,029
-- Air rage!
-- Air rage. Have a point [DING]

196
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,801
-- Creative!
-- Yes.

197
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:48,620
"Disruptive or violent behaviour perpetrated
on an aircraft."

198
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,420
I actually have the first case
of air rage here,

199
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,920
and I'll give you a point if you can roughly
guess the year.

200
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,089
Is it ridiculously early? Is it like 1915
when two pilots have a dust-up in mid-air?

201
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:01,949
I was going to say, I seem to remember this
chap called the Red Baron

202
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:04,220
upset quite a lot of people...

203
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,100
Not between planes,
I mean like gunner and pilot...

204
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,100
No, it has to be on a passenger plane.

205
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,060
-- Sixties.
-- 1920s.

206
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,060
Yeah. That's going to be closest. Stuff like
the little twin engine De Havilland,

207
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,990
when there's just 16 people getting high on...

208
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,550
Going between London and Paris,
stuff like that.

209
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,430
Getting hammered on marg... not margaritas,
what's the phrase I'm looking for? Martinis.

210
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,149
-- Yeah.
-- So when are you saying?

211
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,310
Ah, 30s. De Havilland.

212
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,290
1938, Neville Chamberlain's
flight back from Germany.

213
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,769
You said 30s first, I'm going to give it you.
It was actually the 40s,

214
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,850
1947, on a flight from Havana to Miami. [DING]

215
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,870
It was simply a drunk man assaulting a passenger
and biting a flight attendant.

216
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,320
Bite attendant!

217
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,100
Ahh! I'm sure that person
appreciated the gag,

218
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,140
as you stood there with your martini behind...

219
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,240
-- "I think you'll find...!"
-- "Bite attendant!"

220
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,740
"This isn't helping!"

221
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,560
Which led to the second incident of air rage!

222
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,780
Which is a flight attendant glassing someone!

223
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,800
That whole plane lands
full of fight-injured people!

224
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
Well, this goes back to
something we said earlier,

225
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,790
because they didn't know
whose jurisdiction it was in,

226
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,560
no-one at the landing area
really wanted to prosecute,

227
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,080
and they frequently
got away with it.

228
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:17,050
And it eventually came to be that the laws
of the country

229
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,170
where the aircraft was registered take precedence.

230
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,589
Has the thing happened with planes like has
happened with boats,

231
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,000
where they're registered in tax havens?

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's a fair point, I was wondering that
myself just then.

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,079
It's difficult to do that for most airlines,

234
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,190
because they want to be the flag carrier,

235
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,320
and they want to be registered in a...

236
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
British Airways wants to be
registered in the UK.

237
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,320
There are still a lot of
national flag carriers up there.

238
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,660
So if I wanted to have a mid-air fight club
with no repercussions...?

239
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,800
-- Aeroflot.
-- I was going to say, what is
the best country to register my plane?

240
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,839
Air Astana!

241
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,339
Yeah! Like, Cayman Islands
or something like that?

242
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,980
That's if you want to avoid tax. If you want
to avoid being punished for hitting someone,

243
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,500
I think there are very few jurisdictions
which simultaneously

244
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,700
don't have a law against that
and can register a plane!

245
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm going to say this; somewhere out there,
there's some rich bloke

246
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,430
who's investigating that right now.

247
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,360
That's true. "What can we do in international
waters? Oh, I don't know!"

248
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,810
Oh, I could break a really good
superinjunction right now,

249
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,700
but I'm not going to. I really could.

250
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,140
You could, but I'd have to edit it out anyway.

251
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,760
Well,

252
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,920
Er, so BackpackersXpress never actually got
to that point!

253
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,079
-- Good.
-- They never actually managed to
lease any aircraft...

254
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,110
Wow, that's the first
stumbling block, isn't it?

255
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,929
They never even really got enough funding.
What did the industry think of them?

256
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,579
-- There were just massive arseholes!
-- Not much!

257
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,970
The Times phrased it as "it seems doubtful
to any sane observer

258
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,350
"whether the project will ever
get off the ground."

259
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,560
I didn't realise, as I read that, that was
literal and metaphorical...

260
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,810
And that is a joke from the Times of London!

261
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,060
And that the 'party in the sky' was,
and I'm quoting directly here, a "radical move".

262
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,200
-- Not in the 90s "radical" sense, just in...
-- No!

263
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,050
And I think as the Times goes...

264
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,750
-- It's like saying "well that's brave". 
- Yes.

265
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,370
I've just realised: is this the Venga Plane?

266
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,600
This is actually Venga Airways, isn't it?!

267
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,500
It bloody is!

268
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,320
-- Sorry!
-- Oh, we like to party!

269
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,180
You've just remembered the songs, haven't
you? It's in there...

270
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
No, fortunately I don't know the words!

271
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,300
So are they doing a
New York to San Francisco run?

272
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,100
-- There we go! That was the Vengabus.
-- That was the bus.

273
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,699
That was the bus. No, the plane
was going to Ibiza. The plane always...

274
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,440
-- Oh, god, now I remember!
-- Yes, you're quite right!

275
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,180
It was going to Ibiza.

276
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,000
No matter the mode of transport, it's always
an Intercity Disco.

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,510
No, wait, no that was the train.

278
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,130
No, that was the bus!
That was definitely the bus!

279
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,300
-- Yes, but Intercity's a type of train.
-- Okay.

280
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,480
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Get out!

281
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,540
Some trains did use to have a disco carriage.

282
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,080
-- I'm not joking.
-- In the 70s?

283
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,760
-- Yes! In the 70s.
-- What?!

284
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,700
In the 70s, some special trains, especially
Football Special trains,

285
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:54,310
BR would put on a...

286
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,329
This is the train for all the football supporters,

287
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:59,250
so that the commuters weren't
bothered by the football supporters.

288
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,170
Just a sec! This is the BackpackersXpress
but for footballers on trains?

289
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,040
It's for, basically, if you're going
somewhere for a match,

290
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,139
you would charter a whole Football Special
train, that is s***ty old carriages,

291
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,250
so everyone's corralled in one place, the
police know when you arrive,

292
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,440
but on the back of it they would put an empty
freight car, effectively,

293
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,660
with a disco in it!
And you'd have the disco carriage.

294
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,860
They used to have a pub carriage
on the Southern...

295
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,570
-- Blimey!
-- They put a carriage, and they'd
fitted out inside like a country pub!

296
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,560
-- Fantastic.
-- But it had no windows, that was the problem,

297
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,579
-- because they'd put pub seating in.
-- It's a shipping container!

298
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,260
They'd put seating down the side, so you had
no idea where you were

299
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,060
when the pub... when the train stopped!

300
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,230
Also, do you really want that many drunk people

301
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,600
who can't see outside on a swaying train?

302
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
It was for commuters! It was for people going
home on a Friday night,

303
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,930
they'd put the pub carriage on.

304
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, that's belting!

305
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,579
There is no better way to guarantee you'll
end up at the terminus by accident.

306
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,139
I know! But it was proper country pub, dimpled
pint glasses, hand-pulled booze, the lot.

307
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,539
-- Fantastic! -- Great idea.

308
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,160
That's actually not a bad plan.
I mean, it's now a bad plan,

309
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,160
because you can't fit that many people in
there, and...

310
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,440
I don't know, if you make it obviously a civilised,

311
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,350
you are going to have one dimpled pint,
kind of real ale pub,

312
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,590
it probably polices itself!

313
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,740
-- Copper-topped tables, yeah!
-- Fireplace!

314
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,340
-- Fireplace?!
-- Yeah! I think it had a fireplace!

315
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,120
I'm not joking. It's a steam train.

316
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
I was going to say, let's face it, if it's
fired by steam,

317
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,870
it's not the least likely thing you could
put on there.

318
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,790
Yeah! It's already got a big fire
at the front of it,

319
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,630
stick a little one in the middle, it's fine!

320
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,300
Hey, great way to get it lit as well!

321
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,139
Shovel the coals straight from the firebox!

322
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,410
It's true, that's how travel used to be, kids.

323
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,329
Is it the end of the sliding scale, though?

324
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:40,279
So you have the dining car, then there'll
be like a snacking car,

325
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,610
then they'll have a soft drinks car,
then you've got the pub car,

326
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,060
and then you've got the
club at the end of the night car.

327
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,019
Imagine that! Roll out off the end
of the club car

328
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,099
into the kebab van car at the back!

329
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,959
Which is just a trailer being dragged along.

330
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,800
"Salad and sauce?!"

331
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,360
But it's a steam-powered
rotatey-thing for the...

332
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,040
"Chuck some more coals in!" "Fine!"

333
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,820
Thing is, it's not actually
cooking the meat with coals,

334
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,509
that's just providing the power for the
electric grill that's rotating the meat...

335
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,509
That's a great idea.
Oh, come on BR, make it happen.

336
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:19,680
BR! There hasn't been BR for years!

337
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,300
Congratulations Chris, you win this one!

338
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,660
Fantastic!

339
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,660
Congratulations, today's prize is French.

340
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,959
-- Oh aye?
-- Oui oui!

341
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,219
You win chocolate icing
in the shape of a cow.

342
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,250
It's la vache ganache.

343
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,990
You nearly got there in time on
that one Matt, well done.

344
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,020
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel,

345
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,260
Gary Brannan,

346
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,359
-- Matt Gray.
-- Goodbye, YouTube.

347
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,820
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time.

348
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
