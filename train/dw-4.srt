1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,200
This is uh representing the earth.

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,300
and this represents, what do you think?

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,990
The moon?

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,400
Yes. now our first challenge is how far apart
are they

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
like, roughly

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,300
like roughly, about that much?

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,200
Okay.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,900
Uh... I guess maybe about that far? maybe?

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,800
About that far? Yeah, yeah
maybe.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,400
Roughly? Okay.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,500
about like that?

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,470
im guessing yeah

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,859
this far but then it's like here
somewhere

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,630
rough right there and steal all right
let's let's say stand here

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,630
ok tonight yeah yeah great

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,950
scene with panels in here ok

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,000
these are some images i found on a
google image search for the earth and

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,890
the moon diagrams that are not to scale
are pretty common and I understand why

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,600
we make them so you can show the detail
without showing all that  uninteresting

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,670
space in between but they can have a
problematic effect on learning because

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,119
they give people the wrong idea about
the relative proximity of things

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,270
now if we want to talk about the
distance between the Earth and the moon

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,800
yeah it's actually about here

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,740
think about this it takes like one
second to go from the earth to the moon

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,590
takes eight minutes for light to travel
to the Sun and four years to go to our

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,970
nearest star and then consider that
there are a hundred billion stars in our

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,420
galaxy and as far as we know a hundred
billion galaxies in the universe the

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,009
universe truly is bigger than we can
imagine and certainly bigger than we can

29
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:44,640
draw it to scale
