This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

it's Chris Joel.

Please let us know if you spot the secret
shamanist message in this show.

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,720
" 'Eezer goode."

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,680
Oh! F*** that.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,280
That is the most reluctant clap
I have ever heard for an introduction.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,240
Matt, they're going to sound like
they're at gunpoint.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
In front of me, I've got an article from
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,880
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,680
and there's a special prize
for particularly good answers which is:

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,400
Oh, they're in tune tonight.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,120
And today we are talking about a hail cannon.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,040
Is it a cannon that shoots hail?

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
No.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,880
Did this belong to Ming the Merciless?

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,520
"Klytus, I'm bored.
What plaything can you offer me today?"

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
"A vibrator, or a cannon that shoots hail."

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,720
Are you using those for the same thing?

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,640
Because wow.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,120
I was about to say,
that's a very weird version of Flash Gordon

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,640
but there literally is a parody of…
of Flash Gordon.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,320
-That would be Flesh Gordon.
-Yes.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Which went around at my school like hotcakes,
let me tell you.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,960
The hail cannon does not shoot hail.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,840
Is it a "meteorological event"?

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,800
-Ooh!
-Why did I say that like Michael Gambon?

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,600
"Izzita-meteorological-event?"

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,040
Is it something like cloud seeding?

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,920
Ooh.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,320
So a hail cannon might be something you set off
from a plane into the clouds

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
to make hail happen.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,360
[TOGETHER] Why would you want that?

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,720
Now in stereo.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm giving…
I'm giving biscuits there for two reasons.

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,960
First, stereo,
and secondly, that is a very good question.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,040
The hail cannon does not create hailstones,
you wouldn't want that.

42
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,960
What would you want?

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,360
Does it stop hailstones?
Does it slush them?

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,160
It is a shockwave generator
claimed to disrupt the formation of hailstones.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,600
Ooh! Ooh!

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,240
You look surprised by this, Chris.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
-No.
-Either that or you've just sat on yourself.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
"Ooh, me hailstones!"

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,840
Well, they've been shattered.

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,520
Was this first discovered when Brian Blessed
climbed Mount Everest

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,200
in that a loud enough shockwave
which shatter water?

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,320
"Stop that, I'm camping!"

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,680
Oh, it's just a big bang, so it is just a
cannon that makes a big loud thing,

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,760
and then the big loud thing makes the hail go,
"No, I'm not going to be hail anymore."

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Apparently, yes.

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
What, 'I'm going back up'?

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,560
It just looks like a big cone with a box
at the bottom of it.

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,680
What do they put in the box?

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,360
A man's part, then slam the lid shut.

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,080
Oh! Oh, that'll get a loud noise, that would.

61
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,400
That would get a very loud noise.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,820
Acetylene and oxygen.

63
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,200
Hang on a minute, is this farting into clouds?

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,240
I've talked about this before.

65
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,600
-I still think it was a good...
-Yes, but you meant you had your arse

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,840
against a plane window
and were hoping for the best.

67
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,520
Yeah, but in the service of humanity.

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,100
It's basically a contained
'boomph' of an explosion,

69
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,920
And then all that force gets projected
up into the sky.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,440
-It's a airzooka.
-Yeah.

71
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,400
I'm being hesitant about saying
that's what it's doing.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,880
Has no one ever actually done it?

73
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,380
Lots of people have done it.

74
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,880
These are installed in a lot of places.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,560
Has no one measured their success?

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,120
-I mean…
-"Never been cited in a peer reviewed journal."

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Oh, just because it's never hailed
after that's happened

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,680
doesn't mean it was going to hail
to begin with.

79
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
Because you can't tell.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,880
There has been a review,

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,720
which is why I didn't give you a point for
'Has no one done the research?'

82
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,640
They have done the research
and the results were...?

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,240
Inconclusive.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
No, pretty conclusive.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
-Didn't work?
-Yes.

86
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,160
People are firing massive amounts

87
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,600
of explosive gases in the air
to create a massive boom,

88
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
for no f***ing reason at all.

89
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,840
-Yes.
-I love our race.

90
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,320
There is another reason to doubt it.

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,960
What else happens near hailstorms

92
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,360
that would be a heck of a lot more powerful
than one of these cannons?

93
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,840
Brian Blessed, skydiving.

94
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,320
-Planes?
-Thunderbolts and lightning.

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,380
-Correct.
[TOGETHER] -Very, very frightening.

96
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,160
F***!

97
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,080
At least that one was vaguely scripted.

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,880
Which does bring me to something
called a cloud buster.

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,280
Oh, now, this was a song by Kate Bush.

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Oh! Oh! Gary.

101
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,040
Thank you.

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,440
It was, this was the device that inspired
the Kate Bush song, Cloudbusting.

103
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,240
'I'm running up that hill, I'm something,
something, something else,'

104
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,760
but it's about the man runs up a hill and is he
like a scientist who's arrested at the end?

105
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,080
I'm remembering the video
more than the actual facts here.

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,480
You say scientist,
the man's name was Wilhelm Reich.

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,800
He was Austrian and a psychoanalyst.

108
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,520
So not innately qualified to do weather.

109
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,360
No. No.

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,960
And the cloud buster
wasn't like the hail cannon.

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,280
It had a very different intent.

112
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,320
To make it rain?

113
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,760
To make it rain by doing what?

114
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,920
Did they lob dogs named Buster
up into the clouds?

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Did they lob copies of the 1980s film about the
Great Train Robbery, 'Buster', into the air?

116
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,840
-Do you want to be the third one on this, Chris...
-No.

117
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,960
No, okay.

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,200
Okay. No.

119
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,760
It was a series of parallel hollow metal tubes
at the end.

120
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,920
Tubular bells?

121
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Flexible hoses
and then those are placed in water.

122
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,960
Is he shooting water into a cloud
to make it rain?

123
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
No, I've just described the entire thing,
you've got…

124
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,000
-It's just a thing sat there?
-Some tubes, some hoses

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,800
and some water and it claims to manipulate
something called orgone energy.

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,580
Oh!

127
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,800
It's bollocks.

128
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes, it is.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,880
O-R-G-O-N-E, it might be 'org-own' or 'org-on'.

130
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,440
It literally has a mark in Wikipedia here,
it says

131
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
'Orgone: pronunciation?'

132
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
No one knows.

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,440
And then it says it is a pseudoscientific concept

134
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,000
and there are seven references
after the word 'pseudoscientific'.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
There's been some arguments here.

136
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Officially bollocks.

137
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,560
What is orgone energy supposed to be?

138
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,600
It's the chi version but for weather.

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, it's a bit further than that.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Is it supposed to be the equivalent
of whatever dark matter is?

141
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Is it some kind of surrounding force
that holds water in?

142
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,960
It's actually, it's not just to do with water.

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,240
Is it a life force, is it a binding life force?

144
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,640
Yes, it is essentially
the Force from Star Wars.

145
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,520
It is an esoteric energy,
a hypothetical universal life force.

146
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,360
And by putting a vibraphone into some water
via some hoses, I can make the Force cry.

147
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,400
What you have done there, Gary,
is just give the best…

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,480
the best summing up of the cloud buster
that I think I've ever heard.

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
(Kate Bush, call me.)

150
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,960
This is moving back now to actually trying
to make rain.

151
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,680
This is not orgone and the cloud buster,
this is the US military.

152
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,080
And they created Operation Popeye,
1967 to 1972.

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,880
Any ideas where that might have been?

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,760
-Vietnam.
-Yes, absolutely right.

155
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Why might the US military during
the Vietnam War, have wanted to make rain?

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,880
-Is this Napalm?
-No. No, this is literal rain.

157
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,240
Is it to kind of drive them out of the jungle
because it's so very wet,

158
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,120
-and horrible and they don't like it anymore?
-No.

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,640
Is it to wash off all the Agent Orange
that they've used to poison the entire country?

160
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,360
Ooh.

161
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,560
Is it to get Agent Orange into the rainfall

162
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,640
and then use that to drop it
rather than the aeroplanes?

163
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,880
No, it's actually,
it's more of a tactic about logistics.

164
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,080
Well, to make the roads muddy?

165
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,520
-Yes.
-So they can't move things around.

166
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,800
Yes, soften the road surfaces,
cause landslides, wash out river crossings.

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
And one other thing
about the climate in Vietnam.

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
-Make it very humid and therefore…
-It already is.

169
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,880
-It already is, isn't it?
-What happens there,

170
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
-about certain times of the year?
-Monsoon season.

171
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:21,300
Yes. The idea was to extend monsoon season,
with the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron.

172
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,680
Who had a slogan, and it was, it ended with the
words 'Not war'.

173
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,640
-What were the first two?
-Make rain.

174
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,200
'Make something, not war.'

175
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
-Water.
-Wet?

176
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Okay, you've got the rain,
you've got the ground, you put them together.

177
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Slippery.

178
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,840
-Make slippery, not war?
-Yes.

179
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,360
Yes, sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

180
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,760
'Make mud, not war' was their slogan.

181
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,600
But weren't they making mud to make war?

182
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
-Yes.
-No!

183
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,380
They conducted 50 experiments in the
Laos Panhandle.

184
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,600
And the government of Laos,
what did they think about this?

185
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,280
Did they not even notice
because nothing happened?

186
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,080
You're close, but no.

187
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,040
Were they annoyed that they were flying about
all that and then nothing happened?

188
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,880
-No. No, they weren't annoyed by it at all.
-Did they like it because it watered their crops-

189
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,600
-No, they didn't like it either.
-Did they notice?

190
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
They weren't actually even told about it.

191
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
-Cheeky.
-The US government just decided to fly over

192
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,000
and seed some clouds with lead iodide
and silver iodide.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Oh! Oh, they're bad.

194
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,280
-They are.
-Purple rain?

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,840
Bloody Prince again.

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,560
Isn't iodine purple?

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,640
Yes.

198
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I've never listened to the lyrics
of Purple Rain before.

199
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,200
Neither have I and I'm rapidly thinking,
are they about this now?

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,920
No, no, no, they're not. No.

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
Wait, I'm going to check that.

202
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,640
Because let me… let me tell you,
if it turns out purple rain,

203
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,120
is actually about the US military's
cloud seeding experiments in Laos,

204
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
I am giving you biscuits.

205
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,800
Prince explained the meaning of Purple Rain
as follows,

206
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,180
"when there's blood in the sky,
red and blue equals purple".

207
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,360
So unfortunately, no, it's not about
the US military seeding with lead iodide.

208
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,960
But it could have been.

209
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Yeah, sure.

210
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,460
Also I'm fairly sure lead iodide
is not actually purple.

211
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,360
No, as soon as you change iodine into something
else it would lose it's colour, wouldn't it?

212
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Facts kill humour, kids.

213
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,240
But the question is, did it work?

214
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,680
-No.
-Yes.

215
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,720
-Correct.
-Because everything else on the show hasn't.

216
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,200
Yes, 82% of the clouds produced rain
within a brief period after having been seeded.

217
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
Wow, that's very wet.

218
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,920
So it did work,

219
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,080
but nowadays you're not allowed to do that,
why not?

220
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,120
Some kind of treaty that says, 'Don't do that.'

221
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,840
Weather modification treaties because it could
be used as an act of war?

222
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,880
Ooh, you are absolutely right, it is the
Environmental Modification Convention.

223
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
Have a point.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,240
Which was signed...

225
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
The Weather-a-bugger-about-y Treaty.

226
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,080
Yes, the Weather-a-bugger-about-y Treaty.
that's really hard to say.

227
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
It's the Weather-a-bugger-about-y Treaty.

228
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,600
The Weather-a-bugger-about-y Treaty.
and now we're going to a song, ♪ whoa... ♪

229
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,800
♪ The Weather-a-bugger-about-y Treaty ♪

230
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,200
Yes, it is a ban on weather modification
techniques

231
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,920
and on the use of herbicides in warfare.

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,280
When might that have come into use?

233
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,200
End of Vietnam.

234
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,280
Yeah, in 1977, Agent Orange
and everything was banned by that treaty.

235
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,400
Did they ban the modification of Kate Bush
as well?

236
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,200
How would you modify Kate Bush?

237
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,160
-Get rid of hailing.
-You're right, she can't be improved upon.

238
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,920
There is a link,
at the bottom of Operation Popeye.

239
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,040
Does it say never get involved
in a land war in Asia?

240
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,280
It says…

241
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,500
It says Project Storm Fury.

242
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,720
-F***!
-Yeah.

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,640
I want it, I want a badge, I want a hat with
it on, the whole thing, Project Storm Fury,

244
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,320
unless it killed a lot of people,
in which case I am less interested.

245
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,880
What was the US government trying to do
between '62 and '83

246
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,480
with planes filled with silver iodide?

247
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
-Anger the weather.
-Un-anger the weather.

248
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,560
Yes.

249
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,880
Make friends with weather
and then use it against them.

250
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,220
Why would the US government, not the military;

251
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,040
I nearly said US military,
but it's the government,

252
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,840
why would they want to modify the weather
on a large scale?

253
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,320
Get rid of the tornado belt.

254
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,840
Ooh, it's close, it's not quite tornados

255
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
but something else that's been hitting them
more lately.

256
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Oh, hurricanes.

257
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,680
Yes, tropical cyclones.

258
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,400
The idea was that they would fly an aircraft
into a cyclone.

259
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,760
Was it a Hurricane?

260
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
Fly a Hurricane into a hurricane?

261
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
No.

262
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,040
(The Hurricane is a type of plane.)

263
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,080
Used in the olden days.

264
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,360
Yes. No, it was a Lockheed P-3.

265
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,560
-Is that… is that a dull plane?
-Mmm.

266
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,320
I don't know if you were saying
that was a dull fact or it's a dull plane.

267
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,920
-Both.
-It's a dull plane being flown into a hurricane.

268
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
What, you think it's just a way
to get rid of them?

269
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,240
Some US army general, "We need more B1 Bombers,
they've got Swing Wings, God damn it.

270
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
"Fly the P-3s into a hurricane."

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,040
"Turn that recording of the meeting off,
we've heard enough."

272
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah, the idea was that it would just fly in.
Just fly in…!

273
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,700
Presumably with Slim Pickens on the top
in his cowboy hat.

274
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,880
"Wahoo!"

275
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,400
And the answer is they probably didn't
make it work, but they did…

276
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,520
Well, we still have lots of hurricanes.

277
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,880
Yeah, it probably wasn't actually going to
affect anything,

278
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,680
but they did get a positive outcome out of it,
what might that have been?

279
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
Less P-3s.

280
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
Fewer P-3 Orions, yeah.

281
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,440
They absolutely found it didn't work but that
involves doing something, finding that out.

282
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,400
A massive amount of weather research.

283
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,820
Yes, that's absolutely right,
out of this attempt to seed the clouds,

284
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,000
they found a huge amount of research that
helped them forecast future hurricanes.

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,680
I was going to say this sounds very 50s,
but the fact they were actually trying,

286
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,880
-it feels a bit later.
-1962 to 1983, have the last point.

287
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,040
Yay!

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,640
And with that, congratulations,
Matt, you win the show.

289
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
Yay!

290
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,720
You win a vertical purple lead arse.

291
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
It's a plumb plum plumbum bum.

292
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,840
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel,

293
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,720
to Gary Brannan,

294
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,400
to Matt Gray.

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time.
