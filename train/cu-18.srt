00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,969
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:05,820
the future of the Internet is peace and security -

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,680
run by the world’s biggest violator of human rights.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,049
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,630
Nothing makes me feel hopeful about the future of mankind

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,970
like a new world order run by the benevolent

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,320
Chinese Communist Party.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,449
But that’s a long way off.

10
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,269
We may just have to accept a China’s new
world order

11
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,550
in cyberspace for now.

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,410
Last week, this policy paper called

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,020
"International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace"

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,480
was issued by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,420
and the Cyberspace Administration of China.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,540
Among other things,

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,510
the paper calls for “upholding sovereignty
in cyberspace.”

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,760
Basically, it means the Chinese regime wants cyberspace

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,060
to be viewed in the same way it treats China’s land,

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,360
air, and seas.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,240
Can you build artifical islands in cyberspace?

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,980
Don’t worry.

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,240
They only want to do benevolent new world
order stuff—

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,330
like “prevent cyberspace from becoming a
new battlefield.”

25
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,580
Nice try, China!

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,960
Cyberspace is already a battlefield.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,740
That's what I learned from my favorite 90s
live-action kids show

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,480
adapted using stock footage from Japanese television!

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,340
What?

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,840
Like you didn't watch Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad.

31
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,050
Yes, cyberspace is crawling with monster viruses
that are...

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,479
knocking down lots of things.

33
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,560
The Chinese Communist Party wants to pretend
it’s Servo,

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
our cyber hero.

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
But don't be fooled.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,060
It was Kilokahn all along.

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,520
Mwuhahahaha!

38
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,479
Anyway, like Kilokahn,

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,010
what the Communist Party wants is not just control

40
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,750
of its own domain,

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,690
but the entire world.

42
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,440
Last week’s latest policy paper

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,950
essentially lays out that plan...

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,250
but in warm, fuzzy language.

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,269
It mentions “peace” 18 times in 12 pages.

46
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,099
I mean, did you know that

47
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,819
“China has been a force for world peace,”

48
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,220
“advocates the principles of peace,”

49
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,829
and is “committed to upholding peace and
security

50
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:20,360
in cyberspace?”

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,540
If they say it often enough,

52
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,409
it must be true.

53
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:25,489
And last Thursday,

54
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,230
an official from the Cyberspace Administration
of China

55
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,280
told reporters that

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,999
“The Chinese Internet is fully open”

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,420
and that “all Internet companies are welcome
in China.”

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,230
Did you hear that, Google?

59
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,970
Oh wait, “as long as they comply with

60
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,760
Chinese laws and regulations,

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,870
refrain from undermining China's national
interests

62
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,329
and interests of Chinese consumers.”

63
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,730
Never mind, Google.

64
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,849
The fact is,

65
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:52,459
China’s Internet Freedom ranking is just below

66
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,719
Iran and Syria.

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,139
So not super free.

68
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,650
The Chinese Communist Party maintains

69
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,459
a tight grip on the Internet

70
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,280
with what’s known as the Great Firewall—

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,120
a massive,

72
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,720
nationwide censorship and monitoring system.

73
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,280
The regime claims it’s necessary for national
security.

74
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,420
Or in other words,

75
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,489
cracking down on dissent.

76
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,779
Fortunately, last week’s policy paper

77
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,620
doesn’t have any power to let the Chinese
regime

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,310
control the world’s Internet.

79
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,310
It’s just something they’re going to present

80
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,930
at the BRICS economic summit later this year.

81
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,260
Unfortunately, this policy paper won’t be
the end of it.

82
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,650
And it’s not the beginning, either.

83
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,650
For many years,

84
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,749
the Chinese regime has been working towards
grabbing

85
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,029
more control of the world’s Internet.

86
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,299
In an episode last October,

87
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,900
I told you about how China is trying to influence
ICANN,

88
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,390
the world’s Internet address book.

89
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,849
So why does the Chinese Communist Party care
so much

90
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:53,309
about controlling the Internet in the rest
of the world?

91
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:56,329
No, the end game is not about censoring Americans

92
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,470
from searching for topics banned on the Chinese
Internet,

93
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,109
like the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

94
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,180
A key part of it actually has to do with economics.

95
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,150
The Chinese regime can only do so much

96
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,569
with its draconian Internet security laws

97
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,709
and tons of secret police.

98
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,260
To maintain power,

99
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,530
it has to keep the Chinese middle class happy

100
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,979
with economic incentives.

101
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,569
So to keep the economy running,

102
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,319
the Chinese regime has invented

103
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,370
a vast system of economic espionage

104
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,040
to steal other countries',

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,169
and particularly America's,

106
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,220
innovation and intellectual property.

107
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,610
“U.S. companies and the U.S. economy

108
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,789
lose approximately $5 trillion each year,

109
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,770
or over 30 percent of the U.S. GDP

110
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,419
when you factor the full value

111
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,360
of the stolen innovation.”

112
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,180
And so in 2015,

113
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,169
then President Barack Obama sat down

114
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,120
with Chinese leader Xi Jinping,

115
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,430
and they agreed, no more to economic cybertheft!

116
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,880
Other forms of hacking were still okay.

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,180
That’s not a joke.

118
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,509
But a big chunk of the Chinese economy,

119
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,259
and by extension the rule of the Chinese regime,

120
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,020
depends on stolen innovation.

121
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,800
So whaddya gonna do?

122
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,199
Simply find legal ways to do the same thing.

123
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,990
This is when you start to see China

124
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,600
rolling out all kinds of cyber security laws,

125
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,900
for national security.

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
Laws very similar

127
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,500
to what China now wants to roll out globally.

128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,680
In July 2015,

129
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,060
China passed the National Security Law,

130
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,620
“to make all key network infrastructure
and information systems

131
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,030
“secure and controllable.”

132
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,030
Later that year,

133
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,870
the Counter Terrorism Law was passed that

134
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,389
“Requires internet service providers

135
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,229
to help authorities decrypt data and provide

136
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,150
‘technical means of support’ in terrorism
cases.”

137
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,830
And at the end of 2016,

138
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,340
the Cybersecurity Law was passed.

139
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,219
It requires that network operators

140
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,970
must accept government supervision.

141
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,240
According to Forbes,

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,530
it could “theoretically cover every organization
or business

143
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,520
with a linked computer system.”

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,810
And companies around the world freaked.

145
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,759
Because basically what that all meant

146
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,680
is the Chinese regime can look at anything
that happens

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
on a computer inside China,

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,189
including the computers of Western companies

149
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,040
operating in China—

150
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,069
or even Western companies that don’t operate
in China,

151
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:26,909
but use servers inside China.

152
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:29,750
And it’s done under the guise of national
security

153
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,520
and counterterrorism.

154
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,129
Essentially, if the Chinese regime requires
companies

155
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,879
to give it access to any and all data passing
through China,

156
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,319
this is a “legal” way to get a hold

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,219
of foreign intellectual property.

158
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,590
Of course many companies tried to rebel.

159
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,610
And the Chinese regime hit back hard.

160
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,999
Companies like Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Apple

161
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,349
were hit with surprise early morning raids

162
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,870
of their China offices,

163
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,139
fines, heavy criticism in the media,

164
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,030
the whole shebang.

165
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,240
And then they mostly backed down.

166
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,240
And gave in to the idea of following Chinese
law.

167
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,509
Because who doesn’t want a piece

168
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,280
of the magically delicious China market?

169
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,669
And that’s just one example of how the Communist Party

170
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,960
is trying to influence Internet policy.

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,389
This latest proposal,

172
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,319
is really just a small step in a much larger
plan

173
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,050
that’s been going on for years.

174
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,639
And the end game, as always,

175
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,819
is maintaining the Party’s control over
China.

176
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,819
Argh!

177
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,460
That blasted Kilokahn,

178
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,590
trying to rule the internet!

179
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,810
Speaking of which,

180
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,639
where's my gritty reboot of Superhuman Samurai
Syber-Squad?

181
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,639
Get on it, Hollywood.

182
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,599
I mean, it’s not like Matthew Lawrence

183
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,800
