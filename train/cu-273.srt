1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,840
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,320
how would President Donald Trump handle the
South China Sea dispute?

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,299
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:14,230
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,490
The South China Sea.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,580
It’s one of the biggest shipping lanes in
the world,

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,759
with trade worth 5 trillion dollars a year.

8
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:24,550
Seven countries have overlapping claims there.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,710
And recently, China has been building

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,960
military facilities on disputed reefs in the
region,

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,070
creating what could become

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,290
the world’s most terrifying game

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,550
of Super Smash Brothers.

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,370
Fortunately for President Obama,

15
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,370
six months from now

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,570
he won’t have to deal with it anymore.

17
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,989
Because by then,

18
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:43,360
one of these two candidates

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,829
will have the launch codes for thousands of
nuclear warheads.

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,829
Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,199
The launching nukes part.

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,420
The presidency is pretty much inevitable.

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,699
On my previous episode,

24
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:59,000
I spoke with senior America correspondent
Matt Gnaizda

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,110
about how President Hillary Clinton would
handle the South China Sea.

26
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,590
Today, he joins me to talk about President
Donald Trump.

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,590
Matt?

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,740
Hey Chris.

29
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,820
You’re wearing the same clothes from two
days ago.

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,720
I... never left the studio.

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,240
What’s wrong?

32
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,600
I can’t sleep, Chris.

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,409
I can’t stop thinking about what would happen
in the South China Sea

34
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:21,740
under President Trump.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,299
You think it would be that bad?

36
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,090
I’m not saying bad.

37
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,620
I just have no idea.

38
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,810
I can’t stop thinking about it.

39
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,740
Well last time, you said that Hillary Clinton
is status quo.

40
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,220
She’d do anything to prevent war with China,

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,970
and would continue to build relationships

42
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,409
with the Chinese government and China’s
neighbors.

43
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,790
Do you think Trump would be any different?

44
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,240
Well Trump won’t admit to being like Clinton
in any respect.

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,509
But how would President Trump actually handle
the South China Sea?

46
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,549
Well, Chris, the first thing to understand
is that Trump is an L.I.C.

47
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:55,549
An L.I.C?

48
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,119
A “Low Information Candidate.”

49
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,840
Trump has no foreign policy experience.

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,309
He has international business experience,
sure.

51
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:06,090
But America is not like Trump Entertainment
Resorts,

52
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,330
where if things go badly you can file for
bankruptcy,

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,520
lay off a thousand people, and restructure.

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,730
In diplomacy, if you fail,

55
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,310
people can die.

56
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,770
Trump has never been read-in to the true US-China
relationship,

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,540
so there’s a lot of nuances to the he doesn’t
know yet.

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
On the other hand,

59
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,440
maybe a president who thinks outside the box

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,460
is what we need in the South China Sea?

61
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,620
Yeah, like President Underwood.

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,250
Remember, with one phone call,

63
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,090
Underwood solved a crisis with China that
the previous guy wasn’t able to.

64
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,160
By sending a Chinese businessman back to China!

65
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,580
“What’s more important, Cathy: integrity
or peace?”

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,180
“You know they’ll execute him!”

67
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,700
“Well, the Chinese are right about one thing:

68
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,410
Sometimes you have to sacrifice the one for
the many.”

69
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,130
You just said thinking outside the box might
be what we need.

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,570
That’s not what I....

71
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,050
Anyway, it’s hard to predict what Trump
would do.

72
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,050
On the one hand,

73
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,630
Trump says he wants to reduce US troop presence
in Japan and South Korea,

74
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,370
which are part of the US’s larger strategy

75
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,630
that includes the South China Sea issue.

76
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,260
Is pulling troops out a good idea?

77
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,370
One country thinks so.

78
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,150
And I do think Trump could save billions of
dollars by pulling troops out,

79
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,760
or by pressuring Japan and South Korea to
pay a bigger share.

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,900
But there could be unintended consequences
to that.

81
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,040
We need military forces near China

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,370
if we want to deter China

83
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,440
or intervene in a conflict within the first
24 hours.

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,180
So would Trump pull troops out of the South
China Sea?

85
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,340
Well that’s what we don’t know.

86
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,570
It sounds good as campaign rhetoric.

87
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,280
But if he becomes president,

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,760
he’s going to have to deal with a lot more
nuance than a candidate does.

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,290
I think Trump is more pragmatic than ideological.

90
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,800
He might change his mind.

91
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,510
Also, how Trump handles the South China Sea

92
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,990
depends a lot on who his advisers are,

93
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,120
and whether he’ll listen to them.

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,460
So best and worst case scenarios for the South
China Sea?

95
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,590
Best case: Trump uses his business negotiating
skills

96
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,350
to get China to back its military off,

97
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,400
agree to fair and reasonable terms for sharing
navigation and resources,

98
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,590
there’s lasting peace in the region,

99
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,440
and we all live happily ever after.

100
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
That's...really?

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,580
Ok, extremely best case scenario here.

102
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,630
Like Newt Gingrich moon colony best case scenario.

103
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm almost afraid to ask this,

104
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,130
but worst case?

105
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,640
Trump uses his business negotiating skills,

106
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,630
but misses some important points of diplomacy,

107
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
and fails.

108
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,390
He’s alienated the countries that Obama
and Clinton worked hard to befriend,

109
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,140
so no support there.

110
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,390
Then there’s some accident or misunderstanding,

111
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,320
and China opens fire on a ship from Vietnam
or the Philippines or the US.

112
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,920
Archduke Ferdinand gets killed,

113
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,280
and World War III begins.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,060
Not Archduke Ferdinand!

115
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,840
That’s a pretty big range of possibilities.

116
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,100
Lasting peace or ultimate war.

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,740
Well, it could also fall somewhere in between.

118
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,660
All I’m saying is that with Trump,

119
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,390
you have an unknown.

120
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,500
With Clinton, you’re investing in stable-but-low-return
government bonds.

121
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,710
With Trump, you’re gambling in Atlantic
City.

122
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,140
At least when it comes to the South China
Sea.

123
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,370
Take your pick.

124
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,110
Thanks, Matt.

125
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,630
So what would you pick?

126
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,230
Leave your comments below.

127
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,390
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

128
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,100
See you next time.
