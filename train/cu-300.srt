00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,760
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,140
nothing says Christmas

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,940
like a war on drugs.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,719
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,419
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,199
’Tis the season to be jolly, I say!

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,440
A time of brotherhood, a season of giving.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,960
Just ask my friend Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,300
He knows the true meaning of Christmas.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,039
I mean, check out this video he made for Christmas
last year!

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,940
“I’m only human, so I’ll still say Merry
Christmas

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,720
to drug traffickers, thieves, corrupt criminals,

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,160
and those who’ve made life hard for Filipinos.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,020
But if you don’t stop and the violence continues...

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,740
this will be your last Merry Christmas.”

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,770
Yikes.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,820
He’s more like Krampus than Santa Claus.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,700
Santa Claus, apparently, is being played by
China this year.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,020
And it’s given Duterte a major yule log.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,520
He’s been seeking weapons from China since
the beginning of his presidency.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,180
Details of the deal aren’t public yet.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,620
But Duterte has done a pretty good job of
making

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,849
last year’s Christmas threat a promise.

24
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,439
As of December 1,

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,260
his police have killed more than 2,000 people
in his war on drugs.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,740
The international community has condemned
his drug war.

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,979
And Duterte has condemned the international
community.

28
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,060
“I would like to just give an advice to
all the human rights

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,460
(groups) who are shouting now, local or international.

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,160
I said you can all go to hell.”

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,020
Since Duterte became president,

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,340
he’s moved for closer ties with China

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,410
at the expense of ties with the U.S.

34
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,020
Duterte even agreed to take a “back seat”

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,440
on the hotly contested territorial dispute
between The Philippines and China.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,020
So much so that Filipino fishing boats can
visit the Scarborough Shoal again.

37
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,410
Trust me, I know.

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,010
But here’s the thing:

39
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,410
Duterte wants help from China fighting his
war on drugs.

40
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,350
Yet, according to a reliable source,

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,080
a lot of the drugs, drug dealers, and materials

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,740
come from China.

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,800
And that reliable source is Duterte himself.

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,500
In fact, in July this year, shortly after
becoming president,

45
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,220
Duterte met with Chinese businessman Peter
Lim who is, um,

46
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,520
totally not a drug lord,

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
and instead of killing him,

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
gave him chance to clear his name with the
National Bureau of Investigation.

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,600
It probably had nothing do with them knowing each other from before.

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,160
Then in September,

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,670
Duterte spoke about how the machinery

52
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,150
that makes synthetic drugs like methamphetamine
comes from China.

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,020
“All of the materials come from China...

54
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,660
If you consider us your friend,

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,640
you want to help us,

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,420
but most of the materials,

57
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,100
and the machines and the boilers are from
China.

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,500
What does that mean?”

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
What does that mean?

60
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,250
It means this year,

61
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,240
“Santa Claus China” wears a pork pie hat.

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,560
You see, they supply the best drugs,

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,820
and the machines to make the drugs.

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,800
But amazingly, the drug enforcers ask for
their help.

65
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,400
Then, in the end,

66
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,650
they’re the ones to bring the big guns and
kill the drug dealers.

67
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,700
And millions of people think they’re the
heroes.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
Now that’s smart business, China!

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,600

Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,850
See you next time.

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,140
Hey. While I was in Taiwan,

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,520
I teamed up with Allen from Off the Great Wall

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
for a night market adventure.

80
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,940
So yeah. It’s great to be in

81
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,600
basically the parallel timeline version of a democratic China,

82
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
where they didn’t destroy the culture.
