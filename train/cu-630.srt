1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,500
We can’t afford to show you this

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,880
Or this

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,920
Or this

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,231
Because YouTube doesn’t want us to.

5
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:17,150
Welcome to China...Censored.

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,689
Because censorship seems to be what YouTube
wants.

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,400
If you’re watching this show, I assume you’re
interested in what’s happening in China—the

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,479
kind of stuff the Chinese regime wants to
cover up.

9
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:31,310
The analysis you won’t get from any other
media.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,560
The jokes you find mildly amusing.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:40,210
But YouTube, which is owned by Google, does
not want us to talk about certain “sensitive”

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,520
China topics.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,330
In fact, they punish us when we do.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,500
Most of the time, YouTube is not outright
censoring China Uncensored.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,600
Instead, they demonetize content that violates
their vague “community guidelines.”

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,870
A demonetized video means it gets no ads or
so-called “limited ads”, which is pretty

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,720
close to no ads.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,359
And after a video has been demonetized, generally
YouTube won’t recommend it as much, so the

19
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,829
number of people who see it is limited.

20
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:17,450
For example, a few days ago we put out an
episode about how Chinese police are stealing

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,740
ordinary people’s motorcycles, right out
from under them.

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,860
Demonetized.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,159
Can’t have people seeing how Chinese police
abuse people.

24
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,450
You see, over the years I’ve found a distinct
pattern to what gets demonetized—any footage

25
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,649
from China that makes the Communist Party
look bad.

26
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,869
Take for instance the coronavirus.

27
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,880
The Communist Party’s initial response to
the coronavirus was a coverup followed by

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,259
brutal suppression of Chinese people.

29
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,439
We showed you what the Party was doing in
this episode, the Coronavirus Cure isn’t

30
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,670
Authoritarianism.

31
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,869
So let’s take a look at what the People’s
Republic of China did to deal with the Coronavirus.

32
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:08,270
Starting with how Chinese officials rounded
people up and threw them into mass quarantine

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,330
camps.

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,640
And if people went outside without a mask,
they did this.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,030
And this.

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,950
And this.This guy didn’t wear a mask, so
they tied him to a pillar.

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,340
Still without a mask.

38
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,980
These ethnic Uyghurs weren’t supposed to
go outside.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,550
So officials hung signs from their necks calling
them dogs.”

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,640
The Chinese Communist Party’s coronavirus
response was horrific.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,870
But at the time, people were praising the
Communist Party’s response.

42
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,900
Some Western media even suggested you might
be better off sheltering in China.

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,470
The New York Times suggested that open societies
were a problem.

44
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,150
So we figured it was important to show you
how bad it really was in China.

45
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,160
And when we did that, YouTube hit us hard.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,780
First this episode was demonetized...

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,630
...then YouTube flat out deleted the video
without explanation.

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,160
Completely censored.

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,940
We made a huge stink about it on social media,
so they put it back up, again without explanation,

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,320
but now it was ineligible for monetization.

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,470
Plus, it was now age restricted.

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,920
You had to be over 18 to see the video, and
you’d see this message before you could

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
watch it.

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,740
Oh, our video was “inappropriate or offensive”?!

55
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,510
I think YouTube’s censorship was “inappropriate
and offensive”.

56
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,690
And this was far from an isolated incident.

57
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,780
Most of our coronavirus coverage in the early
days of the pandemic got demonetized.

58
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,800
YouTube wasn’t giving any explanation.

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,370
But by that point I had noticed a pattern.

60
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:55,050
It seemed like any time we showed Chinese
authorities using violence, we would get demonetized.

61
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,870
Back in 2019, almost all our coverage of the
Hong Kong protests were getting demonetized

62
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,870
too.

63
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,870
Here’s a clip from our episode Hong Kong
Police Lay Siege to University Students.

64
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,890
Over the weekend, Hong Kong police once again
surrounded Polytechnic University of Hong

65
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,430
Kong, known as PolyU.

66
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,850
They began arresting students, and...stomping
on their heads?!

67
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,100
Jeez.

68
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,460
Overnight clashes began at PolyU on Sunday
evening.

69
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,889
Police fired volleys of tear gas and blocked
the exits after protesters set fires on a

70
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,010
bridge.

71
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,660
More than a thousand people were trapped inside
the university, including reporters, medics,

72
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,890
and high school and university students.

73
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,080
It’s important for people to see that kind
of footage—to know what’s really happening

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,630
in Hong Kong.

75
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,100
It was demonetized.

76
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,300
Here’s another Hong Kong episode that YouTube
age restricted and labeled ineligible for

77
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,900
monetization.

78
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,210
Clashes between protesters and police in Kong
Kong over the weekend turned parts of the

79
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,180
city into a bona fide battlefield.

80
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,130
Complete with plenty of police violence, rubber
bullets, and enough tear gas to make Chuck

81
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,320
Norris cry.

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,600
Good one 2019 Chris.

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,820
But demonetized.

84
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,940
And it wasn’t just the coronavirus and Hong
Kong stories getting demonetized.

85
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,880
If we showed footage of Uyghurs shackled and
blindfolded, YouTube would demonetize us.

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,460
When we covered anti-China protests in Vietnam,
YouTube would demonetize us.

87
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,450
Here’s footage of police cracking down on
protesters inside China.

88
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,300
Including beating up an old woman.

89
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,930
YouTube demonetized AND age-restricted it.

90
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,520
The crazy thing is, all this was being done
without any explanation from YouTube.

91
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,139
Eventually, under pressure, YouTube began
to tell creators why something was demonetized

92
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,070
after human review by someone at YouTube.

93
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,000
We’d get notifications like this.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,730
It says our video contains “situations showing
hurt, damage, or injury.”

95
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:11,690
In other words, it exposes what a brutal authoritarian
regime is doing—and we can’t have that!

96
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,840
Even though YouTube’s policies supposedly
allow you to show this footage when there’s

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,139
educational or documentary context.

98
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,260
You know, like the fact that we’re reporting
the news.

99
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,190
But even when we didn’t show that kind of
footage, we’d still often get demonetized.

100
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:36,330
This episode, Coronavirus: 2nd Wave Hits Chinawas
demonetized for “harmful or dangerous acts”

101
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,240
such as “accidents, pranks or stunts”.

102
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,560
A human reviewer made that claim.

103
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,990
There were no stunts or pranks in that video.

104
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,169
That makes no sense.

105
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,229
Unless you consider China’s coverup of coronavirus
infections a stunt.

106
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,320
But I don’t think that’s what YouTube
meant.

107
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,240
This episode, Hunter Biden’s China Deals
Under Investigation was demonetized for Adult

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,460
content such exposed breasts, full nudity
or animal mating.

109
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,150
Look, I know there are the Hunter Biden sex
tapes floating around out there, but our episode

110
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,290
only talked about Biden’s China deals.

111
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,120
It didn’t show any of the stuff YouTube
claims it did.

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,449
By the way, that was also one of our weekly
news roundup episodes.

113
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:31,630
So we also talked about alleged Chinese spy
Fang Fang targeting US politicians, how China

114
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,540
is using big tech to arrest Uyghurs, and the
US sanctioning Chinese officials for the crackdown

115
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,729
on Hong Kong.

116
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,090
Which one of those was “sexual behavior,
language, or expressions?”

117
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:49,701
And in case there’s still any confusion
about what YouTube is really doing here, this

118
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:55,650
episode, China Must Have a Chernobyl Moment
() was demonetized for “situations that

119
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,290
may endanger participants”.

120
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,650
That episode—is a 35 minute interview over
skype.

121
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,570
It’s just me and the guest talking.

122
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,790
I don’t see how that could possibly be a
situation that “endangers participants”...wait,

123
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,600
unless YouTube is making a subtle threat to
stop interviewing Chinese dissidents.

124
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
OK, I don’t think it was.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,090
But I still can’t imagine the reason it
was demonetized.

126
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,800
Especially since that demonetization was confirmed
by a human reviewer.

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,280
So clearly, people at YouTube don’t want
you to know what’s really going on in China.

128
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,610
I’m not sure why, since YouTube is so vague
about it.

129
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,899
And since they’re so vague, I’m left to
my imagination.

130
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,839
Which goes to places like, I wonder if YouTube
is being influenced by Google.

131
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,890
Since Google is working with the Communist
Party on Artificial Intelligence Research.

132
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,360
Which might benefit China’s military.

133
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,380
And of course, Google had once tried to launch
a censored search app for the China market.

134
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,740
But if Google and YouTube are trying to get
us to tone down our message, we’re not going

135
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,770
to do it.

136
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,050
No matter how much they take away our ads,
or even delete our videos, we won’t stop

137
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,190
uncensoring China.

138
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,940
But to do this, we need your help.

139
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,970
YouTube ad revenue is unreliable.

140
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,040
It’s up and down and sometimes gone—depending
on what topics we cover.

141
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,390
Even in the best of times, it’s never been
enough to pay our staff—including writers,

142
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,810
video editors, sound editors, and of course
rent on our studio here in New York.

143
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,930
Our main source of support is viewer contributions.

144
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,560
That’s right, you—my amazing viewers...

145
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,720
...fans I call the “50-Cent Army”—the
people who help us fight the Chinese Communist

146
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,570
Party’s so-called 50-Cent Army of paid trolls
who spread propaganda.

147
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,970
You are the reason we can afford to cover
the most sensitive topics—because no matter

148
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,310
what YouTube does, you have our backs.

149
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,850
If you want to help us...

150
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,790
go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

151
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,450
Each membership level has rewards.

152
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,790
For just a dollar per episode, you can leave
questions for me to answer at the end of my

153
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,740
YouTube episodes.

154
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,370
Other rewards include our monthly letter,
behind the scenes footage, the music we use

155
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,580
in the show, live Google hangouts with me,
and a lot more.

156
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,000
If you don’t have a Patreon account, it’s
easy to sign up with just your name and email.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,360
Choose what you want to pledge per video.

158
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,170
We publish about 18 episodes per month.

159
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,320
And you can pledge that amount for “every
creation”...or set a monthly limit.

160
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,820
For example, if you only want to pledge 10
dollars a month, you can pledge 1 dollar per

161
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,200
creation, with a monthly limit of 10.

162
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,980

want you to know about.
