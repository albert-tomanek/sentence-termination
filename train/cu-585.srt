1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,190
The Chinese regime is using the Coronavirus
Outbreak

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,720
as a form of propaganda warfare.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,320
And the backlash is huge.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,160
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,340
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,490
As more information comes out about the deadly
coronavirus,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,380
we are finally getting answers.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,310
There’s been a lot of questions about where
the blame

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,760
for the virus’ spread should lay.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,570
Chinese people eating bat soup?

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,170
A leak from a Chinese biolab?

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,000
A cover up at high levels of the Chinese Communist
Party?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,840
Turns out, America’s to blame!

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,180
Chinese social media sites,

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,030
“are pushing the idea that the virus

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,500
really originated in the United States.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,030
Clips from Taiwanese TV and mistranslated
captions

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,629
from American reporting

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,280
are used to back up the case.”

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,620
Like this one, where the Chinese caption says
that the CDC

22
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,370
confirms the first case of the Coronavirus
originated in the US.

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,229
It’s not clear whether that translation
was state backed...

24
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,450
or if it’s just a reading comprehension
issue

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,469
by whoever made the Chinese caption.

26
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,770
But the Chinese Communist Party is turning

27
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,929
the coronavirus outbreak into a big propaganda
push.

28
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:20,029
They published this huge, glossy book called

29
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:25,090
“A Battle Against Epidemic: China Combatting
in 2020.”

30
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,909
It basically complies all official state media

31
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,659
reporting about the coronavirus.

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,209
And guess what the message is?

33
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,039
“The Chinese Communist Party,

34
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,909
despite all evidence to the contrary,

35
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,729
and despite the broad undercurrent of popular
anger

36
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,640
on Chinese social media,

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,950
has faced the epidemic with great wisdom

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,909
and effectiveness from the start.”

39
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,469
I get it.

40
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:50,639
We all believe we’re the hero of our own
story.

41
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,639
Even if we’re an authoritarian dictatorship

42
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,569
that routinely kills our own citizens.

43
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,880
To be clear, I’m not using the “royal
we” here.

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Anyway, the book

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,630
“has gotten rave reviews in Chinese media,

46
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,709
not least because it was published by their
ultimate boss—

47
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,399
the Central Committee Publicity Department,

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,349
formerly known as the Propaganda Department.”

49
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,370
The Chinese regime is also taking the propaganda
battle

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,459
to American social media banned in China.

51
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,620
Like this poll by state-run Xinhua News.

52
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,599
In China's fight against the coronavirus outbreak,

53
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,569
which part impresses you most?

54
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,819
Gosh, there are so many choices!

55
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,819
It also doesn’t help that the World Health
Organization

56
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,040
is lavishing praise on how the Chinese Communist
Party

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
has responded to the outbreak.

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,689
One W.H.O. official even said this.

59
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:44,319
“If I had COVID-19, I’d want to be treated
in China.”

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,969
Yes, will it be the “box” treatment for
you, sir?

61
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:52,340
Or the “welded into your home to starve”
treatment?

62
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,790
Or perhaps the more plebeian “thrown into
a hastily built,

63
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,810
overcrowded quarantine center” treatment?

64
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,650
Meanwhile, the popular WeChat messaging app

65
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,830
has been censoring coronavirus content for
months.

66
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,980
And many citizen journalists and whistleblowers

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,599
who have spoken out about the coronavirus

68
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,720
have been jailed or simply disappeared.

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,969
But Chinese coronavirus propaganda doesn’t
always go as planned.

70
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,310
State run media released this video of female
medical workers

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,450
getting their heads shaved.

72
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,519
It was supposed to be a,

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,630
“wow, look at how dedicated these women
are!

74
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,389
Shaving their heads so they can fit into their
medical gear better.”

75
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:32,799
But it came off more as a group of men

76
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,530
humiliating a bunch of women in tears.

77
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,290
Chinese internet users were furious.

78
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,890
One person wrote on WeChat,

79
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,140
“Stop using women’s bodies as propaganda
tools.”

80
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,070
Don’t worry, that person won’t be

81
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,549
posting comments like that for long!

82
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,549
The Chinese Communist Party

83
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:51,239
is also using coronavirus misinformation

84
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,239
to attack Shen Yun.

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,650
Shen Yun is a New York-based performing arts
company.

86
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,170
According to its website,

87
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,189
it’s mission is to revive traditional Chinese
culture

88
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,239
through the arts.

89
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,510
It was also started by Falun Gong practitioners.

90
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,280
So the Chinese Communist Party really hates
Shen Yun.

91
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,549
But since it's based in the US, they can’t
touch it.

92
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,980
So they’ve started spreading rumors that
the dancers

93
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,780
are infected with the coronavirus.

94
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,959
Even though Shen Yun performers

95
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,949
are the least likely Chinese people to be
infected—

96
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,050
because they’re literally banned from traveling
to China.

97
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,780
The Communist Party’s propaganda got so
bad,

98
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,070
that in one city where Shen Yun was performing,

99
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,000
the health department had to step in, and
be like:

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,530
Guys, the dancers are not infected.

101
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,840
The Salt Lake County Health Department made
it clear that,

102
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,740
“Shen Yun is based in NYC, not China.”

103
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,520
This kind of propaganda attack isn't just
happening in the US.

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,240
In South Korea, where the coronavirus outbreak
really is severe,

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,979
a, “theater manager received a phone call
from a TV reporter

106
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,069
who said that the Chinese Consulate

107
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,759
had told the reporter that Shen Yun performers
were from Wuhan,”—

108
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,419
that’s where the outbreak began.

109
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,050
But all of the Commuinst Party’s attempts

110
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,229
to spread propaganda and lies about the coronavirus

111
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:11,940
are only damaging its reputation.

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,800
Abroad and even inside China.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,500
What the Party calls “rumors,”

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,770
are now being taken as truths.

115
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,650
“‘Rumor is just a prophecy far ahead of
our times,’

116
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,240
says a quote widely shared online in China
in recent weeks.”

117
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
Taiwan is also accusing the Chinese regime

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,539
of spreading disinformation, calling it cyber
war.

119
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:34,889
“This week Taiwan’s government reported

120
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,110
an increase in fake online reports about the
virus on the island,

121
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,180
and blamed China’s “internet army”

122
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,180
for being behind the misinformation.”

123
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,879
I mean, just because there’s an outbreak
of a deadly disease,

124
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,099
doesn’t mean you have to stop being petty.

125
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,789
So what do you think about how the Chinese
regime

126
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,620
has turned the coronavirus outbreak into propaganda
warfare?

127
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,539
Tell me in the comments below.

128
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,440
Take a moment to subscribe to China Uncensored

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,830

And even if you have,

131
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,280
because many viewers are telling me YouTube

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,300

support this show on the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

135
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:15,680
YouTube demonetizes most of these video

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,409
and would have run us out of business,

137
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,770
if it weren’t for the support of what I
call

138
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,180
the China Uncensored 50 cent army—

139
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,889
the fans who support us on Patreon.

140
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:25,949
As a thank you to them,

141
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,620
I answer their questions at the end of some
of my episodes.

142
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,600
Today’s question comes from William Adderholdt,

143
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,569
“The W.H.O.'s name for the coronavirus "COVID-19"
hasn't caught on.

144
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,820
Any idea why?

145
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,389
And what would be a good replacement name?”

146
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:44,210
Good question.

147
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,690
Coronavirus is actually the name of a family
of diseases.

148
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,370
For example, SARS is another type of coronavirus.

149
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,490
So in mid-February,

150
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,840
the World Health Organization dubbed this
new coronavirus disease

151
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,169
COVID-19.

152
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,550
This was their reasoning behind the name.

153
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:07,290
“We had to find a name that did not refer
to a geographical location,

154
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,879
an animal, an individual or group of people

155
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,330
and which is also pronounceable and related
to the disease.

156
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,229
Having a name matters to prevent the use of
other names

157
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,400
that can be inaccurate or stigmatising.”

158
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,039
And obviously the W.H.O. wouldn’t want to
do anything

159
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,479
that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese
Communist Party.

160
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,220
But this was already weeks after they declared
the coronavirus outbreak

161
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,509
a global health emergency and months after
the virus

162
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,889
first began to spread in China.

163
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,630
That was a long time for the public

164
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,280
to only have “coronavirus” as a name.

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,010
People got used to it.

166
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,820
And it sounds better than COVID-19.

167
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,370
What would be a better name for a deadly disease

168
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,580
spreading around the world and killing people?

169
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,330
Well, sounds like Communism to me.

170
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,889
But I think calling it that might just be
confusing.

171
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,389
Thanks for your question, William.

172
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,389
