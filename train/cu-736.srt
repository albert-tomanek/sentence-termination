1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,870
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,550
is there anyone who still believes in journalism?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,140
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,010
You know, it's hard out here for newspapers.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,740
According to the Pew Research Center,

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,350
newspaper subscriptions are declining fast.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,500
And ad revenues are falling, too,

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,290
so it's tough to make ends meet.

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,110
Fortunately, there’s at least one group

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,380
that hasn’t given up on Western journalism—

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,739
the Chinese Communist Party.

13
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,870
Yes, the Chinese state-run media

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,569
is paying to place its propaganda

15
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:40,399
in mainstream Western newspapers—

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,600
like the Daily Telegraph,

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,809
the New York Times,

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,519
and the Wall Street Journal.

19
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:48,719
Well, it’s not exactly propaganda.

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,769
Propaganda would be if a Chinese newspaper

21
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,839
ran a story called something like,

22
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:53,999
I don't know,

23
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:57,149
“Wherever you look, Red Reigns Supreme.”

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,190
But if you get a respected American newspaper

25
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,819
to run the same thing,

26
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,539
people think it’s credible.

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,700
So it becomes something that’s more accurately
called

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,280
disinformation.

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,390
That's when intentionally false or misleading
information

30
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,060
is planted in a way that would

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,219
make people believe it.

32
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,909
It was a technique masterminded by the Soviets,

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,000
and it's been fine-tuned

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,219
by the Chinese Communist Party.

35
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,920
This is the latest piece of disinformation:

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
A 5-page full color spread

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,689
published in the January 17th edition

38
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,280
of the Wall Street Journal.

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,929
Sure, it looks exactly like a bunch of news
articles.

40
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,500
But it’s an advertisement.

41
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,899
You can tell by the small text at the bottom
that says

42
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,810
“Paid by the Xinhua News Agency”.

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,030
And because it’s selling us Xi Jinping’s
vision

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,979
for a better world for all.

45
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,570
Yes, China has a plan for you, too.

46
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,880
That article also criticizes the US for it’s

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,829
“sense of superiority and impatience.”

48
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,090
Another article on that page accuses Europe

49
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,260
of being fueled by “rightist ideas.”

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,909
But if you’re concerned about the Communist
Party’s

51
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,439
anti-Western messages

52
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,510
being printed in the Wall Street Journal,

53
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,540
well, sure they’re in inside the Wall Street
Journal,

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,740
but according to the Wall Street Journal,

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,550
they’re not in the Wall Street Journal.

56
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,290
I emailed their spokesperson,

57
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,290
who responded:

58
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,100
“The Journal has run special advertising
sections

59
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,100
and other traditional advertising from China
Watch,

60
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,010
which are clearly labeled as such.

61
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,750
The Journal’s news organization is not involved.”

62
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,870
Basically,

63
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,100
if someone pays them to run an ad,

64
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,670
they’re not responsible for what it says.

65
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:44,130
As long as it's clearly labeled.

66
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,260
FYI, I also asked the Wall Street Journal

67
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,160
if they’d be willing to run a full-page
ad

68
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,790
that praises Stalin.

69
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,230
Strangely, they did not respond.

70
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,440
And here’s one of the most interesting things

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,900
this 5-page Chinese “ad” is selling:

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,420
Blasphemy That Masquerades as Art.

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,950
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party is a great
art critic.

74
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,950
After all,

75
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,730
they spent decades eradicating traditional
Chinese culture,

76
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,530
and twisting theater to its own political
ends.

77
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,370
So they know a thing or two.

78
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,430
So what is this so-called

79
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,280
“Blasphemy That Masquerades as Art”

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,400
that Chinese state-run media is criticizing?

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,510
Why, it’s Shen Yun!

82
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,600
A dance company that state-run media

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,750
accuses of being linked to Falun Gong,

84
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,190
a.k.a. Falun Dafa.Well, I am shocked,

85
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,610
shocked to hear this terrible secret

86
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,400
that no one knows.

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,680
Except for the fact that Shen Yun

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,160
explicitly says this on its own website.

89
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,940
Yes, Shen Yun is:

90
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,840
"reviving 5,000 years of civilization"

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,520
"features the world's foremost classically
trained dancers"

92
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,970
And look, it was

93
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,940
"established by Falun Dafa practitioners in
2006."

94
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940


95
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,940
Whistle.

96
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Blown.

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,500
What amazing investigative reporting

98
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,310
from Chinese state-run media.

99
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,180
If you’ve been watching China Uncensored
for a while,

100
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,320
you’ve heard me talk about the Chinese regime’s

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,960
weird obsession with slandering Shen Yun.

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,160
And if this is new to you,

103
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,780
let me tell you why the Communist Party

104
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,090
sees this Chinese-American dance show

105
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,320
as such an enormous threat.

106
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,269
Falun Gong practitioners are the

107
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,350
people getting their organs harvested in China,

108
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,870
as punishment for doing this.

109
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,310
And this.

110
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,590
Such a threat to social harmony.

111
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,220
Like yoga.

112
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,190
And yet—and this is true—

113
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,900
the Chinese regime has spent billions of dollars

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,440
since the late ’90s

115
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,720
creating a global propaganda campaign

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,780
to slander Falun Gong.

117
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,820
Including by planting disinformation

118
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,380
in foreign newswire services like the Associated
Press.

119
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Anyway,

120
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,770
you can imagine that this latest

121
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,120
Chinese state-run media-slash-totally-not-Wall
Street Journal article

122
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,760
does not speak highly of Shen Yun,

123
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,500
calling it full of “far-fetched theme[s],”

124
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,660
that spare little effort in

125
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,420
“demonizing the Chinese government.”

126
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Hey,

127
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,240
demonizing the Chinese government is hard
work.

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,380
Unfortunately for the Chinese Communist Party,

129
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,350
Shen Yun is actually really popular.

130
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,520
It plays to packed theaters every year

131
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,830
in hundreds of cities around the world.

132
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,990
I just saw their performance at New York’s
Lincoln Center

133
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,290
last week.

134
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,900
It sold out four shows in a row.

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,980
What’s so “blasphemous” about it?

136
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,210
Well, the show had about twenty dance and
music numbers.

137
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,030
Most depicted cultural and historic things
from China,

138
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,290
like a scene from Journey to the West.

139
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,590
But some of them also show an awareness of
modern China.

140
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,990
One had a monk with awesome fighting skills

141
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,400
defending a Buddhist temple from being demolished

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,770
by Communist officials during the Cultural
Revolution.

143
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,870
Another one showed Falun Gong practitioners

144
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,110
standing up to the Chinese regime’s persecution.

145
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,110
Imagine!

146
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,830
Using the arts to tell important stories.

147
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,300
What blasphemy.

148
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
Yes, according the article,

149
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
audiences get

150
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,950
“assaulted with everything the Falun Gong
propaganda arsenal

151
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,090
has to fire at them.”

152
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,090
Wow.

153
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,169
Let’s see what people assaulted with the
Falun Gong propaganda arsenal

154
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,169
have to say.

155
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,030
I laughed, I cried…

156
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,900
Colorful and vibrant and joyous.

157
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,110
The dancers - you guys are amazing!

158
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,110
Great experience.

159
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,110
Well worth it.

160
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,020
Why even a Wall Street Journal anchor

161
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,410
said she and her son enjoyed the show.

162
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,190
"…So I have him to thank

163
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,540
for introducing me to this beautiful culture."…

164
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,540
"Another good part

165
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,200
was when the monk's were fighting the Red
Guards."

166
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,460
But for the Chinese regime,

167
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,730
Falun Gong is a third rail issue.

168
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,330
They hate it when people talk about it positively—

169
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,800
because it rips apart their propaganda.

170
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,430
Like back in 2001 when the Wall Street Journal

171
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,850
won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the
regime's persecution

172
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,850
of Falun Gong.

173
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,660
That was before the Communist Party

174
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,260
started paying the Wall Street Journal, though.

175
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
For years,

176
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,169
the Chinese Communist Party has gone to great
lengths

177
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,150
to stop people from seeing Shen Yun.

178
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,460
Chinese embassies around the world

179
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,040
have written to theaters that hosting Shen
Yun

180
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
"may compromise relations"

181
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,330
between China and their country.

182
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,120
And pressuring them to cancel it.

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,570
Like in Spain.

184
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,640
Germany.

185
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,290
And even Florida.

186
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,610
That's pretty low.

187
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,480
Florida needs all the culture it can get.

188
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,170
Anyway, it's a tactic that generally backfires,

189
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,000
since when the news comes out,

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,690
it kind of makes people want to see the show
more...

191
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,480
But if an article inside a well-respected
paper like the Wall Street Journal

192
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,639
trashes Shen Yun as Falun Gong propaganda,

193
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,889
that could actually affect sales—

194
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,880
especially for readers who don’t realize

195
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,889
it’s an ad from Chinese state-run media.

196
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,910
But, come on, Wall Street Journal.

197
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,330
Are you really willing to print the Chinese
Communist Party's disinformation

198
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,290
for a few thousand bucks?

199
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,450
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

200
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,450
Oh.

201
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,979
The retail price for a full-page color ad
in the Wall Street Journal

202
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,610
is 354 thousand dollars.

203
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,979
The Xinhua News ad was five pages,

204
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:12,110
so about 1.8 million dollars.

205
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,949
I mean, I’m sure the Journal gave them a
discount.

206
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:19,310
After all, they probably want repeat business.

207
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
But you know what?

208
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,680
If they’ll run a full-page Chinese propaganda
ad,

209
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,350
we should run a China Uncensored ad.

210
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,310
Except I don’t have 354 thousand dollars.

211
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,060
And that’s maybe too ambitious of a Kickstarter
campaign.

212
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,800
Hey, who needs a newspaper ad anyway?

213
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,669
Traditional media is dying!

214
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,370
I have my fifty-cent army!

215
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,380
Yes, China Uncensored fans,

216
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,399
I want you to spread the word about the show.

217
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,100
Remember that wanted poster of me that,

218
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,119
uh, someone, created?

219
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,149
Download it on this website.

220
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,709
The link is in the Description box below.

221
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:57,809
Print out 10 copies,

222
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,809
20 copies,

223
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,149
or as many as you can—

224
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,899
and put them up in a populated area near you.

225
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:04,670
Take a wide photo of one of the posters

226
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,809
and send it to me in an email at chinauncensored@gmail.com.

227
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,839
Don't forget to tell me where you put it up.

228
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:13,689
And we'll post those pictures on our Facebook
page.

229
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,819
This is going to be awesome.

230
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:17,759
So what do you think of the Wall Street Journal

231
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,410
allowing Chinese disinformation to be printed

232
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,550
in an ad in their paper?

233
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,769
Leave your comments below.

234
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,310
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

235
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,230
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

236
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,579
See you next time.

237
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,290
And put up those posters!
