00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,630
Tweet-le Dee and Tweet-le Dumb.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,160
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,070
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,139
And you thought Twitter was dead.

6
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,339
Far from it!

7
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,289
Twitter is having a resurgence.

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,790
It’s all anyone can talk about.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,119
And it’s all thanks to soon-to-be president,

10
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:23,779
Donald Trump.

11
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:24,920
On the campaign trail,

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,550
Trump promised to be tough on China.

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,590
And now, before even assuming office,

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,190
he’s set his sights on the Chinese regime.

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,190
In 140 characters or less.

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,900
In two Tweets he tweeted Sunday,

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,960
Trump attacked China for being a currency
manipulator,

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,400
and then for militarizing the South China
Sea.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,550
Now these are both things

20
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,790
the US has criticized China for in the past.

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,820
Just not via Twitter.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,610
It follows on the heels of a phone call between
Trump

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,010
and the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ying-wen.

24
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,010
That’s the first time in 40 years a US president
or president-elect

25
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,790
had a phone call with Taiwan’s leader.

26
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,250
Taiwan is considered a province by the Chinese
regime.

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,570
I believe this was the Chinese Foreign Minister’s
response to Trump's tweets:

28
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,910
My favorite state-run media, Global Times

29
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,490
slammed Donald Trump, saying

30
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,720
“Trump's reckless remarks against a major
power

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,220
show his lack of experience in diplomacy.”

32
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,290
This one warns that Trump will learn not to
cross China.

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,220
That’s ridiculous!

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,020
How does an eagle throw a rock?!

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,140
Eagles don’t have opposable thumbs, people!

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,140
Now in the West,

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,030
Trump has also been slammed for his “Twitter
diplomacy.”

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,979
Because the proper way for a president to
deal with China

39
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,080
is to let the Chinese regime walk all over
you!

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,320
And for all those who criticize Trump as lacking
experience,

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,580
well, at least he has experience on Twitter,

42
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,050
where his verbal war with China goes all the
way back to 2012,

43
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,640
when he said that China invented global warming

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,780
to hurt US manufacturing.

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,960
Sorry, Al Gore.

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,250
2012 also saw Trump weigh in on other important
matters,

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,600
such as the relationship between Twilight
stars Robert Pattinson

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,810
and Kristen Stewart.

49
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,220
He was right then and he’s right now!

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,700
So is it appropriate for the future president
of the United States

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,760
to use his Twitter account to discuss

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,569
high level diplomatic issues?

53
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,480
Well, it certainly is a new medium.

54
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,720
Perhaps what’s strange and unusual now

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,260
might be common practice in the future.

56
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,440
The real problem is his snapchat account.

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,870
So what do you think?

58
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,780
Is Trump standing up to China?

59
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,110
Or will his Twitter diplomacy result

60
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,900
in a Myspace-level catastrophe?

61
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,470

62
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,780
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,960
see you next time.

64
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,420
Internet censorship is a disease,

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,960
a cancer of this planet.

66
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,520
It’s a plague.

67
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,599
And ExpressVPN is the cure.

68
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,709
ExpressVPN helps users in China and around
the world

69
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,930

want them to see.

70
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,730

75

A world kind of like…

76
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,080
America.

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
That’s right,

78
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,300
ExpressVPN lets you browse the Internet like
an American,

79
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,780
even if you’re in China.

80
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,230
After all, what good is the Internet

81
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,170
if you’re unable to speak?
