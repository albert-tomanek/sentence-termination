1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,939
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:04,960
well, we’re finally getting towards the
final round

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,590
of Civilization.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,590
What?

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,260
Thermonuclear warfare?

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,680
Shoot, I wanted to get to Alpha Centauri…

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,320
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,230
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,390
Kim Jong-un,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,470
the rotund God emperor of North Korea.

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,180
What can you say about a man that,

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,180
when you type his name into Google,

13
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,700
it auto completes Kim Jong-un

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,680
flamethrower execution.

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,930
Apparently he executed an official by flamethrower.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,570
Also, mortar…

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,250
And anti-aircraft gun.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,860
Unless you're an actual hermit,

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,280
you’ve probably heard that the hermit kingdom

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,850
is on the warpath.

21
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,460
Last year marked North Korea’s

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,650
5th nuclear test.

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,720
They also released this nice video

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,390
where they blow up the US Capitol.

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,160
And threatened to nuke Manhattan:

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,530
“all the people there would be killed immediately

27
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,200
and the city would burn to ashes.”

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,270
Which is an odd threat to make since,

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,270
you know,

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,990
the United Nations is there.

31
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,080
And probably a lot of countries

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
would be mad at Kim

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,830
if he blew it up.

34
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,110
Also there are North Korean diplomats there.

35
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,740
And me, too.

36
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,740
So blowing up Manhattan

37
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,810
is in no one’s best interests.

38
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,810
To top it all off,

39
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,250
North Korea has been conducting

40
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,740
a series of ballistic missile tests.

41
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,500
Now all this posturing might have worked

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,170
on the United State’s last president,

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,740
who failed to put the bomb in O-bomb-a.

44
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,140
But things have changed under President Trump,

45
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,010
who puts the bomb in bombastic.

46
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,210
Not only has he launched a Twitter war on
North Korea...

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,000
He’s shown he may be willing

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
to go for an actual war.

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,060
In the course of a week,

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,170
Trump ordered a retaliatory missile strike
on Syria

51
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,830
for Assad’s use of sarin nerve gas.

52
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,170
Then dropped the “mother of all bombs”
on ISIS.

53
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,170
And over the weekend,

54
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,519
a US carrier strike group headed to North
Korea...

55
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:12,599
...as they prepared to celebrate the 105th
birthday

56
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,529
of founder Kim Il Sung.

57
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:18,189
And how did North Korea plan to celebrate?

58
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,239
“Satellite intelligence suggests that a
nuclear test

59
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,709
could be in the works.”

60
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,540
I mean fireworks are nice

61
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,219
but that is going a bit too far.

62
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,540
So it was a bit of a tense weekend.

63
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,069
Since we are not now scrounging through the
wasteland

64
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,920
looking for slightly radioactive

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,239
roach meat and Rad-X,

66
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,309
you might have correctly guessed

67
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:42,170
we did not have a nuclear war.

68
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,680
So if North Korea didn’t launch a nuke,

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,430
how did they celebrate their holiday?

70
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,939
With a military parade showcasing

71
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,519
their latest intercontinental ballistic missile
technology...

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,459
...and a big old dance party!

73
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,620
Because nothing says there’s no famine in
North Korea,

74
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,959
like lots of people dancing.

75
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,870
You can’t dance if you’re starving.

76
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,919
And then the next day,

77
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,870
they did have a totally awesome ballistic
missile test!

78
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,230
U.S. Pacific Command says it, quote,

79
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,879
"blew up almost immediately"

80
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,930
off the Korean peninsula's east coast.

81
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,139
Most people in North Korea weren’t too troubled

82
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,099
by the news of the failure.

83
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:22,099
Mainly because they didn’t hear

84
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,249
any news of the failure.

85
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:25,650
And when some Reuters reporters

86
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,040
spilled the beans,

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,870
citizens responded with all the correct answers.

88
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,000
If the news is true,

89
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,480
failure is the mother of success.

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,519
We will make more efforts to make

91
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,339
even more powerful weapons in the future.

92
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,279
That's a lie...

93
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:45,439
Scientists like me don't believe that.

94
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,510
And you've got to believe

95
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,099
the scientists of North Korea.

96
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,879
The good news is that President Trump

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,889
has worked out a close friendship

98
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,029
with someone powerful enough to have

99
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,540
an impact on North Korea.

100
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,810
The Easter Bunny.

101
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,969
It’s part of the new US-fairy tale alliance

102
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,239
that will also include Jack Frost,

103
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,329
Santa Claus,

104
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,640
and the Tooth Fairy.

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,299
Yes, things are looking very...

106
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,180
Grimm for North Korea.

107
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,469
What's that, Shelley?

108
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,450
Yes, I know that's just a movie.

109
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,660
But can North Korea

110
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,459
actually start a nuclear war?

111
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,040
Well, technically they haven’t even finished

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,840
the Korean War.

113
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,720
Right now it’s just in an awkward

114
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,350
decades-long ceasefire.

115
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,780
But if it starts up again,

116
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,840
this time, China's not on their side anymore.

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,500
It's on America's.

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,400
At least on this issue.

119
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,120
At first it might not seem like the US and
China

120
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,260
could be allies against North Korea.

121
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,820
After all, hundreds of thousands of Chinese
soldiers

122
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,980
died fighting against US troops

123
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,740
in the Korean War.

124
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,840
But the last Chinese leader

125
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,330
to really support North Korea

126
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,650
was the four-eyed toad Jiang Zemin.

127
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,400
And he’s Xi Jinping’s big political rival.

128
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,820
So it’s not a coincidence that,

129
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,660
as Xi Jinping takes down his political enemies

130
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,150
tied to Jiang Zemin,

131
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,870
he is also dismantling China’s old friendly
relationship

132
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,530
with North Korea.

133
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,010
In February,

134
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,930
China said it was cutting off coal imports
from North Korea

135
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,850
in compliance with UN Security Council sanctions.

136
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,710
And after the meeting between Xi and Trump,

137
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,000
even my favorite state-run media,

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,170
the super nationalist Global Times,

139
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,500
came out in favor of stricter UN sanctions

140
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,170
and warned Pyongyang that it should

141
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,800
"avoid making mistakes."

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,740
The Global Times, by the way,

143
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,200
has long been considered part of Jiang's faction.

144
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,430
So if even they are criticizing North Korea,

145
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,270
it doesn't look good for Kim Jong-un.

146
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,470
Now there are signs the the US and China

147
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,300
are working together on dealing with the situation…

148
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,140
...and the Chinese military has been put on
alert.

149
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,390
So China will not be joining North Korea

150
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,430
if they decide to provoke the United States.

151
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,070
But Chinese authorities also don't want

152
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,110
a sudden collapse of the Kim regime

153
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,540
to send millions of refugees across the border.

154
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,550
Could North Korea actually launch a nuke?

155
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,630
It's not clear whether they've been

156
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,970
able to make a nuclear warhead small enough

157
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,200
to mount it on a missile.

158
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,470
But South Korea or Japan

159
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,121
could definitely be in harm’s way

160
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,310
from a North Korean missile attack,

161
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,150
even if it's not a nuclear one.

162
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,980
For now, I guess all we can do is take comfort

163
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,460
in Vice President Pence’s presence

164
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,250
at the Demilitarized Zone between North and
South Korea.

165
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,480
Because dressing like you’re in Top Gun
says to me,

166
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,050
everything is going to be all right.

167
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,270
So how do you feel standing

168
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,650
on the brink of nuclear annihilation?

169

Leave your comments below.

170
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,240
And since YouTube has a real penchant

171
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,600

172
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,140
