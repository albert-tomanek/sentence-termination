1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,520
did you fill out your paperwork?

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,520
Wait, Shelley -

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,540
why does the teleprompter say that?

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,449
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:30,449
Tibet.

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,150
A land of happiness and freedom,

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,239
according to the Chinese Communist Party.

10
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,960
In fact, Tibet’s capital tops state-run
CCTV’s poll

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,519
as the happiest place in China!

12
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,890
Sorry, Mickey.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,789
I'm sure Shanghai Disneyland

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,940
came in a close second.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,300
But unlike Disneyland,

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,149
if you try to flee Tibet,

17
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,980
Chinese soldiers will actually shoot you.

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,820
But there’s more good news for the happy
people

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,430
living in Tibet:

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,690
It turns out that even after death,

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,390
they’ll still feel the loving embrace

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,610
of Chinese bureaucracy.

23
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,330
Traditionally, Tibetans Buddhists believe
that after death,

24
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,470
their soul re-enters the cycle of samsara,

25
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,060
and they will be reborn based on their karma

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,540
or their wishes from a previous life.

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,360
Clearly, a slow, inefficient process,

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,180
riddled with problems.

29
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,840
Problems that today have been solved—

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,280
thanks to the efficiently humming engine of
socialism

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,700
with Chinese characteristics.

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,469
You see, back in 2007,

33
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,590
that old fashioned way of reincarnation was
banned.

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,140
Now, it’s under the auspices

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,659
of the Chinese government.

36
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,680
Yes, I kid you not,

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,539
the officially atheist Chinese Communist Party

38
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,329
is bringing the revolution to the afterlife,

39
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:48,579
streamlining the whole thing by requiring

40
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,350
government permission before reincarnation.

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,049
According to the State Administration of Religious
Affairs,

42
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,850
this was "an important move to institutionalize

43
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,440
management of reincarnation."

44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,469
Mmmm.

45
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,820
So to reincarnate you'll need to fill out

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,700
Form 99-R, as well as Form 22-EL.

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,560
Don't forget Form 108-A.

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,720
Make sure you do the calculations

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,770
on the back of that one

50
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,590
to get your official karma score.

51
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,190
You'll need to get all of those signed

52
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,810
and notarized in triplicate.

53
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,370
And you'll need to two valid forms of ID,

54
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,110
plus your death certificate.

55
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,310
Piece of cake.

56
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,140
Sure, that may seem like unnecessary

57
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,770
and ridiculous government regulation

58
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,800
of something the Party doesn't even believe
in,

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,750
but it's there for a reason.

60
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,860
Take a specific case.

61
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,850
Under the sloppy way reincarnation

62
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,830
was handled in the past,

63
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,210
this boy was mistakenly identified

64
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,660
as the Panchen Lama,

65
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,080
the number two religious figure

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
in Tibetan Buddhism.

67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,860
The Dalai Lama was the one who identified
him.

68
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,560
Fortunately the Chinese government stepped in

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,100
and cleared up that mess.

70
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,590
The boy and his family mysteriously disappeared.

71
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,710
And the Chinese Communist Party found someone
else

72
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,240
to call the Panchen Lama.

73
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
You know this new guy’s the real deal

74
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,290
because he says things like

75
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,000
monks should love the Communist Party.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,890
Meanwhile, the other guy is probably doing
ok.

77
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,630
After human rights groups and the UN

78
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,830
repeatedly asked about his whereabouts,

79
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,530
Chinese authorities responded that he's

80
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,580
absolutely fine and living a "normal, happy
life."

81
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,590
Authorities went on to say

82
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,660
that he was living on a happy little farm
in the countryside,

83
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,350
where he has lots of room to sit around and
meditate.

84
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,170
And I’m sure they’ve already filled out
the

85
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,140
reincarnation paperwork for him.

86
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,291
But you know who’s a bigger threat to the
Communist Party

87
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,620
than a six-year-old boy?

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,350
An 81-year-old man!

89
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,280
This 81-year-old man.

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,830
That Nazi...

91
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,830
Terrorist...

92
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,620
Wolf in monk’s robes!

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,570
Well, he’s not going to live forever.

94
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,260
And I’ll bet the CCP can’t wait to approve

95
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,430
his reincarnation.

96
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,400
Because they’ll make sure the next Dalai
Lama

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,590
is someone who totally gets what Communism

98
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,450
is all about!

99
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,640
Not someone who interferes with China’s
internal affairs,

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,870
by—I don’t know—

101
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,430
visiting politically sensitive disputed territory.

102
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,650
See, that pesky, still-living Dalai Lama

103
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,449
just made a visit to the Arunachal Pradesh.

104
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,489
That’s along the border of China and India.

105
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:22,489
And..surprise!

106
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,199
The Chinese regime claims it’s not Indian
territory,

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,570
but has been a part of China's sacred territory

108
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,849
since ancient times.

109
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,660
In fact they call it South Tibet.

110
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,620
Kind of like how Los Angeles

111
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,009
is East Beijing.

112
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,009
Needless to say,

113
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,500
the Chinese regime flipped out.

114
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,409
"India, disregarding China's concerns

115
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,409
and persisting to arrange for the Dalai Lama

116
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,289
to go to the eastern sector of the disputed
border region

117
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,930
between China and India,

118
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,539
severely harms China's interests

119
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:53,680
and China-India relations..."

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,200
And one Indian official

121
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,740
had the sweetest response.

122
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,310
He basically took a page

123
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,389
out of China’s own playbook.

124
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:06,729
"India never interferes in internal affairs
of China...

125
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:09,900
so we expect that China also should not

126
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,729
interfere in our internal matters."

127
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,819
State-run China Daily called it “cute,”
I guess state-run media can dish it out,

128
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,009
but they can't take it.

129
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,009
But the Dalai Lama’s trip

130
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:21,690
was about more than needling

131
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,949
the Chinese regime on territory disputes.

132
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,169
It was about the future of Tibetan Buddhism.

133
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,400
The town he visited is also

134
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,039
the historic home of the 6th Dalai Lama,

135
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,159
400 years ago.

136
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,499
There’s also a tradition that

137
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,300
towards the end of his life,

138
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,749
the Dalai Lama will visit the place

139
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,370
he will be reincarnated in.

140
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,160
I mean, you always want to scope out a neighborhood

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,039
before you move in.

142
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,979
Is he trying to say the next Dalai Lama

143
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,879
will be found in India,

144
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,389
not China?

145
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,729
Clearly he doesn’t understand

146
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:52,699
China’s laws on reincarnation.

147
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,569
Some Buddhist master he is!

148
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,159
But here's where the Communist Party

149
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,870
has been playing the long game.

150
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,150
You see, one of the reasons

151
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,749
they kidnapped a 6-year-old child

152
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,610
and installed their own Panchen Lama

153
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,770
in his place

154
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,749
is because the part of the Panchen Lama’s
job

155
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:13,610
is to identify the next Dalai Lama.

156
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,550
So after the Dalai Lama reincarnates

157
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,490
with state approval,

158
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,629
the Communist Party-loving Panchen Lama

159
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,810
will officially find him.

160
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,000
In China.

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,150
But the current Dalai Lama

162
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,360
isn't taking this sitting down.

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,259
He had this to say last week:
"That's, I think frankly speaking, nonsense."

164
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,650
"First, Chinese communists should accept

165
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,050
the theory of rebirth.

166
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,729
Then, second, the Chinese government should
recognize

167
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,250
Chairman Mao Zedong's reincarnation.

168
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,550
As well as Deng Xiaoping's reincarnation.

169
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,729
Then there's some logic for showing concern

170
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,980
about Dalai Lama's reincarnation."

171
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Ouch.

172
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,980
I think the Communist Party

173
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,539
might need some lotion for that burn.

174
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:04,419
I have a feeling the next Party-approved

175
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,729
reincarnation of the Dalai Lama

176
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,860
won't be quite as sassy.

177
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
So what do you think of the Chinese Communist
Party’s

178
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,969
ban on reincarnation?

179
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,469
Leave your comments below.

180
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,520
And if you’d like to generate good karma
for yourself,

181
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
so Beijing will mark you down for a top post

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,349
in the next lifetime,

183
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,349
considering contributing to China Uncensored
on Patreon.

184
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,030
