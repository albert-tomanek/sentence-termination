00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:05,759
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're
playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,769
Joining me today, he reads books you know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:09,490
“I am Kermit the Frog, and tonight, Matthew,

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,880
“I’m going to be that little flat guy from
'Frogger'!”

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,279
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,580
“Covered in resin and
brimming with juicy seeds!”

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,820
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,680
Hello YouTube Studio 1!

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,960
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can’t see it.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,920
Every fact they get right is
a point and a ding.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,060
I was too quick on the ding there, sorry.

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,220
Yep, so was I.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,460
You’re always too quick on the ding, Gary(!)

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,800
And there’s a special prize for particularly
good answers, which is:

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,720
I just conducted that in Waltz time.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,640
Today, we are talking about Benjamin Rush.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,100
Huh. Is that what happens when the shop of
Benjamins opened on Black Friday?

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,050
Yes. There’s a Benjamin Rush. Straight in.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,320
Is it street slang for a drug?
“I’ve got to get my Benjamin Rush on.”

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,860
People going round licking wax mannequins
of Ben Franklin.

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,100
That's why I’m banned from Madame Tussauds
now, obviously.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,260
“Oh, Maggie. Oh, Maggie!”

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,200
You are surprisingly close with Benjamin Franklin,
though.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Was he a friend of his?

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,740
I’ll give you a point, he was a
founding father of the United States.

26
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,900
Okay, that shows poor history on my part.

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,920
Well, to be fair there were
a lot of founding fathers.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,960
I thought you were going to say there was
a lot of Benjamins.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Both.

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Franklin... yeah.

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
- No, that’s two, Tom.
- That's two.

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,220
Counting two and saying "yes" doesn’t really
make my point.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,180
So this is America
and it’s ancient history of America,

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,640
so I’m going to go 19... 20s.

35
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,780
And the wheel spins and lands on America.

36
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,720
Take that, the colonies!

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,880
Benjamin Rush,
founding father of the United States.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,060
Yep, and if this isn’t the most interesting
thing on that man’s bio...

39
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,119
It is definitely not the most interesting
thing on this man’s bio.

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,409
Was he in the band ‘Rush’?

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,740
A: no, they’re much later,

42
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,700
and B: no, they’re Canadian.

43
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,720
Benjamin Rush was a physician.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,939
Was he an utter quack and a charlatan?

45
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,310
He was surprisingly
forward thinking for his time.

46
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,310
Amputations!

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,909
Didn’t necessarily do them.
That'd be forward thinking.

48
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,299
He was Surgeon-General
in the continental army.

49
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,090
Oh, in an army, okay, fine.

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,330
Yes, you went for the
sarky salute there, but yes.

51
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,260
You were right, you gave the man
the due respect, yeah.

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,340
'Dew respect' is what you give wet grass on
a morning.

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,060
S***, I wondered where you were going with that.
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,240
First groan of the day!

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,760
So surgeon general and innovative, in some...

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,100
I can’t get away from operations,
if it’s during the war.

57
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,600
There were some interesting prescriptions
given by this man.

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,640
Okay, laudanum?

59
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,420
Why?

60
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,400
Painkiller.

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,180
Really?

62
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,100
Yes!

63
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,160
I don’t f***ing know, but you believed it!

64
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,079
He’s like, “Well I believe you!”

65
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,109
Some kind of painkiller
or something like that, or antiseptic.

66
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:01,650
He gave supplies to a very famous expedition
after the revolution.

67
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,620
Now, I know your American history is not great.

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,239
I know bugger-all about America.

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,700
Do the words 'Lewis and Clark'
mean anything to you?

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,420
Yes, that's... Superman.

71
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,299
That was 'Lois and Clark', and that’s actually
why they called it that.

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,300
- Really?
- F***ing hell!

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,469
'Lois and Clark, the New Adventures of Superman'
was a Lewis and Clark pun.

74
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,499
So was this an expedition to Krypton?

75
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,230
It was certainly an expedition to somewhere.

76
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,060
Was it a westward one?

77
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,880
Yes, it was.

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
“Westwood!”

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,280
Not Westwood!

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,260
Two Americans set off and discover South London.

81
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,669
It was a westward expedition.
What were they hoping to find?

82
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:42,669
The Pacific.

83
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,049
Yes, absolutely right!

84
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,749
Yes, the Lewis and Clark expedition was trying
to find --

85
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:48,749
and successfully found --

86
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,239
a route through to the Pacific through American
territories.

87
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,779
Pimp My Horse And Cart.

88
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,560
It’s not the Westwood expedition!

89
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,819
And that’s just the horse.

90
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,949
Yeah, if it does that,
don’t get behind it.

91
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,439
Wait until it stands up again!

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,439
Wicked horse!

93
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:09,369
Who here actually knows who Tim Westwood is?

94
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:10,909
You underestimate them!

95
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,729
For about half the audience,
that’s just lost.

96
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:15,980
That expedition obviously had a lot of supplies

97
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,220
to get through all the way
for months and months to the Pacific

98
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,840
and their doctor was Benjamin Rush

99
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,199
or at least their initial man who gave them
the supplies.

100
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,150
What sort of thing do you give
for a months-long expedition

101
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,500
through the wilderness in 1803?

102
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,800
Opiates.

103
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
Absolutely spot on.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,360
I was going to say imodium.

105
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,820
Now, we’ll get back to you
on there in a minute, Gary.

106
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,200
But I just want to point out that,

107
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,080
yes, Turkish opium, apparently.

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
Turkish!

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,479
Not opiates, it’s Turkish opium, what was
that for?

110
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,760
Making sure you have a lovely time, darling(!)

111
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,280
You know what, I’m going to give you a point,
nervousness.

112
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,560
What, to incite it?

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,070
“I don’t think we’re panicking enough

114
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,599
“about when we’re going to get there,
hand me the opium!”

115
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:01,620
Why aren't all expeditions done on opiates?
Strong opiates!

116
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,560
Ranulph Fiennes, off his tits at
the North Pole, I’d gladly watch that.

117
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,289
Have you read any Hunter S Thompson?

118
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:10,090
The International Space Station!

119
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,140
“To Mars, on smack!”

120
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,909
Do they rate their expedition by which drug
they’re using?

121
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,820
“This feels more like an LSD trip to me,
but I don’t know.”

122
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,780
Trip! Trip!

123
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,880
Only manage one orbit, then lose interest.

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,199
Turkish opium, absolutely right.

125
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,620
You mentioned a fairly obvious joke here for
something you’d give for it.

126
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
- Imodium!
- Yes.

127
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,920
Did they have problems of the bum?

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,990
"Their meat rich diet and lack of clean water
gave them cause to use…"

129
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,800
Cork and a rubber mallet!

130
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,819
It’s the phrase 'rubber mallet'
that got me.

131
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,460
Well, you’ll not get it in far enough
on your own.

132
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,380
Can't reach round, you need the leverage.

133
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,720
You’re not going to use wood, are you?

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,060
You want that soft return on it.
...I would imagine.

135
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,040
And you’re not going to use
Timmy Mallett either, so...

136
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,680
[Timmy Mallett noise]

137
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,780
That’s one for the ’80s kids in the studio(!)

138
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,960
I thought that was the noise if you forgot
to put the cork in.

139
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,879
They weren’t called 'Imodium', it was…

140
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,189
'Ye Imodium.'

141
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:13,189
…fifty dozen of Dr Rush’s Bilious Pills.

142
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:17,039
I’d still take those now,
they sound reassuringly competent.

143
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,460
"I’m off for a Bilious."

144
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,699
They also had sort of a weather-ish name,

145
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,300
something that might cause a rumbling.

146
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
A 'Thunder Plunderer'.

147
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,140
I’m going to give you the point,
they were 'Thunder Clappers'.

148
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,120
I’m going to call them all that now anyway!

149
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,500
A brace of Thunder Clappers, no less.

150
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
What did those contain?

151
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,650
Because it won’t be senna, then,
or anything like that.

152
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,199
No, I mean, bear in mind…

153
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,229
What bungs you up?
There was a lady I used to know…

154
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,270
It wasn’t necessarily designed
to bung you up.

155
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,449
Rush believed, as you would at the time,

156
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,009
in certain theories of medicine.
What might that…

157
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,240
Purging and things like that.

158
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Oh, humours!

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
No, not humours. Surely not humours?

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,710
A little bit late for humours,

161
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,159
but it was certainly bleeding
or anything like that.

162
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,159
So leeches?

163
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,729
Stick a leech on your arse
and you get a colostomy bag!

164
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,780
Oh, the poor leech!

165
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,210
Two leeches in a pond,
one goes on the king’s wound,

166
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,150
the other one is going to be
stuck up your bum as a colostomy leech.

167
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,699
We’ve started plumbing depths
very quickly here, I’ll be honest.

168
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,860
It’s like the Human Centipede! The Leech.
Sorry.

169
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,159
It does say here:
"Even in Rush’s day and location,

170
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,379
"many physicians had abandoned
on scientific grounds that remedy."

171
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,550
Rush just kinda kept going.

172
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,260
He believed in something called Heroic Medicine.

173
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,840
Does anyone want to…

174
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,060
I know where this is going.

175
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,560
Anyone tell me what that is?

176
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,550
I don’t want any doctor with that kind of
heroic mindset,

177
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,029
thank you very much.
Who might kick my door in

178
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:51,139
and slam a leech down my throat and go,

179
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,849
“You’re saved!” and then leave.

180
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:54,960
Flashheart as your doctor.

181
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,220
“I’ve got a syringe!
And it's as hot as my pants!"

182
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,280
Is it basically when the time comes,
you say,

183
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,719
“I’m going outside now,
I may be some time,”

184
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:05,750
and then just find a tree.

185
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,710
Is this Greek influenced,

186
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,220
as in hero in Greek mythology
or something like that?

187
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,720
Absolutely right.

188
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,140
Essentially purging, vomiting,
sweating and blistering.

189
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,160
Saturday night out, really.

190
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,939
Given all that, what would you put in Dr Rush’s
Bilious Thunder Clappers?

191
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,360
Anything to do all those at once,

192
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,159
and by God would you thunder clap while that
happened.

193
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,349
This is not something that you even want to
touch these days.

194
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,680
Was it poison to force it out quicker?

195
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,740
Yes, I’ll give you the point but it’s…

196
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Mercury.

197
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,880
-- F*** me!
-- Not only that.

198
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,560
Absolutely spot on,
they were 50% mercury pills.

199
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,340
What was the other 50%?

200
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,820
Er... pill.

201
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,620
Are you okay there Gary?

202
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,600
I am such a t***.

203
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,620
Actually, the correct answer
would probably have been -

204
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,130
if we weren’t being nobs about this -

205
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,070
chalk or something like that, wouldn’t it?

206
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,740
- Yes.
- Nothing that’s going to kill you,

207
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,560
but chalk will bung you up more.

208
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,020
Not if you combine it with mercury it won't.

209
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,029
You’re right. Because chalk in flour was
a thing and that would bung you up horribly.

210
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,460
There was an interesting side effect for archaeologists.
I mean other than…

211
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Shining bits?

212
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,380
- I didn't... no...!
- A shining trail of breadcrumbs!

213
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,060
Behave(!) Ooh, no.

214
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,350
Because mercury is silver and shiny,
isn’t it?

215
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,730
Is it horrifically dangerous
to do archaeological excavations

216
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,470
on burial sites from these people where they
died along the way?

217
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,529
'Cos their bodies and skeletons are going
to be full of quicksilver mercury.

218
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,290
If you touch it with bare hands it will seep
into your skin

219
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,060
and also give you the heaving s***s?

220
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,020
As we archaeologists call it.

221
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,840
That’s a man who looks through archives
for a living, there.

222
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,920
It’s true, there’s certain things I have
to be careful with, if it's been...

223
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,360
Black Death, 'yersinia pestis',
is very, very contagious.

224
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,470
If you discover a black death burial site

225
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,300
you have to immediately run away
lest you get ill.

226
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,760
Because a lot of people got buried
in lead coffins.

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,029
And of course lead,
the body just corrodes in it

228
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:08,220
and just turns into a bit of a sludge,

229
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,899
but the disease persists within and it is
very persistent

230
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,300
hence why it kills a quarter of the population
if it gets out.

231
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,759
So, there are certain plague burials where
you just run a mile

232
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,270
if you think it’s black death.

233
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,250
So that could happen with
a quicksilver-imbued skeleton.

234
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,750
Ha, not so stupid now!

235
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,740
I like the idea you run a mile,

236
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,630
thus spreading black death for a mile. That's...

237
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,590
How do you think it worked in the first place?

238
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,310
They were able to trace the expedition
a century or more later

239
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,760
by the trail of mercury they left behind.

240
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,940
- By their middens.
- Mercury breadcrumbs.

241
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,000
What other reforms did he try and bring through?

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
Mobile phone.

243
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,360
Yes, it’s a telegraph that you have to
wire up as you go behind you.

244
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,500
That’s pretty much how they lay telegraphs,
yes.

245
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
...fair.

246
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,020
Did he introduce 'Hungry Hungry Hippos'?

247
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,860
To medicine? What is the function of
'Hungry Hungry Hippos' in medicine?

248
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,410
"He who winneth the most pills
liveth the longest."

249
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,660
Whoa, competitive. Wow.

250
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,320
So what you’re saying is the modern American
medical system

251
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,680
is entirely based on 'Hungry Hungry Hippos'.

252
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,800
Who has the most gets the best care.

253
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,980
Yes. Satire.

254
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,770
Was he against lobotomies?

255
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,180
It’s not actually medical reform.

256
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,390
So it could have been 'Hungry Hungry Hippos'.

257
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,670
Bearing in mind he was a founding father,

258
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,209
he was also a politician, and it says here,

259
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,430
'educator, social reformer and humanitarian'.

260
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,430
Slavery.

261
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,310
Yes, he was anti-slavery.

262
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,950
But pro-mercury.

263
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,579
Yes! Yes...

264
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,910
I didn’t realise there was anyone anti-slavery
that early.

265
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,870
Yes, they fought a civil war over it.

266
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,490
Did they?

267
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:50,480
One of the arguments of the American Revolution
was, "do we allow slavery?"

268
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,139
It’s like having a major royal
sat next to me! “Really?”

269
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,319
“How very interesting!”

270
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:00,759
There are actually some
interesting headings here,

271
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,680
because we have anti-slavery,

272
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,769
and then capital punishment,
which he was also against,

273
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:08,399
they just haven’t put the word
'anti' in the title.

274
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,220
That’s one hell of a relative.

275
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,880
Auntie Capital Punishment...!

276
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,800
Morning! Whoomph.

277
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah, along with 'Uncle Pillory'...

278
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,310
and 'Cousin Swift-Kick-in-the-Bollocks'.

279
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,850
These things work on a kind of bilateral thing,

280
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,440
so either massively for or massively against.

281
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Mmm. Place your bets now.

282
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,300
- Okay.
- Going full Banzai on us!

283
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,639
He’s been anti-slavery, anti-capital punishment,

284
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,910
got to be pro-purging so I’m going go…

285
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,769
Not in like the movie of The Purge sense,

286
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:44,769
just to be clear here,

287
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,470
because you brought that in from nowhere.

288
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,130
Pro-purgatives... I’m going to say he was
pro-ladies.

289
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,950
Correct.

290
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,010
Flip a coin! One or the other!

291
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,259
He was instrumental to the founding of the
Young Ladies Academy of Philadelphia.

292
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,100
Fillies in Philly?

293
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,200
Yes, he proposed, er, a...

294
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:12,220
You t***.

295
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,279
I mean, don’t get me wrong, that’s genius.

296
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,460
The first chartered women’s institution
of higher education in Philadelphia.

297
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,630
What did he think women
should be trained in?

298
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,580
Kung fu!

299
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,760
Not exactly.

300
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,329
Driving a steam engine. Building wardrobes.

301
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:34,700
That thing where you balance a golf ball on
the end of the golf club

302
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,610
and then you hoy it up and then hit it.

303
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,060
Scuba diving. We can go all day.

304
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,780
Precision cake throwing.

305
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,480
Slightly closer.

306
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,329
Those John Virgo trick shots where you get
a snooker ball

307
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,990
to go into a little wine cooler thing.

308
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,879
That bit from 'Full Metal Jacket',

309
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,970
where he’s obsessively stripping the rifle
and chanting to himself.

310
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,880
Is it something like etiquette for the ladies?

311
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,640
Not quite that far.

312
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:00,649
Good housekeeping.

313
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:01,910
No, it wasn’t quite that.

314
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,910
Armed combat.

315
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,910
I started there.

316
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,690
Okay, here’s a line, here’s armed combat,
here’s etiquette...

317
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,690
About here.

318
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,320
Oh! Oh! Nice combat.

319
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,519
- Unarmed combat!
- "I'm terribly sorry." Boompf!

320
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,319
Witty repartee!
Biting and scathing comebacks, but politely,

321
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,269
so the fellow doesn’t notice it’s happened.

322
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,060
He just, about two days later,
wakes up in the middle of the night

323
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,240
with a growing sense of ennui

324
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,290
and realised he missed his chance forever.

325
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,460
Sorry, got autobiographical there.
Back in the room.

326
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,079
Coquettish waving of fans to avoid embarrassment.

327
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,579
Moral essays, poetry and religious writings

328
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:41,639
and history, which you know presumably you
didn’t, er…

329
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,040
He’s not a lady!

330
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
I don’t know if it's escaped your notice
but…

331
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,769
What did he think women shouldn’t be pushed
towards?

332
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,120
Kung Fu! Precision cake throwing! All the
same jokes!

333
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,340
- The Bessemer steel process!
- Let's move on!

334
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,700
Cliff edges!

335
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,080
Who’s he?

336
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,840
Rough, uncouth types.

337
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,080
Hey up.

338
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,980
Mathematics, logic, advanced science.

339
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,190
So ladies of the room, how many of you would
not qualify?

340
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,640
Benjamin Rush is the father of…

341
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,000
Of his children!

342
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,760
…of American… something.

343
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880
Baseball.

344
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,780
A discipline in... medicine, I guess.

345
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,800
Anaesthesia.

346
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,829
Bowel cleanage.

347
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:30,430
It’s nothing really to do with the body,
as such.

348
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,400
So a medical process that’s not to do with
the body?

349
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,390
Is it like blind testing
or something like that,

350
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,589
actual research rather than just poking?

351
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,329
I mean it is to do with a bit of the body,

352
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,019
but you would say this was not a
physical thing to fix these days.

353
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,019
This would be something else.

354
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,120
Psychiatry, mental health,
something like that.

355
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,439
Yes, absolutely right, spot on with the word,

356
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:47,889
the father of American psychiatry.

357
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:50,790
What did he think was a good way to cure "insanity"?

358
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,420
That’s the phrasing they’ve used here.

359
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,660
Electroshock treatment.

360
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,259
No, too early for that,
much too early for that.

361
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:59,259
I don’t think at this point Benjamin Franklin
had been shocked by his kite yet.

362
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,680
“Look at the size of this kite!”

363
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,820
“I’m going to go flying in the rain right
now while holding a brass key.”

364
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,470
A good hard slap to the face.
“Sort yourself out, man!”

365
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,540
Remember what he already believed in.

366
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,820
Mercury?

367
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,920
Point. It was called 'calomel', if anyone
knows that that is.

368
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,480
That’s dangerously close to 'caramel'

369
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,790
in a hilarious mix up in a chocolate factory,
isn’t it?

370
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,560
Yes, it’s mercurous chloride. So, like,
don’t eat Cadbury's Calomel.

371
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,240
How did he convince his patients who were
suffering from,

372
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,220
and again I’m using the word here, "insanity",
to eat mercury?

373
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,819
Wrap it in ham.

374
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,190
♪ Wrap it in ham... ♪

375
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,870
You’re close.

376
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,129
Wrap it in cheese.

377
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:44,329
Yeah, I’m going to give you the point,

378
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,779
"sprinkling a few grains of mercury daily
on a piece of bread

379
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,500
"and then spreading a thin covering of butter
over it."

380
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,380
He believed that mental illnesses were caused
by disruptions of blood circulation.

381
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,699
So how might you get some more blood
to the brain?

382
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:59,470
Did he throw people in cold water

383
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,150
or something like that to increase circulation?

384
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,734
That would be slightly more sensible than
what we’ve got here.

385
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:05,734
Hang them upside down.

386
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,130
Yes, sleep them like a bat.

387
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,040
A powered warming hat!

388
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,240
"Sleep them like a bat..."

389
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,420
I'm gonna let that go by.

390
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,080
I’m going to give you a point,

391
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,130
it was a sensory deprivation head enclosure.

392
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,150
F*** off, no.

393
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,870
So a tin hat with no eye holes?

394
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,130
Are you saying he invented the bucket?

395
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,830
And the process of placing it on someone?

396
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:31,390
He also had a more physical way of getting
blood to the brain.

397
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,420
Is it like when you’ve got an ice pop

398
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,280
and you’ve got the juice at the bottom and
you want it to the top,

399
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,440
so you have to go fneeeeer with the leg

400
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,360
and it’s just forcing the blood up through
the body?

401
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,460
Okay, I’m not going to give you a point
but you are right.

402
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,900
Moving tourniquet is probably an easy way
of describing that.

403
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,440
Not quite, it was a way…

404
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Static tourniquet!

405
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,340
…to force blood up to the head.

406
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,160
Is it like that machine at the end of
'The Princess Bride',

407
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,330
where you put suction cups on it and it’s
water powered

408
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,710
but instead of sucking life it just pulls
the blood through you?

409
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,830
I’m going to give you the point, it’s…

410
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,830
A vacuum.

411
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,350
It’s not a vacuum or it’s not anything
like that,

412
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,860
but it is a spinning machine…

413
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,640
Human centrifuge!

414
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
…that you strap someone to and spin them
round like that

415
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,760
and that was how he thought
you cured mental illnesses.

416
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,880
Oh, yes please!

417
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,040
Did it work?

418
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,980
No.

419
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,640
This strikes me as medicine in the form of
a Shooting Stars end game.

420
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,000
He actually had a thing called
the 'Moral Thermometer'.

421
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,430
And he was way off it.

422
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,620
The more blood you have in your brain,
the better off you would be.

423
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,320
Is this like one of those love testers you
get in bars,

424
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,770
you put your hand on it, if it's a warm hand,

425
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,000
but a cold hand:
"moral turpitude, he must be hung!"

426
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,020
He was against the death penalty
so there wasn’t...

427
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,980
"He must be roundly shunned."

428
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,960
"And put in a bucket."

429
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,240
At the end of the show, congratulations Gary,
you win this week.

430
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,500
You win...

431
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,620
Brace yourselves.

432
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,620
You win an express trip to see
the buttock cleavage of one of 'Tenacious D'.

433
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Yep.

434
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
No!

435
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,820
It’s 'Jack Black’s Fast Track Ass Crack'.
Do enjoy that.

436
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,140
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel!

437
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
Bye then!

438
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,620
to Gary Brannan,

439
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,480
to Matt Gray.

440
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,160
I’ve been Tom Scott,
we’ll see you next time.

441
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
Thank you, folks!

442
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Ee, that were gradely.
