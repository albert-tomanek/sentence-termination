1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,330
Huawei maaaaybe can’t be trusted.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,640
China sets its sights on Mars

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,290
And Microwaves!

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,230
They can do more than just heat your food

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,900
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,680
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,010

00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,470
This week’s China news headlines!

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,470
Huawei.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,470
The Chinese telecom company

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,589
that wants you to know that it’s a totally
private company

15
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,350
that absolutely does not coordinate

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,679
with the Chinese Communist Party.

17
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,489
Have you ever given any information

18
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,100
to the Chinese government

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,370
in any way, shape, or form?

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,710
For the past 30 years,

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,879
we have never done that,

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,059
and in the next 30 years to come,

23
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,420
we will never do that.

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,379
Ok, of that reporter’s not going to say
it, I will.

25
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,519
Ren Zhengfei is lying.

26
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,519
There.

27
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:03,519
I said it.

28
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,719
He’s a bald-face lying liar.

29
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,350
Of course Huawei shares information

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,439
with the Chinese government!

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,140
In fact, experts told CNBC that

32
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,820
“Huawei would have no choice

33
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,729
but to hand over network data to the Chinese
government

34
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,640
if Beijing asked for it,

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,200
because of espionage and national security
laws in the country.”

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,049
They’re talking about the 2014 Counter-Espionage
Law

37
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,619
and the 2017 National Intelligence Law.

38
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,420
Article 7 of the National Intelligence Law
says,

39
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,829
“Any organization or citizen shall support,

40
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:37,149
assist and cooperate with the state intelligence
work

41
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,329
in accordance with the law.”

42
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,609
Basically what that means is that if the Chinese
state

43
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,189
asks you for *anything*,

44
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,070
you need to comply.

45
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,789
The 2014 Counter-Espionage Law says,

46
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,219
“When the state security organ investigates

47
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,090
and understands the situation of espionage

48
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,390
and collects relevant evidence,

49
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,560
the relevant organizations and individuals

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,319
shall provide it truthfully and may not refuse.”

51
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,329
That basically says the same thing—

52
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,700
using the excuse of national security.

53
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,929
So Huawei would obviously need to give up

54
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,990
any information the Communist Party wants.

55
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,810
And even if there weren’t already laws that
said that,

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,900
the Party is perfectly capable of making them
do it anyway,

57
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,590
since there is no meaningful rule of law in
China.

58
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,710
I mean honestly,

59
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,350
do you think these guys would take no for
an answer?

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,690
According to Council on Foreign Relations

61
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,209
adjunct senior fellow Jerome Cohen,

62
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,050
“Not only is this mandated by existing legislation
but,

63
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,459
more important, also by political reality...

64
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,120
The Party is embedded in Huawei and controls
it.”

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,909
Which is why Congress passed a bill

66
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,629
that bans the US government from using Huawei
technology.

67
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,780
And that’s why Huawei has sued the US government.

68
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,849
They say it violates their constitutional
rights

69
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,610
for congress to punish them without a fair
trial.

70
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,000
To which I say...

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,430
I can’t wait to see what turns up during
that fair trial.

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,430


73
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,790
So Huawei might not be at the top of the list

74
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,650
to build America’s 5G network.

75
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,130
But that doesn’t mean China

76
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,200
won’t be bombarding us with something!

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,180
According to my favorite Chinese state run
media,

78
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,530
the Global Times,

79
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,420
China has developed a weapons system

80
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,459
based on microwaves.

81
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,519
It’s non-lethal.

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,060
It just stimulates nerves to cause excruciating
pain.

83
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,060
The weapon can be focused on an individual
or a group.

84
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,890
It can even be mounted on cars.

85
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,409
Huh, if I didn’t know better,

86
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,140
I’d say maybe this was the weapon

87
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,879
used to make those US Embassy workers in Cuba
and China

88
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,819
experience severe pain.

89
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,650
But I can’t imagine there’s a connection.

90
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,439
Anyway, I wouldn’t want you to be think
that

91
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,250
the Chinese Communist Party is gearing up

92
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,120
to attack foreign countries.

93
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,220
Honestly, they don’t have time.

94
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,370
They’re too busy creating a harmonious Chinese
society

95
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,010
through systems of mass control.

96
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,870
Chinese authorities have made great progress

97
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,180
building their social credit system.

98
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
And last year,

99
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,150
they successfully stopped millions of citizens

100
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,409
from traveling because of a low social credit
score.

101
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,190
According to the National Public Credit Information
Center

102
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,570
Chinese courts banned people from 17.5 million
flights

103
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,610
and 5.5 million train rides in 2018.

104
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,520
I just hope they found out *before* they got
to the airport.

105
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,150
But there’s one trip everyone in China is
waiting for:

106
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,210
The trip to Mars.

107
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,860
“Next year, China will launch its Mars probe,

108
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,780
which is expect to encircle,

109
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,330
land on and explore the Mars.”

110
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,430
It’s not just any Mars.

111
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,330
It’s “The Mars”.

112
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,410
This probe will be unmanned.

113
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,170
But it could bring China one step closer to
being

114
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,100
the first country to land a man on mars…

115
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,920
that a bunch of people on the Internet

116
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,540
will say was faked in a film studio.

117
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,230
Speaking of impossible trips,

118
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,160
the United Nations investigator on religious
freedom

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,560
would sure like to make a trip to China’s
Xinjiang region—

120
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,910
to look into those re-education camps.

121
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,100
I mean there’s a rumor going around that

122
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,040
instead of them being about re-education

123
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,980
to learn job skills,

124
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,490
the camps are more about re-education to be
loyal to the Party.

125
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,910
Because nothing makes you more loyal than
getting tortured.

126
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,920
More than a million ethnic Uighur Muslims
are in the camps,

127
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,560
so I think it’s best figure out what’s
really going on there.

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,740
The UN investigator made his visitation request
in February,

129
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,330
but Chinese authorities still haven’t responded.

130
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,050
I’m sure they’ll get on that soon.

131
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,060
Of course, China sits on the UN Human Rights
Council,

132
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,680
so maybe China can just send its own representative
instead.

133
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
And finally,

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,940
last year we told you that some local officials
in China

135
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,380
had told Christians to replace pictures of
Jesus

136
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,580
with pictures of Xi Jinping.

137
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,890
And I’m sure you were wondering,

138
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,920
“How could they possibly do this?...

139
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,100
only to Christians and not to *all* religious
believers?”

140
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Well don’t worry,

141
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,330
it was just an oversight,

142
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,020
and the Communist Party is working on it.

143
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,030
In round two,

144
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,080
Tibetans are being told to put their Buddha
statues aside

145
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,790
and replace them with Xi Jinping.

146
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,830
Photos of Xi Jinping.

147
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,970
Not statues of Xi Jinping meditating.

148
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,820
Too creepy.

149
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,240
And before you go, it’s time when I answer
a question

150
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,210
from a fan of the show who supports China
Uncensored

151
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,530
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

152
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,220
Coralline Algae asks,

153
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,040
“Does China have any adversaries

154
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,300
in South or Central America?”

155
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Adversaires?!

156
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
What?!

157
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
No!

158
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,220
The Chinese Communist Party makes friends
wherever it goes.

159
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,690
Especially in poor authoritarian dictatorships.

160
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,750
China’s presence in Latin America began
in 2001,

161
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,751
when Venezuela became the first Latin American
country

162
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:57,400
to enter a “strategic development partnership,”
with China.

163
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,970
And look how well that turned out!

164
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,190
Since 2001,

165
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,720
trade between China and most Latin American
countries

166
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,380
has skyrocketed.

167
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,040
So really, things are just getting better
and better for everyone.

168
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,270
Probably.

169
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
Maybe.

170
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,450
Of course, considering the Chinese regime’s
playbook—

171
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,230
where they get a country in debt,

172
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,270
take their resources,

173
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,780
and help brutal dictators control their own
people—

174
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,560
there could come a day when some of these

175
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,980
“strategic partners” in Latin America
become adversaries.

176
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,140
Thanks for your question, Coralline.

177
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,520
So why am I answering questions on the show?

178
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,800
It’s because companies that are “strategic
partners” of China

179
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,530
don’t dare to work with a show

180
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,430
that criticizes the Chinese Communist Party.

181
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,460
So we rely on support from viewers like you

182
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,100
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

183
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,550
Answering your questions on the show

184
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,560
is one of my ways of saying thank you.

185
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,440
So head over to patreon.com/chinaucnensored

186
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,490
to find out how you can keep China, uncensored.

187
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,490
Thanks for watching.

188
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,890
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.
