1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,200
China declares war on Bitcoin.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,400
Their reason?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,240
Not what you’d expect...

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,880
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Good news! The Chinese Communist\h
Party has found something new\h\h

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,920
to declare war on. This time it’s\h
crypto mining. Stirring wider fear...

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
...into a porridge of peril.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,680
This is a big deal for Bitcoin, which\h
is the most popular cryptocurrency.\h

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,640
That’s because “China accounts for around\h
65% of all Bitcoin mining globally.”

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,560
“In comparison, the United States accounts\h\h

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,080
for 7.2% of global Bitcoin mining.” 
I’ll explain why that is in a bit.\h

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,640
But the Chinese Communist\h
Party is not a fan of Bitcoin.

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
“Bitcoin are created and moved around not\h
by a central bank or financial institution\h\h

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,000
but by a broad and disparate network of\h
computers,” on what’s called a blockchain.\h

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,240
Bitcoin operates entirely outside of China’s\h
Central Bank or Communist Party control. It gives\h\h

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,040
Chinese people a way to use money completely\h
free from oversight by the government.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,280
So if you’re, say, a Chinese\h
dissident, the Communist Party\h\h

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,720
can make the bank freeze your savings account.\h
But they can’t freeze your Bitcoin assets.

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,080
But that’s not why the Communist Party is cracking\h
down on Bitcoin mining. No, no, no. It's cracking\h\h

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,320
down, because the Communist Party wants to\h
save the environment. More after the break.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,080
Welcome back. Unless you didn’t see an ad,\h
in which case YouTube may have demonetized\h\h

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,240
us. That’s why China Uncensored relies\h
mainly on viewer support. Which reminds me,\h\h

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,360
did you know we accept Bitcoin? Visit\h
chinauncensored.tv/support to learn more.

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,840
So China has declared war on crypto mining.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,720
In order to help the environment,\h
you see. You might be thinking—WHAT?!\h\h

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Well, it makes total sense.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,080
Simply put, Bitcoin mining is a process\h
where people can run powerful computers\h\h

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,720
to solve complex math problems\h
that validate Bitcoin transactions.\h\h

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
They're rewarded with Bitcoins. This\h
is how new Bitcoins are created.\h

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,160
And the computers doing that Bitcoin\h
mining requires a huge amount of energy,\h\h

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,600
more than entire countries\h
like Ukraine and Argentina.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,520
And as I said, China makes up about\h
65% of all Bitcoin mining globally.\h

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,680
And the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia alone\h
“accounts for about 8%, due to its cheap energy.”

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,640
Which is why Inner Mongolia is\h
not only banning Bitcoin mining,\h\h

35
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
but also banning any new digital coin projects.

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,440
You see, Chinese leader Xi Jinping promised,\h\h

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,400
promised the UN that China will be\h
carbon neutral within four decades.

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,160
You can make that kind of long-term promise\h
when you have the power to rule indefinitely.

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,880
But becoming carbon neutral is going to be tough,\h\h

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,520
considering China burns more coal\h
than the rest of the world combined.

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,960
So yeah, Xi could have reined in the\h
number of new coal plants they’re building.

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,040
But banning Bitcoin mining instead—that\h
just makes so much more sense.\h\h

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,240
For purely environmental reasons.\h

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,160
A few weeks ago, China’s top economic planner\h
released this statement blasting Inner Mongolia\h\h

45
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,000
not meeting energy targets.

46
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
So they had to ban Bitcoin mining\h
you see. For the environment.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,480
This has led to a surge in the price of Bitcoin.

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Did I mention we take Bitcoin?

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,840
So you can see, the Chinese\h
Communist Party has nothing\h\h

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
at all against Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,720
In fact, they love the idea so much, the\h
Party wants to make its own digital currency!

52
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,960
More after the break.

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,480
Welcome back.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
So I wouldn’t want you to think the\h
Chinese Communist Party has something\h\h

55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
against Bitcoin. Sure they’ve\h
declared war on Bitcoin mining.

56
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
And in 2017 they banned cryptocurrency exchanges.

57
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,720
For the environment…?

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,560
But as the New York Times recently reported,\h\h

59
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,600
China is charging ahead with a National Digital\h
Currency, called the e-Chinese-yuan. (eCNY)

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,360
China’s central bank began testing\h
it in four cities last year.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,720
And now it’s being brought to bigger\h
cities like Shanghai and Beijing.

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:07,680
“In my hand is the new digital RMB. It’s held\h
inside a digital wallet on an app on my phone.”

63
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,200
Held by Mao Zedong, who’s\h
watching you from the grave.

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
But China’s digital currency\h
is like the anti-Bitcoin.

65
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Because while Bitcoin uses blockchain\h
technology that keeps transactions anonymous,\h\h

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,520
China’s digital currency...does not\h
do that. In fact, Chinese authorities\h\h

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,960
can see every transaction you\h
make with the digital yuan.\h

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:39,600
China’s digital currency is not actually a\h
cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies by definition use\h\h

69
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,680
a decentralized system to record transactions.\h
That keeps the records from being manipulated.

70
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,400
But China’s digital currency uses a\h
centralized system. It’s controlled by\h\h

71
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,480
the Chinese Central Bank, and ultimately\h
by the Chinese Communist Party itself.\h\h

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,000
But it *feels* kind of like cryptocurrency,\h
so it’s the same thing, right?

73
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,280
The digital yuan could “give the\h
Chinese government more power\h\h

74
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,440
to monitor finance flows because a digital\h
currency system can record every transaction.”

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
“[It] can make it easier for governments\h
to track financial transactions\h\h

76
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,920
to stamp out tax evasion and\h
crack down on dissidents.”

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
Those two things definitely\h
belong in the same sentence.

78
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,680
And believe it or not, it gets better.

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,000
“It will give the central\h
bank new powers, including\h\h

80
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
novel types of monetary policy\h
to help the economy grow.”\h

81
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,160
“In one possibility that economists have\h
discussed, a central bank could program\h\h

82
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,920
its digital currency to slowly lose value so that\h
consumers are encouraged to spend it immediately.”

83
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
Great! I hate wasting all my money on savings.\h\h

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
Well gosh, how long until we can\h
have that in the United States?!\h

85
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,680
A bunch of countries are experimenting\h
with a national digital currency,\h\h

86
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
“Yet no major power is as far along as China.\h\h

87
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,040
Its early moves could signal where the rest\h
of the world goes with digital currencies.”

88
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,200
The New York Times always\h
manages to fill me with hope.\h

89
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,720
You know, the Chinese Communist Party\h
has for years been trying to weaponize\h\h

90
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,800
its currency and defeat the US dollar. And\h
now some say the digital yuan could help.

91
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,960
But will the yuan be able to defeat the\h
dollar as the global currency? That’s a whole\h\h

92
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,840
nother episode. Let me know in the comments\h
below if you’d like to see us do that one.\h

93
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,920
And now it’s time for me to answer questions from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,920
fans who support China Uncensored on\h
the crowd funding website Patreon.

95
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,320
James Wallberg asks, “Chris when the CCP falls\h
do you think China will stay a single country\h\h

96
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,280
or split up into several smaller ones?\h
To quote Romance of the Three Kingdoms.\h\h

97
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,640
"That which is divided must unite,\h
that which is united must divide."

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,760
First of all James, Romance of the Three\h
Kingdoms is one of my favorite books,\h\h

99
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,560
and definitely my favorite\h
of the four Chinese classics.\h\h

100
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,840
I highly recommend reading it if you\h
haven’t. Or at least play Dynasty Warriors.

101
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,400
But what happens after the CCP\h
falls is a very good question.\h\h

102
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,400
China has existed for thousands of years.\h
Despite so many different dynasties,\h\h

103
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,920
over the last two millennia there has always\h
been something that eventually unified people\h\h

104
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,240
into the country we call China. That will\h
surely continue even after the CCP falls.\h\h

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,000
However, regions like Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang,\h
Tibet—places that have not always been\h\h

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,800
historically part of China—they might become\h
their own independent countries again.

107
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
Thanks for your question James.

108
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,840
And thank you for watching. Once again\h
I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
