00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,610
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,150
a fission is forming between the UK and China.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,660
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,289
You know, when I think of nuclear technology,

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,869
I think of one thing.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,180
Ok, I think of two things.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,560
"What do I do? What do I do?

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,400
In the name of God you got to tell me!"

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,280
Ok, I think of three things.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,640
The third thing is China.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,310
China has been investing billions of dollars
in foreign countries,

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:41,850
including buying stakes in things like power
plants, water utilities, and electrical grids.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,260
I guess they're so good at being a developing
country,

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,289
that they've decided to develop other countries,
too.

15
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,280
Let's talk about the power plants.

16
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,780
Though you might know China for its investment
in clean energy,

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,260
the Chinese regime actually wants to help
the United Kingdom

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,580
build its dream nuclear power plant.

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,110
The state-owned China General Nuclear Power

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,449
promised to put up about a third of the cost

21
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,350
for the $23 billion dollar state-of-the-art
facility at Hinkley Point in England.

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,750
If completed, it could provide electricity
for nearly 6 million homes.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,380
It will also be the world's first power plant

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,500
that apologizes profusely every time it lets
off steam.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh dear, I’m terribly sorry about that.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,310
Now, a lot of people thought this was a good
idea.

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,689
“I think this is going to be a very important
moment for British-Chinese relations

28
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,710
which are in a very good state,

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,450
something of a golden era in our relationship.”

30
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,350
A golden era?

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:46,150
Maybe, possibly, the guy who just caused the
biggest geopolitical divorce in modern history,

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,409
might not be the best judge of relationships.

33
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,530
Although, when your first and second dates
are both of the Opium Wars,

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,939
I guess your relationship can only go up from
there.

35
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:56,939
Yeah.

36
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,320
Anyway, the Hinkley Point nuclear deal

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,270
seems much less glowy now,

38
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,630
because there's a new prime minister in town.

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,920
Just as investors gathered to finalized the
agreement,

40
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,080
the new British Prime Minister Theresa May

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,220
said she needed some time to think about it
first.

42
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,650
Uh oh.

43
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,450
Guys, here's some China Uncensored relationship
advice.

44
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,340
When you ask your strategic partner for a
commitment

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,980
whether you do it with a diamond ring,

46
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,750
or say, a stake in a 23 billion dollar nuclear
power plant

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,420
and she says she has to think about it first,

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,610
that's not the best sign.

49
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,090
You see, last year, while Britain’s then-Prime
Minister David Cameron

50
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,970
and China’s leader Xi Jinping were having
a stag night at the local Pig 'n' Whistle,

51
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,250
current-Prime Minister Theresa May’s advisor
wrote this editorial.

52
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,040
He wrote that British Intelligence felt

53
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,750
“the intelligence services of…China…continue
to work against UK interests at home and abroad.”

54
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,510
And he warned that if a Chinese state-run
corporation

55
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,410
had access to the computers at the Hinkley
Point reactor,

56
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,610
China could “shut down Britain’s energy
production at will.”

57
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,610
Which is kind of like

58
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,600
giving someone the keys to your house and
your car after the third date.

59
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,090
Only, then there’s just a risk of an emotional
meltdown.

60
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,760
Maybe that’s why Prime Minister May has
a so-called

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,380
“general prejudice” against Chinese investment.

62
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,110
You know who else might have a “general
prejudice?”

63
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,720
The United States.

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,200
Because just after Prime Minister May delayed
the nuclear deal, this story broke.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,530
Apparently the same Chinese state-owned company

66
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,780
that wants to invest in Hinkley Point

67
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,760
is facing charges of nuclear espionage from
the US Department of Justice.

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,890
China General Nuclear Power is being accused

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,680
of stealing nuclear technology research from
the US

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,670
to help speed up its production of Chinese
reactors

71
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,940
for almost twenty years.

72
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,129
That's...also not the best sign.

73
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:58,930
So what do you think of the Hinkley Point
nuclear plant?

74
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,019
Should the UK put a ring on it?

75
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,490
Leave your comments below.

76
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,599
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

77
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:07,500
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
