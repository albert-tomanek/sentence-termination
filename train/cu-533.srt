1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,560
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,200
China’s housing market.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,910
It’s grown up so fast.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,620
China’s real estate boom is now

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,260
in its teenage years,

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,960
and you know what that means:

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,050
It’s constantly getting into trouble.

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,400
China is building real estate

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,960
faster than beavers build dams.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,770
That is, faster than beavers

12
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,949
with chainsaws and backhoes build dams.

13
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,330
Obscure Chinese cities you’ve probably never
heard of

14
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,090
look like this.

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,380
And this.

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,460
And this.

17
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,170
It’s because China’s manufacturing industry

18
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,280
has expanded so quickly over the past few
decades.

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,460
That’s pushed hundreds of millions of people

20
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,480
to move from the countryside to the cities.

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Fun fact:

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,940
More than 100 Chinese cities

23
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,480
now have over a million people.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,820
Compare that to just 10 cities in the United
States

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,910
with over a million.

26
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,590
Sorry, San Francisco.

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,450
You’re gonna need another 140,000 more tech
bros

28
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,170
to make it to a million.

29
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,280
And is it really worth it?

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,239
Anyway, with so many Chinese people

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,700
moving to the cities...

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,840
“Big boom’ is the result.”

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,220
That will never get old.

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,049
The problem with big booms, though,

35
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,619
is that they’re often followed by devastating
busts.

36
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:16,619
In the US,

37
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,509
housing prices saw a boom after 2000,

38
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,460
when mortgage rates dropped.

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,460
Then in 2008,

40
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,729
there was a huge crash.

41
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,820
Big cities have recovered,

42
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,250
but most of the country hasn’t.

43
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,310
So could this kind of crash happen in China?

44
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,320
Some economists say it already has.

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,680
“The bubble has broken.

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
That's it.

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,159
They overbuilt.”

48
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,960
Prices are falling in many top cities.

49
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,640
But let state-run China Global Television
Network assure you,

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,719
everything’s going to be just fine.

51
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,189
“We’ve been talking about a bubble for
many,

52
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,280
many years.

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,609
But it continues to grow bigger and bigger.

54
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,460
And it never seems to burst.”

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,999
Yes, it never seems to burst.

56
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,399
Which is surely proof that it never will burst.

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,399
“Buy a beautiful volcano view home in Pompeii,

58
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,389
the city where nothing ever goes wrong!”

59
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,990
There are two main reasons

60
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,120
for China’s real estate boom.

61
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,030
One is that more people are living in cities
now

62
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,980
than ever before in Chinese history.

63
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,690
This chart shows that when former leader Deng
Xiaoping

64
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,940
began his famous “Reform and Opening Up,”

65
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,360
just 18% of people lived in cities.

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,540
Now that figure is 57%.

67
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,959
And current leader Xi Jinping

68
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,490
hopes to reach 60% by 2020.

69
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,150
But the problem is that a lot of the housing

70
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,710
isn’t being bought by new homeowners—

71
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,349
young families from the countryside

72
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,260
starting a new life in the city.

73
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,200
Those migrant workers are often renting

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,170
cheap apartments on the outskirts of the city.

75
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,380
Or in places like these underground bunkers
in Beijing.

76
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,159
No, a lot of the new homes

77
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,620
are being snapped up by China’s growing
class

78
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,950
of nouveau riche—

79
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,400
people who’ve recently earned a lot of money

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,010
and are looking for places to invest.

81
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,430
This is the deeper reason why

82
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,670
real estate prices keep going up and up and
up.

83
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,079
Chinese people have no other good places

84
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,970
to invest their money.

85
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,150
The Chinese bond market is weak.

86
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,599
The Chinese stock markets can best be described

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,689
as Las Vegas casinos but without the tasty
buffets.

88
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:17,340
And the latest investment trend—

89
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,690
Wealth Management Products—

90
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,390
can be as opaque as a window painted black

91
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,390
covered in a curtain

92
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,409
in front of a brick wall.

93
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,830
Plus, there are severe limits on how much
Chinese people

94
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,080
can invest overseas.

95
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,250
So where do you park a million dollars?

96
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,080
Real estate.

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
For example,

98
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,110
Shanghai resident Miranda Chen,

99
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,870
who was interviewed by Vice.

100
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,329
“Ms. Chen and her husband have purchased

101
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,989
two Shanghai apartments in the last few years.

102
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,349
They’re now on their hunt for their third.”

103
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,840
This is not what the Chinese government wants.

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,049
As state-media says...

105
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,659
“Authorities in China are sending a clear
message.”

106
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,829
“The property markets should provide homes
for people,

107
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:01,390
not investment vehicles for the rich.”

108
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,890
So to cool this out-of-control housing boom,

109
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,590
the government has implemented various restrictions.

110
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,099
For example, to discourage people

111
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,700
like Ms. Chen and her husband,

112
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,530
last year Shanghai added a requirement

113
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,430
that second-time buyers must make

114
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,829
a 70% down payment

115
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,890
instead of China’s typical 40%.

116
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,710
But not to worry;

117
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,360
they found a loophole.

118
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,530
“If you were married, and already owned
a property,

119
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,890
you would have to pay a huge down payment

120
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,740
for the next one.

121
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,480
So eventually it was recommended by our friends

122
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,390
that we file for divorce legally.”

123
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,750
Yes, they actually got divorced

124
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,560
so they could buy an investment property

125
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,780
with a smaller down payment.

126
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,290
Shanghai has since closed that loophole.

127
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,320
And they’ve also implemented other restrictions

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,540
to cool off the investmentment market.

129
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,880
Those include capping prices

130
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
on certain new developments,

131
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,220
and requiring buyers to use their real names

132
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,840
instead of using shell companies

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,660
to get around limits on second homes.

134
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,440
Beijing has implemented similar restrictions

135
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,830
to discourage second and third homes.

136
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,330
In Beijing, the average two-bedroom,

137
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,290
1,000 square foot condo sells for a whopping

138
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,730
$1.2 million dollars.

139
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,050
In one downtown neighborhood,

140
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,000
the average housing price has tripled

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,450
since 2010.

142
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,630
23 other major cities have also added restrictions

143
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,310
on home buying in the past year.

144
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,310
All this is to say,

145
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,720
for all the talk of China being

146
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,240
a so-called free-market economy,

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,580
the real estate market is being controlled
heavily

148
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,090
by the government.

149
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,390
And the government feels it has to control
it,

150
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,960
because that’s the only way to solve the
problems

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,020
it created by controlling the other markets,

152
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,870
like stocks, foreign exchange,

153
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,600
and other investment vehicles.

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,170
Oh, and they’re also trying to get rid of
unsold real estate

155
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,880
by encouraging migrant workers

156
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,050
to buy instead of rent.

157
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,510
The problem is that many still can’t afford
it,

158
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,500
or just don’t want to.

159
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,070
So will China’s real estate bubble burst?

160
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,070
On one hand,

161
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,160
it could burst any time.

162
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,710
Prices are so outrageously high

163
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,220
that the average housing unit in China cost

164
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,500
160 times the average person’s income.

165
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
On the other hand,

166
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,990
the government’s restrictions may cool the
market enough

167
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,900
that the bubble doesn’t pop,

168
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,850
but just settles down.

169
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,080
On the other other hand,

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,430
the Chinese government wants to keep prices
increasing,

171
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,400
because that spurs construction,

172
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,370
and construction means jobs and GDP growth—

173
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,210
both necessary for the Communist Party

174
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,360
to stay in power.

175
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,120
On the other other other hand,

176
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,080
real estate prices are getting so high,

177
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,830
that it’s affecting the rest of the economy.

178
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,630
If your monthly mortgage payment

179
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,360
is 75% of your income,

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,540
like with this guy...

181
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,490
...well, then you’re not going to be able
to spend

182
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,550
that much money on other stuff.

183
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,630
That’s a problem when the Chinese government

184
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,200
is depending on people buying more stuff

185
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,270
to prop up the economy.

186
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,120
Of course, the problem with real estate bubbles

187
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,690
is that you can’t tell whether they’re
really bubbles

188
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,580
until after they burst.

189
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,670
So how about that volcano view property?

190
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,900
It’s a great investment.

191
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900


192
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
So what do you think?

193
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

194
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,450
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

195
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,840
See you next time.
