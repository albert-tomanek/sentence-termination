00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,939
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:04,320
China’s People’s War on Terrorism

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,000
expands to Afghanistan!

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,200
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,550
Okay, okay, okay,

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,940
let me just clear something up.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,520
Just because you see military vehicles,

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,250
doesn’t mean you’re looking at the military.

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,310
You see in November,

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,560
an Indian publication released these photos

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,769
from the Little Pamir region, along the border

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,940
between China and Afghanistan.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,100
Okay, okay, okay,

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,000
let me just clear something up.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,859
Just because you see something that looks
like a Hummer,

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,640
that doesn’t mean it’s a hummer.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,460
That’s actually a Chinese made Dongfeng,

19
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:46,569
eastern wind,

20
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:49,499
a knockoff of the American Hummer.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,800
So is the Chinese military patrolling in Afghanistan?

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,940
No, don’t be silly.

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,440
According to that spokesman,

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,619
they were Chinese police.

25
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,920
Military vehicles.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,850
Not military.

27
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,590
Of course as the Financial Times points out,

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,210
the spokesman also denied there were ongoing

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,280
“non-military patrols on the Afghan side
of the border”

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,420
The Afghan side also denied it so...

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,560
I’m not sure what to say about those...

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,920
Chinese military knockoffs patrolling along
the border.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,770
Though the think tank Central Asia-Caucasus
Analyst

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,000
say the statements of eyewitness,

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,970
diplomats, and an unnamed Chinese official,

36
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,659
made for “overwhelming evidence”

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,369
that they were Chinese troops.

38
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,840
But we could argue back and forth all day

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,619
over whether Chinese military vehicles patrolling
Afghanistan

40
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,090
constitutes some form of military or non military
patrol,

41
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,090
which it isn’t.

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,800
Uhh, anyway.

43
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,799
The Wakhan Pass is a narrow strip of territory

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,530
that borders Pakistan, Tajikistan, and connects

45
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,399
to China’s western Xinjiang region.

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,869
You might be wondering,

47
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,260
why the weird shape?

48
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,689
Well, in the 19th century,

49
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,269
the British and Russian Empires

50
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,000
were fighting over Afghanistan,

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,510
a tradition that countries still carry on

52
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,480
to this day.

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,110
The Wakhan corridor was a territorial agreement

54
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,569
between the two to separate what was then

55
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,350
British India and Russia—

56
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,739
a sort of, “okay you two,

57
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,700
go to opposite sides of the room”.

58
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,659
Just one of the many fun decisions

59
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,739
foreign countries have made about Afghanistan.

60
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,240
And now—China.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,409
China-Afghan ties have been...

62
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,299
warming for a while now.

63
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,240
And I’m not just talking Afghan girls

64
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,700
learning Chinese kung fu.

65
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,980
For example, in 2015,

66
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,970
the Afghan government arrested Chinese Uyghur
Muslims

67
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,260
and sent them back to China,

68
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,870
in exchange for China’s help talking with
the Taliban.

69
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,670
Proving China’s commitment to fighting terrorism.

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,760
But China may have legitimate concerns

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,340
about Islamic extremists entering China.

72
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,620
According to the Chinese regime,

73
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,540
the Turkistan Islamic Party,

74
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,400
headquartered in Afghanistan,

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,939
has conducted terror attacks inside China.

76
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:18,870
But they probably aren’t getting through
here.

77
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,159
Crossing from Afghanistan to China at this
border point

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,500
is almost impossible.

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,099
According to the Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst,

80
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,680
“the high plateau of the Little Pamir can
only be reached

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,900
by vehicle from Tajikistan,

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,280
as mountains without roads block the access
for vehicles f

83
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,290
rom the Afghan and Chinese sides.”

84
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,200
So that means even these Chinese military
vehicles

85
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,069
which are absolutely not part of the military,

86
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,450
must have gone through Tajikistan to get there.

87
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,450
Which makes sense,

88
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,329
because China and Tajikistan also have

89
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,819
a military relationship.

90
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,700
There are also no footpaths

91
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,769
and those border mountains reach as high as
16,500 feet.

92
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,010
So probably, terrorists are not streaming
through there

93
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,510
on their way to China.

94
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,650
China is also pursuing big economic deals
in Afghanistan.

95
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,150
According to China's state-run Global Times,

96
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,220
"The Corridor has huge importance geopolitically

97
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,860
and geo-economically,

98
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,570
as it allows China to access a treasure trove

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,100
of mineral deposits."

100
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,760
Ah, the promise of Afghan mineral deposits!

101
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,420
Like this copper mining operation,

102
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,330
that unfortunately has all these pesky ancient
Buddha statues

103
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,290
that simply must go.

104
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,750
So it’s weird both sides are being so cagey

105
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,080
about whatever kind of patrol this was.

106
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,220
In July, China gave military aid to Afghanistan—

107
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,390
a first.

108
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,810
A month later, China joined Afghanistan, Tajikistan,
and Pakistan

109
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,010
in the Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination
Mechanism.

110
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,000
It was a military cooperation agreement

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,330
dressed up like an anti-terrorism agreement.

112
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,330


113
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,750
And the source that spoke to Central Asia-Caucasus
Analyst

114
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,610
said the countries conducted patrols

115
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,140
on almost a weekly basis.

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,540
And then suspended them.

117
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,540
I mean, these patrols were definitely happening.

118
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,780
I mean, we have the pictures.

119
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,070
So why the denial these drills ever happened?

120
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,820
Does this mean the Afghan government is lying?

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
Or worse, did the Afghan central government
simply

122
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,060
not know what is happening in its own borders?

123
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,290
That’s not too far fetched.

124
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,520
In theory, local officials could have authorized
it

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,660
on their own.

126
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,950
This is a pretty remote region.

127
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,330
This all comes at a time when

128
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,760
US presence in Afghanistan is waning.

129
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,190
President Obama withdrew nearly all US troops

130
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,580
by the time he left office.

131
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,400
So is China trying to fill a power vacuum

132
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
left by the US?

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,680
Is the Chinese regime simply seeking to protect

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,590
its growing business interests in the country?

135
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,590
Or are they concerned about

136
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,520
terrorists entering China?

137
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,860
If that’s the case,

138
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,300
why the patrols in the middle of harsh terrain

139
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,330
where it's virtually impossible to cross into
China?

140
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,450
But just a word of warning to China:

141
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,410
Don’t start leaving your troops in Afghanistan.

142
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,400
It’s probably not going to end well.

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,370
What's that Shelley?

144
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,000
Or I guess you could just leave troops in
Afghanistan forever.

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,290
So what do you think about the mysterious
appearance

146
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,470
of Chinese military, or police, or...whatever,

147
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,160
in Afghanistan?

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
Leave your comments below.

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,770
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

150
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,470
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

151
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,760
see you next time.
