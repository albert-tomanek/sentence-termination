1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,700
are you going to Scarborough Shoal?

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,060
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme?

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:14,410
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,269
The United States did something incredibly
shocking

7
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:20,000
and outrageous last Friday.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,770
They sent a ship...

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,769
through the ocean.

10
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:25,970
The South China Sea, to be exact.

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,850
Near here, the Paracel Islands.

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,210
They’re about 200 miles from the coast of
mainland China.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,360
And steering a ship near there is totally
and completely legal—

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,510
because it’s international waters.

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,930
Unless you’re the Chinese regime,

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,180
and the Paracel Islands are actually the Xisha
Islands,

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,830
which have been China’s territory since
ancient times.

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,020
Haha, oh dear.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,530
So I am wondering the same thing this reporter
is:

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,340
"Are you concerned at all that China

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,160
will view this as a provocative act?"

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,260
"They shouldn't, I guess you have to ask them
for a response?

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,070
They shouldn't because this is a principle
that reflects

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,660
what we believe as the broad interest

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,250
of the international community.

26
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,120
So how did the Chinese regime respond?

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,500
By saying it will never allow the US to run
amok in the South China Sea.

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,290
The US is the “real trouble-maker in the
South China Sea.”

29
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,740
That's according to an official editorial
in the People's Daily,

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,210
the official newspaper of the Communist Party,

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,180
and republished in English by my favorite
state run media,

32
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,340
the Global Times.

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
You see,

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,780
the People's Daily knows that the US is just

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,850
a little depressed right now,

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,850
and the destroyer was

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,520
“a way to release its depression.”

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,360
Are you feeling depressed?

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,840
Uninspired by your leadership

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
and dominance over other countries?

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,500
Talk to your doctor about Hegemonib.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,140
Hegemonib is clinically proven

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,110
to release your depression.

44
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,170
Side effects may include provocation, hostility,
running amok,

45
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,880
and overturning the trend of peaceful development

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,500
as defined by the Communist Party of China.

47
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,870
I'm going to have to ask my doctor about that one.

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,860
Anyway,

49
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,420
the People's Daily goes on to point out

50
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,720
the America's questionable timing,

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,250
just when China and the Philippines were

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,790
"restoring their ties."

53
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,420
It's almost like the People's Daily

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,420
is implying that America is the jealous ex,

55
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,191
trying to cause trouble during the Philippines'

56
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,110
first date with China.

57
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,500
You know what this means?

58
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,370
The People's Daily watches China Uncensored!

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,570
Yes,

60
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,920
Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte visited
China last week,

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,120
and made it very clear that things are changing.

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
You can tell he was serious because he wore
a tie.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,980
"America has lost.

64
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,160
I've realigned myself in your ideological flow

65
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,540
and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk
to Putin

66
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,520
and tell him that there are three of us against
the world --

67
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,920
China, Philippines and Russia.

68
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,920
It's the only way."

69
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,240
As much as I would love to watch that sitcom,

70
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,110
somehow, I don't think that's going to happen.

71
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,240
The Philippines had been a major thorn

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,760
in the Chinese regime’s side

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,100
over the South China Sea territorial dispute.

74
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,569
But that’s changed after the Philippines
elected Duterte.

75
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,100
He’s said the Philippines can’t win.

76
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,510
And that attitude might just be giving Duterte

77
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,030
what he wants.

78
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,030
According to Reuters,

79
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,610
quoting sources inside China,

80
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,350
“China would consider giving Philippine
fishermen

81
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,650
conditional access to disputed waters.”

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,080
And sure,

83
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,870
it sounds like a great deal.

84
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,870
Get permission from China

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,260
to fish in waters the UN tribunal just ruled

86
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,709
belonged to the Philippines.

87
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,370
As well as promises of $24 billion in loans
and investments.

88
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,430
This could set a precedent for the other countries

89
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,819
involved in territorial disputes with China

90
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,040
over the South China Sea.

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,770
Stick to your guns and keep claiming the territory

92
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,010
and end up with nothing,

93
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,740
or give in to China in exchange

94
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,130
for at least some limited rights.

95
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,660
And maybe some money as well.

96
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,990
And how is the US reacting to all of this?

97
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,770
Well, other than sending a destroyer

98
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,690
through the South China Sea?

99
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,340
They're totally cool with China and the Philippines'
new bromance.

100
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,620
And maybe the US and the Philippines can still
be friends.

101
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,720
Awww.

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Guess we need to make some room on the sitcom
couch.

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,690
Japan, you want to get in here, too?

104
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,690
See?

105
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,000
Territorial disputes aren't that bad after
all.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
Wait, what's that Shelley?

107
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,320
Phoebe!!

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,500
So what do you think of the US running amok
in the South China Sea?

109
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,120
Leave your comments below.

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,440
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,290
see you next time!
