1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,650
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,480
a new report says...

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,620
everything in China is great!

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,500
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,940
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,559
The Chinese Communist Party is waging

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,439
an all out war!

8
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,820
To make you love them!

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,320
And you’d better start loving the CCP,

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,160
or else.

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,990
This war of love is not fought by soldiers

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,560
giving out free hugs.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,560
It’s waged with money and influence,

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,560
forming a complex web involving policy makers,

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
think tanks,

16
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,230
and media companies around the world—

17
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,230
including right here in the United States.

18
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,730
The CCP’s aim is to make influential people

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,400
and organizations love them.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,740
And then all the love will sort of trickle
down to you,

21
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,540
the average American.

22
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,020
The spider at the center of this web of communist
love

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,710
is the United Front Work Department.

24
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,350
What is the United Front Work Department you
ask?

25
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,050
Well, according to its executive deputy head,

26
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,500
“the United Front is the political coalition

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,790
of all parties,

28
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,070
all walks of life,

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,200
all ethnic groups,

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,909
and all associations.”

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,590
Or to put it another way,

32
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,340
the United Front is the CCP’s political
coalition

33
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,109
of everything that’s not the CCP,

34
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,080
which exists in order to support the CCP.

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,509
It’s a little hard to describe,

36
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,970
because there’s simply nothing like it in
the West.

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,750
It’s not a government organ or an NGO.

38
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,600
It’s a top-level branch

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,729
of the Chinese Communist Party itself.

40
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:33,069
The goal of the United Front is

41
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,759
to “win hearts and minds”

42
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,280
both in China and overseas.

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,369
Getting everyone to see things

44
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,679
with the CCP’s perspective.

45
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,189
And when I say everyone,

46
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,539
I mean everyone.

47
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,049
The Financial Times managed to get

48
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,829
a training manual that’s issued

49
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:50,179
to United Front cadres.

50
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:51,689
It talks about the need to battle

51
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:52,689
“enemy forces abroad”

52
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,920
that are against China’s rise.

53
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,409
But don’t worry!

54
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,969
The United Front is a big magic weapon

55
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,209
that can get rid of all of these problems.

56
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,000
And when I say all the problems,

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,240
I mean that the United Front

58
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,719
is involved in everything

59
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,470
from making sure that all religions in China

60
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,900
love the CCP,

61
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,980
to making sure that 60 million overseas Chinese

62
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,740
love the CCP,

63
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,030
to making sure that foreigners

64
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,730
who learn about China love...

65
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,420
well, you get the point.

66
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,980
Imagine it like this.

67
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,250
Say you wanted to get Connie to go with you
to prom.

68
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,830
But if you had a \hUnited Front Work Department,

69
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,060
you wouldn’t just ask Connie!

70
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,510
Because she’s waiting for Chad to ask her
out.

71
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,010
But don’t worry,

72
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,690
your United Front workers

73
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,460
would be making friends with all her friends,

74
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,430
paying a reporter at the school paper

75
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,900
to write a glowing feature on you,

76
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,430
even getting the cheerleaders to chant your
name

77
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,460
at the next football game—

78
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,220
all with the goal of convincing Connie

79
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,430
that you’re the greatest guy

80
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,970
at Palm Desert High.

81
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,870
And if all that’s not enough to convince
Connie

82
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,370
to go out with you,

83
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,690
you’ll just hire some thugs to beat up those

84
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,840
“enemy forces abroad,”

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,930
aka, Chad.

86
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,210
The United Front Work Department

87
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,130
is a fascinating shadowy organization

88
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,180
that we can’t cover in just one episode.

89
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,960
So let’s look at one small example

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,210
of the work they do,

91
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,830
via a recent investigation

92
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,360
by Foreign Policy magazine.

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,610
This is Johns Hopkins University’s School

94
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,520
of Advanced International Studies.

95
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,870
It’s one of the top

96
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,140
international relations schools in the US.

97
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,600
Its graduates fill the ranks

98
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,230
of the next generation of American leaders—

99
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,420
from the State Department,

100
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,520
to the CIA,

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,090
to the military.

102
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,710
And the white papers they put out

103
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,110
serve as the basis

104
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,170
for a lot of the mainstream media reports

105
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,360
you see about China.

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,920
In 2016, they announced the Pacific Community
Initiative.

107
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,510
According to the school’s announcement,

108
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,550
it will examine “what China’s broader
role in Asia

109
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,800
and the world means for its neighbors.”

110
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
And you know what?

111
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
I’m guessing the white paper it puts out

112
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,630
will be all about how great China would be

113
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,610
as a prom date.

114
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,230
Because, where is the School of Advanced International
Studies

115
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,580
getting the money for its new initiative?

116
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,910
Why, from the China-United States Exchange
Foundation.

117
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,180
That group is registered as a foreign agent

118
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,099
with the US Department of Justice

119
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,379
under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

120
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:22,780
Partially because it was founded

121
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,469
and funded by Tung Chee-hwa,

122
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:27,669
who currently serves as the vice chairman

123
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,199
of one of the United Front’s most important
entities:

124
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,020
the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference.

125
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,490
That’s a political advisory body

126
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,849
made up of people the CCP

127
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,199
wants to keep in close orbit.

128
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,460
Members range from the CCP’s fake Panchen
Lama,

129
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,560
to action star who thinks Chinese people

130
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,080
need to be controlled,

131
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,830
Jackie Chan.

132
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,500
In addition to being the vice chairman

133
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,810
of the CPPCC, Tung Chee-hwa

134
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,300
was also the first Chief Executive of Hong
Kong

135
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,389
after the end of British rule.

136
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,479
He got that position because of his close
relationship

137
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,280
with former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,979
And because he said things like,

139
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:09,300
“Freedom is not unimportant.

140
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,330
But the West just doesn't

141
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,289
understand Chinese culture.

142
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,340
It is time to reaffirm who we are.

143
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,169
Individual rights are not as important

144
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,479
as order in our society.”

145
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,479
So really,

146
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,490
what do you think research

147
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,289
paid for by this guy and the United Front

148
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,470
will say about \h“what China’s broader
role

149
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,650
in Asia and the world means for its neighbors”?

150
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,819
Maybe China’s got the right idea,

151
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:35,230
taking away individual freedom

152
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,750
for the sake of social harmony.

153
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,370
The Pacific Community Initiative, by the way,

154
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,499
comes with a professorship

155
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,660
that’s also paid for by,

156
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,409
and in fact, named after

157
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,479
Tung Chee-hwa.

158
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,789
This isn’t the first time Tung Chee-hwa’s

159
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,840
China-United States Exchange Foundation

160
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,849
has worked to influence American organizations.

161
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,800
In fact, it has ”cooperated on projects

162
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,169
with numerous U.S. institutions,

163
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,249
including the Brookings Institution,

164
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,979
the Center for Strategic and International
Studies,

165
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,340
the Atlantic Council,

166
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,219
the Center for American Progress,

167
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,139
the East-West Institute,

168
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,490
the Carter Center,

169
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,050
and the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.”

170
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,240
Those are influential organizations

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,949
that have a real impact on US policy making.

172
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,789
Maybe they shouldn’t be working with

173
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,879
an organization designated a foreign agent

174
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,880
whose sole purpose is to influence

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,479
a “positive” relationship

176
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,560
between the US and China.

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,879
Don’t worry though,

178
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,199
the China-United States Exchange Foundation

179
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,639
denies that it has any ties to the United
Front.

180
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,229
That makes me feel a lot better.

181
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,860
As does the fact that the

182
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,879
China-United States Exchange Foundation

183
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,440
also worked with the Communist Party’s

184
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,559
People’s Liberation Army.

185
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,559
In particular,

186
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,469
the Sanya Initiative.

187
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:52,650
They had this great idea

188
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,779
to get retired US and Chinese

189
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,659
high ranking military leaders together,

190
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,220
to just kind of hang out,

191
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,610
pose for awkward photos,

192
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,960
and give each other dishware

193
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,400
from Williams-Sonoma.

194
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,460
And also, back in 2008,

195
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,860
they wanted to encourage the US veterans

196
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,009
to convince the Pentagon to delay

197
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,509
publishing a report about China’s

198
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,150
aggressive military build up.

199
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,530
And get this—

200
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,759
the US veterans actually tried.

201
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,870
The Pentagon rejected their request.

202
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,960
The China-United States Exchange Foundation

203
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,600
is also actively involved

204
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,129
in influencing US politics.

205
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,409
In 2016, they hired the Podesta Group—

206
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,339
whose co-founder was Hillary Clinton’s

207
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,009
former campaign manager—

208
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,689
and spent almost 700,000 dollars

209
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,430
lobbying Congress about China-US relations.

210
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,949
And this year they’ve spent about 500,000
on lobbying.

211
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:49,749
At the recent Chinese Communist Party Congress

212
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,119
held in October,

213
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:53,379
Chinese leader Xi Jinping called the United
Front

214
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,069
the Communist Party’s “magic weapon.”

215
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,490
Sounds familiar.

216
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,169
Why, Xi Jinping himself is the head

217
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,900
of the United Front Small Leading Group.

218
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,939
He was appointed by...himself.

219
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:07,069
And as much as Xi Jinping

220
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,059
would like to use the United Front to build

221
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:11,820
a better image for himself internationally,

222
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,379
this is part of a much larger political battle

223
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,879
happening inside of China.

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,729
During the Party Congress this year,

225
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,220
Xi appointed his guy, You Quan

226
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,610
as the new head United Front Work Department.

227
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,539
One of the former heads, Ling Jihua,

228
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,689
was a part of Jiang Zemin’s political faction.

229
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,469
Ling Jihua is currently serving

230
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,659
a life sentence for corruption,

231
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,029
and was accused of plotting a coup

232
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,320
against Xi Jinping.

233
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,029
So putting his own guy in charge

234
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,550
and getting more closely involved

235
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,479
with the United Front means that Xi Jinping

236
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,100
sees the United Front as a key part

237
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,740
of changing China’s role in the world,

238
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
and it’s another sign

239
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,149
that he’s continuing to lock down

240
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,860
his power struggle against Jiang.

241
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,410
Now remember Tung Chee-hwa—

242
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,050
who founded the China-United States Exchange
Foundation?

243
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,050
Like I said before,

244
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,779
he’s closely tied to Jiang Zemin, too.

245
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,779
So now that Xi

246
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,510
is taking charge of the United Front,

247
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,600
how will Tung fit into the picture?

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,670
We’ll have to wait and see.

249
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,910
Well, one thing is certain,

250
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,980
the groups his foundation is funding

251
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,420
probably aren’t going to come out

252
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,750
with any research critical

253
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,900
of the Chinese Communist regime,

254
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,170
regardless of who’s in charge.

255
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,170
What do you think?
