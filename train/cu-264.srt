1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,520
Are US Allies joining President Biden

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,160
In countering the Chinese Communist Party?

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
Plus: New sanctions for Uyghur persecution

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,760
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,520
This episode is sponsored\h
by Surfshark Alert. It helps\h\h

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,640
detect if your private information has been\h
leaked online, or is part of a data breach.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
This week in China news...

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,720
From the start of his campaign,\h\h

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,920
President Biden said he’d work with US allies\h
to counter the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
And now for the first time, it seems like\h
that strategy might be bearing fruit.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,680
The US, Canada, UK, and EU joined together\h\h

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
to sanction China for its\h
treatment of Uyghur Muslims.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,440
The sanctions target current and\h
former officials plus a paramilitary\h\h

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,760
organization involved in the mass\h
detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
The officials targeted will have their\h
assets frozen and be banned from travel.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
This is honestly surprising\h
considering this is the first time\h\h

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,080
Europe has used sanctions against China\h
since the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.\h

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,520
It’s even more surprising considering the\h
EU signed a preliminary trade deal with\h\h

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,520
China at the end of December, in which human\h
rights and US concerns didn’t factor in.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,760
The US had led the way with sanctions on China\h
under the Trump Administration. The US had also\h\h

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,280
labeled the Uyghur persecution genocide. However,\h
this coordinated sanctioning under the Biden\h\h

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,160
Administration is new. Is Biden making good on his\h
promise to work with US allies to counter China?

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
Earlier this month, Biden also\h
met with leaders of the Quad,\h\h

25
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,320
an alliance of India, Japan, Australia,\h
and the US aimed at countering China.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
But if you’re a US ally who’s\h
wondering whether you’ll have\h\h

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,760
to choose between the US and China, don’t worry.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,160
This week Secretary of State Antony Blinken\h
also said the US won’t force allies into an\h\h

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
“us or them” choice between the US and China.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,400
“The U.S. wants to out-compete with China,\h
not simply seek to defeat it, Blinken said.”

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,360
When asked to respond to Blinken’s comment,\h\h

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,200
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson\h
Zhao Lijian attempted to say something\h\h

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,160
about America’s decline, but instead just\h
laughed uncontrollably for five minutes.\h

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,840
And after the break, I’ll tell you how China\h
has responded to America and its allies.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,520
Welcome back.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,720
The new sanctions on Chinese officials are\h
no laughing matter for the Communist Party.\h\h

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,040
In fact, they’ve responded with\h
their own sanctions on the EU.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Those sanctions included\h
“blacklisting 10 European lawmakers,\h\h

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,400
as well as several think tanks and academics”.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,520
The EU sanctions China for\h
crimes against humanity,\h\h

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,240
China sanctions the EU for\h
sanctioning them. Makes sense.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
Of course, that may mean that fancy new\h
trade deal with Europe might be doomed.

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,160
That’s because several of the European\h
lawmakers the Chinese regime sanctioned\h\h

44
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,400
are members of the European Parliament—which\h
has to approve that trade deal.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,800
And as a result of the sanctions,\h
the European Parliament cancelled\h\h

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,520
a meeting that was supposed to discuss that deal.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,480
The US and China had also signed\h
a trade deal in 2020. That was\h\h

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,160
right before the coronavirus\h
became a global pandemic.

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,320
And this may surprise you, but China\h
hasn’t been holding up its end of the deal.

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
So if that deal also goes down\h
the drain...boo frickin’ hoo.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,160
And now, to punish the US, the Chinese\h
Communist Party has been running a nonstop\h\h

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,960
propaganda blitz. They’re accusing the US of\h
racism, inequality, and a poor pandemic response.

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
You know they say we criticize in\h
others the things we see in ourselves.

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,160
Despite the draw of the China\h
market, the rest of the world\h\h

55
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,240
is beginning to wise up to the risk\h
posed by the Chinese Communist Party.

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,040
Take Canada, which is also\h
part of the recent sanctions.\h\h

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,240
China has kidnapped two Canadian citizens,\h
Michael Korvig and Michael Spavor.\h\h

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,680
Well, in the last week, both Michaels\h
were secretly put on trial for spying.

59
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,560
In both cases, the verdict hasn’t been\h
announced. But China’s justice system is\h\h

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,320
very efficient. Everyone put\h
on trial is found guilty!

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,240
Foreign journalists and diplomats were banned\h
from the trials. But in a show of support,\h\h

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
“More than two dozen diplomats representing\h
several countries, including Canada and the United\h\h

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,720
States, tried to gain access to the courtroom,\h
only to be turned away by security personnel.”

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
Hey, do you think the Chinese Communist Party’s\h
hostage taking might actually be backfiring?

65
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,840
More on that after the break.

66
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,840
Welcome back.

67
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,000
There are more signs that the\h
Chinese Communist Party’s aggression\h\h

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,760
is turning the world against it. NATO is now\h
looking to build partnerships with Japan,\h\h

69
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,160
South Korea, Australia, and\h
New Zealand to counter China.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,880
And another US Admiral is warning\h
a Chinese invasion of Taiwan\h\h

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,640
is closer than most people think.

72
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,840
Of course, he’s obviously not talking about\h
most people who watch China Uncensored.

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,200
But as the Uyghur genocide continues to turn\h
people against the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,880
the Party is striking back.

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,720
Facebook recently caught Chinese hackers\h
creating fake profiles to attack Uyghurs abroad.

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,560
The hackers would pose as activists or journalists\h
supporting the Uyghurs. They would send targeted\h\h

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Uyghurs links to compromised websites. They\h
even created fake prayer apps for Android.

78
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,280
Meanwhile, the Chinese regime\h
has launched a boycott of H&M\h\h

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
for criticizing the treatment of Uyghurs.

80
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,720
In this statement last year, H&M said, Ohh,\h
I guess that page doesn’t exist anymore.

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Hmm. But nothing is ever\h
really gone from the internet.\h\h

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Here’s their original statement, which said,\h
“H&M Group is deeply concerned by reports\h\h

83
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,800
from civil society organisations\h
and media that include accusations\h\h

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,760
of forced labour and discrimination of\h
ethnoreligious minorities in Xinjiang.”

85
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,120
They also said they’d stop buying cotton from\h
Xinjiang, since it’s made with Uyghur slave labor.

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,640
Nike also released a statement on Xinjiang,\h
saying they’re committed to ethical and\h\h

87
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,200
responsible manufacturing. And that they\h
do not source products from Xinjiang.

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,360
Even though they lobbied against a\h
Uyghur slave labor bill in Congress.

89
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
And now Nike might be next\h
on China’s boycott list.\h\h

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,040
“On Wednesday, Nike was at the top\h
of Weibo’s ‘hot search’ list. Some\h\h

91
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,360
users were furious that Nike had joined\h
the boycott of cotton from the region.”

92
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,360
Never thought I’d see boycotts\h
against companies for *opposing*\h\h

93
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
genocide and slave labor. But that’s\h
the Chinese Communist Party for you.\h

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
And this episode is sponsored by Surfshark Alert.

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,360
Big data breaches happen all the time. Like\h
the 2019 Capitol One breach that affected\h\h

96
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,120
100 million Americans. Or the 2017 Equifax\h
hack that exposed data of nearly 150 million\h\h

97
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
Americans. Whether these hacks come from\h
China or elsewhere, your private information\h\h

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,880

account balance, social security number, and more.

99
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,880
If you’re concerned about data breaches,\h
identity theft, password leaks, or hackers,\h\h

100
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
you should use Surfshark Alert.
