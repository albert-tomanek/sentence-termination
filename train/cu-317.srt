1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,929
Stalled progress on a US-China trade deal.

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,800
The threat of new tariffs coming Friday.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Trump is playing hardball.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,280
But what’s really at stake?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,960
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,269
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,310
Friday’s coming and you know what that means

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,659
here at China Uncensored—

9
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,570
It’s Friday, Friday gotta get down on Friday!

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,509
If you’d like to feel old,

11
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:29,650
that song came out eight years ago.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,539
Anyway, this Friday,

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,040
you know who might not be partyin’, partyin’
yeah?

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,540
See, for five months,

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,010
US and Chinese negotiators have been trying

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,289
to work out a big trade deal.

17
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,500
Back in December,

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,570
President Trump had said he would raise tariffs

19
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,309
on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on
March 1.

20
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:50,750
He extended that deadline,

21
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,980
and then kept extending it,

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,079
so a trade deal could be made.

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,449
But on Sunday,

24
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,559
President Trump said enough is enough.

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,019
Well, he Tweeted enough is enough.

26
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,940
“For 10 months,

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,440
China has been paying Tariffs to the USA

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,660
of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech,

29
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,730
and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods.

30
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,120
The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday."

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Thank goodness Twitter allows

32
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,590
up to 240 characters now.

33
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,590
So this Friday—

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,590
two days from now—

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,770
is the deadline.

36
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,670
And maybe he means it this time.

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,910
“The Trade Deal with China continues,

38
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,910
but too slowly,

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,580
as they attempt to renegotiate. No!"

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,710
This is a change of tone from early April,

41
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,030
when Trump met with Vice Premier Liu He in
the Oval Office.

42
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,970
At that time, it seemed like things were going
well.

43
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,660
"We are rounding the turn,

44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,910
we'll see what happens.

45
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,590
We have a ways to go but not very far.

46
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,950
We've made a lot of progress."

47
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,560
The Chinese Vice Premier agreed there was
progress,

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,280
and tried to butter up the president a little

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,840
by praising his direct involvement the negotiations.

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,620
“Because of your direct involvement,

51
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,440
we do have great progress.

52
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,670
Although we still have some remainings,

53
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,910
hopefully we get a good result.”

54
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,810
Oh Liu He, flattery will get you everywhere.

55
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,000
Except maybe to a trade agreement.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,340
So why have the trade negotiations

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,590
hit a speed bump since then?

58
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,590
On Monday,

59
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,790
US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer

60
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,100
and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin,

61
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,060
who have been leading the trade talks,

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,120
said that Chinese officials had been reneging

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,100
on previous commitments.

64
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,931
And they confirmed that US tariffs

65
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:41,530
would be raised on Friday.

66
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,870
According to Lighthizer,

67
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,090
Chinese officials were trying to make

68
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,590
substantial last-minute changes to the agreement.

69
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,850
What?! Who could have seen this coming?

70
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,280
Well...a lot of people, actually.

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,450
Bloomberg columnist and finance professor
Noah Smith

72
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,480
says that for China to make good on its promise

73
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,620
to reduce its 400 billion dollar a year trade
surplus with the US,

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,360
it would have to make big sacrifices.

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,390
“It seems improbable that China will follow
through on

76
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,180
this big trade-war concession,” Smith argues.

77
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,040
“Chances are high that it turns out to be
a red herring.”

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,150
That’s because following through on

79
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,150
any kind of structural reform

80
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,910
would hurt China’s economic growth too much.

81
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,599
But of course, not signing a trade deal

82
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,370
would also hurt China’s economic growth.

83
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,350
That could be why, last Friday,

84
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,530
Trump suggested that the US would be just
fine without a deal.

85
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,080
"We'll see what happens over the next couple
of weeks,

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,190
but we're getting close to a very historic
monumental deal

87
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,880
and if it doesn't happen we'll be fine too,

88
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,430
maybe even better."

89
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,459
One reason the US could be better off holding
out for now,

90
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,270
is that these negotiations are a unique chance

91
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,420
to reset America's relationship with China.

92
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,959
That’s what hedge fund manager Kyle Bass
recently told CNBC.

93
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,430
And there’s good reason to listen to Bass.

94
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,209
He's one of the few people who correctly predicted

95
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,900
the sub-prime meltdown that sparked the 2008
financial crisis.

96
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,260
He says reducing America's 400 billion trade
deficit with China

97
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,130
is small potatoes compared to the big play:

98
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,279
forcing China to stop stealing American technology.

99
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,580
"With China, our real issue is forced technology
transfer,

100
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,309
it's intellectual property theft,

101
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:29,120
it's subversive industrial policies

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,039
that circumvent WTO rules,

103
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,449
it's basically the way the Chinese lie,

104
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,889
cheat and steal their way through our economy."

105
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,599
Bass says that for the trade deal to be meaningful

106
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,529
it's gotta have teeth.

107
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:43,860
Like sanctions on China

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,659
if their promises turn up empty.

109
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,740
"It's really important for this new agreement,

110
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,690
whatever it is,

111
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,610
to be measurable and punishable."

112
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,180
And that’s one of the sticking points with
the current deal,

113
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,930
which the Chinese officials tried to renege
on.

114
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,949
But if you ask former White House chief strategist
Steve Bannon,

115
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,800
the US has to demand that the Chinese regime

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,710
make structural reforms that will transform
China

117
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,990
into the kind of free market system

118
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,710
that China promised to be so many years ago.

119
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,279
And if we can’t get that from the trade
deal,

120
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,870
we shouldn’t sign it at all.

121
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,699
"I think we should walk away from this right
now.

122
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,389
We ought to start playing hardball,

123
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,370
we ought to start playing smash-mouth."

124
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,539
Yeah, we ought to start playing Smash Mouth!

125
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,979
“Hey now, you’re an all star.

126
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,419
Get your game on, go play.”

127
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,360
If you’d like to feel really, really old,

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,449
that song came out 20 years ago.

129
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,470
What’s that, Shelley?

130
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,830
I see.

131
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,930
Steve Bannon is not a fan of late nineties
rock music.

132
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,159
He just meant aggressive and confrontational.

133
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,969
That makes more sense, I guess.

134
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:53,849
Anyway, Trump *is* getting more aggressive
and confrontational.

135
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:55,249
His Tweets on Sunday...

136
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,509
were a warning that things are moving too
slowly,

137
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,470
and that Chinese negotiators had better not

138
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,999
get overconfident or drag things out.

139
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,460
It’s time to make a deal.

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Or no deal,

141
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,369
if they want to play it like that.

142
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,689
And he’s gotten support from some unexpected
sources.

143
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:13,900
Like Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer,

144
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,479
who tweeted that Trump should “hang tough
on China.”

145
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,059
Meanwhile, Chinese officials have agreed to

146
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,000
resume trade talks Thursday and Friday,

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,210
so there’s a possibility that tariffs

148
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,529
might not go into effect on Friday, after
all.

149
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,979
So what do you think about Trump's threat

150
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,900
to slap China with more tariffs?

151
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,509
Leave your comments below.

152
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:33,509
And while you’re still here,

153
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,270
it’s time for me to answer another question

154
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,499
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

155
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:39,490
with a dollar or more per episode—

156
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,249
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

157
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,680
J R Harrison asks:

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,300
“Who are you interviewing this year

159
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
for the anniversary of the T.S. Massacre?

160
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,039
Is it going to be Fang Zheng again?”

161
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,879
Thanks for your question.

162
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,650
Last year during the Oslo Freedom Forum,

163
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,120
I interviewed Fang Zheng—

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,089
a Tiananmen Square student protester

165
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,669
who was run over by a tank.

166
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,899
This year, I have a new guest lined up:

167
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,270
Zhou Fengsuo.

168
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,580
After participating in the 1989 Tiananmen
Square protests,

169
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,330
and surviving the massacre,

170
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,249
Chinese authorities labeled him as number
5

171
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,270
on their “most wanted” list.

172
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,270
They arrested him,

173
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,520
and threw him in a re-education camp.

174
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,180
Now, he’s in the US and fighting to make
sure

175
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,849
Tiananmen Square gets remembered.

176
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,080
I think you’re going to love this interview.

177
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,590
It’ll come out June 3.

178
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,590
And thank you to everyone
