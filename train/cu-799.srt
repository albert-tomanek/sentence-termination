00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,820
Oh, they think it's a Hugo Weaving fan meet-up?

2
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,980
I get that a lot.

3
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,700
No, I don't do it for the thanks!

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,460
I do it because it's right!

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,800
I thought New York traffic was the worst in the world...

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,680
I can't wait to go back.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,660
I've never seen anything like this.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,060
If you could describe Chris with one word, what would it be?

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,680
One word?

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,960
He's intelligent.

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,440
A patriot!

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,400
He's awesome!

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,280
Good person.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,680
Subversive!

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,580
Hero.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,440
Superman.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,700
Fascinating!

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,620
Humor.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,120
Humor?

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,960
Yes!

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,460
So guys, what did you think of that meet-up?

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,300
That was crazy, right?

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm amazed at the Filipino fanbase of the show.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,600
The New York fanbase had better step it up!
