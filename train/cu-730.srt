1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,520
China gets aggressive with Taiwan

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,549
An unexpected Chinese response to Notre Dame

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:10,720
And Chinese scientists do creepy experiments
with monkey brains

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,640
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,300
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,669
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:23,740
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,609
On Monday, the Chinese Communist Party

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,689
conducted what it called necessary drills
of warships,

10
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,060
bombers, and reconnaissance aircraft around
Taiwan.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,120
And they *are* necessary.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,860
If you consider intimidating Taiwan to be
necessary.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,500
The US on the other hand said it was more
like coercion.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,980
The Chinese Communist Party denies

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,200
that Taiwan is a separate country,

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,310
despite Taiwan having its own government,

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,170
currency, and military.

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,840
It considers Taiwan a breakaway province

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,420
that needs to be taken, by force if necessary.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,520
And...it’s necessary.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,530
But the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-Wen

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,350
says Taiwan will not be intimidated.

23
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,200
“These actions only serve to strengthen
our resolve.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,070
Our military forces have the capacity,

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,990
determination, and commitment to defend Taiwan

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,130
and not allow coercion to dictate our own
future.”

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,619
Which is ironic, because the Chinese regime

28
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,530
said basically the same thing in response.

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,560
That “No person or any force should underestimate

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,219
our firm determination and strong ability

31
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,289
to defend the country’s sovereignty

32
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,979
and territorial integrity.”

33
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,670
It’s like looking into a mirror.

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,659
The Trump administration, for its part,

35
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,689
has been offering more US support to Taiwan.

36
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:41,820
According to President Tsai,

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,210
“The Trump administration had notified Taipei

38
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,130
that its pilots could train

39
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,560
at the Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.”

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,069
And now, the fate of Taiwan

41
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,740
lies in the hands of...Arizona.

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,810
The world was shocked by the devastating fire

43
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,840
that gutted the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,909
There’s been an outpouring of support

45
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,430
and condolences around the world.

46
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,579
Except from some Internet users in China.

47
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,849
In fact, they seem to be celebrating.

48
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:14,489
Did you know that almost 160 years ago,

49
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,810
the French, along with the British,

50
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,069
burned down the Summer Palace in Beijing?

51
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,959
Well now, thousands of netizens want you to
remember that.

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,580
According to What’s on Weibo,

53
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,780
“All across Chinese social media,

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,650
many people showed little sympathy

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,819
for the burning of the Notre Dame,

56
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,910
comparing it to the devastating blaze of 1860

57
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,250
that ruined the Summer Palace.”

58
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,250
One person wrote,

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,090
“I feel that the French got what they deserve

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,709
to see this kind of history go up in smoke.”

61
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,830
Another said “I know I shouldn’t,

62
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,840
but I cannot restrain myself:

63
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,620
ha ha ha ha ha!”

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,750
That got thousands of likes.

65
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,970
Of course, it was only *60* years ago,

66
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,439
the Chinese Communist Party forced the Chinese
people

67
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,439
to burn or destroy thousands of their own
temples

68
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,290
and historical sites.

69
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,659
Not that young people on China’s heavily
censored internet

70
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,819
would know about that.

71
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,349
Speaking of destroying things,

72
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,349
here’s a video that’s gone viral in China.

73
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,650
It shows a worker comparing the yellow safety
helmets t

74
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,430
he ordinary workers get,

75
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,750
to the red safety hats their bosses get.

76
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,620
Now I can’t really say I’m surprised that

77
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,049
the bosses gave their workers the cheap-o
helmets.

78
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,020
What I am surprised about is that my favorite

79
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,010
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times,

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,430
actually covered it.

81
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,800
Will wonders never cease?

82
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Remember Huawei?

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,640
It’s the Chinese telecom company

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,780
the US keeps telling everyone is a national
security threat,

85
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,950
because it has shady links to the Chinese
government—

86
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,569
even though it’s technically a private company.

87
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,760
In fact, in the West, Huawei likes to say
that

88
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,970
they’re an “employee-owned” company.

89
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, a new academic paper

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,209
blows that the idea out of the water.

91
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,840
This report by Christopher Balding and Donald
Clarke

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,140
...took a look at publicly available records

93
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,599
and concluded that Huawei isn’t exactly
employee owned,

94
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,500
and it doesn’t just have shady links to
the Chinese state.

95
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,880
According to the paper,

96
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,460
“Huawei may be deemed effectively state-owned.”

97
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,009
So you might want to think twice about

98
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,880
watching China Uncensored

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,860
from that new Huawei phone you’ve bought.

100
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,260
Speaking of companies that really aren’t
helping—

101
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
Volkswagen.

102
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,780
The VW Group has just built a factory in Xinjiang.

103
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,750
That’s the region where China’s

104
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,590
favoritest happy ethnic Uighur people live,

105
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,840
and play, and get locked up for no reason.

106
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,530
Robin Brant of the BBC had very public chat

107
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,639
with Volkswagen’s chief exec.

108
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,980
“But Xinjiang is not something your proud
to be

109
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,350
associated with in terms of what the Chinese
government

110
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,210
is doing to the Uighur people...

111
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,210
"

112
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,210
“I can't judge this, sorry."

113
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,210
"You can't judge it?"

114
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,210
"No"

115
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,210
“But you know about it?"

116
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,230
"I don't know what you're referring to."

117
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,900
"You don't know China's reeducation camps

118
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,130
for a million Uighur people its referred to

119
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,569
as reeducation camps as part of its counter
terror threat

120
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,350
in the West of the country.

121
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,470
You don't know about that?"

122
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,580
"I'm not aware of it."

123
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,280
So... would it be better if the head of a
company

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,319
that’s invested millions of dollars in Xinjiang

125
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,100
has no idea what’s happening in Xinjiang?

126
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,169
Or if he’s just a liar?

127
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,169
Either way,

128
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,430
this really doesn’t look good for Volkswagen.

129
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,759
Especially after that whole emissions scandal.

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,720
And *especially* after that whole working
with the Nazis thing.

131
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,860
So I think Volkswagen might want to keep its
distance

132
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,380
from an authoritarian regime

133
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,280
that’s rounding people up based on their
ethnicity

134
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,580
and sending them to concentration camps.

135
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,530
Just my free PR advice.

136
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,460
More free advice from Chris Chappell:

137
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,800
Planet of the Apes was supposed to be a warning,

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,550
not a guidebook.

139
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,480
But some people always seem to learn the wrong
lessons.

140
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,879
And that’s why Chinese scientists

141
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,220
are splicing human brain genes into monkeys!

142
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,570
But it’s not a smart idea.

143
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,599
Part of the reason this is happening in China

144
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,690
is because the US and Europe have made it
more difficult

145
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,479
to experiment on primates.

146
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,030
China, on the other hand,

147
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,450
doesn’t have any of those dumb ethical constraints.

148
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,699
So they can do important science,

149
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,639
like cloning gene-edited disease monkeys.

150
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,039
What could possibly go wrong?

151
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you think about this week’s headlines?

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,750
Leave your comments below.

153
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,090
And now it’s time for me to answer

154
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,460
a question from one of you—

155
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,449
a fan who support China Uncensored

156
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,500
with a dollar or more per episode,

157
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,910
by contributing through Patreon.

158
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,680
Zhou Rui asks,

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,379
“If Xi Jinping were to watch some BABYMETAL
videos

160
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,870
is it possible that his heart could melt

161
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,680
and he would stop all Chinese aggression in
the Pacific?

162
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,900
Baby Metal?

163
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,340
I’m afraid I’ve never heard of them.

164
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,010
Here, let me take a listen.

165
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:15,990
Zhou Rui, you’ve solved the South China
Sea crisis!

166
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,020
You deserve a Nobel Peace Prize!

167
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,800
And thank you BABYMETAL,

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,030
for everything.

169
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,690
And thank you to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

170
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,220
who support China Uncensored.

171
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,069
It’s only because of your support

172
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,860
that we’ve been able to cover topics

173
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,389
that most other media don’t want to,

174
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,159
because they prefer to get advertising dollars,

175
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,830
or make cars in Xinjiang,

176
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,700
rather than criticize the Chinese Communist
Party.

177
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,980
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

178
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,240
See you next time.
