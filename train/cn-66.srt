1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,200
Fillies in Philly?

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,900
Thereby undoing all the good work said establishment
ever did!

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,160
Yes!

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,580
Yes, he proposed a…

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,670
You t***.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,940
I mean, don't get me wrong, that's genius.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,660
The first chartered women's institution of
higher education in Philadelphia.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,760
(Fillies in Philly...!)

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,040
"I say, dear boy, I thought of that one on
the train here!"

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,580
"Rah, rah, rah!"

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,700
This is what private education gets you(!)

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,710
Okay.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,809
So what did he think… w…?

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,180
You're just going to need a wait a second.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,380
It's over, mate. It's over.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,360
I'm going to direct this at Chris, actually.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello!

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,320
What did he think...?

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,240
It's gone.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,180
He's gone.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,680
I should leave it until there's no chance
of a spit-take.

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm dead!

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,600
Like that one.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,130
That's actually straight through to the green
room back there.

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,160
So he's just taking a minute, to just...

26
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,820
You okay there, Matt?

27
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,840
You've just given someone an OBE haven't you?
