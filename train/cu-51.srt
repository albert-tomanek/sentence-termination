00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:10,080
5 signs China's economy is weaker than you
think.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,870
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,940
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,140
China's economy.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,230
Growth so fast it makes Jack's beanstalk jealous.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,900
And like Jack's beanstalk,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,460
China's economic growth is sort of magical

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,380
in that it's kind of hard to believe.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,810
I mean, sure China has beans,

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,880
and stocks,

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,380
and people named Jack.

13
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,440
But could China's economy really be growing
so much, so fast?

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,390
So here are 5 signs China's economy is weaker
than you think.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,499
Number 5:

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,389
China's stock market is unstable.

17
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,199
Very unstable, in fact.

18
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,359
In just the past year,

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,769
it more than doubled,

20
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:50,000
then crashed almost as far as it rose.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,789
And since then it's been up, and down, and
up again.

22
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,869
Hedge fund investor Jim Chanos put it more
eloquently when he said China's stock market

23
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,940
is "like a pig on LSD.

24
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,250
You don't know which way it's going to run."

25
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,120
I don't think having a pig on LSD is a good
sign.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,030
Not for your country's stock market, at least.

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,600
If you own a ranch, though,

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,930
it might be kind of entertaining.

29
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,930
Number 4:

30
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,100
China's GDP growth is much lower than reported

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,730
The Chinese government loves to brag that
its GDP is so much bigger than everybody else's.

32
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,780
The problem is,

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,920
it's full of hot air.

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,300
Kind of like the Hindenberg.

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
In recent years,

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,000
the officially reported figure has been around
7 percent.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,480
But Li Keqiang,

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,870
China's current premier and the person more
or less in charge of China's economic policy,

39
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,140
once said that even he doesn't trust the official
GDP figures.

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,260
He didn't say that publicly, of course.

41
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,140
We learned that from a Wikileaked cable.

42
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,480
Back in 2007,

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,440
Li was head of the Communist Party in Liaoning
province.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,080
He told the US ambassador that China's GDP
figures are "man-made".

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,440
Li said he looked at electricity production,
rail-freight cargo, and bank lending to get

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,720
a more accurate picture of GDP in Liaoning.

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,940
And going by that measurement,

48
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,049
China's overall GDP growth isn't 7 percent.

49
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,730
It's closer to 3 percent.

50
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,829
China bear Gordon Chang estimates growth could
even be as low as 1 or 2 percent.

51
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,889
But whether it's 1 percent or 7 percent,

52
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,120
there's still another problem.

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,689
A lot of it is empty growth.

54
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,889
A simple way to look at GDP is how much money
is spent each year.

55
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,130
GDP is supposed to tell you how healthy the
economy is.

56
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,629
But in China, the government spends a lot
of money on worthless things.

57
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,319
Like building ghost cities that no one lives
in.

58
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,530
Or bridges that collapse.

59
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,200
It's like the quote from that movie.

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,879
"If you build it…they won't come…but it's
still GDP."

61
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,150
Number 3:

62
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,030
China is cutting interest rates...again

63
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,459
So what does a government do when it sees
its economy slowing down,

64
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,410
and wants to jump start it?

65
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,430
It cuts interest rates.

66
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,959
Low interest rates mean businesses can more
easily borrow money to invest.

67
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,980
In theory, this helps the economy grow.

68
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,359
What's weird is that China is supposed to
have one of the world's fastest-growing economies.

69
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:17,590
So why would they need to cut interest rates?

70
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,989
But in fact their central bank has lowered
interest rates six times this year.

71
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,529
It's almost as if the guy in charge of China's
economic policy doesn't believe China's GDP

72
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:30,559
data.

73
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:34,239
Oh, and here's the problem with low interest
rates.

74
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,689
Although it helps in some ways, it also encourages
companies to invest in things that aren't

75
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,230
necessarily good investments.

76
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,779
Like building cities that no one's going to
live in.

77
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:45,939
Number 2

78
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,909
China has an unemployment problem

79
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,650
You know how I said electricity production
is supposed to help measure GDP growth?

80
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,870
Well one of China's biggest coal companies
just fired 100,000 employees.

81
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,900
Because China's electricity growth is the
weakest it's been in 30 years.

82
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,489
You know who else can't find jobs?

83
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,519
Millions of people.

84
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,040
But don't worry,

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,440
because if you look at the Chinese government's
officially reported urban unemployment data,

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,730
it's quite stable.

87
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,760
Freakishly stable, actually.

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,390
It's so stable that even Japan

89
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,970
Japan, where it's almost impossibly to lay
off employees

90
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,220
has more fluctuation in unemployment.

91
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,070
I mean, it's as if Japan, like every other
country,

92
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,110
is affected by the global economy...

93
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,160
...and China magically is not.

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,290
But it's not so magical for the millions of
Chinese college graduates who can't find jobs.

95
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,450
That's why so many live in squalid conditions,
sometimes literally underground, in what are

96
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,520
called yi-zu

97
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,590
or "ant tribes."

98
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,210
Speaking of young people...

99
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,210
Number 1

100
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,250
China doesn't have enough of them

101
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,010
Yes, even though many educated young people
can't find jobs,

102
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,910
China has an overall problem of too many old
people and not enough young people.

103
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,910
In the 70s,

104
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,750
the government created the One-Child Policy
to slow down population growth.

105
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,910
But that policy was kind of a disaster.

106
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,520
It's like no one actually did the math.

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,400
Because people get old,

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
and need to be taken care of.

109
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,380
After two generations,

110
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,820
an only child today whose parents are also
only children will have to take care of two

111
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,830
parents and four elderly grandparents.

112
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,360
And how can you do that if you can barely
afford to live in an underground ant tribe?

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,070
The imbalance is so bad that even China's
new Two-Child Policy won't able to fix it

114
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,590
anytime soon.

115
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,440
Without a young healthy workforce,

116
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,200
good luck keeping up that economic growth.

117
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,760
So perhaps China's economy is not all unicorns
and ponies.

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,400
Though it might have some pigs on LSD.

119
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,090
So what do you think?

after a serious economic crisis,

check out this video from our friends at Seeker
Daily.

123
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,810
"Greece is grappling with one of the worst
economic crises in history.

124
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,100
At the center of this crisis is Athens,

125
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,320
where people are starting to panic."

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:20,910
Once again I'm Chris Chappell.
