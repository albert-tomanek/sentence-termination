1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,270
A new virus is killing in China

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,770
While China’s military is on the move

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,830
Plus, can things really get worse?!

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,400
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,080
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,990
This episode is sponsored by Surfshark.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,679
Because you should be using a reliable VPN

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,169
whenever you go online.

10
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:30,240
So...you know, it’s as if things couldn’t
get any worse.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,750
My generation grew up with the threat of global
terrorism,

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,410
came of age during a global financial meltdown,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,950
and now we’re trying to raise kids in a
pandemic.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,860
On top of all that a giant asteroid

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,640
is going to fly by the Earth next month.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,060
NASA says it won’t hit us...

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,860
but can we really trust NASA?

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,640
I mean, NASA’s covered up how the aliens
killed JFK on 9/11!

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,200
Think it can’t get worse?

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,820
Bears are coming out of hibernation early.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,990
Bears.

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,430
Go back to sleep, bears.

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,120
There’s nothing out here for you.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,000
And now, potentially more deadly than the
CCP coronavirus—

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,110
or CCP Virus, for short—

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,120
...a new virus has emerged in China!

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,490
Ok, Hantavirus is not new.

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,750
It’s just newly emerging.

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,750
Again.

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,530
There have been outbreaks before.

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,570
According to a Swedish scientist,

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,680
“It spreads from rats [or] mice

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,860
if humans ingest their body fluids.

34
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,870
Human-human transmission is rare.

35
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,080
Please do not panic,

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,190
unless you plan to eat rats.”

37
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,800
What else am I supposed to eat!

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,890
I live in New York City.

39
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,150
Rats are all that’s left after hoarders
took the bread!

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,440
Well, there’s still plenty of gluten-free
bread.

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,730
But clearly we’d ALL rather eat rats.

42
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,170
What’s that, Shelley?

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,159
There are actually several types of hantaviruses

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,409
that can cause different diseases,

45
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,170
and I can get sick just from breathing the
air

46
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,670
around contaminated rodent droppings?

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,830
I am never taking the subway again.

48
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,770
What’s that, Shelley?

49
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,970
Subway rats don’t carry hantavirus?

50
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,970
Oh good.

51
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,509
So I can still eat them.

52
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,739
According to the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention,

53
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,719
hantavirus infections are rare.

54
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,060
But the types of hantaviruses most commonly
seen in Asia

55
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,769
have anywhere from a 1 to 15 percent mortality
rate.

56
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,569
That’s potentially much higher than the
CCP Virus.

57
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,269
Though communism itself also has a very high
mortality rate.

58
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,859
Speaking of which,

59
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,919
China has lifted travel restrictions in Hubei
province.

60
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,189
Hubei is the epicenter of the coronavirus.

61
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,689
Unless you believe the Chinese Communist Party

62
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,379
when they say it really began in America.

63
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,709
And I thought NASA conspiracy theories were
intense.

64
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,781
Tens of millions of people in Hubei province

65
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,180
have been under lockdown for two months.

66
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,189
But China’s National Health Commission

67
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,269
said there were no new coronavirus infections

68
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,980
and so the restrictions could be lifted.

69
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,879
And when have Chinese authorities ever lied
about numbers?!

70
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,150
However, as we’ve reported before,

71
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,840
there could be a second wave of the CCP Virus

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,969
already spreading inside China.

73
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:12,370
As the lockdown is lifted,

74
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,069
people who have the CCP Virus but aren’t
showing symptoms,

75
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,109
could continue to spread it around China and
the world.

76
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:22,330
But if you’re concerned about the Chinese
Communist Party

77
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,120
doing another round of coronavirus cover-ups—don’t
be!

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,699
China’s premier Li Keqiang is warning local
officials:

79
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,659
no second cover up.

80
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,749
So if any local officials are currently covering
it up,

81
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,379
the solution is simple:

82
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,870
They should cover up their coverup.

83
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,469
But Chinese officials are very concerned

84
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,449
about a second wave of infections.

85
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,969
That’s why they just issued this statement,

86
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,779
banning all foreigners from entering China,

87
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,870
even with a valid visa.

88
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,439
Remember when China and the WHO

89
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,790
were telling everyone travel bans were unnecessary?

90
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,980
And a Chinese diplomat compared travel bans

91
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,640
to turning away Jewish refugees during the
Holocaust?

92
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,319
Yeah, that happened.

93
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,359
Meanwhile, a concerned Chinese father

94
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,959
has created a safety pod for his baby.

95
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,010
“This baby safety pod is modified from a
cat carrier backpack.

96
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,280
It has an electronic fan system.

97
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,550
It can offer a totally isolated environment
when going out.

98
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,310
It can provide a safe and comfortable environment
for the baby.”

99
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,720
So, people around the world are isolating
themselves,

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,690
practicing social distancing and avoiding
contact with others,

101
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,849
while this guy runs around with a baby pod?

102
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,620
I guess we’re living in Death Stranding
now.

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,740
Great.

104
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,759
The CCP Virus has devastated the world.

105
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,620
So isn’t it nice that the CCP—

106
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,440
the Chinese Communist Party—

107
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,940
is selflessly extending

108
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,909
a “helping hand to countries around the
world

109
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,960
in the global battle against COVID-19?”

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,220
As state-run media says,

111
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,080
“The Chinese government has announced that

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
it will provide medical supplies to 82 countries.”

113
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,310
Which makes it sound like they’re donating
supplies, doesn’t it?

114
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,819
But in most cases they’re not actually donating
them.

115
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,820
The countries have to pay for them.

116
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,379
Now it’s not a problem for the Chinese government

117
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,099
to sell medical supplies.

118
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,610
That’s fine.

119
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,800
But then using that as propaganda

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,319
to make it sound like they’re generously
donating supplies

121
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,229
and saving the world from the disease that
they caused?

122
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,879
That’s low.

123
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,960
Incidentally, 80% of coronavirus test kits
'gifted'—aka sold—

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,069
to the Czech Republic by China didn’t work.

125
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:42,550
Shots were fired as Chinese boats

126
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,940
rammed a Taiwanese coast guard vessel.

127
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,379
And that was the second time this month.

128
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,660
On top of all the military harassment of Taiwan,

129
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,460
“Taiwan’s government says China has intentionally

130
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,360
hampered its efforts to get virus information

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,310
direct from the World Health Organization.

132
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,039
China blocks Taiwan’s WHO membership

133
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,750
as it considers the island merely one of its
provinces.”

134
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
Shameless and disgusting...

135
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,550
is what the CCP called Taiwan.

136
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,110
A Chinese official said,

137
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,980
“The use of the epidemic to stir up

138
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,539
cross-Taiwan Strait confrontations

139
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:21,509
at a time when the outbreak in Taiwan

140
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,169
is picking up is shameless and disgusting.”

141
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,409
And again, for clarity, that was the Chinese
Communist Party

142
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:33,129
criticizing Taiwan for being shameless and
disgusting.

143
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:38,300
That’s like the pot calling the magical
pink unicorn black.

144
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,669
Meanwhile, China’s Maritime Militia is fanning
out

145
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,509
in disputed territorial waters in the South
China Sea.

146
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,740
We did a whole episode about

147
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,790
the Maritime Militia back in September.

148
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,940
They’re a fun bunch.

149
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,479
The point is, just because

150
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,629
you exposed the world to a deadly pandemic,

151
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,379
doesn’t mean you can’t keep throwing gasoline
on the fire!

152
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,680
Wow, reminds me of Twitter.

153
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,639
I wonder if there is some kind of catastrophe

154
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,030
the Chinese Communist Party is trying to distract
people from.

155
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,509
Last week I told you that the Chinese government

156
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,789
kicked out reporters from the New York Times,

157
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,360
Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post.

158
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,320
Well this week, the the papers penned this
open letter,

159
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,180
begging the Chinese regime to let them back
in.

160
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
I mean, what the Chinese Communist Party

161
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,860
did to them was really unfair!

162
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,449
I mean, all three papers had tried so hard

163
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,419
to be good to the Communist Party.

164
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,300
Like by not covering sensitive topics.

165
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,229
And by letting the Communist Party directly
put propaganda

166
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,520
in their newspapers as paid advertising.

167
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,909
You really want the Chinese Communist Party
to let you back in?

168
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,949
Start writing articles about how the Party

169
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,270
kills Falun Gong and Uighurs for their organs.

170
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,940
Put those on the front page.

171
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,240
Do it every day.

172
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,250
Pretty soon, the Party will figure out

173
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,229
it’s better to have you in China,

174
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,729
where they can still control you.

175
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,900
China has launched three new

176
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,259
military surveillance satellites into orbit.

177
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,699
But despite the success,

178
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,550
celebration was muted as technicians

179
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,039
applied appropriate social distancing.

180
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,419
Now while Chinese military surveillance satellites

181
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,379
may sound scary, don’t worry,

182
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,069
they “will be used for electromagnetic environment
detection

183
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,259
and related technological tests.”

184
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,710
Just trust the Chinese military.

185
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,960
And with the knowledge the Chinese military

186
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,189
has a bunch of surveillance satellites overhead,

187
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:32,490
I think now’s a good time to tell you about
the VPN Surfshark.

188
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,850
When you go online, everything you do is being
tracked and logged—

189
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,630
by the websites you visit and your internet
service provider.

190
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,150
And in many cases, by the government.

191
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,160
And if you’re in an authoritarian country
like China,

192
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,460
this kind of tracking can put you

193
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,880
at risk of surveillance and even arrest.

194
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,590
So I recommend you use Surfshark to protect
yourself online.

195
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,680
When you use Surfshark’s CleanWeb mode,

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,630
you’ll be protected from trackers, plus
a lot of ads and malware.

197
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,640
And with Surfshark,

198
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,690
you can connect as many devices as you want.

199
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,960
Try it out with a 30-day money back guarantee.

200
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,380

Uncensored fans.
