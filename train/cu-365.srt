00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,780
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,280
I’ve heard the expression

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,870
“Spare the rod, spoil the child.”

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,180
But I’m pretty sure this is not the kind
of rod they were talking about.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,860
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,500
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,780
Well, it’s back to school time, kids,

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,410
and you know what that means—new backpacks,

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,570
freshly sharpened pencils, and mandatory military
drills!

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,789
Got to be ready to give your life

11
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,529
for the glorious Communist Party at any age.

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,320
But, at one kindergarten in Shenzhen,

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,390
the city where your iPhones are made,

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,650
thought they’d try something a little different
this year.

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,350
Pole dancing.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,040
I think some kids kind of liked it.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,040
American journalist Michael Standaert,

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,330
whose kids went to this kindergarten,

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,989
posted the pole dancing footage on Twitter.

20
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,790
It had been circulating on WeChat among angry
parents.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,980
Apparently the principal of Xinshahui Kindergarten
in Shenzhen

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,780
thought pole dancing was the best way

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,040
to welcome students into a new school year.

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,530
According to Standaert, the principal even
personally

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,420
performed a pole dance using the school flagpole.

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,070
Which is...patriotic?

27
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,200
Then she brought in another dancer.

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,450
Because obviously, you can’t just have one
pole dance.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,150
Kindergartens in China are part of preschool
education,

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,130
so the kids at the school were between 3 and
6 years old.

31
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,240
The principal, Lai Rong, defended her actions,

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,090
saying the pole dancing was to “liven up
the mood.”

33
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,500
And I can understand, kids that age are hard
to entertain!

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,299
I mean, the school already did

35
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,900
the military indoctrination thing over the
summer.

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,350
So there weren’t a lot of options left.

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,040
On the phone, the principal told Standaert’s
wife

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,320
that pole dancing was “international and
good exercise.”

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,550
She also told her that they were

40
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,479
“planning on having pole dancing classes
at the school.”

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,830
The parents of the kindergartners however,
were not thrilled.

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,880
Many called the police, the media,

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,029
and the local education bureau to complain.

44
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,439
So this story went viral.

45
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,430
Even the BBC had to cover it.

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,799
Very improper.

47
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,129
And once the story made Chinese and international
headlines,

48
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,250
the local education bureau

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,689
decided it should probably make a statement.

50
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:27,639
They said the pole dance was “inappropriate,”

51
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,319
and said the principal should be fired.

52
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,629
Well, she was.

53
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,769
After the public outcry, Principal Lai apologized,
saying

54
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,379
“It was a very terrible viewing experience

55
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,340
for the kids and the parents.”

56
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,620
I mean, c’mon, the dancing wasn’t that
bad.

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,780
Principal Lai also told the Washington Post,

58
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,290
“I just want the kids to know

59
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,439
the existence of this kind of dance.”

60
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,439
Perfectly reasonable!

61
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,969
3 to 6 year olds

62
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,760
should know about the existence of pole dancing.

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,890
Principal Lai calls herself a “pole dancing
enthusiast”

64
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,799
and said that she started pole dancing

65
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,999
to help her back and shoulder problems,

66
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:08,189
and even lost 20 pounds dancing.

67
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,849
I guess this is just a case where her personal
enthusiasm

68
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,010
overwhelmed her professional boundaries.

69
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,290
Like the time that Producer Matt tried to
build

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,230
an entire set for China Uncensored out of
Legos.

71
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,959
That was not ok, Matt!

72
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,479
I was stepping on Legos for weeks.

73
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,339
But unlike Matt, I think principal Lai can
be forgiven,

74
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,339
because pole dancing

75
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,569
is even being pushed in state-run media,

76
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,079
like my favorite, the Global Times.

77
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,349
Okay, I think that one got lost in translation.

78
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,989
That’s more like dancing with poles.

79
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,349
But here’s another Global Times article
that’s…

80
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,569
well it’s really not so much an article,

81
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,180
as it is just a series of pictures of women
pole dancing.

82
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,890
The headline is “Hot pole dancing staged
in the street”

83
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,879
but it doesn’t say which street.

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,659
Or even which country.

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,269
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

86
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,069
You’re kidding.

87
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,069
Poland?

88
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,069
Pole-land?!

89
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,579
That’s too good.

90
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,790
Although that still doesn’t explain why
the Global Times

91
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,479
would publish those photos.

92
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,229
I guess it’s a mystery.

93
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:21,949
But the Global Times isn’t the only state-run
media

94
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,780
pushing the pole-dancing agenda.

95
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,800
Here’s a video from another state-run media,

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,930
the English version of Xinhua.

97
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,740
“The pole dance has become a way for people
to keep fit,

98
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,009
especially for girls and women.”

99
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,490
And can I just say, the guy teaching that
class is amazing.

100
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,490
Check out his t-shirt.

101
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,169
Yes, pole dancing is actually

102
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,370
something of a fitness craze in China right
now.

103
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,770
It started ten years ago,

104
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,090
according to this New York Times article from
2008.

105
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,389
I guess it’s like the yoga fitness craze
in America.

106
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,540
Only less spiritual and more...vertical.

107
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,580
According to CNN, “Hundreds of studios are

108
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,789
popping up across the country.”

109
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,500
One of the pole dancing experts they interviewed
said,

110
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,120
"At this point, in the whole country—everywhere,

111
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,580
every province, every corner—pole dancing
is popular...

112
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
Everyone has been exposed to this now."

113
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,370
Yep, everyone.

114
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,930
Including kindergarteners.

115
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
But get this:

116
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,620
“[Pole Dancing] is so hot that China

117
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,750
even has a national pole dance team,

118
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,300
and regularly hosts competitions in cities

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,860
like Beijing and Hong Kong.”

120
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,539
Yes, China has established its own national
pole dancing team!

121
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,319
And according to Principal Lai,

122
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,250
why shouldn’t she be able to introduce pole
dancing to the kids

123
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,949
when there’s even a pole dancing world championship?

124
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,270
Well, I there are plenty of things with world
championships

125
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,770
that I don’t think should be introduced
to young children.

126
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,500
Like Australian rules football.

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,680
Or air guitar.

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,669
But wait, if Principal Lai is saying that
pole dancing

129
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,620
is a prestigious international sport,

130
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,949
then this starts to make sense.

131
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,930
After all, the Chinese Communist Party

132
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,210
considers it a matter of national pride

133
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,849
to win international sports competitions.

134
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,240
That’s why for the Olympics,

135
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,090
they start the athletes out young,

136
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,849
and make them train brutally hard.

137
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,590
All for the glory of future Olympic gold.

138
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,060
Sure, Principal Lai has been fired from being
a principal.

139
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,720
But what if she’s playing the long game
here?

140
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,870
She could combine her love of children

141
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,789
with her love of pole dancing

142
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,669
and open her own pole dancing schools for
children!

143
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,050
And then one day,

144
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,749
when pole dancing becomes a recognized Olympic
sport,

145
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:49,360
she’ll have the last laugh.

146
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,310
After all, it’s not that much weirder than
racewalking.

147
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,349
You may see confused children,

148
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:00,979
but someone else clearly sees a future of
pole-dancing gold medals.

149
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,389
So what do you think about pole dancing at
a Chinese preschool?

150
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,039
Leave your comments below.

151
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:07,039
And before you go,

152
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,849
it’s that time when I answer questions

153
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,939
from fans who support China Uncensored

154
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,460
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

155
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,060
michiganpizza asks

156
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,719
“personally, china seemed less of a mess

157
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,169
under battle toad than under pooh.”

158
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,770
Ah, using the lingo like a pro.

159
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,610
For those of you who don’t know,

160
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,870
battle toad refers to this guy, Jiang Zemin,

161
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,639
former leader of China.

162
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,970
Winnie-the-Pooh is the current leader of China,
Xi Jinping.

163
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,919
I think it’s obvious why those are their
nicknames.

164
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,120
So Mr. Pizza, that’s a common misconception.

165
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,259
It’s not that things are worse under Pooh.

166
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,550
It’s that they’re more visibly bad.

167
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,550
Things were horrible under battle toad, too.

168
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,830
And in many ways they were worse.

169
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,080
For example, Jiang Zemin had the idea

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,669
to round up people for practicing Falun Gong,

171
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,849
even though Falun Gong had been recognized

172
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,479
by the government as being beneficial.

173
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,130
Then Jiang gave his security forces the order
to, quote,

174
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,660
“Ruin their reputations,

175
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,229
bankrupt them financially,

176
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,509
and destroy them physically.”

177
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,840
And destroy them he did.

178
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,830
Millions of people were put in labor camps,

179
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,850
detention centers, and prisons.

180
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,020
We don’t know exactly how many people were
killed under Jiang,

181
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,909
but it’s likely in the tens of thousands,
if not higher,

182
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:31,370
including through his whole scheme to harvest
their organs

183
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,680
and sell them for profit.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,180
Plus he directed a huge anti-Falun Gong media
propaganda campaign.

185
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,550
But there was no social media in China

186
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,200
back in the 90s and early 2000s

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,680
when Jiang Zemin was officially in power.

188
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,260
And it was easier for the Communist Party

189
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,399
to manipulate how foreign journalists reported
on China.

190
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,240
Most of the issues we’re dealing with today—

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,980
intellectual property theft,

192
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,170
trade violations,

193
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,779
currency manipulation, well,

194
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,750
those were things Jiang Zemin helped kick
off.

195
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,190
It just took 20 years for the rest of the
world to catch on.

196
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,240
I’m not saying Xi Jinping is a great guy

197
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,990
and you should invite him to parties.

198
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,690
Under Xi Jinping, we’ve definitely seen
more news stories

199
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,420
about arrests of lawyers, dissidents, and
religious believers,

200
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,149
like in Xinjiang.

201
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,880
But I think partly that’s because there’s

202
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,950
just so much more reporting now.

203
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,700
There’s information now passed through social
media

204
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,070
that could not have been possible 20 years
ago,

205
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,510
and state-run propaganda is not as effective
anymore.

206
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,790
So both leaders have done bad things.

207
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,920
But it’s also not just these two leaders.

208
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,190
The Communist Party itself is the problem.

209
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,459
The Party is what creates the system

210
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,010
where persecution of groups is easy,

211
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,170
as well as practically necessary to maintain
power.

212
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,899
So it doesn’t matter which man is in charge.

213
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,310
There will always be serious abuses

214
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,690
while the Communist Party controls China.

215
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,880
But I suppose, at least when it comes to mass
murder,

216
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,420
Jiang Zemin is probably the worst leader since
Mao.

217
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,329
Or I guess better,

218
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:15,000
if you’re going for a gold medal for mass
murder.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,519
Thanks for your question!

220
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,889
In case you don’t know,

221
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,610
China Uncensored episodes are often getting
demonetized

222
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,850
by YouTube because the content is too “controversial.”

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,899
So we started crowdfunding the show on the
website Patreon.

224
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,940
