1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,320
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,000
what happens when a beauty pageant gets ugly.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,800
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,560
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
You know,

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,119
when I started a comedy show that exposes
the things

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,470
that the Chinese Communist Party wants to
keep under wraps,

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,830
I never imagined I would spend so much time

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,140
talking about beauty queens.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,199
Specifically, Miss World Canada Anastasia
Lin.

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,199
We know her,

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,199
we love her.

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,199
And she...

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,089
at least knows who I am.

15
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:34,089
I mean,

16
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:35,090
she’s been on my show.

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,019
What’s awesome is that she’s been

18
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,050
using her Miss World platform

19
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,620
to expose human rights atrocities in China.

20
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,039
Now you’d think Miss World

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,760
would be proud of someone like Anastasia Lin.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,129
The UK-based Miss World beauty pageant

23
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:51,690
isn’t just about looks.

24
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,690
After all,

25
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,690
their motto is "Beauty with a Purpose."

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,190
They even got rid of the swimsuit competition.

27
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,699
As Miss World’s chairman Julia Morley said
in an interview

28
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:02,850
with Elle Magazine,

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,790
"I don't care if someone has a bottom two
inches bigger

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,320
than someone else's.

31
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,600
We are really not looking at her bottom.

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,200
We are really listening to her speak."

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,000
That’s a nice sentiment—

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,550
if it were true.

35
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,180
Because when the bottom in question

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,820
is Miss World’s bottom line,

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,140
speaking suddenly gets more complicated.

38
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,520
You see,

39
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,610
all of the Miss World organization’s sponsors

40
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,570
appear to be Chinese companies.

41
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,940
I know it’s a little hard to see there

42
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,160
because it’s really tiny and they put it

43
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,880
all the way at the bottom of their site.

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
You know,

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,100
the way you do when you're really,

46
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,060
really proud of your sponsors.

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,100
Since 2003,

48
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,170
the Miss World finals

49
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,930
have been held in China 7 times,

50
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,170
mostly in the city of Sanya.

51
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,710
And Sanya has put a lot of money into Miss
World,

52
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,909
including a $31 million dollar investment

53
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,500
into infrastructure for the pageant.

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,810
Last year, Sanya paid Miss World 4.8 million
dollars

55
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,570
to host the finals in their city,

56
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,989
and let them keep 100 percent of the broadcasting
fees

57
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,300
paid by TV networks outside China.

58
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,569
So what happens when one of your contests
is,

59
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,879
I don’t know,

60
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,829
“misguided by her values,”

61
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,190
according to Chinese state-run media?

62
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,920
She gets barred from entering China.

63
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,219
That’s right.

64
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,519
In 2015,

65
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,019
China refused to grant Anastasia a visa,

66
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,540
calling her "persona non grata."

67
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,579
And Chinese public security officers harassed
her father,

68
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,129
who still lives in China,

69
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,900
and eventually bankrupted his company.

70
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,950
What did the Miss World organization do?

71
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,090
I mean, what could they do, am I right?

72
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,120
Their hands were tied.

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,639
It's not their fault if a contestant somehow
violated

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,959
the host country's regulations!

75
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,230
What were they going to do, speak up for her?

76
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,230
It wasn't all bad though.

77
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,830
The media firestorm gave Anastasia a new platform

78
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,939
to speak about human rights,

79
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,939
and she did:

80
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,950
at places like Oxford University,

81
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,450
the National Press Club, and the Oslo Freedom
Forum.

82
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,050
She spoke to the British Parliament,

83
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,849
testified in front of Congress,

84
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,109
and met the Dalai Lama.

85
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:18,450
And she's also starring in a movie that was
just released,

86
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,889
called the Bleeding Edge--

87
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,780
a thriller about Western companies

88
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,480
taking huge sums of money to help China

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,939
censor its citizens,

90
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,930
and the cover up of forced organ harvesting

91
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,640
from prisoners of conscience.

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,739
I bet that movie’s banned in China.

93
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,629
Download it on iTunes while you still can.

94
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,549
Plus Miss World Canada,

95
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,450
the quasi-independent Canadian division of
the organization,

96
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,840
which stood up for Anastasia Lin in the first
place,

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,319
decided to extend her title an extra year.

98
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,239
That way, she can compete in this year’s
finals—

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,609
which fortunately are being held in Washington,
DC—

100
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,680
not China.

101
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,459
Anyway, Miss Lin goes to Washington,

102
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,730
and everything goes smoothly after that.

103
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,519
Well if that were true,

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
you wouldn't be watching this episode right
now.

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,049
You see, the Miss World organization

106
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,159
is now itself actively silencing Anastasia
Lin.

107
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,040
According to the New York Times,

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,030
“Pageant employees warned her that she would
be ejected

109
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,450
from the competition if she spoke to reporters.”

110
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,750
When a Boston Globe reporter took some initiative

111
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,670
and intercepted her in her hotel lobby,

112
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,010
Miss World officials hustled her away

113
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,220
while accusing her of causing trouble.

114
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,640
Which is funny,

115
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,410
because Chinese media have been given full
access

116
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,750
to interview the contestants.

117
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,100
The Miss World organization even tried to
block

118
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,420
a U.S. State Department official who wanted
to meet

119
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,200
with Anastasia Lin.

120
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,440
They finally agreed,

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,230
but only on the condition,

122
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,890
that they got to play chaperone during the
meeting.

123
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,660
And they forbid the State Department

124
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,030
from tweeting about the meeting.

125
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,520
Can they even do that?

126
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,670
Plus, Miss World denied Anastasia permission

127
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,350
to go to the premiere of the Bleeding Edge
in Washington DC.

128
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,140
So a British-owned beauty pageant

129
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,480
is preventing a Canadian beauty queen

130
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,090
from talking about Chinese human rights abuses

131
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,740
on American soil.

132
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,250
It really is Miss World.

133
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,190
It's not clear if the Miss World organization

134
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,900
is censoring Anastasia because they've been
pressured

135
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,120
by the Chinese government or their Chinese
sponsors,

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,610
or if they're just worried about possibly
being pressured

137
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,300
or losing money.

138
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,920
But it is clear that the organization itself

139
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,740
is doing the censoring.

140
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,640
They can't blame it on the hosting country's
visa requirements

141
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
this time.

142
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,320
Wait, what's that Shelley?

143
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
Well, well.

144
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,030
It looks like things have changed.

145
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,780
Just one day after everyone from the New York
Times to Cosmo

146
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,520
reported on Anastasia being silenced,

147
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,800
she's suddenly allowed to speak to the media
again.

148
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,070
And even attend her movie premiere.

149
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,230
I guess bad PR can really turn things around.

150
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,250
You know,

151
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,580
many companies are craven enough to self-censor

152
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,670
or censor others to appease the Chinese Communist
Party

153
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,330
for Chinese money.

154
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,500
And sometimes the only thing we can do

155
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,340
is to call them out on it.

156
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,210
Good old fashioned public shaming.

157
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,680
I don't often say this,

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,170
but bravo, media, for covering this.

159
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,170
But you know what,

160
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,200
I think Anastasia could use an even bigger
megaphone.

161
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,740
Who could we get to talk about this?

162
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Let's see...

163
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,020
it would have to be someone who has experience

164
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,610
with beauty pageants,

165
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,240
who likes using social media,

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,680
who enjoys shaming people,

167
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,330
and who angers Chinese officials with big
symbolic gestures...

168
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,180
hmmmm....

169
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,460
Ok, I know what you're thinking.

170
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,700
Donald Trump doesn't have the best track record

171
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,870
when it comes to beauty queens.

172
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,000
But I still think he should meet with Anastasia.

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,270
Not in a dressing room,

174
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,720
and possibly with a chaperone.

175
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,200
But he is about the be the leader of the free
world.

176
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,870
He likes to do things that are out-of-the-box.

177
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,370
He does read Twitter.

178
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,340
And that meeting might just make Chinese officials
explode.

179
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,400
So seriously.

180
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,530
Whether you love him or hate him,

181
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,990
tweet at Donald Trump right now.

182
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,990
Tell him,

183
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,530
