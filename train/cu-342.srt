00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,100
get your nuclear submarine ready,

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,930
because we’re diving down,

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,940
into China’s deep state.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,740
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,039
China has long been seen

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
as the final go between for North Korea

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,230
and the rest of the world—

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,460
the only country that could do what sanctions

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,300
and international condemnation couldn’t—

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
get North Korea to back down

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,780
from its ballistic missile and nuclear program.

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,039
Kind of like North Korea's more responsible,

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,740
slightly less outwardly totalitarian big brother.

16
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,220
How's that going, by the way?

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,020
Yeah, ok, seems to be going really well.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,100
Unfortunately for China, the United States,

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,729
and the rest of the world,

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:07,200
North Korea is hitting its difficult teenage
years

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,509
and going full-on Rebel Without a Cause.

22
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:12,030
But instead of this:

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,350
You’re tearing me apart!

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,189
It's coming off more like this:

25
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,430
You’re tearing me apart, Lisa!

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,030
So has the Chinese regime really lost all
sway

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,130
over its Communist little brother?

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,420
If North Korea carries out its 6th nuclear
test,

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,899
would it, as my favorite state-run media

30
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:32,790
the Global Times says,

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,460
take relations beyond the point of no return?

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,549
And let me just say,

33
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:40,020
if the hawkish Global Times,

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,020
the ones who’ve said that

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,039
“China's nuclear capability should be so
strong

36
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,950
that no country would dare launch

37
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,799
a military showdown with China

38
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,249
under any circumstance,”

39
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,210
is arguing restraint,

40
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,469
you know things are bad.

41
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,869
But you may have noticed that in the past,

42
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,610
China treated North Korea less like

43
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,299
the responsible big brother

44
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,790
who gets you to quit smoking,

45
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,890
and more like the irresponsible big brother

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,219
who teaches you how to smoke

47
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,950
in your room with the windows open

48
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,590
so you're mom can't smell it.

49
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,450
China did things like supply 80%

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,060
of North Korea's imports.

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,071
And the Chinese Communist Party

52
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:18,430
turned a blind eye to Chinese companies

53
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,120
that violated UN sanctions

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,440
by supplying North Korea with,

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,610
for example,

56
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,459
nuclear bomb materials.

57
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,090
So what's different now?

58
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,430
Has North Korea just gotten so extreme

59
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,550
with all their nuclear talk

60
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,450
that they're even freaking out the Chinese
regime?

61
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,500
"Bro, I told you you could smoke a couple
of cigarettes

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,659
with the windows open,

63
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,689
not light the house on fire!"

64
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,370
Well, it's complicated.

65
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,370
And it all ties back

66
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,600
to China's very own deep state.

67
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,310
Loyal viewers of the show will remember me

68
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,720
talking once or twice about the life-or-death
fight

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,879
between former leader and toad-in-the-hole,
Jiang Zemin

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,550
and current leader, Xi Jinping.

71
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,750
But North Korea used to be much friendlier

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,319
when China was controlled by Xi’s political
rivals,

73
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,379
a faction tied to former Chinese leader, Jiang
Zemin.

74
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,930
Jiang Zemin and former North Korean god emperor,

75
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,920
Kim Jong-il were close.

76
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,940
Really close.

77
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,000
Uncomfortably close.

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,140
I guess they really took Mao’s quote

79
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,230
about being as close as lips and teeth

80
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,560
to heart.

81
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
By the way,

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,330
I fully expect this photo to inspire

83
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,099
some totalitarian leader relationship fanfiction,

84
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:33,510
because the internet.

85
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,590
North Korea was the first foreign country

86
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,870
Jiang visited after assuming power

87
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,819
in the wake of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

88
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,180
Primarily because North Korea was the only
country

89
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,069
cool with that sort of thing.

90
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,960
According to this Radio Free Asia article,

91
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,441
Jiang may have even given North Korea

92
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,480
the enriched uranium they needed

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,989
to start the nuclear weapons program

94
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,540
in retaliation for all the bad vibes he was
getting

95
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,989
from the rest of the world.

96
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,600
Jiang, you're such a troll.

97
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,650
Now Jiang Zemin is 90,

98
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,689
so he’s not all that active anymore.

99
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,170
Mostly.

100
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,010
But this toad literally dug a hole a

101
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,689
nd planted his own deep state

102
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:17,380
within the Chinese Communist Party-

103
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,200
loyal followers who carried out his plans

104
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,720
even when he was out of power.

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
And by the way,

106
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
if you've ever wondered why

107
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,740
I don't talk much about Hu Jintao,

108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,770
the Chinese leader that came between

109
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,330
Jiang and Xi,

110
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,840
it's because Jiang put so many of his people

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,400
in positions of power

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,870
that they basically crippled Hu

113
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,890
for almost his entire time in office.

114
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,320
In fact, this photo pretty much expresses

115
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,380
how Hu and Xi feel about Jiang.

116
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,510
Anyway, Jiang's faction continued to have

117
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,420
very close ties with North Korea.

118
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,820
And as one China analyst told the Epoch Times,

119
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,150
Jiang’s people, “may have even influenced

120
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,540
the timing of North Korea’s five nuclear tests”

121
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,440
as a distraction whenever their faction

122
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,430
came under attack.

123
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,430
For example,

124
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,330
North Korea conducted its first nuclear test

125
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,440
shortly after one of Jiang's proteges,

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,230
and a potential future Party leader,

127
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,640
was sacked for corruption.

128
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,660
And it goes beyond just influencing

129
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,920
North Korea's nuclear tests.

130
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,340
Here's another Jiang guy,

131
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,340
Wang Jiarui.

132
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
For 12 years he was the head

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,570
of the International Liaison Department.

134
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,850
Here he is with Kim Jong-il.

135
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,840
And Kim Jong-un.

136
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,600
He's the guy who allowed all that trade

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,650
between China and North Korea.

138
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,710
Including those nuclear bomb materials.

139
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,370
Then there’s Zhou Yongkang,

140
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,800
known to his friends as "Sunshine"

141
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,380
and one of the highest ranking members

142
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,080
of Jiang’s clique, brought down in Xi Jinping’s

143
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
anti corruption campaign.

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,760
Before he got purged like the aftermath

145
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,370
of a Fourth of July hot dog eating contest,

146
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,210
he was the head of the Communist Party’s

147
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,020
internal security apparatus,

148
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,530
and one of the biggest supporters

149
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,140
of the Kim dynasty.

150
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,770
Why, he was even there

151
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,850
when Kim Jong-il led his son, Kim Jong-un,

152
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,330
out as the heir apparent.

153
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,570
"Hi kid,

154
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,260
say hello to your Uncle Zhou!"

155
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,880
And speaking of uncles,

156
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,820
Zhou also may have been responsible

157
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,310
for Kim Jong-un's execution of his own.

158
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,990
Kim’s uncle visited China in 2012

159
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,960
to meet with Hu Jintao.

160
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,080
Apparently to discuss stopping North Korea’s
nuclear program

161
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,560
in exchange for economic development,

162
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,830
and replacing Kim Jong-un with his step-brother,

163
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,520
Kim Jong-Nam.

164
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
You know,

165
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,240
the one who was just assassinated.

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,130
By poison.

167
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,130


168
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,130
But according to this China analyst,

169
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,270
Zhou told Kim about Jang's conversation,

170
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,910
and Kim had his uncle purged.

171
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,180
And executed.

172
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,590
And it continues to this day.

173
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,610
Xi Jinping is opposed by three members

174
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,650
of the Jiang faction

175
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,810
in the Politburo Standing Committee,

176
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,870
the most powerful old dudes in China.

177
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,930
The two Zhangs,

178
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,930
no relation,

179
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,360
both studied in Pyongyang

180
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,430
and have made several state visits.

181
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,410
Here’s Zhang Dejiang with the two Kims.

182
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,530
And here’s Liu Yunshan

183
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,680
having a grand time with Kim Jong-un.

184
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,980
It was under Jiang Zemin and his cronies

185
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,060
that North Korea was able to develop into

186
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,720
the potential nuclear threat it is today.

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,080
So it’s not too surprising that Xi Jinping,

188
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,180
the political enemy of North Korea’s Chinese
allies,

189
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,280
has had such a hard time reigning in

190
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,120
the rogue regime.

191
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,721
So can China stop North Korea

192
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:30,190
from developing a nuclear bomb?

193
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,660
It may depend on how much trouble

194
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,260
Jiang's people can still cause.

195
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,090
Because even though Xi is doing a pretty good
job

196
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,350
of digging out Jiang's faction so far,

197
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,970
the roots go pretty deep.

198
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,330
What do you think about China's ability

199
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,020
to stop North Korea?

207
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,090
