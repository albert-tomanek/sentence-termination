1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,360
One last nail has been put in the coffin

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,360
of democracy in Hong Kong.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,680
It only gets worse from here.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,520
Well, I’ve got good news for\h
the Chinese Communist Party:\h\h

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,200
They’ve successfully killed\h
democracy in Hong Kong.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Now to be fair, democracy in\h
Hong Kong was always a bit shaky.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,280
For example, Hong Kong citizens were never allowed\h
to directly vote for their Chief Executive.\h\h

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
That position is chosen by a group of 1,200\h\h

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,280
influential Hong Kong citizens, mostly\h
tied to the Chinese Communist Party.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,360
And while the Hong Kong\h
Legislative Council has 70 seats,\h\h

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
Hong Kongers were only allowed to\h
vote for 35 of those legislators.\h\h

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,400
Most of them support Hong Kong’s freedoms,\h
but that doesn’t matter because the rest of\h\h

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,760
the legislators are directly awarded to the\h
Pro-Beijing side and special interest groups.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,880
But now, even having elected\h
representatives is basically done.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,440
The pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong's\h
legislature have decided to resign en masse,\h\h

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,560
in protest of the expulsion of four of their\h
own who are accused by the city government of\h\h

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,400
endangering national security. It's the latest\h
in the tense ongoing dispute over the autonomy\h\h

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,760
of China's freest city. The opposition lawmakers\h
had threatened earlier this week that they would\h\h

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,360
resign from the 70-seat council if any members\h
were disqualified. And then on Wednesday it\h\h

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,760
happened. Politicians Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki,\h
Kenneth Leung, and Dennis Kwok, were expelled,\h\h

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,800
but the city government did not elaborate\h
on the accusation of endangering security.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Ever since the Chinese Communist Party\h
forced a national security law on Hong Kong\h\h

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,800
over the summer, Hong Kong’s freedoms have been\h
strangled. Political arrests have become common.\h

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,560
But the latest—with four pro-democracy\h
legislators fired for allegedly\h\h

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,840
endangering national security, despite no other\h
information being given—that’s a huge escalation.\h\h

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,920
So the last remaining 19 pro-democracy\h
legislators decided to call it quits.\h\h

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,320
Since I’m pretty sure everyone knew it was just\h
a matter of time before they got purged, too.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,960
Legislative elections, which were\h
supposed to be held in September,\h\h

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,480
were postponed for a year “because\h
of the coronavirus”—right.

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,040
And now they might as well just\h
cancel elections all together.

32
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
Essentially, the Chinese\h
Communist Party has what it wants.\h\h

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
The people of Hong Kong have no say in their\h
government anymore. Hong Kong is just like\h\h

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,600
any other Chinese city now—subject to the\h
arbitrary policies of communist officials.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,520
Which means Hong Kong’s days as an\h
international financial center are also over.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,280
On November 9, the US sanctioned four\h
more Chinese officials over Hong Kong.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,800
They are Deng Zhonghua, deputy director\h
of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office;\h\h

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Edwina Lau, deputy commissioner of police in\h
Hong Kong, and Li Jiangzhou and Li Kwai-wah,\h\h

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,600
two officials at the newly established\h
national security office in Hong Kong.

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,320
The sanctions prevent them from traveling to the\h
US, or having access to any US related assets.\h\h

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,200
These are actually pretty hard-hitting\h
sanctions. The US has already imposed\h\h

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,800
sanctions on other Hong Kong officials,\h
including Chief Executive Carrie Lam. For more,\h\h

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,120
check out our episode on that, Hong\h
Kong’s rich elite are screwed.\h

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,800
Last month, the State Department warned\h\h

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,880
major international banks that they could\h
easily get caught up in those sanctions.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
But while sanctions are effective at punishing\h
individuals involved in killing Hong Kong’s\h\h

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,880
freedoms, things are still looking grim\h
for the regular people of Hong Kong.\h\h

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,080
This week also saw the arrest of another\h
student activist, for assisting fugitives.

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
All in all, I think Hong Kong is a\h
pretty good warning as to what happens\h\h

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,240
when the Chinese Communist Party gains\h
more power and control over a place.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,640
Hey Taiwan, are you ready\h
for peaceful reunification?

52
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h\h

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,000
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon!

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,360
Mark Hewitson asks, “Hey Chris, besides watching\h
the show and becoming aware of these issues,\h\h

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
what can people do to help?”

56
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
That’s an excellent question, I\h
get that a lot. So as you said,\h\h

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,840
watching China Uncensored is a good way to learn\h
about China, and sharing episodes with your\h\h

58
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,840
friends and family can also help them understand\h
the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.

59
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
Even just telling them about what’s\h
happening makes a difference.\h

60
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,720
But what more can you do? For one,\h
you could tell your elected officials\h\h

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
to stand up to the Chinese regime.You can\h
call your representatives and senators\h\h

62
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
and tell them you want them to\h
support a tougher China policy.\h\h

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,920
You can vote for officials who understand\h
what the Chinese Communist Party is doing.\h\h

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,360
The Communist Party has very successfully\h
infiltrated the United States at\h\h

65
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,200
all levels of society. So take a look at your\h
own community. For example, does your college\h\h

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,400
or university have a Confucius Institute? Or\h
does it get money from the Chinese government?\h

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,200
If you’re a young person who is interested\h
in China, I would encourage you to go study\h\h

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,280
Chinese history, language, and culture. Study the\h
Chinese Communist Party. We need more people who\h\h

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,120
understand what the Party is doing in our own\h
government, think tanks, and military. Or you\h\h

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,160
could become a reporter, or start your own thing\h
on YouTube, or other social media platforms to\h\h

71
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,480
share what you know. This is an information war,\h
and from that perspective, we’re all soldiers.

72
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,160
Thanks for your question Mark.
