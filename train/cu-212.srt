00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,320
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,900
religion in China is getting sinicized.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,700
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,820
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,540
You’ve probably read so-called reports

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,690
that under the Communist Party in China,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,900
people who practice religion

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,529
are constantly oppressed,

9
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:19,529
arrested,

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:20,640
even tortured.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,220
Well, good news, everyone!

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,359
The Party has just released some new regulations

13
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,240
that should convince you that everything’s

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,829
going to change for the better.

15
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:32,990
Religions are going to “sinicize.”

16
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,610
No, that’s not what your new-agey friend

17
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,550
does with a neti pot to clear their sinuses.

18
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,690
English state-run China Global Television
Network explains.

19
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,460
“The new regulations highlight religious

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,620
and social harmony;

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,010
they call for respect between believers

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,010
and non believers;

23
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,820
as well as between religions.”

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,560
Wow, these new regulations

25
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,650
sound like real progress has been made!

26
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,560
I can see now why the Communist Party

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,210
was so upset by that recent US report

28
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,930
criticizing China’s religious freedom.

29
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,760
That US report claims that

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,460
“the Chinese government tortures and imprisons

31
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,950
thousands for their religious beliefs.”

32
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,060
Including Tibetans, Muslims,

33
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,700
Falun Gong, and Christians.

34
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,249
But that report covered China in 2016.

35
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:17,249
That was the old,

36
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,569
antiquated China.

37
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,920
Now is the new,

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,159
cool China—

39
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,389
the enlightened China

40
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,799
that’s totally on board with religion.

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,799
Unless for some reason

42
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,229
China’s state-run media

43
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:29,060
isn’t giving us the full picture

44
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,890
and this is instead part of some elaborate
scam

45
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,890
to spread propaganda to the West.

46
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,990
But that wouldn’t be very Christian of them,

47
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,299
would it?

48
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:40,070
China has five officially recognized religions:

49
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,710
Buddhism, Taoism, Islam,

50
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,159
Christianity and Catholicism,

51
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,399
yes, in China

52
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,420
those last two things are different.

53
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,149
And if you want to practice religion,

54
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,429
and not get in trouble,

55
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,429
you need to belong to

56
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,310
one of those official religions.

57
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,490
That’s what Article 36 of China’s constitution

58
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,759
means when it says,

59
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,459
“Citizens of the People’s Republic of
China

60
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,349
enjoy freedom of religious belief.”

61
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,210
The catch is that citizens enjoy

62
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,929
freedom of religious belief

63
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:06,780
so long as they belong to one of those

64
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,560
state-approved religions,

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,010
where the leaders are hand-picked

66
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,330
by the Communist Party.

67
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,920
It’s like, if you’re given total freedom

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,420
to pick your school’s vice principal

69
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,460
from among these three guys.

70
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,820
I’m sure they’re all good choices.

71
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,080
Well, following China’s announcement

72
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,620
of the new regulations,

73
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,950
the Party-approved leaders

74
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,680
from the five official religions

75
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,900
held a forum together

76
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,320
and decided they’re all totally on board

77
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,920
with the CCP’s request

78
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,450
that they sinicize their religions.

79
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,780
“Sinicize” is just a fancy way of saying

80
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,740
“Chinese-ify.”

81
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,380
Which in this case has nothing to do with

82
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,990
Chinese culture.

83
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,990
This time,

84
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,220
it’s a totally made up way of saying,

85
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,250
“[Religious] leaders must steer religions
forward

86
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,710
with Chinese socialism.”

87
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,020
That’s how one Politburo member explained
it.

88
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,250
He also said,

89
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,720
“Whatever your belief is,

90
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,510
you must first abide by law.”

91
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,650
So to be clear, the hierarchy is:

92
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,910
The Communist Party;

93
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,390
Then socialism—

94
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
or whatever current system

95
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,370
the Communist Party decides to promote;

96
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,620
Then Chinese law—

97
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,580
not the “freedom of religion” law,

98
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,810
the, um, other laws;

99
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,390
And then God.

100
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,390
So in China,

101
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,760
the “thou shalt have no other gods before
me” thing

102
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,730
is...more of a suggestion.

103
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,730
The new regulations

104
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,740
that Chinese state-run media

105
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,150
are so eager to promote

106
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,220
are essentially about controlling religious
institutions

107
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,930
and forcing religious believers

108
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,850
to do what the Communist Party tells them.

109
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,940
The Party also has a specific concern

110
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,810
they’re hoping to address with this:

111
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,500
Islamic extremism.

112
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Mu Kefa,

113
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,340
deputy chairman of the China Islamic Association
said,

114
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,160
“The goal of sinicizing the religion actually
is to

115
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,450
guard against ‘desinicization’ in Islam,

116
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,050
a trend of misleading use

117
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,650
of the halal concept.”

118
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,760
Yeah, Halal Guys,

119
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,590
you aren’t doing enough to sinicize.

120
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,640
Where’s my General Tso’s Chicken gyro?

121
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
But seriously,

122
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,370
it’s like these Party-approved religious
leaders

123
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,040
are just regurgitating mindless Party slogans.

124
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,080
But the real question is,

125
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,650
“Have these new regulations that

126
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,670
‘highlight religious and social harmony’

127
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,790
achieved anything?”

128
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,760
Let’s take a look at the scene on the ground.

129
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,720
Oh, they’re still demolishing Christian
churches.

130
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Yeah.

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
It turns out there’s

132
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,510
a bit more to the new regulations

133
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,040
than what English language state-run media
told us.

134
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,480
The new regulations massively restrict religious
freedom.

135
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,380
Impressive, considering I didn’t think they
had

136
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,310
any more room to squeeze.

137
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,590
But the Communist Party leaders

138
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,720
are real miracle workers.

139
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,040
Also, with the new regulations:

140
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,320
online religious discussion

141
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,580
will be under surveillance.

142
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,400
Not that they weren’t under surveillance
before,

143
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
but you know,

144
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,640
it’s always nice to have more laws

145
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,350
making it official.

146
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,380
They also limit religious gatherings.

147
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,110
There’s a bunch of new restrictions

148
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,520
on building places of worship

149
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,860
and financing religious groups.

150
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,080
Foreign donations are outright banned,

151
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,800
and local “donations over 100,000 yuan

152
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,320
need to be reported to authorities.”

153
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,270
The Chinese regime also gets new powers

154
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,890
over setting up religious colleges.

155
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,639
Now all that is related to the official

156
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,080
state-run churches and temples.

157
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,780
But let’s say that you weren’t interested
in

158
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,510
having any of these guys for your vice principal.

159
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,030
You were looking at more of a Mr. Belding
kind of guy.

160
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,030
Which is to say,

161
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,160
you’re one of the millions of Chinese citizens

162
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,250
who worship in non-state approved churches.

163
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,660
Well, time out,

164
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,830
because for you,

165
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,650
things get even worse.

166
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,140
The regulations “increase existing restrictions

167
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,139
on unregistered religious groups

168
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,940
to include explicit bans on

169
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,230
teaching about religion or going abroad

170
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,250
to take part in training or meetings.”

171
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,910
But what’s really amazing

172
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,820
is that so many people in China

173
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,040
are religious—

174
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,120
despite all the harsh regulations,

175
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,630
and a legacy of communism

176
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,260
that banned all religions under Chairman Mao.

177
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,640
Over the last 40 years,

178
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,790
religious belief has been on

179
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,760
a sharp rise in China.

180
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,670
According to one study,

181
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,139
“85 percent of the Chinese

182
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,290
either hold some religious beliefs

183
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,850
or practice some kind of religion.”

184
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,150
And by 2030,

185
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,370
China might have more Christians

186
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,050
than any other country on Earth.

187
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,630
But the Communist Party is worried.

188
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,449
That’s why they’re encouraging people

189
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:13,830
to report on parents

190
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,740
who lure their kids into religion,

191
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
and ordering Churches

192
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,310
to install surveillance equipment.

193
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,050
The fundamental problem with religions

194
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,650
is that they provide an ideological alternative

195
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,740
to the wonderful world of

196
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,040
Marxist Leninist Maoist Thought.

197
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,449
So the Communist Party views religions

198
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,830
as as a challenge to their rule.

199
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,580
Which shows you how much confidence

200
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,550
they have in their own wonderful system.

201
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,300
So the Chinese authorities

202
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,889
continually try to clamp down on religions,

203
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,139
making sure they can never be

204
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,360
more powerful than the Party.

205
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,050
And they try to reduce religious belief

206
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,710
to Chinese patriotism,

207
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,710
to make sure believers

208
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,800
put the Communist Party before their God.

209
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,210
And if religious believers refuse to comply,

210
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,430
well, let’s just say they might be

211
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,010
going to Heaven a lot quicker.

212
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,320
What do you think of the new regulations?

213
