1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,500
Dubbed the “Little Blue Men”

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,660
China’s little-known Maritime Militia

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,710
is the bad cop of the seas.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,170
They do the dirty work that China’s navy
won’t.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,611
Helping China’s military

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,880
“win a war without gunsmoke.”

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,480
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,550
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,090
China’s navy is one of the biggest in the
world,

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,320
with about 400 warships and submarines.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,140
These ships belong to the People's Liberation
Army Navy—

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
or PLAN.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,080
It’s part of the armed wing of the Chinese
Communist Party.

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,500
And the People's Liberation Army Navy

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,070
are the big boys with the biggest toys.

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,900
And the biggest hammer and sickle.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,970
The Navy’s main job is to protect China

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,820
from hostile foreign invaders—

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,640
like the evil British—

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,510
And to be prepared in case they need to,

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,900
I don’t know,

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,920
invade a neighboring island.

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,960
The Communist Party also has

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,210
a second military force at sea:

25
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,650
the China Coast Guard,

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,780
which is run by the People’s Armed Police.

27
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,920
That’s China’s paramiltary police force,

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,059
which is run by the Central Military Commission.

29
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,470
The Coast Guard’s job is domestic law enforcement.

30
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,210
Which for China, I imagine would be

31
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,420
mostly cracking down on Chinese dissident
pirates.

32
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,670
Arrrrrr.

33
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,690
The Coast Guard also does search and rescue
missions...

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,670
at least when the state-run media cameras
are rolling.

35
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,590
And the Communist Party also yet another military
force at sea.

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,320
This third branch is the little-known

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,990
People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia,

38
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,370
or PAFMM.

39
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,570
I mean, with an acronym like PAFMM

40
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,120
you can’t really blame them for low brand
recognition.

41
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Definitely the worst acronym,

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,320
and also the worst ships.

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,590
These maritime militia ships are typically
civilian ships,

44
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,270
often with crews of fishermen.

45
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,580
But like the rest of China’s militia,

46
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,479
these ships answer to the People's Armed Forces
chain of command,

47
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,920
which is separate from the People’s Liberation
Army.

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,909
But when activated for missions,

49
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,549
they operate like a naval unit,

50
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,030
sometimes even taking instructions

51
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,450
directly from the People’s Liberation Army
Navy.

52
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,929
So they’re essentially civilian ships that
do

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,630
normal civilian stuff most of the time.

54
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,410
But they can be activated

55
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,200
like sleeper agents by the Chinese military.

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,170
China's maritime militia has been dubbed

57
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,880
the 'Little Blue Men'.

58
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,069
The guy who came up with the term Little Blue
Men

59
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,120
is Andrew Erickson,

60
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,470
a professor at the U.S. Naval War College

61
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,140
and author of China's Maritime Gray Zone Operations.

62
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,890
"Little blue men" is a reference to Russia's
"little green men."

63
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,000
Those are out-of-uniform Russian soldiers

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,690
used in Crimea and the Ukraine

65
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,480
to do all kinds of dirty work

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,760
without being officially tied to the Russian
military.

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,900
In his book “China's Maritime Gray Zone
Operations”,

68
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,020
Erickson describes how the Communist Party

69
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,280
uses the maritime militia to harass other
countries' navies

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,500
and wage what in Chinese is known as

71
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,140
a "war without gunsmoke."

72
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,960
That means pushing the limits of confrontation,

73
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,860
but stopping just short of outright combat

74
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,220
in order to “win without fighting.”

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,360
Sometimes these maritime militia ships themselves

76
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,660
are used like weapons—

77
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,480
to bump and ram other ships.

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,030
Ok, technically that smoke is not gunsmoke,

79
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,069
but someone’s definitely trying to start
a fight.

80
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,820
They use a whole range of non-lethal tactics,

81
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,330
including powerful water cannons

82
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,250
that can damage sensitive equipment on foreign
ships.

83
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,270
Why?

84
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,870
To drive other navies out and solidify

85
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,640
China's unresolved claims to territory in
the Yellow Sea,

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,780
East China Sea, and South China Sea.

87
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,040
Sometimes they band together...

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,060
... and barge into contested territorial waters.

89
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,989
In fact, the Philippines recently lodged

90
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,750
diplomatic complaints over Chinese Maritime
Militia ships

91
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,970
that surrounded parts of the Spratly Islands

92
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,250
administered by the Philippines.

93
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,580
Hundreds of the militia ships have been blocking
Filipino boats

94
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,209
from being able to fish in the area.

95
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,120
Other times, the maritime militia ships

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,010
swarm around US ships

97
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,310
on freedom of navigation missions.

98
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,550
All the while, the Chinese navy watches from
afar,

99
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,090
ready to jump in and escalate to full blown
conflict

100
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,499
if the American response to the maritime militia
is too forceful.

101
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,269
“China’s Navy is bear-hugging the US Navy

102
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,979
to learn more about our best practices,

103
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:25,559
talking the talk of a good cop,

104
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,789
while the bad cops—

105
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,030
the Coast Guard and maritime militia—

106
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,020
are doing the dirty work in the East China
Sea

107
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,919
and the South China Sea.”

108
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,259
The big danger is that one of these maritime
militia boats

109
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,310
might go a little too far in its role as the
bad cop.

110
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,090
Back in March 2009,

111
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,229
five Chinese Maritime Militia vessels

112
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,919
surrounded the USNS Impeccable—

113
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,110
an unarmed American ship doing an underwater
survey

114
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,240
in disputed waters off the coast of China’s
Hainan province.

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,979
These vessels “shadowed and aggressively
maneuvered

116
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,629
in dangerously close proximity.”

117
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:02,059
And then when the Impeccable tried to leave,

118
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,909
“two of the Chinese ships stopped

119
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,509
‘directly ahead of USNS Impeccable,

120
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,740
forcing Impeccable to conduct an emergency
“all stop”

121
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,110
in order to avoid collision.’”

122
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,069
Fortunately, there was no collision.

123
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:18,189
And after some angry diplomatic statements
from both sides,

124
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,509
the incident was swept under the rug.

125
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,099
But what if it happens again—

126
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,069
maybe during an American freedom of navigation
operation

127
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,460
near one of China’s newly militarized artificial
islands?

128
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,219
And what if this time, there *is* a collision?

129
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,759
Even if it’s accidental,

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,180
if a crew member on either side is killed,

131
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,909
it could quickly escalate past the point of
diplomacy.

132
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,740
And then the People’s Liberation Army Navy
gets called in,

133
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,690
and it won’t be a “war without gunsmoke”
any longer.

134
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,740
So what can the US do?

135
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,669
One option is to completely stop

136
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,210
all freedom of navigation operations.

137
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,349
But that’s not going to happen.

138
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,539
Because the moment the US stops,

139
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,180
the Chinese regime’s territorial claims
will go from this...

140
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,310
...to this.

141
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,310
Ryan Martinson,

142
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,849
a researcher at the US Naval War College,

143
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,589
says there’s another option.

144
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,129
He says the US should “develop a range of
nonlethal tactics

145
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,529
that it can use to achieve local effects

146
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,350
without resorting to use of force.”

147
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,129
That includes continuing the freedom of navigation
operations

148
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,750
that challenge the Communist Party’s territorial
claims.

149
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,159
And furthermore, he says,

150
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,110
“If the United States wants to be effectual,

151
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,639
it must do more to expose China’s gray zone
activities.”

152
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,819
Yes, they need to be exposed.

153
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,949
And I don’t mean the kind of exposure

154
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,149
like that time in 2009

155
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,939
when “the Chinese crewmembers disrobed to
their underwear”

156
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,309
and continued closing in on the USNS Impeccable.

157
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:51,740
I...don’t understand what that was supposed
to accomplish.

158
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,569
By exposing, I think Martinson meant

159
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,210
there needs to be more media coverage of these
incidents.

160
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,440
And that’s why you—

161
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,879
yes, you, my amazing viewers—

162
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,509
can help by sharing this episode with your
family and friends.

163
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,419
Let them know how the Chinese Communist Party

164
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,889
has been quietly using civilian ships

165
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,909
as a way to stir up trouble for foreign vessels.

166
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,610
And also, tell me what you think.

167
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,439
Leave your comments below.

168
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,520
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

169
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,560
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
