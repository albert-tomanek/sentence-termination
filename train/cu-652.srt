1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,560
Christians have come out in force in Hong
Kong...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,560
singing hymns...

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,030
“Sing Hallelujah to the Lord!”

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,039
and using their faith

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,630
to join millions of others, protesting an
extradition bill.

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,880
That bill that could allow Hong Kong authorities

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,180
to send people to mainland China for trial.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,320
Welcome to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,080
I'm Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,700
Joining me is Cardinal Joseph Zen.

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,970
He's going to talk a little bit about

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,640
the extradition protests in Hong Kong.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Thanks for joining me.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,290
I know you and many other religious leaders

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,320
have come out very strongly against the extradition
bill.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,220
And many Christian groups have been very active
in protesting it.

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,220
Why do you think Hong Kong's Christians

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,850
have been so motivated to join these extradition
bill protests?

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:01,640
You see, in Hong Kong the Christian religions

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,850
had very strong point in education.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:16,289
So, we Catholics, we have more than 300 schools.

22
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:22,340
That means we have 25% of the school population
in our schools.

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:30,299
We don't have university because the government
was very exclusive.

24
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:38,299
So, many people pass through our schools.

25
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,979
Many influential people in Hong Kong are Christians.

26
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,070
Even Carrie Lam is Catholic.

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,539
She is also, yeah.

28
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:51,079
Actually, she got baptized just shortly before

29
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,090
coming back from Britain.

30
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,999
So, they have influence in society.

31
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:03,939
For example, the barristers, many Catholics.

32
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:10,580
Also, in the government like Anson Chan.

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,170
He was number two in the government.

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:23,090
So, it should be natural that the Christians
have a part.

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:30,780
But, the official church in Hong Kong have
always been rather,

36
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,280
how to say, traditional.

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:44,330
That means reluctant to come out for any subject

38
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,410
which can be called political.

39
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,780
Still, some people have the prejudice that

40
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,840
we should not join the politics.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,640
Now, that's ridiculous,

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,060
because we have ecumenical council in the
'60s.

43
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,630
There, in the official document it says politics
is part of life.

44
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,680
Politics means the things which belong to
the society,

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,560
so everybody should join.

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,040
It very clearly says that.

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,470
Here, I'm really wonder why so many priests

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,860
have such a resistance to go into politics.

49
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,490
Anyway, people say, "Under the British,

50
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,270
you had such good relation with government.

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,490
Why now you always fight the government?"

52
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,520
We say, "It's not our choice.

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,880
They are fighting us,

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,069
and so we have to defend ourselves."

55
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,650
Then we have to defend the freedom of people.

56
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,000
They were very clever to promise one country
two systems.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,970
We take their words seriously,

58
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,040
but now they went back on their words.

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,620
Now the situation is terrible, terrible.

60
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,579
This time, it's more clear the participation
of the church.

61
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,400
You feel in many ways it's the duty of Hong
Kong's Christian

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
to come out and stand up.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Sure, sure.

64
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,639
We have to come out.

65
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,760
You see, we are responsible for the people,

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,409
so they must see that our teaching about human
rights,

67
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,070
we believe in those values.

68
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,560
So, I don't think we can be neutral to all
this.

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,020
Unfortunately, the organization of the six
religions

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,979
is rather conservative.

71
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:07,409
Many times they try to say some things which
are neutral, impartial.

72
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:13,509
"Oh, now there is a division in society.

73
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,710
We hope everybody can be restrained

74
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,499
and come to discuss and to revere harmony."

75
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:26,960
That's an empty invitation according to many

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,229
because this situation is a really much worse

77
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:35,900
than we can manage only with good will.

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,529
We have to fight.

79
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:42,710
This ties in very much to the situation Christians

80
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,770
are also facing in mainland China.

81
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:55,439
Now, in mainland China, there is no religious
freedom

82
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,509
because there's no freedom.

83
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,639
People cannot talk as they like.

84
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,339
There's no freedom.

85
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,930
Okay, now you say,

86
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,960
"Oh, they have solved the problem of poverty.

87
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,300
Many people now."

88
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,110
Okay, that may be true,

89
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:23,389
but you cannot just feed the people.

90
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,090
You are not running a farm.

91
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,240
You are running a society of human beings.

92
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,969
They have their conscience,

93
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,930
but they are not allowed to say anything.

94
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,759
Hong Kong Christians are concerned that

95
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,779
could happen here in Hong Kong.

96
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,470
Yes, sure.

97
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,789
I think at this moment

98
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,550
we may say it is the only thing which remains
for us

99
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,870
to be different from the cities of China.

100
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,050
With this legislation,

101
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,949
anybody can be brought to China

102
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,619
because they have only to present

103
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:06,289
some so-called prima facie evidence.

104
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,629
That means even faith evidence is enough.

105
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,400
They can force the government to hand those
people,

106
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,210
because the evidence is to be judged at their
court, not here.

107
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,210
Terrible.

108
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,999
Many say it is worse than the so-called Article
23.

109
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,009
The National Security Bill.

110
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,099
Because that is a law in Hong Kong.

111
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,460
The cases are to be judge in Hong Kong.

112
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,199
But now, according to this legislation,

113
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,689
the cases will be judged in China.

114
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,189
You cannot trust.

115
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:42,189
At this point,

116
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,479
do you think if the Hong Kong government

117
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,140
withdraws the extradition bill

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,740
that will be enough?

119
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:55,550
I think now the urgent problem is to solve

120
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,159
this issue about this extradition law.

121
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:08,789
But, I think given all what happened these
days,

122
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,669
we need much radical thinking about the actual
situation,

123
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:20,099
because it's really bad.

124
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,310
They have so much unjustice.

125
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,159
Now they are harvesting a disaster.

126
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:33,270
So, I really hope it's not only about this
law,

127
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,820
which should be withdrawn.

128
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,670
Otherwise the people will not believe in what
they say.

129
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,140
That's the minimum they can do.

130
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,720
Then the second thing they can do is have

131
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,650
an independent commission to inquire about

132
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,440
what really happened on the day 12th of June,

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,380
and to know clearly the responsibility

134
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,920
of the young people and of the police.

135
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:12,460
Then the whole thing happened because the
whole system is wrong,

136
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,800
because we are feeling so much helplessness.

137
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,750
You see, this Umbrella movement

138
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,000
or this Occupy Central movement,

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,300
we put so much effort, peaceful effort,

140
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:39,570
to demand that they do what is being promised
in the basic law.

141
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,590
To let us have a real democratic election,

142
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,590
but we are not given.

143
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,070
They are closing all the doors.

144
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,800
So, we have to go back to that.

145
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,390
Then, after that,

146
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,090
they did so many things we had just to bear.

147
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,780
They disqualify some democratically elected
legislators.

148
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,530
They bring to the court people

149
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,250
who peacefully made some demands to the government.

150
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,820
We just accept all that peacefully.

151
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,470
But, at a certain moment,

152
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,880
there's so much anger in the people.

153
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,320
We have to thank those three promoters

154
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,750
of the Occupy Central movement

155
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,240
because they preached peace,

156
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,680
nonviolence all the time.

157
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,240
I think the whole world should admire

158
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,310
how we can have a march of one million

159
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,070
and more than one million people

160
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,840
with no incident at all.

161
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,970
You see?

162
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,520
Really, they have to face their responsibility.

163
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,900
They took advantage of our peaceful nature.

164
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,510
I think in this moment,

165
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,760
we are very much worried that the young people

166
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,160
may not be able to be so patient.

167
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,290
The government is provoking them to violence.

168
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,500
The police, we don't recognize those police

169
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,140
as Hong Kong police.

170
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,140
Terrible.

171
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,630
They look like the public security in China.

172
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,370
It's incredible.

173
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,730
You've been a religious leader-

174
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,380
I am a retired bishop.

175
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,130
You see, because what we are doing

176
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,450
is according to the teaching of the church.

177
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,010
Now, the bishops,

178
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,220
they have retirement from the office,

179
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,160
but not from the duty of preaching the doctrine
of the church.

180
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,330
So, I have still the duty to preach the doctrine
of the church.

181
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,390
I think what they are trying to do is against
the human rights,

182
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,570
against teaching of the church.

183
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,520
And your religion is what motivates you to
stand up.

184
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,460
Sure, sure.

185
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,460
Yeah.

186
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,610
Actually, the human rights belong to human
beings.

187
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,960
It's not exclusive to believers.

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,010
Then, we have also a church

189
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,670
who happens to see clearly such doctrine,

190
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,040
especially the recent popes.

191
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,310
We have so many wonderful documents of the
church,

192
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,800
encyclicals, teaching about human rights.

193
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,070
As somebody who has been a religious leader
for so many years,

194
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,140
what advice would you give to people standing
up to tyranny,

195
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,320
both Christian and nonChristian alike?

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,840
Actually it is a duty for people who are so
privileged to know

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,090
very clearly this doctrine about human nature,

198
00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:00,200
about the human rights, about how the society
should be run,

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,720
what is the authority,

200
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,130
what are the duties of those in authority.

201
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,930
So, we must share our knowledge,

202
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,420
our conviction,

203
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,190
our values with the people who are less privileged.

204
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,960
Thank you so much for joining me today.

205
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,240
It's been a pleasure.
