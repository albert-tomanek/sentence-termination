00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,529
This African country now knows what it feels
like

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,340
to get owned by the Chinese Communist Party!

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,100
Hi, Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,280
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,070
Zambia is a landlocked country in southern
Africa.

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,619
And it’s poised to be the next African country
to fall prey

8
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,779
to the Chinese Communist Party’s predatory
lending practices.

9
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,519
The news service Face 2 Face Africa gets straight
to the point,

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,870
asking “Is Zambia Africa’s first casualty
in China’s takeover

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,390
after defaulting on loan repayment?”

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,370
Well technically it’s not the first—

13
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,280
don’t forget about Djibouti—

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,230
but it could very well be the next.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,940
And it’s all happening under the radar.

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,149
According to Africa Confidential,

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,840
Zambia can’t afford to pay back

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,820
its multibillion dollar loans to China,

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,539
and so there are secret talks going on

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,010
between Chinese and Zambian leaders

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,760
to hand over the country’s biggest energy
producer.

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,309
The report says,

23
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:04,750
“The state electricity company ZESCO is
already in talks

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,750
about a takeover by a Chinese company.”

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,460
ZESCO supplies electricity to about 80% of
households in Zambia.

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,760
So signing away control of a strategic national
asset is a big deal.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,320
But it doesn’t end there.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,330
The same report also revealed that Zambia
is poised

29
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,120
to hand over the Lusaka International Airport
to China.

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,150
That’s in addition to all the Zambian copper,
nickel,

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,470
and cobalt mines that are already run by Chinese
companies.

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,420
And Zambia’s state-owned TV and radio news
channel ZNBC

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,960
is already 60% Chinese-owned.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,460
Which might explain why you see lots of news
reports lately

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,680
about Zambia-China friendship...

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,900
...but not so many reports about all those
Chinese takeovers.

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,170
Of course, a Zambian government spokesperson

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,390
has gone into denial mode,

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,430
saying that “all stories relating

40
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,890
to the sale or takeover of public assets

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,340
such as ZNBC, KKIA and ZESCO by China are
false.”

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,660
But investigative reporters from Africa Confidential
say Zambia

43
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,560
is getting owned by the Chinese Communist
Party—literally.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,880
Africa Confidential also warned that the long-term
outcome

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,250
could be effective Chinese ownership of the
commanding heights

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,480
of the economy and potentially

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,940
the biggest loss of national sovereignty

48
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,070
since they gained independence in 1964.

49
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,890
Another term for this whole thing is simply
“debt trap.”

50
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,700
“More of Africa finds itself in China’s
debt.”

51
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,600
“China is saddling the partner countries
with crippling debt.”

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,700
“Saddling Africa with unsustainable debt.”

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,390
And “debt trap” has become a buzzword
that’s harder

54
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,000
to shake off than a hater in a Taylor Swift
song.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,530
Yes, my pop culture references are very current.

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,220
At the recent China-Africa summit in Beijing,

57
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,700
“A senior Chinese official denied...

58
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,400
that his country was engaging in ‘debt trap’
diplomacy.”

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,670
And even Chinese leader President Xi Jinping

60
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,310
jumped on the denial bandwagon.

61
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,240
He prefaced the announcement of 60 billion
dollars

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,720
of new funding for Africa

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,120
with the so-called ‘five nots’ of predatory
lending.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
"(China) is determined to implement the 'five
nots'—

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,540
to not interfere in countries in Africa

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,210
exploring a development path

67
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,880
which suits their own country’s situation,

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,150
to not interfere in the internal affairs of
Africa,

69
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,130
to not impose (China’s) will on Africa,

70
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,959
to not attach any political strings when offering
Africa support,

71
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,840
and to not seek political expediency

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,690
during investment and financing in Africa.”

73
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,690
Ok.

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,180
Firstly the “five nots”

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,760
is a really stupid name for a national policy.

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,319
Unless Xi Jinping means it in the elementary
school sense.

77
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,320
“The five NOTs!”

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,230
Because they’re all sarcastic.

79
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,400
And secondly, go back to that opening shot
of the China-Africa summit.

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,980
Why are most of the Africans sitting in the
back?

81
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,750
Anyway, while Africa’s demand for Chinese
cash is high,

82
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,960
not everybody’s buying into the theory of
China’s good intentions.

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,690
A specialist in Chinese Studies at Britain’s
University of Nottingham

84
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,880
says interference is an inevitable part and
parcel of the cash.

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,320
“Whenever you engage economically or financially

86
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,260
with another country you do interfere in the
political structure,

87
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,480
or the economic structure and the power structure,

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,510
so in that sense any kind of engagement

89
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,900
is a kind of disturbing the status quo.

90
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,760
But that said,

91
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,800
there will at some point be conflicts

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,110
in the Chinese-African relations.”

93
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,800
And there’s a typical formula for how these
conflicts play out:

94
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,460
The Chinese Communist Party offers loans to
needy governments.

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,470
Those governments become dependent on Chinese
money.

96
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,800
Then, when they can’t pay back the loans,

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Chinese companies take over key infrastructure.

98
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,830
That’s according to an investment advisor

99
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,400
and political analyst in Nairobi.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,320
“We cannot be naive, at this point in time.

101
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,490
We’ve seen countries take on enormous amounts
of debt.

102
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,920
We’ve seen hugely inflated infrastructure
projects,

103
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,710
many of which are white elephants before the
get go.

104
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,070
And you don’t have to look very far,

105
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,490
whether it’s Gwadar in Pakistan,

106
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,780
whether it’s Tonga,

107
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,419
whether it’s Sri Lanka, which gorged on
Chinese credit

108
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,370
and then had to disgorge their port at Hambantota.”

109
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,520
In what was pretty much a textbook definition
of a debt trap,

110
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,480
when Sri Lanka couldn’t afford its loan
payments,

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,550
it had to hand over the port of Hambantota
to China

112
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,000
on a 99-year lease.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000


114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,170
And the Chinese regime might want to eventually

115
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,580
use that port for military purposes.

116
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,600
Not to say that’s happening,

117
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,920
but...it’s probably going to happen.

118
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,860
US senators aren’t buying the story

119
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,360
of China’s good intentions, either.

120
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,730
In a letter to the US Treasury and State Department,

121
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,740
a group of senators expressed their concern

122
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,330
over bailout requests to the International
Monetary Fund

123
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,930
by countries who have accepted

124
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,290
predatory Chinese infrastructure financing.

125
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,979
They believe that China has figured out a
clever hustle

126
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,490
by saddling countries with debt they can’t
afford to repay,

127
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,880
and then getting the IMF to bail these countries
out

128
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,600
with money that comes, in large measure,

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,199
from American tax dollars.

130
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,200
They say the goal for China’s infrastructure
construction

131
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,240
and financing in other countries is “the
creation of

132
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,610
an economic world order ultimately dominated
by China”

133
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,710
and that this poses a national security threat
to the United States.

134
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,350
I should note that this letter is signed by

135
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,470
both Republican and Democratic senators,

136
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,120
proving that the threat of the Chinese regime’s
global domination

137
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,520
is something we can all be scared of.

138
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,229
In the letter, the senators ask how the US
can educate

139
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,130
our African allies about the risks of Chinese
predatory lending,

140
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,500
and how the US can provide an alternative
to the Chinese debt trap.

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,930
And while those are both good questions,

142
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,490
for countries like Zambia,

143
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,949
which has already signed off on

144
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,259
at least 8 billion dollars of project financing
from China,

145
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,590
it may be too late.

146
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,170
“Well I think in some cases it’s too late.

147
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,630
In some cases the dominos are falling.

148
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,430
In Zambia you’ve got a eurobond price at
70 cents on the dollar.

149
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,660
If you follow the markets

150
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,780
that’s telling you that basically Zambia’s
bust.

151
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,720
It’s biggest lender is China,

152
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,389
so we’re going to watch this situation now
in real time

153
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,229
unfold in front of our eyes.

154
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,650
And there are a number of situations

155
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,860
which are very very similar.”

156
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,850
So what do you think about China’s lending
practices in Africa?

157
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,139
Leave your comments below.

158
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,061
And before we go, it’s time to answer a
question

159
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:00,139
from a fan of China Uncensored who contributes
to us

160
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,800
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

161
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,570
james mckay asks:

162
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,850
“Is it possible that the CCP's Belt and
Road Initiative

163
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,009
will encourage manufacturing production to
move to countries

164
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,430
with a lower labor cost?”

165
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,990
Good question, James.

166
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,979
In a way, that’s already happening.

167
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,669
That is, cheap manufacturing is moving out
of China

168
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:22,550
to even lower-cost countries, like Bangladesh.

169
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,270
And even with some high-end products,

170
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,570
we might see it start to happen.

171
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,330
Like how—in the midst of the trade war—

172
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,870
President Trump is encouraging Apple

173
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,300
to move production to the US.

174
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Not that Apple will do something

175
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
just because Trump says so.

176
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
But moving production out of China

177
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,419
isn’t necessarily tied to the Belt and Road
Initiative.

178
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,059
It’s mainly because labor costs in China

179
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,010
are going up for other reasons,

180
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,949
and multinational companies want to make stuff

181
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,389
to where it’s cheapest.

182
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,709
China’s Belt and Road Initiative

183
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,620
doesn’t exactly aim to reduce labor costs.

184
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,459
It mainly seeks to get cheap raw materials
from poor countries,

185
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,249
then assemble those raw materials back in
China,

186
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:56,980
and then sell those finished products

187
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,329
to other Belt and Road countries.

188
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,149
That’s the goal of the Belt and Road.

189
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,709
Also to create debt traps that other countries
can fall into.

190
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,550
