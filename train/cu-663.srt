00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,080
China loves Socialism with Chinese Characteristics

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,140
But Socialism with Venezuelan Characteristics...

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,670
not so much

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,200
Trouble brews for China as Venezuela crumbles

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,740
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,760

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,880
Venezuela!

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,260
The Socialist Paradise where,

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,270
for the low low price of just 15 million bolívars,

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,860
you can buy a chicken!

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,800
Yes, that’s right.

16
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,340
Venezuela’s socialist economy

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,940
has not worked out all that well.

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,670
The economy crumbled and according to the
IMF,

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,110
inflation hit a million percent.

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,790
“The currency is so devalued,

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,540
some shopkeepers weigh the money,

22
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,820
rather than waste time counting.”

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,410
Tomatoes for five million, anyone?

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,790
Or just 3 million for a roll of toilet paper?

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,090
Needless to say,

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,770
that doesn’t make a country very stable.

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,290
And just last week,

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,290
this happened.

29
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,960
“As hundreds of thousands of protesters,

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,420
fed up with the government of Nicolas Maduro,

31
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,460
flooded the streets of Caracas, Wednesday.

32
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,899
Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido

33
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,840
declared himself the country's interim president.”

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,369
I am so jealous.

35
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,990
I’ve often tried to declare myself president,

36
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,869
and yet it has never stuck.

37
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,459
The Trump Administration was quick

38
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,340
to support this new interim president.

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,369
“Nicolas Maduro is a dictator

40
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,079
with no legitimate claim to power.

41
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,369
The National Assembly is the duly-elected

42
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:38,689
representative of the people

43
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,759
and through their constitutional system

44
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,450
and now the interim president, Juan Guaido;

45
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,179
it represents the will of the people.”

46
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,179
Needless to say,

47
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,950
that didn’t go over very well with Maduro’s
people.

48
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,479
“Because Mr. Pence doesn't have a job,

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,320
now he wants to come and run Venezuela...

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,259
I will say it like the Venezuelan people would
say it to you,

51
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,140
‘Yankee, go home.’”

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,540
Go home?

53
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,200
Mike Pence *is* home.

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,480
He lives in Washington DC.

55
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,220
Anyway, Maduro himself officially broke ties
with the US.

56
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,980
“I have decided to break diplomatic and
political relations

57
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,890
with the imperialist government of the United
States.”

58
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,200
I mean, that’s a little ridiculous.

59
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,510
It’s not like the US would ever be involved
in a coup in South America!

60
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,159
Anyway, Maduro is finding his government increasingly
isolated.

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,640
Nearly every other Latin American country

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,489
has sided with the new interim president.

63
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,459
But you know who still has Maduro’s back?

64
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,469
China.

65
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,909
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said,

66
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,920
“China supports efforts made by the Venezuelan
government

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,819
to protect the country’s sovereignty,

68
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,630
independence and stability.

69
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,230
I want to emphasize that outside sanctions

70
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,560
or interference usually make the situation
more complicated

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,109
and are not helpful to resolving the actual
problems.”

72
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:04,349
And China should know.

73
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:06,530
Because China’s outside interference

74
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,109
is part of the reason Venezuela is in this
mess.

75
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:12,500
And it goes beyond the moral support China

76
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,340
gives other socialist nations and dictatorships

77
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,190
to counter the democratic West.

78
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,200
First of all, you might be wondering—

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,109
since the protests in Venezuela have been,

80
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,299
well, pretty hot—

81
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:28,489
how has Maduro managed to stay in power this
long?

82
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,050
Well, it’s partly thanks to around $350
million dollars

83
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,340
of weapons from China and Russia.

84
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,159
And China has consistently pumped money into
Maduro’s government.

85
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,340
At the end of last year, Maduro even made
a state visit to China.

86
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,400
And somehow convinced Xi Jinping to wear a
beauty queen sash.

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,719
And Xi doesn’t do that for just any socialist
dictator.

88
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,349
Chinese premier Li Keqiang reportedly promised
that China was

89
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:00,040
“willing to provide whatever help it can
offer.”

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,730
I bet Maduro really hopes that offer is still
on the table.

91
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,909
So why would China continue to support a guy

92
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,219
who’s probably on his way down?

93
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:16,180
Well, China has invested heavily in Venezuela.

94
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,700
Venezuela was a key part of the Belt and Road
Initiative.

95
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,440
That’s the Chinese regime’s trade

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,070
and infrastructure investment strategy,

97
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,500
whereby they give a developing country infrastructure
loans

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,780
they maybe can’t pay back,

99
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,970
and when they don’t pay them back,

100
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,950
China takes over the infrastructure.

101
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,320
It’s worked great around the world.

102
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,000
Like in Sri Lanka.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,420
And Pakistan.

104
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,140
And Djibouti.

105
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
And for a while,

106
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,660
it looked like things were going great in
Venezuela as well.

107
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,470
Over the past 10 years,

108
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,860
China invested about 70 billion dollars in
Venezuela.

109
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,540
That’s about half of all China’s lending
in Latin America.

110
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,310
But there was a catch.

111
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,500
According to the Foreign Policy,

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,720
“To guarantee repayment,

113
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,960
Beijing insisted on being repaid in oil.”

114
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,670
Like how I used to collect all my debts in
pogs.

115
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,810
Which was a mistake.

116
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,010
Just like oil.

117
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,480
Because oil prices tanked in 2014.

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,990
And that caused a huge problem,

119
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,310
compounded by the fact that the socialist
government

120
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,290
relied too much on redistribution of state
oil profits,

121
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,770
instead of encouraging the people

122
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,620
to build a robust economy in other sectors.

123
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,940
Oil made up about half of Venezuela’s GDP.

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,710
So when prices collapsed,

125
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,050
not only did the country go broke,

126
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,600
but the amount of oil they had to give to
China skyrocketed.

127
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,740
And they began falling behind on their payments.

128
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,720
Of course, China has a plan for that.

129
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,030
When other countries fail to pay back their
loans to China,

130
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,340
China just takes over a port,

131
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,500
or builds a military base or something.

132
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,150
And it looked like there was a similar plan
in Venezuela.

133
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,630
Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves.

134
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,840
Last year,

135
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,900
Venezuela sold about 10% of shares in an oil
joint venture

136
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,750
to a Chinese state-owned enterprise.

137
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,630
Combined with the shares already owned by

138
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,400
China National Petroleum Corporation,

139
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,580
that meant China owned 49% of the oil venture.

140
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,250
But now it’s turning out that the brilliant
plan

141
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,810
of destabilizing a country with unpayable
debts

142
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,440
might not be a good long-term strategy.

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,940
Nearly every Latin American country, and Canada,

144
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,050
is siding with Trump’s support of the new
opposition leader,

145
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,720
Juan Guaido.

146
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,200
And what happens if Guiado does replace Maduro?

147
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,350
Would he then rethink some of those Chinese
loans?

148
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,300
That’s what happened in Malaysia

149
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,860
when the long time Prime Minister was ousted.

150
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,370
But besides potentially losing

151
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,590
all that investment money and oil,

152
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,590
there’s another big loss China would have
to swallow—

153
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,050
a loss of influence.

154
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,050
At the turn of the 21st century,

155
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,150
China had very little presence in Latin America.

156
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,270
But Venezuela helped with that.

157
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,890
Now, China’s trade with Latin America

158
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,180
is 22 times what it was back in 2000.

159
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,230
And a lot of Latin countries that used to
have

160
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,320
diplomatic relations with Taiwan,

161
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,430
now have switched to the People’s Republic
of China.

162
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,170
Of course, a change in leadership in Venezuela

163
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,580
doesn’t guarantee that they would cool ties
with the China,

164
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,350
but that’s a risk.

165
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,600
And if Venezuela has a new leader,

166
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,590
and the Chinese regime loses its foothold
there,

167
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,940
lots of things could change.

168
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,420
And that’s why it’s basically only friendly
dictatorships

169
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,660
like China, Russia, Syria, and Turkey

170
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,240
that are saying Maduro should stick around.

171
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,390
I mean, obviously Turkey is on the list.

172
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,740
After all, Maduro dined at the restaurant

173
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,330
of Turkish heartthrob chef Salt Bae.

174
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,820
Soft power has nothing on red meat power.

175
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,490
Especially when you’re the president of
a starving country.

176
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,490
“We're hungry.

177
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,490
There's hunger.

178
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,490
I stand in line all day long,

179
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,490
but I don't get anything.”

180
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,250
“I haven't bought milk for months.

181
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,020
Meat and chicken are extremely expensive,

182
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,780
if you can even find them.”

183
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,490
One’s that’s basically turned into

184
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,780
a real life version of the Purge.

185
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,060
So what do you think China will do if Maduro
is ousted?

186
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,660
And if you want to know how the situation
in Venezuela

187
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,390
relates to America,

188
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,220
head over to our sister channel America Uncovered.

189
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,420
The link to that episode is below.

190
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,560
And before we go, now is the time

191
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,310
when I answer questions from you,

192
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,450
my loyal 50-cent army—

193
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,700
fans of the show who support what we do

194
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,640
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

195
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,750
Jacky Yang asks,

196
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,720
“Do you think the CCP will try to attack
you or your crew,

197
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,670
if they found you a danger to their national
stability?”

198
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,180
A lovely thought.

199
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,860
Well, I don’t know to what extent the CCP

200
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,580
is monitoring me or the show.

201
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,860
I mean, I’m still waiting to be directly
criticized

202
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,710
by my favorite state-run media, The Global
Times.

203
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,580
But no matter how much of a thorn

204
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,770
in their side China Uncensored is,

205
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,090
there’s a limit to what the Communist Party

206
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,170
would be willing to do to an American in America.

207
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,390
However, if I decided for some insane reason

208
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,310
that I wanted to go to Mainland China,

209
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,020
things might be different.

210
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Maybe Chinese police would “discover”

211
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,890
I was actually trying to, I don’t know,

212
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,960
plan on smuggling 500 pounds of drugs,

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,930
and then I’d wind up like this Canadian.

214
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,920
So I think I’ll keep making the show here
in New York City.

215
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,480
Thanks for your question, Jacky.

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,380
If you’d like to hear your question answered
on the show,

217
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,880
sign up to support China Uncensored

218
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,890
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

219
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,390
It’s basically the price of your daily cup
of coffee.

220
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,400
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

221
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,830
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

222
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,840
see you next time!
