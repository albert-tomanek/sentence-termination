1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
The crazy eights as in the number.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,280
Eights, so it's not the crazy After Eights?

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh my God, do you know,
I really don't like those.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,200
I've discovered that after we got,
bought a load of them.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,080
-After Eights.
-After Eights, they're s***.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,760
It's taken you how many years to work out
you don't like After Eights?

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,840
I'm growing up, I am maturing and I believe
I can have my own opinions now.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,200
And one of my firmly held ones
are that After Eights are w***.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,080
But you're reaching the stage in life where you
should be getting excited by After Eights.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,080
-What are they for?
-The kids have gone to bed,

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,960
you've invited some people around
for a light brandy.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,960
And I want to eat some toothpaste
and chocolate, why?

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
Exactly. And possibly
a brandy snap with squirty cream in it.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,240
Oh!

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,000
"Combined! Standard! Extreme."

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,400
Are you selling razors over there?

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,520
Yeah.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
The new Matt Gray CSX!

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,240
"With 32 blades.
8, then 8, then 8, then 8."

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,120
"For the extreme shave."

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,280
i.e., a shaver that would be that big,
you just put it against your face,

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,840
you go, 'Uh,' and you're done.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,400
You've got no skin left.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
Or is it a ham slicer?

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,640
That's going on the cutting room floor.

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
Are you going for the Imothep from
The Mummy look and just…

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,040
"In a world with some bad things inside it."

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
"And a city with all bends in it."

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,800
I can have a new career in narrating.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
I'd do that, I'd listen to that, go on.
Go on, do Harry Potter for me.

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,640
There's audio description
and then there's the audio lack of description.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,280
Just loads of silence and
you just lean in and go,

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,160
"I don't know what he's doing,
he's on a stick or something. Magic?"

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,160
No, so the bloke with the hair
and he's driving the movingy thing,

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,080
but the movingy thing can't be driven because
it's running at... that... kind of...?

36
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,640
No, fine.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
It's close, I'll give it.

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
Schting! Cutting room floor.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,440
Phenolic acid.

40
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,760
Is it an acid?

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,720
-I'm not, I'm not…
-Can we just get a runaway train of Gaviscon

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,240
to hit it 'cos that'd...

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,600
That's what you want for your hangover.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,160
Yeah, it really is,
the runaway train that is Gaviscon.

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,480
With a proper hopper with like a hose,
"Aargh!"

46
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,800
Hand actions I shouldn't be doing on camera.

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,480
Gaviscon.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah, that's not the internationally approved
symbol for Gaviscon, there.

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,560
Wrong white liquid.

50
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,560
It's pink, isn't it?

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Moving on.

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,640
See a doctor.

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,800
So anyway, doctor...

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah, the movie had Devil's Cu…

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,720
both of you okay there?

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,600
Yeah. Stops your heartburn though.

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,360
Gets right to the insides.

58
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,720
Sorry.

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,760
It's going to take them a good 20 seconds
to recover from this.

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,920
Just so... I should point out, you see 15 minutes,
we're going for about 45 here, so...

61
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,760
It makes you wonder
what Pepto-Bismol is really, doesn't it?

62
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,600
Thought: runaway train film with all Alien on it.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,640
And just as the train goes honk, the
little mouth comes in and out.

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
No, they've just got a seven and a quarter inch
train in the front.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,200
Coming out of a landscape
that looks just like Ian Holm.

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,160
Tha's a joke that landed
for one person here.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
Welcome to the Holm Hills.

68
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Let's let them kiss,

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
and they made a baby.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
Sorry, I'm all over the place today.
