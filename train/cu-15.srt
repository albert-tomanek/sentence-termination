00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,170
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,330
if you think your job is torture,

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,360
well...just ask this guy.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,020
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,570
I'm Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,180
What do you think is the most dangerous job
in China?

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,810
Is it construction?

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,070
Tall buildings, tight deadlines, plus low
safety standards are a recipe for disaster.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,830
Or how about coal mining?

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,110
Mine collapses, gas explosions, and long-term
lung disease

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,070
kill thousands of workers every year.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,070
No?

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,770
Ok, how about...landmine removal?

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,370
I do not want to be this guy.

15
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,910
Or any of these guys.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,910
Whoa!

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,120
Well, actually, there's one job that's even
more dangerous.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,700
It's carried out by those people who are the
dregs of society,

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,660
the filth with no regard for what their poor
mothers might think:

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,580
I'm talking about lawyers.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,750
And not even those slimy corporate lawyers,

22
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,430
or those personal injury lawyers.

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,079
No, no, I'm talking about the lowest

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,540
of the low in the eyes of the Communist Party:

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,390
Chinese human rights lawyers.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,729
You see, human rights lawyers think

27
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,340
the law exists to protect the Chinese people.

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,400
That makes them like the annoying little angel

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,390
on the Chinese government's shoulder,

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,590
always going on and on about doing what's
right.

31
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,709
It's like they think they can win against
the Communist Party.

32
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,729
Wait, what's that Shelley?

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,820
Oh, apparently human rights lawyers know they
can't win?

34
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,541
That's according to what one human rights
lawyer

35
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,999
told the New York Times.

36
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:36,009
''We know we can't win.

37
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:39,349
We can't do anything to make our clients not
guilty.

38
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,409
For human rights lawyers,

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,060
our job is to meet with them,

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,060
to encourage them,

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,779
to deliver their message to the outside.

42
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,140
Only lawyers can do this.

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,579
And so I continue to defend them.''

44
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,229
So being a human rights lawyer in China

45
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,539
is kind of like climbing Mount Everest in
bike shorts.

46
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,539
It seems impossible,

47
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,009
but there's always the hope that someday,

48
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,630
it can happen.

49
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,630
You know,

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,859
after Everest collapses due to infighting
and corruption.

51
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,859
Two years ago,

52
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,170
starting on July 9, 2015,

53
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,399
the Chinese regime launched a massive crackdown

54
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,550
on China's rights lawyers.

55
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,280
More than 300 Chinese human rights lawyers
and activists

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,620
have been targeted.

57
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,860
Most were forcibly detained and questioned.

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,270
And a lot of them were tortured.

59
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,860
You may know some of their names.

60
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,860
On August 25th,

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,510
I talked about Jiang Tianyong.

62
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,720
He's a human rights lawyer who stood up

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,080
for other human rights lawyers that were tortured

64
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
by the Chinese regime.

65
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,020
And guess what?

66
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,090
He got tortured.

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,470
And then appeared on trial on state-run media,

68
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,540
saying he totally wasn't tortured,

69
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,890
and all that stuff he said about

70
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,530
other human rights lawyers being tortured--

71
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,430
that was all just lies.

72
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,980
And it's because he was brainwashed by evil

73
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,320
Western ideas like, you know, the rule of
law.

74
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
And funny enough,

75
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,640
that was the same confession

76
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,290
another human rights lawyer made back in May.

77
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,860
After also being tortured.

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,440
What a coincidence.

79
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,270
And you may also recognize one of China's

80
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,280
most famous human rights defenders,

81
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
Chen Guangcheng.

82
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,430
Despite his blindness,

83
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,670
he taught himself law,

84
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,190
and then defended poor people who

85
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,120
couldn't afford a lawyer.

86
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,730
Helping people in need?

87
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,320
Big mistake.

88
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,520
The police put him under house arrest.

89
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,000
But Chen got huge international publicity

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,420
when he evaded the Chinese police guarding
his house

91
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,710
in the middle of the night,

92
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,790
scaled a wall,

93
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,840
and fled to the US Embassy.

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Wait.

95
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,650
Is he...the real Daredevil?

96
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
But anyway,

97
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,191
today I want to talk about human rights lawyer

98
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,250
Gao Zhisheng.

99
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,650
Gao is less known in the West,

100
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,040
because unlike Chen Guangcheng,

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,320
Gao never made it onto the front page of US
magazines.

102
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,930
But Gao Zhisheng has a heck of an origin story.

103
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,980
He was born in 1964.

104
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,470
In rural China.

105
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,060
In a cave.

106
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,510
But as a boy, he never dreamed of becoming
a lawyer.

107
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,930
That's because back then,

108
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,850
China had no criminal justice system.

109
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,870
The Communist Party just had, well,

110
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,300
I guess you could call it the "Judge Dredd
System":

111
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,160
The CCP was the judge, jury, and executioner.

112
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,830
Finally, in 1979--

113
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,280
three years after Mao Zedong's death,

114
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,960
the Party had to build a criminal justice
system from scratch.

115
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,859
Because Mao had already purged all the lawyers.

116
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,209
And while I know "'Let's kill all the lawyers"

117
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,229
is a memorable line from Shakespeare,

118
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,009
let's remember it was said by a guy named

119
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,319
"Dick the Butcher."

120
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,830
A hilarious joke,

121
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,900
but maybe not the best advice for building
a civil society.

122
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,990
So the Party began encouraging people,

123
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,020
anyone really, to study law on their own.

124
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,889
And that's what Gao Zhisheng did.

125
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,350
He saw a newspaper article that China needed
lawyers.

126
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,560
At the time, he was a soldier and a loyal
Communist Party member.

127
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,740
And he decided that becoming a lawyer

128
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,569
is what he ought to do to help China.

129
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,460
He studied law on his own,

130
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,580
passed the bar exam in 1995,

131
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,289
and soon was one of the best.

132
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,289
Literally.

133
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:58,560
In 2001,

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,050
China's Ministry of Justice named Gao Zhisheng

135
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,710
one of the top ten lawyers in China.

136
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,300
Gao said it was his Christian faith that

137
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,750
drove him to work so hard to bring justice

138
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,599
to those who needed it most.

139
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,479
And, it turns out, that eventually came to
include

140
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,270
practitioners of the severely persecuted spiritual
practice,

141
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,770
Falun Gong.

142
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,449
And that's why his good standing with the
Ministry of Justice didn't last.

143
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,029
In October of 2005,

144
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,479
Gao published this open letter to China's
top leaders,

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,509
Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao.

146
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,509
It basically says,

147
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,949
I have faith that you two are good men,

148
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,150
and I hope that you'll stop the persecution
of Falun Gong.

149
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,540
And also here's like 20 specific cases

150
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,229
of practitioners being tortured,

151
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,069
in case somehow you didn't know this was a
thing.

152
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,439
I have great faith that you can stop this,

153
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,400
et cetera, et cetera.

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,879
But the only thing the CCP stopped was Gao
Zhisheng.

155
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,059
A couple weeks later,

156
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:55,470
they shut down his law practice.

157
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,529
Then Gao publicly renounced the CCP, saying,

158
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:03,490
"[I] quit the cruel, untrustworthy, inhumane,
and evil party."

159
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,009
The next year, he was arrested and convicted
of inciting subversion.

160
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,969
State-run media publicized the subversion,

161
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,419
but failed to mention that they also

162
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,659
tortured the bejesus out of him.

163
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,479
Here's what Gao Zhisheng wrote about it.

164
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,849
"We always hear how strong and stalwart

165
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,759
hero is in the face of torture,

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,970
how he refused to utter a sound,

167
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,469
but in my judgment this is utterly bogus and
impossible.

168
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:30,870
I'm sure that my screams were absolutely hair-raising

169
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,439
and audible for five or six floors in either
direction."

170
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,759
And that's when the Communist Party decided
to show off

171
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,439
a little magic trick they've been practicing.

172
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,439
To perform it,

173
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,729
All they need is a volunteer.

174
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,440
It can be anyone really,

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,009
how about, I don't know,

176
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,629
shall we sayyyyy, Gao Zhisheng.

177
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:51,740
Watch as the Communist Party takes this grown
man,

178
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,849
and makes him disappear!

179
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,180
Then reappear.

180
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
Then disappear.

181
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,669
Then reappear.

182
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,159
Then disappear again.

183
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,469
Gao's latest disappearance last month

184
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,400
is especially worrisome.

185
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,889
His health was already failing

186
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,889
over the past three years of house arrest,

187
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,949
since they wouldn't let him get medical treatment

188
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,589
after all that torture.

189
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,969
His teeth were falling out.

190
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,130
So what I want to get across here

191
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,520
is what this guy has gone through is unimaginable.

192
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,499
If I'd gone through half as much,

193
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,540
let's just say you'd probably see me making

194
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,699
a somewhat different show on China Central
Television.

195
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,080
"Hi, welcome to China's Not Censored.

196
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,169
On this episode,

197
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,710
we celebrate the heroic struggle of China's
democratic dictatorship

198
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,849
against the American imperialists and their
running dogs."

199
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,830
Gao Zhisheng on the other hand,

200
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,590
is like a living motivational poster.

201
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,439
Even though he was under constant surveillance

202
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,369
for the past three years,

203
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:52,319
somehow he managed to write this 446-page
book,

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,029
which details his experiences in detention.

205
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,840
And then he somehow gets it out of China.

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,190
And then on August 7,

207
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,330
he gave a rare interview with US-based NTD
Television.

208
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,330
"In China 1.3 billion people are under house
arrest,

209
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,330
not just me.

210
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,330
To human nature, human rights, humanity,

211
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,330
and heaven's mandate,

212
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,330
this is a prison.

213
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,330
My greatest wish is to change this evil system

214
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,650
so Chinese people can live a normal life

215
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,100
and China can go back to being a normal civilization."

216
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:20,480
My greatest wish is to change this evil sustem so Chinese people can live a nortmal life and China can go back to being a normal civilization.

217
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,520
Well, the "evil system" didn't change soon
enough,

218
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
because a few days later:

219
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Ta-dah!

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,879
He disappeared again.

221
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:28,879
So as of now,

222
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,240
we have no idea where Gao Zhisheng is right
now

223
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,130
or what's happening to him.

224
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,270
You might be thinking we should do something

225
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,710
to get Gao safely out of China.

226
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,350
Well, eight years ago,

227
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,210
after being harassed and watched for years
by the police,

228
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,310
his wife and kids fled China,

229
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,310
escaping as refugees

230
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,700
and finally making it to California.

231
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,970
But as much as Gao Zhisheng wants to see his
family again,

232
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,290
he's also said he's not ready to leave China.

233
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,400
He considers staying in China and fighting
for justice

234
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,600
his mission from God.

235
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,090
This guy is a superhero--

236
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,780
fighting a regime so evil it makes you feel
bad for lawyers.

237
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,670
And this is why being a human rights lawyer

238
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,860
is the most dangerous job in China.

239
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,000
They defend the people who are in trouble

240
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,090
for trying to stand up to the Communist Party.

241
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,580
They defend the people who are the most disliked

242
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,020
and abused by the Communist Party.

243
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,750
The fact that they get tortured for doing
their job

244
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,440
shows the world that the there is no rule
of law in China.

245
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,670
It shows that the call is coming from inside
the house--

246
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,510
Chinese people are fighting for their own
rights.

247
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not something the CCP can blame on hostile
Western forces.

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,360
Although they're trying really hard to,

249
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,390
by torturing lawyers into confessing they
were brainwashed by Western ideas.

250
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,470
This is an issue that strikes at the heart
of

251
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,070
the legitimacy of the Communist Party's rule.

252
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,000
By trying to make the system work,

253
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,260
these human rights lawyers are showing that
the system is broken.

254
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,900
And in the eyes of the Communist Party,

255
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,500
that is the ultimate crime.

256
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,160
So what can we do to help these human rights
lawyers?

257
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,420
International attention is the best way to
ensure Gao's safety.

258
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,620
So we've created this handy Where's Gao Zhisheng
poster.

259
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,180
Let's see if we can find him,

260
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,550
using the power of social media.

261
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,040
Share it with everyone you know using the
hashtag

262
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,770
Where's Gao on facebook, twitter,

263
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,500
whatever other obnoxious social media platform
you kids are using these days,

264
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,100
I don't know, snapghost?

265
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Periscope?

266
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,900
The point is, let's get ourselves an answer
to Where's Gao.

267
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,720
And you know who might be interested in knowing

268
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,470
that people out there are looking for Gao?

269
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,080
How about the twitter and facebook pages of
Chinese state-run media?

270
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,540
We'll put the links in the description below.

271
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
Have fun.

272
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,890
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

273
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,570
Once again I'm your host Chris Chappell.

See you next time.

275
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,060
You know, I could've done an episode

276
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,269
about pandas to get lots of views.

277
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,010
But I covered Gao Zhisheng instead.

278
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,110
You know why?

279
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,530
