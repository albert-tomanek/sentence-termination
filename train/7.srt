1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:03,939
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're
playing 'Citation Needed'.

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:05,900
Joining me today, he reads books y'know, it's
Chris Joel.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,640
I've... still not put it together in the right order,
I'll try for the second show.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,180
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,720
Get out o'my office!

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,500
And standing in for Matt Gray,
the Mouth from the South, Will Seaward.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,820
I have, indeed, eaten Matt.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,590
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can't see it.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,530
Every fact they get right
is a point and a ding

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,360
and there's a prize for a particularly good
answers, which is...

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,230
And today we are talking about
the Stephens Island wren.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,140
A person in the lady navy…?

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,180
This is really terrible! The lady navy(!)

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,420
The Lady Navy?

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,540
Just for those who don't have their
British naval history there... 'the lady navy'?

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,489
That was like a car at the start
of a Formula 1 race,

17
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,620
just stalling on the start line.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,280
I can't remember the acronym. I get the…

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,469
Is it just Women's Royal Navy, is that it?
There's no E.

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:05,189
The Women's Royal Naval Service, the WRNS.

21
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,180
The WRNS, there we go.

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,020
Well, that's the 1940s isn't it?

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,679
Because there's no such thing now.

24
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,130
Yes, you're absolutely right.

25
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,049
It was 1993, apparently, when it all got unified.

26
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,119
This has nothing to do with
the Stephens Island wren,

27
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,420
but as a cheap joke that started the show,
well done.

28
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Yes, well done.

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,520
Is it a bird?

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,560
S***, I should have gone for plane first,
shouldn't I?

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,980
Is it from Stephens Island?

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,040
How the frig is he getting points as easy
as that this time?!

33
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,969
He's new! Let him off.

34
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:42,160
Is there a Wikipedia article about it?

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,920
That is the point of the show.

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,660
Genus troglodytes.

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,060
Genus troglodytes? No.

38
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,069
What?

39
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,069
Not this time.

40
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,069
I am offended.

41
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,499
I'm having to look this up.

42
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,439
The common wren is troglodytes troglodytes.
So I thought if it was a wren,

43
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,079
it would probably be troglodytes something-elsesius.

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,020
Alright, what we have here is Chris Joel,
ornithologist.

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,920
When I say, "Ornith", you say, "Ologist."
Ornith!

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,540
Ologist!

47
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,080
Ornith!

48
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,760
Ologist!

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,660
No.

50
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,659
That's the first time that's ever been used
right though,

51
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,590
because usually I haven't a f***ing clue.

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,070
Well, in this case, unfortunately,
you are wrong.

53
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,110
The Eurasian wren is troglodytes troglodytes,

54
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,099
this is the Stephens Island wren,
traversia lyalli.

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,510
Does it go through French alleyways?

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,920
Le Alley?

57
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,140
Le-alley.

58
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,240
Will, you have slotted into Matt's seat
just perfectly.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,460
Well, when I ate him I stole his powers!

60
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,280
That's how it works.

61
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,209
You actually had a buzz cut didn't you,
before you went in?

62
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,000
The man was clean shaven and five foot one.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,689
The Stephens Island wren, gentlemen,
a long time ago…

64
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,180
So far we've established it's a bird on
Stephens Island that's a wren, basically, haven't we?

65
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,540
Yes. Well, its last refuge was Stephens Island.

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,180
Was it on the run for a horrific crime it
had committed?

67
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,799
Was this its last stand?

68
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,790
No, it had three other friends though and
they drove around in a black and red van

69
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,430
and if you needed their help,
you know, they'd save sparrows and s***.

70
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,680
Who would Mr T be?

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
What sort of bird?

72
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,760
Well, they wouldn't fly would they? So it'd
be like an ostrich or a penguin or something.

73
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,480
That was good. I like that.

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,099
Gary, unbelievably, you have a point.

75
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,140
No way, no.

76
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,190
F*** off. How?

77
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,640
Because the Stephens Island wren is flightless
and I'm giving you a point for that!

78
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,780
Has it learned not to fly since being
on Stephens Island, it being an island,

79
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,630
or did it get there on a raft?

80
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,010
I like the idea of learning not to fly.

81
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,420
"Oh, s***, I've flown again! I wish I could
forget this bollocks!"

82
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,980
Well, maybe it didn't like it! Maybe it didn't
like heights.

83
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,459
Yes, that's not forgetting is it? That's proactively…

84
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,420
Is there a difference though? Between actively
forgetting and unlearning?

85
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,640
"Welcome to epistemology today..."

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,540
"Today, bird dat don't fly.
He forget or did he learn it?"

87
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,859
It's also known as Lyall's wren. Why would
its last refuge be Stephens Island?

88
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,700
Is it... extinct?

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,680
Spot on.

90
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,160
Okay. Was it delicious?

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,640
Damn it! That much faster.

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,099
Yes, but not that… I mean this is a wren…

93
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,280
Yes, but no.

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,069
It was, apparently, delicious.

95
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,520
There have only ever been five species of
flightless songbirds found.

96
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,740
What's happened to them?

97
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,200
They've all been eaten.

98
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,020
For the Stephens Island wren in particular
by what?

99
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,900
Was it eaten by pests that were introduced
by humans?

100
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,240
Yes, absolutely right. Any particular pests?

101
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,220
Rats.

102
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,280
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bill Oddie!

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,240
"Bring me another plate of wrens!
Conserve them that I may consume them…"

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,930
Because that's what Bill Oddie sounds like
behind the scenes...

105
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,479
We're in trouble when the audience
have better gags than we have.

106
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,590
As Bill Oddie sits in the ruined wasteland
of the island

107
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,460
seeing the last little wren entering his lips,

108
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,860
he goes, "I really should have saved these."

109
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Yes!

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,060
"You didn't see nothin'!"

111
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,520
Not rats.

112
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,320
Cats!

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,340
Yes, cats is technically correct. Could we
be a bit more specific?

114
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,180
Panthers?...

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,120
Will, I've just got this thing of being in
like a hotel room,

116
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,900
in a lonely kind of guest house and suddenly
from inside the cupboard,

117
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
hearing you saying that.

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,120
And it would be the most terrifying thing
I could imagine.

119
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,360
"Panthers?"

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,600
A single cat from one ship's crew.

121
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,860
Absolutely right. A lighthouse keeper's cat
named Tibbles.

122
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,580
Yes, allegedly, a lighthouse keeper's cat
named Tibbles

123
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,300
and for a while that was the accepted wisdom,
what is more likely?

124
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,240
More than one cat...!

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
"Panthers?"

126
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,500
Chris is closest, Chris gets a point, yes.

127
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,640
Yes, a large number of feral cats had come
to overrun the island.

128
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,069
How many living wrens were actually spotted,
ever?

129
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,229
None. They're not spotted at all,

130
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,780
they've got sort of
vertical striations or stripes.

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
Go on, just hit me.

132
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,980
It's not that, it's you're kind of right.

133
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Yes!

134
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,580
Olive brown plumage with edges of brown.

135
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,930
So I'll actually give you the stripes there.

136
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,250
How often were they seen by humans?

137
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,940
Seconds after the entered the cat's mouth,
probably, or when the cat brought…

138
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,120
Yes, there was loads left in a pile on the
door mat.

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,539
The cat's saying, "I'm friends with you",
by leaving dead bodies outside.

140
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,480
And when I do it, it's wrong.

141
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,360
Never. They were so small, they were essentially
invisible.

142
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,160
I mean, I like it, but...

143
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,040
What you've got there, mate, are bees.

144
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,320
Bees, birds, and the next part of the talk
is where it gets distressing.

145
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,840
Only twice. The lighthouse keeper called it
almost nocturnal,

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,020
'Running around the rocks like a mouse.'

147
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,539
Yeah, well, you would if you were being chased
by a frigging cat!

148
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,400
Yes, that was the problem.

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,680
Then the cats ate the lighthouse keepers,

150
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,660
then the cats took over the lighthouse and
turned off the light,

151
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,360
many ships were wrecked.

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
And eaten!

153
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
Those crews, also, were devoured.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,860
I mean you've got a good ghost story there.

155
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,760
It's complete bollocks, but you've got a great
ghost story there.

156
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,740
It was once widespread throughout the area.

157
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,260
What area is Stephens Island in? Where are
we going to…?

158
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
The sea!

159
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,220
I mean, technically, I'ma give you a point
for that.

160
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,880
Which part of the world…? This is 1870s…

161
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,920
New England.

162
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,840
No.

163
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,300
Nova Scotia?

164
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,780
I mean, you...

165
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,800
Can you make anything not sound kinky?

166
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,840
You've said, "New." You've said, "Nova."
New is correct.

167
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:39,849
Zealand.

168
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:41,580
Yes, there we go, have a point.

169
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,900
Prehistorically, it was all through New Zealand,

170
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,240
then the land was settled.
Its bones can be found where?

171
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,979
Cat poo.

172
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,511
Yes, that's true, half of that's right...

173
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,849
I love the way you lead me on like a primary
school teacher with the thick student,

174
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:01,699
"You're right. Are there any other answers
in the class?"

175
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,909
Deposits left by laughing owls.

176
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,439
Wonderful!

177
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,800
Was that an impression or a reaction?

178
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,820
It's the thought of this darkly humoured owl
in a tree,

179
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,660
watching all these wrens getting eaten and
going, "Ha-ha, losers!"

180
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,140
What happened to the laughing owl?

181
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,100
Did they get eaten next?

182
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes, they did.

183
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,000
Not laughing now, are we?

184
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:29,169
I was actually going to move on to other extinct
birds of New Zealand.

185
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,169
Well, there's the Moa,

186
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,330
there's that really fecking big eagle that's
the biggest one that ever lived,

187
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,240
starts with a H.

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,770
Augh, can't remember.

189
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,740
"New Zealand fecking big eagle".

190
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,830
Big feck-off... come on, come on.

191
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,020
Haast's eagle.

192
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,160
Yes!

193
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,120
The wonders of technology.

194
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,550
That's a terrifying thought that technology
might be optimised to how I think.

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,820
The rest of you are screwed.

196
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,380
Talking about introducing pests.

197
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,500
Hello.

198
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,520
There have been many, many attempts to deal
with pests,

199
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,330
particularly Australia and New Zealand.

200
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,210
They're not pests, they're legitimate countries.

201
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,580
We had words about this before.

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Yes, what can you tell me about
the rabbit-proof fence?

203
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
It wasn't rabbit-proof!

204
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,820
Because they went under it.

205
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,730
Yes. It turns out that building a fence was
not a great way to stop rabbits.

206
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,900
Did they get in... in the hats of magicians?

207
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,720
Tries to pull out flags of all nations.
Just loads of rabbits tied together.

208
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,460
With the flags of all nations to be fair.

209
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,500
It's actually the rabbits of all nations.

210
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,180
Heavily tattooed.

211
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,830
Yes. What can you tell me about
the Cobra Effect?

212
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,720
And the phrasing here is,

213
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,730
'It illustrates the causes of incorrect stimulation
in the economy.'

214
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,920
Eh, kids?

215
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,320
Is it to do with sales of Viagra?

216
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,120
They introduce cobras,
but they're all dead-straight now.

217
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,420
Flinging them like javelins. Come on!

218
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,200
How you do it is your own business.

219
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,000
Where might this have been?

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
India?

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,440
Yes, despite the phrasing,
you are absolutely right.

222
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,920
This was British Colonial India and they were
concerned about venomous snakes, cobras.

223
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,820
What did they try to do to solve
the snake problem?

224
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,660
Did they bribe them?

225
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,780
Yes, set up an elaborate passport service

226
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,370
that meant they couldn't move
from place to place.

227
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,390
You know, that thing where, "Oh, he's got it.
He's got it. He's got it. No."

228
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,290
To be fair, "he's got it" was "did they".

229
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,300
And then "he's not" was... bribe?!

230
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,530
Did they bribe the snake charmers?

231
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,900
People to catch them.

232
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,180
And then they wouldn't get rid of them all,

233
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,970
because if they got rid of them all, they
wouldn't have an income

234
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,440
so they bred snakes to make sure
they still had a…

235
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Amazing!

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,200
I know that because that was a common thing,
16th-17th century.

237
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,080
You have accounts of what they do in parishes

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,370
and they have similar problems with beavers.

239
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,240
You would bring the tails to show that you
caught the pests that you had.

240
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,960
You also had beadles
that would get rid of dogs,

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,260
things like that out of churches.

242
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,020
But there were rumours that they would be,
potentially, breeding animals

243
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,380
to make sure that they were still getting
paid for this little bit of income.

244
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,690
So it was a similar thing.

245
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,990
Yes. They offered a bounty for every
dead cobra, which worked.

246
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,570
Then people started breeding cobras, so they
scrapped the bounty programme.

247
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,670
What happened?

248
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,670
Lots of snakes.

249
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,080
I mean, yes, everyone released the cobras,

250
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,510
because they were now worthless, so they just...

251
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,130
Yes. When they did it, did they use the…

252
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,570
Actually, this needs your voice to say this
doesn't it?

253
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,580
Yes, "Release the cobras," surely?

254
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,360
"Release the cobras."

255
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,560
That is good.

256
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,460
Good lord, I'm involuntarily
picking my feet up off the floor here.

257
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,100
"Panthers?"

258
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,820
No, that's clearly a Disney panther though,

259
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,380
that is going to be smoking a pipe and asking
insightful questions,

260
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,400
a panther introduced in that tone.

261
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,870
I can never go to the cinema...!

262
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,800
That's different reasons though, to do with
chucking the cobras.

263
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,380
I'm just going to go, "Panthers?"

264
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,510
So to drag this back, to drag this back,

265
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,590
a long, long way to the Stephens Island wren.

266
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,300
Oh, Jesus, yes.

267
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,440
Oh, Christ.

268
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,950
There were some fights over the specimens,
because…

269
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,040
Between the cats, obviously,
'cos they were hungry.

270
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,840
The thing is you're actually right,

271
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,240
because almost all the specimens now extant
were brought in by cats.

272
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,350
Oh, as presents?

273
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,610
As presents for the lighthouse keeper,
you're absolutely right.

274
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,490
Although, they're not presents.
They're sort of a mark of pity.

275
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,650
Yes, it's that kind of,
"Look, that's how you do it", isn't it?

276
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,270
It's the kind of thing they're showing you.

277
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,940
It's like when they s*** on the floor, it's
to show they're angry.

278
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,750
It's true. That's what happened when you came
to my house.

279
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,270
What? You s*** on the floor
because you were angry he was there...?

280
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,270
"Out, Scott!"

281
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,640
Do you remember?
He once stayed over at my house.

282
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,340
I did. God, that was before
your stag-do wasn't it?

283
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,020
Yeah. You stayed over at my house and I just
heard this immortal phrase,

284
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,060
"Gary? The cat's s*** on the floor."

285
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,640
I have no memory of this at all.

286
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,140
That happened. It's the only time she's ever
done it with another person in the house.

287
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,290
Normally, we get it after a weekend away or
something,

288
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,630
a day or so later she'll just go and lay one
on the floor to say,

289
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,040
"Damn it, you've been away and this is how
angry I am,

290
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,270
"I'm going to let you see this."

291
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,520
So for some reason,
she took with umbrage with you

292
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,270
to that degree that she did a massive dump
in protest.

293
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,780
And when I do it, it's wrong.

294
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,940
On the other hand, I know exactly how my resignation
from the show is going to go,

295
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,730
should it ever happen.

296
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,680
So, yes, what happened to most of the specimens?
Where did they end up?

297
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Museums!

298
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,460
Yes, absolutely right. What happened to most
of the cats?

299
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,860
Mew-seums.

300
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,160
Shot, sadly. But there was a…

301
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,820
Oh, I like this one when it ends on dead cats.
It's always good fun isn't it?

302
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,800
And that's the end of the show!

303
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,670
It's not ending on that.
There was a recommendation sent out.

304
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,350
What should lighthouse keepers not do?

305
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,850
Have cats to shoot in the first place!

306
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,990
Yes. It was recommend that
they not introduce pests.

307
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,720
So the last question, who was Lyall?

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,480
Who were they named after?
Lyall's wren, Traversia lyalli?

309
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,440
Was he the lighthouse keeper?

310
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,700
Yes, he was!

311
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,000
Hooray!

312
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,380
So at the end of the show, congratulations,
Chris, you win this one.

313
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,200
You win a stuffed toy inspired by the villain
from 'Nightmare on Elm Street'.

314
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,600
It's a Teddy Krueger.

315
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,610
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel,

316
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
to Gary Brannan,

317
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,300
to Will Seaward.

318
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,380
I've been Tom Scott
and we'll see you next time.

319
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,720
Can I really go this time?

320
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,320
Yes!
