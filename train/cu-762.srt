1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,830
America has called Taiwan its unsinkable aircraft
carrier.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,820
But there's one thing the US better not call
it a country!

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,700
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,420
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,530
The One China policy.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,000
If you're not familiar with it,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,750
the One China policy is an agreement

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,380
between China and Taiwan.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,750
The policy says that the People's Republic
of China

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,570
and the Republic of China both agree

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,269
that there's only one country called China.

13
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:36,559
Oh, and they both claim they're the legitimate
government

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,219
of the whole thing.

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,820
Which is weird, when you think about it--

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,559
since both regions have independent governments,

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,679
laws, militaries and so on, the way that you
know,

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,729
two separate countries do.

19
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,420
The One China Policy also means that other
countries

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,260
are only allowed to have diplomatic relations
with one of them.

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,819
They might as well call it the "Highlander
Policy"--

22
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:01,069
"there can be only one, China."

23
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:02,389
It's like a bunch of people agreeing

24
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:05,330
not to see the elephant sitting in the middle
of the room.

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,610
And anyone who tries to say otherwise well--

26
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,230
that's a third-rail issue for Beijing.

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,360
But now, Taiwan's new Premier, William Lai,

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,890
has stepped on that third rail and electrocuted,
uh,

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,100
China by saying,

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,360
"What are you stupid,

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,710
of course Taiwan is an independent country!"

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,560
That was a loose translation.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,630
But as you can imagine,

34
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,350
the Chinese Communist Party was not happy.

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,560
The CCP has in the past promised military
action

36
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,480
if Taiwan ever does declare independence.

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,960
Well, not to worry, Premier Lai

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,030
did not declare independence.

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,590
He merely said Taiwan,

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,890
"already was an independent country

41
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,909
called the Republic of China and so

42
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,780
had no need to declare independence."

43
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,480
Yeah, I'm not letting an elephant into the
room!

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,460
I'm just pointing out that there's already
an elephant in the room,

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,380
and it's been here the whole time.

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,800
How did you not notice this?

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,770
Premier Lai's comments came after the CCP

48
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,870
said on Wednesday that Taiwan would

49
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:06,080
"reap the consequences" of promoting formal
independence.

50
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,241
Fortunately, Premier Lai

51
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,840
just pointed out objective reality,

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,719
without specifically promoting reality.

53
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,599
And Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council added,

54
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,030
"Taiwan's future and the development of relations

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,489
across the Strait will be jointly decided

56
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,720
by Taiwan's 23 million people."

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,989
In other words,

58
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,900
Taiwan's government wants Taiwan's fate

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,480
to be decided by the people of Taiwan,

60
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,260
and not the Communist Party in Beijing.

61
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,609
Now this may blow the minds of patriotic Chinese
nationals

62
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,840
everywhere who freak out when anyone even
suggests

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,069
that Taiwan might not be anything other than

64
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,029
a breakaway province of the People's Republic
of China

65
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:47,019
that's totally been a part of it all along.

66
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:49,889
We've reported before about how professors
and universities

67
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:51,989
face pressure for hurting the feelings

68
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,180
of the Chinese people whenever sensitive topics
are mentioned.

69
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,230
Well, just listen to this interaction between

70
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,540
a Chinese student and an Indian lecturer in
Australia.

71
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,849
Why you always keep saying that?

72
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:05,989
Saying what?

73
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,130
Saying Taiwan.

74
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,420
In this class you said it twice as a country.

75
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,950
That's because from where I am standing,

76
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,760
Taiwan is a separate country.

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,090
Relations between Taiwan and China

78
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,900
have been strained ever since Taiwan's 2016

79
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,049
election of President Tsai Ing-wen.

80
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,910
She came from the Democratic Progressive Party

81
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,410
that believes that Taiwan is already an independent
country.

82
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,700
And in her acceptance speech, oops!

83
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,470
She failed to acknowledge the One China principle.

84
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,519
China suspended direct diplomatic contact
with Taiwan

85
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,200
soon after that and drove a wedge between
Taiwan

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,170
and countries around the world.

87
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,170
Like Panama.

88
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,480
Known for its hats.

89
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,499
And canal.

90
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:43,519
Most recently,

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,739
a Taiwanese citizen was arrested and detained

92
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,840
for more than 170 days in mainland China,

93
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,319
then appeared on state-run media

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,840
for a forced television confession.

95
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,189
"I spread malicious attacks

96
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,650
that defamed the Chinese Communist Party

97
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,109
and China's government

98
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,400
and China's current political system,

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,749
and I incited subversion of state power."

100
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,379
Good old vague subversion of state power.

101
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,730
They can arrest anyone for it.

102
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,629
So, the objective reality may be that

103
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,639
Taiwan is functionally an independent country.

104
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,840
But the true test of Taiwan's status as a
country

105
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,420
will come when other countries,

106
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,730
like the United States,

107
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,510
start calling the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office

108
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,230
what it really is,

109
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,200
the Taiwan Embassy

110
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,110
And start calling Taiwan a country.

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,750
Do you see the elephant now?

112
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,140
What do you think of Taiwan's call of,

113
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,570
we've always been independent?

114
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,750
Leave your comments below.

115
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,040
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

116
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,700
Once again I'm your host Chris Chappell.

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,960
See you next time.

118
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,240
You know if Taiwan is a country,

119
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,690
does this mean Mainland China is the breakaway
province?

120
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh who knows.

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,910
But what I do know,

122
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,730
is that if you went to ChinaUncensored.tv,

123
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,560
