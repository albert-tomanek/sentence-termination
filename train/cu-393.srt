00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,790
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,180
It’s a baby!

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,859
Or possibly a super baby.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,850
Or, really, no one knows.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,760
Hi,

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,560
welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,250
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,280
In our top story,

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,260
a Chinese scientist may have created

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,400
the world’s first genetically engineered
babies.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,320
“A Chinese researcher claims to have helped
make

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,630
the world's first gene edited babies.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,449
Twin girls whose DNA he says he altered

14
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,790
with a powerful new tool that lets scientists
edit the genetic code.

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,680
I feel a strong responsibility that it's not
just to make a first,

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,690
but also make it an example.”

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,050
Well, China is great at using people to make
an example.

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,590
He Jiankui says he edited the DNA of the twin
girls

19
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,390
to make them immune to HIV.

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:58,379
“He says he edited embryos for 7 couples
in IBF fertility treatment.

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,030
So far there's been one pregnancy.

22
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,360
The gene editing was done using a tool called

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,359
CRISPR-Cas9.

24
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,409
It works by making a cut in the DNA to disable
a specific gene.”

25
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,869
Now his claim has not been independently verified,

26
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,430
so we don’t know for a fact Dr. He did what
he says he did.

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,770
But even so, it’s created a huge controversy.

28
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,189
Gene editing is banned in many countries.

29
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,189
Guess what?

30
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,529
Not in China.

31
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:26,960
The reasons most countries ban it are:

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
One,

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,659
this is a totally new frontier

34
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,399
so no one knows if other genes might be accidentally
affected.

35
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,399
And two,

36
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,950
if the girls survive to adulthood and have
kids,

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,450
it will have changed the human genepool,

38
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,219
affecting future generations.

39
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,530
But Chinese authorities have always been

40
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,649
a little less strict about the rules.

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,380
At least about safety rules.

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,140
Political rules are very strict.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,610
But the Chinese Communist Party has managed

44
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,700
to draw scientists from around the world

45
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,729
with promises of big state-backed dollars,

46
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,929
and none of those pesky ethical restrictions.

47
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,939
Which is how you have scientists in China

48
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,499
experimenting with things like...

49
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,639
head transplants!

50
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,490
It’s a no brainer, really.

51
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,550
But in this case of editing the genes of human
embryos,

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,790
the international backlash has been intense.

53
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,070
“More than 100 scientists said in an open
letter

54
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,620
the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,230
to edit the genes of human embryos was

56
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,820
risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation
and development

57
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,710
of the biomedical community in China.”

58
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,260
The backlash has been so intense,

59
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,540
that even official Chinese state agencies
are getting involved.

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,160
“China’s National Health Commission late
on Monday

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,740
ordered officials to ‘seriously investigate
and verify’ He’s claims.

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,000
Shenzhen’s Health and Family Planning commission

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,020
said it was investigating the ethics committee

64
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,870
and review process of He’s work.”

65
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,100
Also, we don’t even know for sure if the
girls are immune to HIV.

66
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,620
This is what happens when science is conducted
in a black box.

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,860
No one knows what's real.

68
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,250
Even the school where He worked

69
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,610
Southern University of Science and Technology

70
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,190
is trying to create some distance from him.

71
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,630
“This research work was carried out by Professor
He Jiankui

72
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,850
outside of the school,” the school said,

73
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,960
calling it a “serious violation of academic
ethics and norms”.

74
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,260
But when has unconstrained scientific experimentation

75
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,710
ever led to anything bad happening?

76
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,470
Though what the Chinese Communist Party giveth,

77
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,110
it can also taketh away.

78
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,330
So what do you think about the possibility
that

79
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,620
China is genetically engineering human babies?

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,680
Leave your comments below.

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
And before you go, now is the time when

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,090
I answer a question from a fan

83
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,900
who supports China Uncensored with a dollar
or more per episode

84
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,250
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

85
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,740
Joseph Bergeron asks,

86
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,680
“Why doesn't the P.R.C. put pressure on
Mongolia to reunify with China,

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,350
as historically both Taiwan and Mongolia (and
other lands)

88
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,700
were a part of the Qing Dynasty's unified
territory?

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,880
Is it because they aren't culturally Chinese,

90
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,020
because they want a buffer state with Russia,

91
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,080
or some other reason?”

92
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Interesting question.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
It has to do with the Soviet Union.

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,600
Near the tail end of World War II in 1945,

95
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,700
at what was called the Yalta Conference,

96
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,830
the US wanted the Soviet Union to join the
war against the Japanese.

97
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,960
One of the conditions was

98
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,280
that the area we now know as Outer Mongolia
would be independent.

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,979
Well, not so much independent as a Soviet
satellite state.

100
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,000
Now remember, at the time,

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,669
China was ruled by the Republic of China government,

102
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,900
which was also a US ally.

103
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,169
And since they were too weak at the time to
challenge the Soviets,

104
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,300
they agreed to it if the Soviet Union agreed
not to support

105
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,120
the Communists inside China.

106
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,499
A few years later, the Communists took over
China anyway,

107
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:41,960
and formed the People’s Republic of China.

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,000
They weren’t able to challenge the Soviets
either.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,270
“As late as 1989 then-Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,419
was still complaining to the Americans that
Stalin had

111
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,889
‘severed’ Mongolia from China.”

112
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:54,520
And when the Soviet Union fell,

113
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,419
Outer Mongolia truly became independent.

114
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,680
But maybe someday,

115
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,069
the Chinese Communist Party will try to give
Mongolia

116
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,050
a taste of some of that win-win cooperation.

117
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,310
Thanks for your question, Joseph.

118
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,310
