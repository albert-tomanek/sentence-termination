1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,549
china is threatening war over taiwan but a
recent donation of u.s coveted vaccines makes

2
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,149
that seem a little less likely

3
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:33,250
welcome to china uncensored i'm chris chappell
well it's something that doesn't happen every

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:40,050
day a bipartisan group of u.s senators took
a military aircraft to visit taiwan the three

5
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:57,289
senators arrived on a u.s air force c-17 not

6
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:02,609
plane available of transporting troops and
cargo cargo like artillery battle tanks and

7
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,159
helicopters taiwanese media reported that
it was the first c-17 visit since at least

8
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,299
1995.

9
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,640
meanwhile my favorite chinese state-run media
global times said it was the most serious

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,960
provocation since u.s president joe biden
took office which of course is just a fancy

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,340
way of saying that it angered china the arrival
of three u.s senators in taiwan bearing covet

12
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,930
vaccines is part of the u.s playing catch-up
at vaccine diplomacy the chinese communist

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,930
party has been selling its coveted vaccines
around the world selling not donating and

14
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,770
those vaccines come with many strings attached
those strings include being politically obedient

15
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,100
to the chinese regime which is why even though
taiwan is struggling with a covet 19 surge

16
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,200
it's still refusing chinese vaccines and with
good reason china is trying to use coveted

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,979
vaccines for political leverage in taiwan
china cut off taiwan's access to germany's

18
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:09,810
bioentech shots and when japan donated 1.2
million vaccines to taiwan china said japan

19
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,670
was using the vaccines as a tool of political
self-interest the party loves to accuse others

20
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,821
of doing what it does i'd say it's a guilty
conscience but i don't think the communist

21
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:27,780
party feels guilt but the binding administration
is now making a push to donate covet vaccines

22
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:35,620
to the world donate not sell unlike china
and one u.s official said u.s vaccines don't

23
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,390
come with strings attached senator tammy duckworth
one of the senators who visited taiwan said

24
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,060
taiwan is getting first dibs it was critical
to the united states that taiwan be included

25
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,230
in the first group to receive vaccines because
we recognize your urgent need and we value

26
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,690
this partnership the chinese communist party
hates when the u.s recognizes taiwan like

27
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,849
this but china's response to this visit has
been surprising and it has many chinese citizens

28
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:07,030
infuriated i'll tell you more after the break

29
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:16,629
welcome back so as you can imagine the chinese
communist party is not happy about u.s senators

30
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,620
visiting taiwan in a military aircraft chinese
jets have been making daily incursions in

31
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,439
taiwan airspace for months china considers
taiwan part of its territory and my favorite

32
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,970
chinese state-run media the global times calls
this latest move by the u.s and taiwan salami

33
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,940
slicing tactics they're accusing the u.s and
taiwan of using small actions to get closer

34
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,330
diplomatically slice by slice and the communist
party knows about salami slicing since they're

35
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:52,319
using it to take over more territory in the
south china sea and on the indian border the

36
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,129
communist party also doesn't get irony so
as this global times editorial asks how should

37
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:07,069
the mainland respond turns out by doing nothing
nada zip state media including the official

38
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,510
xinhua news agency didn't report on the trip
while the chinese foreign ministry sidestepped

39
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,290
a question about the plane but later foreign
ministry spokesman wang wan bin broke out

40
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,410
his inner wolf warrior with this incendiary
rhetoric the u.s should avoid sending any

41
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,070
wrong signal to taiwan independence separatists
and causing further damage to china-u.s relations

42
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,460
and peace and stability across the taiwan
strait these are the same people who have

43
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,500
been threatening to invade taiwan for years
right in 2005 china passed a law saying it

44
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,030
had the right to use non-peaceful and other
necessary means to prevent taiwan from formally

45
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,050
declaring independence chinese state remedia
have threatened war if u.s military aircraft

46
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,780
go to taiwan they said that would be crossing
china's red line it threatened to destroy

47
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:07,160
the taiwanese airport the u.s aircraft and
start a war well i don't see a war starting

48
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,530
could it be the chinese communist party was
just bluffing that it's all bluster a bully

49
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:21,000
who backs down at the first sign of pressure
i'm shocked as were many of china's nationalistic

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,180
youth was all that talk of a red line in war
just that talk one popular huevo comment china's

51
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,220
version of twitter said our red line is no
red line if this is the case how can foreigners

52
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,190
treat taiwan as part of china another online
commentary said this is a salami-slicing move

53
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,900
that is continuously pressing your red line
maybe china's wolf warrior is just a sheep

54
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,850
in wolf's clothing and now it's time for me
to answer a question from a member of the

55
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,770
china uncensored 50 cent army fans who support
us and our efforts to expose the truth about

56
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,340
the chinese communist party by contributing
through the crowdfunding website patreon bananapancakes

57
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,710
asks so is she going to go handmaid's tale
to solve china's population problem this was

58
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,650
in response to my recent episode about china's
new three child policy after decades of the

59
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,400
one child policy and then the brief to child
policy the communist party is now allowing

60
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,410
chinese people to have three children that's
after it became clear all those forced abortions

61
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,220
and sterilizations have caused a population
crisis except as i mentioned in that episode

62
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,400
chinese people don't really want more kids
in fact many want no kids intense workplace

63
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,300
competition inadequate child care and widespread
job discrimination against pregnant women

64
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,120
have made childbearing an unappealing prospect
for many so will the chinese communist party

65
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,470
resort to handmaid's tale tactics in the sense
of how a small group of elite men suppress

66
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,940
the population forcing the lower class to
work in dirty dangerous conditions it's already

67
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:10,160
doing that but will it start forcing women
to have children well considering under china's

68
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,710
family planning policy women had their menstrual
cycles recorded on blackboards for all to

69
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,840
see i don't think the communist party has
an ethical problem with getting right up in

70
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,880
people's personal business in fact they don't
see it as your personal business they see

71
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,250
it as the state's business so i really wouldn't
be surprised if one day the three child policy

72
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,883
goes from a recommendation to a requirement
in fact i talked about hoChina is threatening

73
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:37,883
war over Taiwan

74
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:38,883
But a recent donation of US Covid Vaccines

75
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:39,883
makes that seem a little less likely

76
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:40,883
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

77
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:41,883
Well, it’s something that doesn’t happen
every day.

78
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:42,883
A bipartisan group of US senators took a military
aircraft to visit Taiwan.

79
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:43,883
The three Senators arrived on a US Air Force
C-17 freight plane.

80
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:44,883
They came to Taiwan to announce a donation
of 750,000 US-made Covid vaccines.

81
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:45,883
But the real message was delivered to China,
in the form of a US military transport plane

82
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:46,883
capable of transporting troops and cargo.

83
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,883
Cargo like artillery, battle tanks and helicopters.

84
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:48,883
“Taiwanese media reported that it was the
first C-17 visit since at least 1995.”

85
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:49,883
Meanwhile, my favorite Chinese state-run media,
the Global Times said it was “the most serious

86
00:07:49,883 --> 00:07:50,883
provocation...since US President Joe Biden
took office.”

87
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:51,883
Which of course is just a fancy way of saying
that it angered China.

88
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:52,883
The arrival of three US Senators in Taiwan
bearing Covid vaccines is part of the US playing

89
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:53,883
catch-up at Vaccine Diplomacy.

90
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:54,883
The Chinese Communist Party has been selling
its Covid vaccines around the world.

91
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:55,883
Selling, not donating.

92
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:56,883
And those vaccines come with many strings
attached.

93
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:57,883
Those strings include being politically obedient
to the Chinese regime.

94
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:58,883
Which is why, even though Taiwan is struggling
with a COVID-19 surge, it's still refusing

95
00:07:58,883 --> 00:07:59,883
Chinese vaccines.

96
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:00,883
And with good reason.

97
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:01,883
China is trying to use Covid vaccines for
political leverage in Taiwan.

98
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:02,883
China cut off Taiwan’s access to Germany’s
BioNTech shots.

99
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:03,883
And when Japan donated 1.2 million vaccines
to Taiwan,

100
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,883
China said Japan was using the vaccines as
“a tool of political self-interest”.

101
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:05,883
The Party loves to accuse others of doing
what it does.

102
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:06,883
I’d say it’s a guilty conscience, but
I don’t think the Chinese Communist Party

103
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:07,883
feels guilt.

104
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:08,883
But the Biden Administration is now making
a push to donate Covid vaccines to the world.

105
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:09,883
Donate.

106
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:10,883
Not sell.

107
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:11,883
Unlike China.

108
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:12,883
And one US official said US vaccines “don’t
come with strings attached.”

109
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:13,883
Senator Tammy Duckworth , one of the Senators
who visited Taiwan, said Taiwan is getting

110
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:14,883
first dibs.

111
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:15,883
“It was critical to the United States that
Taiwan be included in the first group to receive

112
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:16,883
vaccines because we recognize your urgent
need and we value this partnership.”

113
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:17,883
The Chinese Communist Party hates when the
US recognizes Taiwan like this.

114
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:18,883
But China’s response to this visit has been
surprising.

115
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:19,883
And it has many Chinese citizens infuriated.

116
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:20,883
I’ll tell you more after the break.

117
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:21,883
Welcome back.

118
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:22,883
So as you can imagine, the Chinese Communist
Party is not happy about US Senators visiting

119
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:23,883
Taiwan in a military aircraft.

120
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:24,883
Chinese jets have been making daily incursions
in Taiwan airspace for months.

121
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:25,883
China considers Taiwan part of its territory.

122
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:26,883
And my favorite Chinese state-run media, the
Global Times, calls this latest move by the

123
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:27,883
US and Taiwan “salami-slicing tactics.”

124
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:28,883
They’re accusing the US and Taiwan of using
small actions to get closer diplomatically,

125
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,883
slice by slice.

126
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:30,883
And the Communist Party knows about salami
slicing—since they’re using it to take

127
00:08:30,883 --> 00:08:31,883
over more territory in the South China Sea.

128
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:32,883
And on the Indian border.

129
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:33,883
The Communist Party also doesn’t get irony.

130
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:34,883
So as this Global Times editorial asks, how
should the Mainland respond?

131
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:35,883
Turns out, by doing nothing.

132
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:36,883
Nada.

133
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,883
Zip.

134
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:38,883
“State media including the official Xinhua
News Agency didn’t report on the trip while

135
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:39,883
the Chinese Foreign Ministry sidestepped a
question about the plane.”

136
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:40,883
But later, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang
Wenbin broke out his inner wolf warrior with

137
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:41,883
this incendiary rhetoric.

138
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:42,883
“[The US] should avoid sending any wrong
signal to ‘Taiwan independence’ separatists

139
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:43,883
and causing further damage to China-US relations
and peace and stability across the Taiwan

140
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:44,883
Strait.”

141
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:45,883
These are the same people who have been threatening
to invade Taiwan for years, right?

142
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:46,883
In 2005, China passed a law saying it had
the right to “use non-peaceful and other

143
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:47,883
necessary means” to prevent Taiwan from
formally declaring independence.

144
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:48,883
Chinese state-run media have threatened war
if US military aircraft go to Taiwan.

145
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:49,883
They said that would be crossing China’s
“redline.”

146
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:50,883
It threatened to destroy the Taiwanese airport,
the US aircraft, and start a war.

147
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:51,883
Well, I don’t see a war starting.

148
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:52,883
Could it be—the Chinese Communist Party
was just bluffing?

149
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:53,883
That it’s all bluster?

150
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:54,883
A bully who backs down at the first sign of
pressure?

151
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:55,883
I’m shocked!

152
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:56,883
As were many of China’s nationalistic youth.

153
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:57,883
Was all that talk of a redline and war just
that?

154
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:58,883
Talk?

155
00:08:58,883 --> 00:08:59,883
One popular comment on Weibo, China’s version
of Twitter said, “Our red line is no red

156
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:00,883
line.

157
00:09:00,883 --> 00:09:01,883
If this is the case, how can foreigners treat
Taiwan as part of China?”

158
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:02,883
Another online commenter said, “This is
a salami-slicing move that is continuously

159
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:03,883
pressing your red line.”

160
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:04,883
Maybe China’s Wolf Warrior is just a sheep
in wolf’s clothing.

161
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:05,883
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

162
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:06,883
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,

163
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:07,883
by contributing through crowd funding website
Patreon.

164
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:08,883
Banana Pancakes asks, “So is Xi going to
go Handmaid’s Tale to solve China's population

165
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:09,883
problem?”

166
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:10,883
That was in response to my recent episode
about China’s new three child policy.

167
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,883
After decades of the one-child policy, and
then the brief two-child policy, the Communist

168
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:12,883
Party is now allowing Chinese people to have
three children.

169
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:13,883
That’s after it became clear all those forced
abortions and sterilizations have caused a

170
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:14,883
population crisis.

171
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:15,883
Except as I mentioned in that episode, Chinese
people don’t really want more kids.

172
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:16,883
In fact, many want no kids.

173
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:17,883
“Intense workplace competition, inadequate
child care and widespread job discrimination

174
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:18,883
against pregnant women have made childbearing
an unappealing prospect for many.”

175
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:19,883
So, will the Chinese Communist Party resort
to Handmaid’s Tale tactics?

176
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:20,883
In the sense of how a small group of elite
men suppress the population, forcing the lower

177
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:21,883
class to work in dirty, dangerous conditions...it’s
already doing that.

178
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:22,883
But will it start forcing women to have children?

179
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:23,883
Well, considering under China’s family planning
policy, “Women had their menstrual cycles

180
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:24,883
recorded on blackboards, for all to see.”

181
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:25,883
...I don’t think the Communist Party has
an ethical problem with getting right up in

182
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:26,883
people’s personal business.

183
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:27,883
In fact, they don’t see it as your personal
business.

184
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:28,883
They see it as the state’s business.

185
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:29,883
So I really wouldn’t be surprised if one
day, the three child policy goes from a recommendation

186
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:30,883
to a requirement.

187
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:31,883
In fact, I talked about how the Party could
start forcing people to have babies in this

188
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:32,883
recent episode.

189
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:33,883
