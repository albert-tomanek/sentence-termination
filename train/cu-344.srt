1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,189
The Chinese Communist Party has colonized
regions

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:05,690
that once belonged to other cultures...

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,649
Like Xinjiang, where Uighurs live.

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,660
And Tibet, where Tibetans live.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,920
But did you know about “Southern Mongolia”?

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,060
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,349
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:21,480
The country of Mongolia.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,160
It’s famous for horseback riding, yurts,
and throat singing.

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,590
But there’s a second Mongolia:

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,750
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,590
which is a province of China.

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,820
And it’s famous for human rights abuses.

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,020
Well, not so famous for that actually,

15
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,730
and that’s part of the problem.

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,190
Matt Gnaizda sat down with Enghebatu Togochog

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,900
from the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information
Center

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,240
to learn more.

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,320
Thanks for joining me today Enghebatu.

20
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,790
You're welcome.

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,860
So there are really two Mongolias.

22
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,720
There's the country of Mongolia

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,270
and the Chinese Region of Inner Mongolia

24
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,010
or what you call Southern Mongolia.

25
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,010
Correct.

26
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,120
I mean, besides obviously one being a country

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,670
and one being a province of China,

28
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,710
what are the big differences?

29
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,390
Well, I started with, they were one nation.

30
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,790
There is no two to Mongolia.

31
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,980
It was the only start in 1949,

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,700
when the People's Republic of China was established.

33
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,410
Southern Mongolia, also known as Inner Mongolia,

34
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,570
was annexed to China.

35
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,230
So in history, they are a part of the greater
Mongolian nation.

36
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,230
Right?

37
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,460
I mean under the Qing Dynasty,

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,549
if you look at maps from the height of the
Qing Dynasty,

39
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,990
which was like was 1644 to 1911,

40
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,990
Correct.

41
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,390
the entire Mongolia was part of China at the
time.

42
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,390
Well-

43
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,850
According to the maps, right?

44
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,770
Well, according to the map, there is a lot
of issue with those maps

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,970
and then there's a lot of problem with the
terminology

46
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,330
that are used by many scholars even in the
West.

47
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:13,249
For example, Qing Dynasty is not Chinese.

48
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,510
It's Manchu's Qing.

49
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,859
It's not China's Qing, right?

50
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:22,400
So, well more precisely actually,

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,739
Qing Dynasty is a joint rule of a Mongolians

52
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:33,590
and the Manchu over the larger territory.

53
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,290
Not only including China,

54
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,790
but also many other territories including
Mongolia.

55
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,340
It was a part of a Qing, so-

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,280
I mean the Manchus had actually taken over
part of Mongolia

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,900
before they moved into the rest of China.

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,980
Well, they were ...

59
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,329
Before 1644, Manchus and Mongolians were,

60
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:01,629
they were neighbors and they had a very good
relationship.

61
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:04,269
Especially at the Manchu with Southern Mongolia,

62
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:06,019
Eastern part of Southern Mongolia.

63
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,989
Well, they had a very close relationship.

64
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:16,400
And so even the founder of a Qing Dynasty,
Nurhaci himself,

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,689
claimed himself as a descendant of a Mongolian
Khan, Temür Khan.

66
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:27,159
So they, at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty,
it was really ...

67
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,099
Manchus really consider themselves as

68
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,670
a legitimate descendant of Mongolian nation.

69
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,620
So really China has been part of Mongolia
for hundreds of years.

70
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
Yes.

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
That was during the Mongolian empire of China

72
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,349
was just one province of a greater Mongolian-

73
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:49,519
Well let's say China's been part of Mongolia
since ancient times.

74
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,519
Right?

75
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:51,680
That's the way to phrase it, I think.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,699
But now the Chinese are claiming that the
Mongolia

77
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,949
and not only Mongolia, Tibetan,

78
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:04,739
and also we were also a part of China from
a long time ago.

79
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,689
Since the few thousand years ago.

80
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:08,689
But which is not true.

81
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,389
I mean the Mongolia actually is a separate
nation.

82
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,290
If you look at the history between Mongolia
and China,

83
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,290
right?

84
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,600
There's a great wall between Mongolia and
China.

85
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Right, the Great Wall is sort of at the Southern
border

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
of what today is the Chinese Inner Mongolia.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,949
Yes.

88
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,540
Great Wall is actually the real true historical
boundary

89
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:42,210
between the Mongolian nation and Chinese nations.And
not only the national boundary,

90
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,930
but also it's a boundary of two civilizations.

91
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,600
North of the Great Wall is nomadic civilization,

92
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
which is totally different

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,210
from the agricultural civilization in that
South.

94
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:05,180
And not only that, also it's a boundary of
two different climate.

95
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,760
If you look at the climate of Mongolian Plateau,

96
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,860
which is totally different from Chinese.

97
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,170
So it's a real historical boundary

98
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,290
between Mongolian nation and Chinese nation.

99
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,290
Yeah.

100
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,000
And I didn't actually know this until I met
you.

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,950
I met you at a Tibetan event.

102
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,750
And it kind of struck me

103
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,300
that maybe what Mongolians and people in

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,640
the Chinese Region of Inner Mongolia are going
through,

105
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,840
is a little bit similar to what Tibetans

106
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,050
and the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang are going
through

107
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,970
in terms of being separate with languages

108
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,340
and separate culture, separate identity,

109
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,610
regions that have historically not been

110
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,900
part of the Chinese Heartland.

111
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,900
Right.

112
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
So, yes.

113
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,410
First of all, the term,

114
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,720
I would like to say a few words on that.

115
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,030
The terminology that you use Inner Mongolia.

116
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,930
You also use a terminology aside Mongolia-

117
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,110
They call it Nei Menggu.

118
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,660
Yes Nei Menggu.

119
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,050
The term Inner Mongolia is highly propagandistic.

120
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,560
And it's highly sinocentric terminology of
...

121
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,580
And direct translation of the Chinese term
called Nei Menggu.

122
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:30,600
It's implying that, this part of Mongolia
is a integral part of China

123
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,140
or inner part of China.

124
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:40,070
So that's ... There's a territorial claim
with this terminology.

125
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,800
And then on the other hand,

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,530
if you look at the history of Mongolia,

127
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,100
if you look at the map of a Mongolia,

128
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,573
so when you say inner,

129
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:52,780
you are standing in Beijing or Heartland of
China

130
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,300
and then it looks to the Chinese, it's, yeah,

131
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,750
the Southern Mongolia looks in there and then
Northern Mongolia

132
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,220
looks like a outer.

133
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,440
But if you look at the ...

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,650
If you stand in Mongolia and look at the map,

135
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,100
then inner is actually ...

136
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,781
The independent country of Mongolia should
be Inner.

137
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,870
And Southern Mongolia is outer.

138
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,430
And actually there is a very interesting book
published

139
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:30,280
in early 20th century by Danish traveler.

140
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,190
His name is Henning Haslund.

141
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,740
The book is entitled,

142
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,900
"In Secret Mongolia."

143
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,840
There is a very interesting map

144
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,420
published in the book showing that Inner Mongolia

145
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,010
is independent country of Mongolia.

146
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,110
Outer Mongolia is Southern Mongolia.

147
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,470
So it really depend on from whose perspective
you look at the map.

148
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,740
So, but we traditionally never say ourselves
as inner

149
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,930
because there's no reason for us to say inner
and outer.

150
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,080
We just ... The term very term Southern Mongolia,

151
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,669
is from the Mongolian word Uvur Mongol.

152
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,610
We still ... All Mongolians still use today,
Uvur Mongol,

153
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,680
which means Southern Mongolia, South of Gobi
Desert.

154
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,900
Northern Mongolia, which is independent country
of Mongolia, Mongol.

155
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,420
That's it.

156
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,770
There's no political meaning or whatsoever
of inside of which country or ...

157
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,060
This is just geographical terminology.

158
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,279
But now used by the Chinese as Inner,

159
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,240
which is our land in inside of China.

160
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Outer,

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,969
which is, outside of China.

162
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,199
That's why it's, a very sinocentric terminology.

163
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,800
Yeah it sounds like the Chinese government

164
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,589
is using maps and terminology as a way to
solidify

165
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,809
its own historical narrative.

166
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,300
Yes, definitely.

167
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,680
It's Chinese, always ...

168
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,290
If you look at the Chinese history, real China,

169
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,630
the Chinese Heartland is very small.

170
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,270
I mean it's mostly between like the yellow
river in the north

171
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,009
and the Yangtze river in the south, right?

172
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,009
Exactly, yeah.

173
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,639
That's why it's sometimes, it's like some
scholars,

174
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,790
even in the West,

175
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:27,560
unknowingly use the term of referring to Qing
as China.

176
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,880
This is a ... It's good for the Chinese.

177
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,470
I mean, of course they happily take that to
legitimize

178
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,819
their territorial claim over those Mongolia,
East Turkestan and Tibet.

179
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,680
They were never part of China.

180
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,999
The Chinese nation was really small as you
mentioned,

181
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,480
it's just the yellow river basin.

182
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,839
That's their ancestral land.

183
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,449
So I noticed you're wearing this pin.

184
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:56,920
The blue pin.

185
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,959
What’s that?

186
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,589
This is the national flag of Southern Mongolia.

187
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,379
It's a national flag of a region that's not
actually a nation right now.

188
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,740
Well, yes.

189
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,829
You're correct.

190
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:13,240
The independent country of Mongolia has a
different flag.

191
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,790
But very similar fire, sun, moon.

192
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,009
Yeah.

193
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,860
They have this also.

194
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,220
But this is specifically for Southern Mongolia.

195
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,769
So you think Southern Mongolia should be its
own independent country?

196
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,950
Well it was and then up until 1949, it was
an independent country.

197
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,619
Do you want to see it united with the Republic
of Mongolia

198
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:41,600
or do you want to see two separate Mongolian
countries?

199
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,579
Well that is very interesting question.

200
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:52,559
And then it's a very ... It's like century
old topic.

201
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,559
All the Mongolians, actually from bottom of
their heart,

202
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,400
all Mongolians want to be united with the
Southern Mongolian

203
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,619
want to be United with the independent country
of Mongolia.

204
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,460
That was their dream.

205
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,019
They've been fighting for this for many centuries

206
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,149
at least to more than the centuries.

207
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,540
If you look at the history in early 20th century,

208
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,360
when Qing Dynasty collapsed,

209
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,199
Mongolia declared the independence in 1911.

210
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:28,699
At that time, all Southern Mongolians,

211
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:30,910
banners is just administrative unit.

212
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,970
All the other Mongolian banners, just declared
their willingness

213
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,449
to unite with the independent country of Mongolia

214
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,119
to become independent country.

215
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,119
Right.

216
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:48,870
So this attempt, this movement has never ended.

217
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,870
Even today-

218
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,850
Is this thing because the country of Mongolia

219
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,671
actually can thank the Soviet Union

220
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,950
for helping it be independent from China,

221
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,579
but that only ended up becoming the Northern
part, right?

222
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,589
Which is now the country of Mongolia.

223
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,149
But that never included ... Under the Soviet
deal,

224
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,319
never included Southern Mongolia.

225
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,319
Correct.

226
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,379
So, that ...

227
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,259
The narrative, for example, the Soviet Union
helped-

228
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:20,410
Well Soviet Union never really helps, right?

229
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,410
I mean-

230
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,410
No, it actually ... It was-

231
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,410
They do like to kill people.

232
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,089
I think that's part of the problem.

233
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:26,089
Exactly.

234
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,029
It's actual independence of Mongolia.

235
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,749
I would say that the restoration of independence.

236
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:38,470
Because Mongolia independent country in history
before Qing Dynasty.

237
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,999
So after Qing Dynasty collapse,

238
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:43,429
it was really not declaration of independence.

239
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,430
It's this restoration of their independence.

240
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,449
Because Mongolia has had been an independent
country for so many years,

241
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:52,920
so many centuries.

242
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,220
So, yes ... So the independent country Mongolia

243
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,570
is a small portion of greater Mongolia.

244
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,970
Actually if you look at the maps,

245
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,769
Southern Mongolian territory is even larger
than

246
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:12,950
the independent country of Mongolia.

247
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,480
It's also got a lot more people.

248
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Yes.

249
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Right?

250
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
I mean Mongolia, the country only has,

251
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,839
what about three million?

252
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,490
Not even ... Yeah close to three million.

253
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,370
And Inner Mongolia has 20 something million,
right?

254
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,899
So Southern Mongolia is like ...

255
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:28,050
Well, the Mongolian population in Southern
Mongolia

256
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,050
s about six million.

257
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,050
One-

258
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,160
So that's like twice the population of the
entire country of Mongolia.

259
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Yes.

260
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,699
And then the Mongolia is not only

261
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,740
the Southern Mongolia and Northern Mongolia,

262
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,139
but, also there's a large part of Mongolia
within Russia.

263
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:50,759
Now it's called Buryat Republic, and then
Tova.

264
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,089
North-Western part of Mongolia.

265
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,009
That's also the Mongolian nation.

266
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,149
And then there's also another nation called
[inaudible] in Russia,

267
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,449
in Europe.

268
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,819
So these-

269
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,209
All the Mongolian Plateau essentially.

270
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,209
Yes.

271
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,649
They were from the same nation.

272
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,089
They speak the same language.

273
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:17,009
Even today, we have no problem communicating
with each other.

274
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:21,019
So we are the same people, one people.

275
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:28,019
But the problem is, they're in the second
world war.

276
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,029
There was not terrorist treaty called JASTA
treaty.

277
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:41,110
So those superpowers, the Russia or Soviet
Union and Britain,

278
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:49,129
and then America, they had a treaty to maintain
that status quo.

279
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:55,329
Meaning, independent country of Mongolia should
be kept as an independent

280
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,209
but under the Soviet Union's influence.

281
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:04,980
But Southern Mongolia must be kept under the
Chinese jurisdiction.

282
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,779
That's the treaty that really divided Mongolia
into two parts.

283
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,709
So what's it like nowadays to be ethically
Mongolian

284
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,689
living in China's Inner Mongolia autonomous
region,

285
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:17,809
or what you call Southern Mongolia.

286
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,929
Southern Mongolia.

287
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:25,489
So, Southern Mongolia is just like Tibet and
East Turkestan

288
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:30,939
is an occupied nation, occupied by the Chinese.

289
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:33,220
It's a Chinese colony.

290
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
So-

291
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,300
So happy ethnic minorities?

292
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,860
No, there's like the ... We were-

293
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
I'm shocked.

294
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,149
Because state-run Media told me that everyone
was happy.

295
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:45,870
If you look ... It's like, as a second class
citizen,

296
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,000
treated as like second class citizen.

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,829
We do not have any basic human rights.

298
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,369
We do not have any fundamental freedoms,

299
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,939
let alone political autonomy.

300
00:15:55,939 --> 00:16:02,910
So the people who demanded the autonomy,

301
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,899
national autonomy, which was promised by the
Chinese Communist Party,

302
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:13,480
or now sent to jail and consider a separate
test

303
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,540
and their family members are imprisoned.

304
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,629
For example, Mr. Hada, who in early 1990s

305
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:28,779
demanded the genuine autonomy and self determination,

306
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,689
which is part of our basic human rights and-

307
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:36,059
Pardon me China calls it the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.

308
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,019
So it's therefore, one of the least autonomous
parts of China, right?

309
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,019
Yes.

310
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:45,029
It is the first, the so-called autonomy,

311
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,739
Autonomous Region set up by the Communist
China.

312
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:53,040
And then they again, Southern Mongolia was
always

313
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,680
the Guinea pig of Chinese all ethnic policy.

314
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,519
Including the ethnic autonomy,

315
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,020
which was experimented in Southern Mongolia
first.

316
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,210
And then they realize that this model works.

317
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:16,700
So they used the same model in Tibet and in
East Turkestan.

318
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,440
And every time when there's a political movement,

319
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,020
especially toward the ethnic minorities,

320
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,690
so called ethnic minorities,

321
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,970
it is experimented in Southern Mongolia.

322
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,110
So for example, during the 1960s and seventies-

323
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,140
During the Cultural Revolution.

324
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,420
Cultural revolution during that period of
time,

325
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,260
the Chinese government carried out

326
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,750
the large scale genocide in Southern Mongolia.

327
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,200
And then at that time, the total population
of Southern Mongolia

328
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,740
is 1.5 million.

329
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,260
And one-third of the population was impacted.

330
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,260
And then-

331
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,500
They killed thousands and thousands of people.

332
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,160
They killed at least 100,000 Mongolians.

333
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,560
100,000 Mongolians.

334
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,970
100,000 Mongolians.

335
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,490
And then half million were imprisoned at center
jail

336
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,610
and tortured and maimed.

337
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:26,680
So even Chinese government official statistics
support this.

338
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:32,070
100,000 Mongolians are killed just for being
who they are

339
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,230
Just basically for being their ethnicity.

340
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,230
Yes.

341
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,730
It's interesting because the Communist Party

342
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,030
claims to be the party for all races and peoples

343
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,510
and then they are super racist against Mongolians,

344
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,480
against Tibetans, against Uighurs.

345
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Right?

346
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,660
It's just like they go by, what's the race
of the person

347
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,360
and they persecute these groups.

348
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Exactly.

349
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
I like the word, the racist you mentioned.

350
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,700
Yes it is China.

351
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,080
Chinese are the most racist people I have
ever seen.

352
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,870
The Chinese Communist Party, let's say-

353
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, if you look at the Chinese history,
right?

354
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,070
So Great Wall is there.

355
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:18,240
It is the earliest evidence of racial segregation
in human history.

356
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,950
And it is testimony to the history between
the Mongolians and the Chinese.

357
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,570
So for thousand of years,

358
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,920
the racial segregation is never new to the
Chinese.

359
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,450
If you look at the history right?

360
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,570
The Great Wall was built in 2000 years ago

361
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,950
and then at that time they already racially
segregate people.

362
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,710
They call the people in the North as all barbarians,
one word.

363
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,870
And then the Tibetans, Mongolians-

364
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,030
I think they were jealous because Mongolians
were so good at wrestling.

365
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:59,250
Well it's a part of a Mongolian tradition,
right?

366
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,400
That wrestling, and Mongolians,

367
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,810
not only is really strong people physically
fit,

368
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:12,870
but also it's a very, they are good at waging
wars

369
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,180
and the Mongolian-

370
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,580
And then the horseback riding [crosstalk].

371
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,800
And the Mongolians are loyal people.

372
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,671
And not only that,

373
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:26,110
Mongolians are really good at conquering other
nations

374
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,210
and then administering the other nations.

375
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,730
Actually if you look at the Mongolian history
in the 13th century,

376
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,050
especially under the black hands time,

377
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,020
and in that time, Mongolia was actually international
nation.

378
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,460
It was a very diverse and then the capital
of Mongolia

379
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:55,600
had probably just like modern day New York.

380
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
There's so many-

381
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,120
So pizza?

382
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,340
Yes.

383
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,560
Everything.

384
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,920
All modern ideas for example.

385
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,950
The embassy, the passport and the postal service-

386
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,160
In the 1200s.

387
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,840
All these religious freedom, religious worlds,

388
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,980
first religious summit was held in the capital
of Mongolia at that time.

389
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,210
And then all major religion were freely debating.

390
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,100
And then the Mongolia were really open minded
people

391
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,910
and not like the ones that described by the
Chinese.

392
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,920
That Mongolians are barbarians.

393
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,970
No, the Mongolians are very open people and
they had really amazing ...

394
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,970
At that time-

395
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,970
Because you're saying,

396
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,310
the Chinese Communist Party has been inaccurate
in its descriptions.

397
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,850
Like it's been lying perhaps.

398
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,850
Whoa.

399
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,850
Of course.

400
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,410
It's not only inaccurate,

401
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:02,570
here's a lot of racial discrimination in describing
Mongolian history,

402
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,050
portraying, Mongolian history.

403
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,560
So, right now people in Mongolia are saying,

404
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,030
writers and and dissidents are being locked
up.

405
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:19,170
They killed 100,000 people during the culture
revolution.

406
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,650
What is life like right now for the average

407
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,540
ethnically Mongolian person in Southern Mongolia?

408
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Okay.

409
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:34,040
So imagine that, again, this is a occupied
nation, right?

410
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,220
Occupied territory.

411
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,470
So people that are just treated as second
class citizens.

412
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,010
They don't have any freedom.

413
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,830
They cannot claim themselves as Mongolian.

414
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,220
Because when you claim yourself a Mongolian,

415
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,600
when you highlight your identity,

416
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,100
ou can see that there's national separatists.

417
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,160
Okay.

418
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,380
So the kids in Southern Mongolia,

419
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,420
did they learn the Mongolian language and
school,

420
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,170
are they doing different cultural things?

421
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:13,350
Starting 2001, Chinese government implemented
a series of policies

422
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,260
toward eliminating Mongolian traditional culture
language way of life.

423
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,620
And rural schools,

424
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,670
mongolian schools were completely removed
or either removed

425
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,940
or merged with the Chinese ones.

426
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,990
And then kids, Mongolian children all forced
to study in Chinese.

427
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,860
So where there are very few Mongolian schools,

428
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,530
but it's really crowded.

429
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,640
There's not many opportunities for Mongolians
to learn in Mongolian.

430
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,380
So yeah, there's a Chinese language, it's
mandatory.

431
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,460
So how about the lifestyle in terms of,

432
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,080
Mongolians have traditionally,

433
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,970
had a more nomadic lifestyle versus for example,
farming?

434
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:07,630
Well, so Mongolians were traditionally nomadic
people.

435
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,500
Up until very recently, there were able to
practice

436
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,560
their traditional way of life.

437
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,100
But again, as I mentioned earlier, starting
2001,

438
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,750
Chinese government implemented what is called
ecological migration.

439
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,650
The Chinese government came up with an idea

440
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:30,370
that the environmental degradation

441
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,260
was caused by the Mongolian backward way of
life,

442
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,470
traditional way of life.

443
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,910
So that they implemented the policy called
ecological migration

444
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:47,280
to move all the Mongolian herders from their
ancestral land

445
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,340
to agricultural and urban areas,

446
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,800
claiming that this is a part of their effort
to recover,

447
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,400
restore the Mongolian grassland ecosystem.

448
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,130
In fact, and who caused the actual environmental
degradation

449
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,290
is not the Mongolians.

450
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm guessing it was the world's biggest polluter,

451
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,610
the Chinese Communist Party.

452
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,320
Yes, it is.

453
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,650
And then they destroyed Mongolian grassland.

454
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:22,950
They open up minds and they practice large
scale

455
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,340
farming in Southern Mongolia.

456
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:32,590
So Southern Mongolia is a very dry arid or
a semi-arid area,

457
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,410
where there's not much more rainfall.

458
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,700
So once you open up the land, the top soil
is very thin.

459
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,070
When you open it up, it becomes desert-

460
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,880
You get a couple seasons.

461
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
That's it, right?

462
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Exactly.

463
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Yeah, that's it.

464
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,890
And so they, even now,

465
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,940
even Beijing is suffering from this desertification
of Southern Mongolia.

466
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
The sand storm.

467
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
Right.

468
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,840
The sand storm is from Southern Mongolia.

469
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,830
Southern Mongolia is only about 200 miles
from Beijing right?

470
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,670
Oh, very close to Beijing.

471
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,850
That's another misfortune of the Mongolian
people.

472
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,470
But there's this geographical location,

473
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,660
there's no option for us to change this-

474
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,100
It can't get away from Beijing basically.

475
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,120
Yeah.

476
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,810
So the problem is,

477
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,010
we were so close to the Chinese,

478
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,830
even though there was a historical boundary,

479
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,420
the Great Wall between us,

480
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,640
but in one, after the People's Republic of
China was established,

481
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,590
they just flooded the Mongolian grassland
by the Chinese immigrants.

482
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,200
So like Beijing destroys the traditional nomadic
way of life,

483
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,690
and implements farming,

484
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,960
which is totally unsustainable.

485
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Right.

486
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,140
And then that ends up causing sand storms.

487
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
And now they're-

488
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,930
And then the sand storms affect Beijing.

489
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,930
[crosstalk].

490
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,640
Yes, definitely.

491
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,960
But they never admit that this was caused
by them.

492
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
They are saying that ...

493
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,960
They're now blaming on the Mongolian traditional
way of life,

494
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,580
claiming that the Mongolian traditional way
of life destroyed this land.

495
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,610
Well it, I mean it's tradition to blame the
victim and-

496
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,070
Yes, yes it is.

497
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,530
This is a good example of how they blame the
victims.

498
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,410
So what is the Southern Mongolia Liberation
Movement?

499
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,230
Well, as I mentioned earlier,

500
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,850
Southern Mongolia Liberation Movement

501
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,940
has never stopped studying the early 20th
century

502
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:45,160
when the independent country of Mongolia restored
their independence.

503
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,980
All part of Southern Mongolia really joined
the movement.

504
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,870
And then 1930s, Southern Mongolia set up

505
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,830
their own independent government military.

506
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:06,820
And then 1945, after the second world war
ended,

507
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,650
Mongolia's practitioning to Mongolia, right?

508
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,250
The Southern Mongolia become officially part
of China

509
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,270
and Northern Mongolia became independent country.

510
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:26,710
And then even after that, the independent
movement had never stopped.

511
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:33,500
And then during the 50s, 60s,

512
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,380
there were still in people's mind, independence
is a dream.

513
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,690
And then during 1980s, Mongolians also,

514
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,580
there was a large scale student movement

515
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,480
protesting the Chinese immigration.

516
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,370
And then 1990s, the number of organizations,

517
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,270
underground organization,

518
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,700
of course you cannot have a public organization,

519
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,690
publicly advocating for independence.

520
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:13,520
So, but there were a number of organizations

521
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,880
advocating for independence of Southern Mongolia.

522
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,570
And as I mentioned earlier, Mr. Hada,
who's the leader of this movement,

523
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,300
as leader of the organization

524
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,430
called Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance,

525
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:32,900
he was sentenced to 15 years in jail in 1995.

526
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,330
And then he served a full sentence.

527
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,540
And then after that, he was supposed to be
released and

528
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,170
after serving the 15 years in jail, but he
was not.

529
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:49,960
And then he was again put under four year
extra judicial detention

530
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,010
in a black jail.

531
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,500
And then after that, he was supposed to be
released, right?

532
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:01,400
But again, he was moved to another apartment
that

533
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,780
run by the Chinese Public Security Bureau,

534
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,670
and then he's confined in that apartment as
...

535
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,030
It's pretty much as a house arrest.

536
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,010
It's almost like there's no rule of law in
China.

537
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,500
No, there is no rule of law.

538
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,090
So the Liberation Movement or the independence
movement,

539
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,720
I mean because you hear about there's the
free Tibet independence movement

540
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,850
and there's an East Turkestan independence
movement for Uighurs.

541
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,850
Yes.

542
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,850
And then so this is similar to those?

543
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,070
Yes, it is ... Well there ...

544
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,530
Not only within inside Southern Mongolia,

545
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,550
but also outside of Southern Mongolia.

546
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:42,110
There have been a number of organizations
movements still very active-

547
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,780
Well, you are outside of Southern Mongolia,
obviously?

548
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Yes.

549
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Lucky for you.

550
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
Yes.

551
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,880
I'm the lucky one.

552
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Yes.

553
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,200
Well, we are unlucky.

554
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,500
We're under the Chinese.

555
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,600
We were ... My people are under the Chinese
colonial regime,

556
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,720
but personally, I'm lucky I was able to get
out of there

557
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,590
and then enjoy freedom here.

558
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:15,870
Yes there are a number of organizations still
very active

559
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:23,870
in fighting for the freedom or independence
of Southern Mongolia broad.

560
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,340
So the Chinese Communist Party would label
someone like you,

561
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,770
a dangerous separatist trying to split up
China.

562
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,770
Yes.

563
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,770
Right?

564
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,770
Yes.

565
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,559
So, is there another solution that doesn't
require independence?

566
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,860
A solution where you could have what you want

567
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,410
but still be within the people's Republic
of China?

568
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,610
Well, this is ...

569
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,460
Actually history tells of that.

570
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:56,930
There's no other way to become free under
the Chinese colonial regime.

571
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:04,340
So this is to the Southern Mongolians and
Tibetan and Uighurs the same,

572
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,720
it is not really the problem of far communism,
actually.

573
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,140
This is colonization.

574
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,140
It's not communism,

575
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,870
it's issue of colonization.

576
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,320
So the Chinese Communist Party is a colonial
hegemon.

577
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,900
Oh yes, of course.

578
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,850
So ... But the problem is,

579
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,680
it's not only just, the communist problem,

580
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,220
we have double problem.

581
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,330
One is communism, Chinese Communist Party
of course.

582
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,860
The other one is colonization.

583
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,120
I mean this is just ...

584
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,930
So even after the Chinese Communist Party
regime collapsed,

585
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,430
there's a still big question.

586
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,940
The Mongolians and Tibetans need to be free.

587
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:53,350
It doesn't matter which regime replaced the
communists ...

588
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:59,990
Our top priority is how to free ourselves
from the Chinese colonization.

589
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,560
Not just fighting the communism.

590
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,060
All right.

591
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,260
Well thanks so much for joining me.

592
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,830
Thank you.
