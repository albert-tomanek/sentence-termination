1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,860
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,360
I'll make a man out of you

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,690
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,280
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,720
Earlier this month,

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,179
Disney announced a 2018 release date

7
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:20,179
for a live-action remake of their animated
classic Mulan.

8
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:23,069
That’s, of course, based on the ancient
legend

9
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:26,319
of an ordinary girl who disguises herself
as a man

10
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,720
in order to take her father's place in the
army,

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,060
with the help of a cricket,

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,519
a sarcastic horse,

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,520
and a pocket-sized Eddie Murphy.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,850
Mulan is just one of the many new live action
remakes

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,250
Disney is planning,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,070
including Beauty and the Beast,

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,070
Aladdin,

18
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,070
the Lion King,

19
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,470
and even a live action Dumbo directed by Tim
Burton.

20
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,470
Wow.

21
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,890
Who greenlit that idea?

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,890
What's next?

23
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,100
Quentin Tarantino's live-action Bambi remake?

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Anyway,

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,400
the live-action Mulan got a little controversial
this week,

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,090
when the blog Angry Asian Man published an
open letter

27
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,920
from someone who had read the original spec
script

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,950
that Disney bought,

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,350
called the Legend of Mulan.

30
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,539
The spec script centers around a 30-something
European trader

31
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,719
who falls in love with Mulan.

32
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,719
In fact,

33
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,149
more than half of the script is about the
European trader,

34
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,799
who ends up saving China.

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,840
So this caused a little bit of controversy

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,390
from people who expected the movie Mulan

37
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,320
to be actually about Mulan.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
To be fair,

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,950
I hear they’re casting a white guy as the
lead in Lion King.

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,600
It sounds a little unbelievable,

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,229
but Hollywood has gotten in trouble recently

42
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,549
for whitewashing characters in movies like
Doctor Strange,

43
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:41,959
The Last Airbender,

44
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,090
Ghost in the Shell,

45
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,090
and I could go on,

46
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,579
but the rest of this episode would just be
me listing movies.

47
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,579


48
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,579
But after that news broke,

49
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,389
sources close to the Disney movie confirmed

50
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:53,920
that the script was being rewritten,

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,349
and that the love interest was definitely
Asian.

52
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:59,110
No word on whether Mushu will still be Eddie
Murphy.

53
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,869
For more on this,

54
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,869
we go to China Uncensored's resident Chinese
woman,

55
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:04,990
Shelley Zhang.

56
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,570
Shelley, what do you think of the Mulan controversy?

57
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,570
Well Chris,

58
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,290
it sounds like the original script wasn’t
so much

59
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,710
the Legend of Mulan,

60
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,890
as it was the Legend of Greg,

61
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,310
the Selfish European Trader Who Falls in Love
With Mulan

62
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,490
and Changes for the Better,

63
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,190
Thereby Saving China.

64
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,180
But I guess that wouldn't fit well on a movie
poster.

65
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Matt?

66
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
Where's Shelley?

67
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,810
I'm here, Chris.

68
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,540
Then why am I talking to Matt about this?

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,330
Well, according to viewer data,

70
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,110
more than half of China Uncensored's US audience

71
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,180
is white males, like me.

72
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,740
So we thought it would be more relatable

73
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,320
if Matt talked about this issue.

74
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,410
But we don't want to hear from Matt.

75
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,390
We want to hear from you.

76
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,390
Oh.

77
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,360
Well, that's all you had to say.

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Thanks, Matt,

79
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,580
you're done here.

80
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,290
Awww, man.

81
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,930
So Shelley,

82
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,020
what do you think of the new Mulan script?

83
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,810
I prefer to think that maybe the screenwriters

84
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,950
got confused and thought that they were writing

85
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,830
the remake of Pocahontas.

86
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,010
Pocahontas?

87
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,030
Right, or Avatar.

88
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,270
Or The Last Samurai.

89
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,520
Or Dances with Wolves.

90
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
Or--

91
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,730
Ok, I take your point.

92
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,360
We've seen this story before.

93
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,670
What about the Great Wall?

94
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm actually not really upset about the Great
Wall,

95
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,640
since casting Matt Damon was more of a cynical
move

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,320
by the Chinese studio to appeal to Western
audiences.

97
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,990
Also, there are monsters attacking the Great
Wall,

98
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,340
so I don't think they were going for historical
accuracy.

99
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,340
And look,

100
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm not saying that Disney's live action Mulan

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,380
has to be totally faithful to the original
legend.

102
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,490
Stories change.

103
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,240
The original ballad of Mulan was written in
the 6th century.

104
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
And it’s been adapted in various poems,

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,260
plays and novels for hundreds of years.

106
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,500
But this latest Legend of Mulan script

107
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,110
was something else.

108
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,660
It's even less faithful than the 1998 animated
film

109
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,540
the Secret of Mulan,

110
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,690
in which Mulan is literally a caterpillar.

111
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,310
A caterpillar!

112
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,420
But guess what?

113
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,780
Caterpillar Mulan still gets to save the day.

114
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,680
So every time that people come out to say
something

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
about whitewashing or diversity in the media,

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,010
there are people who say that this doesn't
matter.

117
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,220
Are we making too big a deal out of this?

118
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,080
It matters, Chris.

119
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Stories are important.

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,110
They influence how we see the world around
us.

121
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,800
And you know who really understands this?

122
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,630
The Chinese Communist Party.

123
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,270
I did not see that coming.

124
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,100
The Chinese Communist Party is fantastic at
using stories

125
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,740
to reshape how people think about their own
culture.

126
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,260
Here's a recent example.

127
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,500
The Washington Post published this story

128
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,440
about an opera that is performed each night
in the capital of Tibet.

129
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,210
It's a love story between Chinese Princess
Wencheng

130
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,640
and Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo.

131
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,050
Princess Wencheng brings civilization to Tibet,

132
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,370
and the noble king,

133
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,840
who dreams of freeing the poor,

134
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,879
builds the Potala Palace as a tribute of his
love to her.

135
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,879


136
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,879
That sounds so sweet.

137
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,140
Yeah, but there’s one problem:

138
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,840
It's not true.

139
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,350
Although historically there may have been

140
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,520
a real Princess Wencheng,

141
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,910
it's a little unclear.

142
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,820
But this version of her story was commissioned
back in 1959

143
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,630
by Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai

144
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,640
to justify the Party's "liberation" of Tibet.

145
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,320
China, as the kind, older brother who teaches
Tibet

146
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,250
how to be civilized.

147
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,950
Princess Wencheng is even credited

148
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,740
with bringing Buddhism to Tibet.

149
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,860
Which is not true?

150
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,330
So they created a legend to explain

151
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,220
why Tibetans should be grateful for the Communist
Party.

152
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,810
Well not so much created as co-opted.

153
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,550
And it's not just about erasing Tibetan culture.

154
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,150
Thousands of Han Chinese tourists watch this
opera every night,

155
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,449
and feel good about themselves for "saving"
Tibet,

156
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,550
and don't understand why Tibetans don't like
the benevolent rule

157
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,960
of the Chinese Communist Party.

158
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,020
Wow, that's pretty messed up.

159
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,550
That's only one example.

160
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,490
The Communist Party has done this with Chinese
culture too.

161
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,540
One famous example is how they took the legend

162
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,889
of a white-haired goddess

163
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,960
and turned it into an opera about a girl whose
hair turns white

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,850
after she's victimized by an evil landlord,

165
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,410
and—spoiler alert—

166
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,850
is saved by communism.

167
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,570
Oh, and there's a song called "Dear Chairman
Mao."

168
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,210
There's also the movie Hero,

169
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,090
which basically shows that it's ok for the
leader of China

170
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,150
to kill tons of people

171
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,720
as long as it's to keep China unified.

172
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
Yes.

173
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,889
That.

174
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,990
To be clear, I'm not saying that Disney is
at all doing

175
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,520
what the Communist Party is doing.

176
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,389
But they need to be aware of what their stories
are saying

177
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,180
about Chinese culture.

178
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,022
So what do you think they'll do about the
live action Mulan?Well, I hope that they're

179
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,490
listening to what people are saying

180
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,680
about the kind of Mulan movie they want to
see.

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,919
As a Chinese American,

182
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,180
I hope to see a story where we get to be our
own heroes.

183
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,380
And I think Disney might just be able to do
that.

184
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,870
Otherwise, dishonor on Disney.

185
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,610
And dishonor on their cow.

186
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,250
Thanks, Shelley.

187
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,120
What do you think about Disney’s changes
to Mulan?

188
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Is it a big deal over nothing?

189
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,480
Or would China Uncensored be better off hosted
by…

190
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
Me!

191
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
Leave your comments below.

192
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,280
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

193
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,009
See you next time!
