00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,800
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,720
5 ways the Chinese regime props up North Korea

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,240
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,700
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,190
It’s been five weeks since the historic
meeting

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,310
between North Korean Dear Leader Kim Jong-Un,

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,580
and His Excellency Donald Trump.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,130
No, seriously.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,000
Kim Jong-Un has just sent a letter to Donald
Trump,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,710
calling him “your excellency” 5 separate
times.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,199
Ugh, what a fanboy!

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,680
Don’t you realize that no one else

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,870
calls Donald Trump “your excellency”?

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,450
They call him God Emperor.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,700
But anyway, last month’s Trump-Kim meeting

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,460
was bad news for the Chinese Communist Party.

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,649
“China, once the primary conduit

18
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,550
between Washington and Pyongyang,

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,730
is at risk of being largely left on the outside.”

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,329
You see, the Chinese Communist Party

21
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:50,559
liked to be the middleman.

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
“If you want to talk the North Korean regime

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,620
out of nuking the world back to the stone
age,

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,559
you have to go through us.”

25
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,579
But now, the Trump-Kim bromance

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,219
is attempting to cut out the middleman.

27
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,610
And that makes Xi Jinping sad.

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,300
And then Trump launched a trade war with China.

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,000
And that makes Xi Jinping mad.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,840
Mad enough, that Trump thinks Xi Jinping

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,100
may be trying to “exert negative pressure”
on Kim Jong-un

32
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,860
to not honor his agreement.

33
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,270
Trump “hopes not!”—

34
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,830
but there have been some hiccups.

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,030
Like how North Korean officials didn’t show
up

36
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,619
for a scheduled meeting with the US military.

37
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,670
And the indications that the North Korean
regime

38
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,990
is still working on its nuclear program.

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,880
So is the Chinese Communist Party

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,590
“exerting negative pressure” on Kim Jong-un

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,329
to not work with Trump?

42
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,170
It’s hard to say.

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,440
Xi Jinping met with Kim Jong-un three times
this year—

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,970
including once after Kim’s summit with Trump.

45
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,970
So it’s clear that the Chinese Communist
Party

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,060
is still heavily involved with North Korea,

47
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,880
and could be influencing how they deal with
the US.

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,170
In any case, it is clear that for decades,

49
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,290
the Chinese Communist Party has been propping
up

50
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,020
the North Korean regime—

51
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,920
for the very purpose of having this kind of
control.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,530
Here are 5 ways.

53
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,840
Number 5

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Trade

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,549
North Korea has always been an international
pariah.

56
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,079
That’s why it’s one of the most heavily
sanctioned

57
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,099
countries on the planet.

58
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,319
How did the Kim Dynasty survive?

59
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,359
China.

60
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,469
“China now represents more than

61
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,090
90 percent of Pyongyang’s trade,

62
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,349
making it just about North Korea’s only
economic lifeline.”

63
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,480
The other 10%?

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,629
Well, let’s just say they found a side hustle.

65
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,939
Number 4

66
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:44,799
Hacking

67
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,150
Nuclear attacks aren’t the only weapon

68
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,819
in North Korea’s arsenal.

69
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:48,819
Turns out,

70
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,629
they have some very proficient hackers.

71
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,110
According to the Korea Institute of Liberal
Democracy in Seoul,

72
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,589
“Today, an elite squad of 6,800 North Korean
state hackers

73
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:03,480
are engaged in fraud, blackmail and online
gambling

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,360
that together generate annual revenue of $860
million.”

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,269
Wow, that’s like 7% of their GDP just from
hacking.

76
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:15,349
Now you may not think of North Korea

77
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,799
as the place for cutting-edge cyber warfare.

78
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,049
But you know what?

79
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:21,549
You’ve got to start them young.

80
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,559
Where did North Korea get these cyber skills?

81
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,170
From their friendly neighbor,

82
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,889
the Chinese Communist Party.

83
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,489
“North Korean hackers have attended schools
in China

84
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:34,019
and used it as a staging ground for attacks...

85
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,839
[North Korea eventually] established a large
outpost

86
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:41,010
for its secretive hacking unit in China.”

87
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,889
And that’s had serious consequences for
the world.

88
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,349
“The magnitude of the attack here is tremendous.

89
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,589
We’re talking 200,000 computers

90
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:51,040
across 150 different countries

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,049
so this is really the biggest cyber shakedown
in history.”

92
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:55,319
And ironically,

93
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,409
one of the victims of that attack was...China!

94
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,819
Some relationships are just complicated.

95
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,819
Number 3

96
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,579
Future-Planning

97
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,099
The Chinese Communist Party had big plans
for North Korea.

98
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,040
They wanted to mold the North Korean economy

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,209
to become like China’s model of state-run
capitalism.

100
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,549
And this was the man to do it.

101
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,909
That’s Kim Jong-Nam, eldest son of Kim Jong-Il

102
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,120
and half brother of current leader Kim Jong-Un.

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,280
Originally, he was in line to become the leader
of North Korea

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,340
after Kim Jong-Il.

105
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,270
But then—and this is true—

106
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,069
he got caught making a trip to Disneyland
in Tokyo

107
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:37,129
using a fake passport.

108
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,030
It became kind of an embarrassment for Kim
Jong-Il.

109
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,099
So “Kim Jong Nam quickly fell out of favor
with his father,

110
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,340
and was replaced by Kim Jong Un in the line
of succession.”

111
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,569
Wow, that’s harsh.

112
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,099
One trip to Disneyland

113
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,660
and your father disowns you?!

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,939
But the Chinese regime took Kim Jong-Nam in,

115
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,380
showering him with the love and the Disneyland
visits

116
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,930
his own father wouldn’t give him.

117
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,960
Why?

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,900
Because “Kim Jong Nam had supported

119
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,150
Chinese-style economic reforms in North Korea

120
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,319
and was seen by some as a possible replacement

121
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,080
for Kim Jong Un.”

122
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,040
It was a good plan.

123
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,259
Until Kim Jong-Un had him assassinated.

124
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,349
Allegedly.

125
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,349
Number 2

126
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,509
High Level Intel

127
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,090
In China, the secret sauce of power is guanxi,

128
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,419
or relationships.

129
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,229
Ok, to be fair,

130
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,550
relationships are the secret sauce of power
everywhere.

131
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,800
It’s just that it sounds cooler in Chinese.

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,879
The point is, you have to know the right people.

133
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,080
And North Korean leaders knew all the right
people.

134
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,889
Like Zhou Yongkang,

135
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,979
former head of China’s Security apparatus.

136
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,680
Here he is with Kim Jong-Il

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,500
and his best “happy face”.

138
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,400
And again in 2010 at a military parade.

139
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,159
The relationship had some perks.

140
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,220
For instance,

141
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,889
Kim’s uncle visited China in 2012

142
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,740
to meet with then Chinese leader Hu Jintao.

143
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,500
And Kim’s uncle allegedly proposed the deal
of the century!

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,759
He secretly offered to stop North Korea’s
nuclear program

145
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,759
in exchange for the Chinese regime’s help

146
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,900
with economic development and putting

147
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,729
Kim Jong-Nam on the throne.

148
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:20,810
But that would have been bad news for Kim
Jong-un!

149
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,689
Fortunately, Kim Jong-un’s good buddy in
China,

150
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,690
Zhou Yongkang, told him about uncle Jang's
conversation.

151
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,849
So Kim disciplined his uncle.

152
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,380
And by disciplined, I mean executed.

153
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,150
By the way, there are competing factions

154
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,360
within the Chinese Communist Party, too.

155
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,190
There’s one faction what wanted to put

156
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,199
Kim Jong-nam in power.

157
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,479
And another one—starring Zhou Yongkang—

158
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,240
that warned Kim Jong-un about his naughty
uncle.

159
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,770
But both factions have something in common:

160
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,889
They’ve been trying to prop up the North
Korean regime,

161
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,370
because they don’t want it to collapse.

162
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,529
That’s why it’s so important

163
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,569
that they helped the regime with...

164
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,310
Number 1

165
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,889
Nuclear weapons

166
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,819
We can’t talk about the Chinese regime

167
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:05,680
propping up the North Korean regime

168
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,659
without mentioning former Chinese leader

169
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,270
and human-size toad Jiang Zemin.

170
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,479
Jiang Zemin and Kim Jong-il were close.

171
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,479
How close?

172
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,169
Too close.

173
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,960
And Jiang Zemin is actually one of the reasons

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,380
we’re in this mess with North Korea in the
first place.

175
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,130
Jiang Zemin helped them develop nukes.

176
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,750
Previous Chinese leaders had refused to—

177
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,250
because even Deng Xiaoping who loved killing
students,

178
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,930
or Mao Zedong who loved killing...anybody...

179
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,939
weren’t crazy enough to give weapons of
mass destruction

180
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,450
to the leaders of North Korea.

181
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,860
But Jiang Zemin, well, he was just the right
kind of crazy.

182
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,669
According to this Radio Free Asia report,
Jiang Zemin

183
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,469
started giving North Korea nuclear material
in 1989.

184
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,099
Allegedly because he was mad at the world

185
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,409
for criticizing the Chinese Communist Party

186
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,009
for killing students in the Tiananmen Square
Massacre.

187
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,159
Yeah, that’ll show the world.

188
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,259
And Jiang Zemin took North Korea under his
arm and said...

189
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,530
“Someday, and that day may never come,

190
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,120
I will call upon you to do a service for me.”

191
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,180
And that day eventually came.

192
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,840
It was decades later when Jiang Zemin

193
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,960
and his allies were under political attack.

194
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,240
According to one China analyst, Jiang’s
people,

195
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,779
“may have even influenced the timing

196
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,319
of North Korea’s five nuclear tests”

197
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,360
as a distraction whenever their faction came
under attack.

198
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,900
Now, if Jiang did give North Korea

199
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,699
help with their nuclear program,

200
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:36,270
he wasn’t alone.

201
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,190
North Korea also got help from the Soviet
Union,

202
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,240
Egypt, and Pakistan.

203
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,370
But I bet none of them got a thank you like
this.

204
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,399
So those are five ways the Chinese Communist
Party

205
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,280
has propped up the North Korean regime.

206
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,980
It’s been a pretty close friendship for
30 years.

207
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,529
So you can see why they might be a tad jealous

208
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:58,709
when some American cowboy comes in

209
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,460
to sweep Kim Jong-un off his feet.

210
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,690
And before you go,

211
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,389
now’s the time on the show when we answer
questions

212
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,570
from fans who support China Uncensored on
Patreon.

213
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,699
H.W. asks,

214
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:12,520
“Why do you say "Chinese Communist Party"

215
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,800
out in full every time?

216
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,690
Wouldn't it be easier to just say "Chinese
government?"

217
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,959
Seems more time-saving

218
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,540
and doesn't confuse new viewers

219
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,089
who don't know what the CCP is.”

220
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,760
Ahh, very good question!

221
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,390
And the answer is:

222
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,440
The Chinese government and the Chinese Communist
Party

223
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
are not the same thing.

224
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,899
The Chinese government is the bureaucratic
structure

225
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,350
that handles the administrative affairs of
the country.

226
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,459
But what’s unusual about China

227
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:41,170
is that the Chinese Communist Party

228
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,060
is actually completely in charge.

229
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,730
It sits on top of the government,

230
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,970
and controls it—like a parasite.

231
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,769
The Communist Party controls not only the
government,

232
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,690
but also the media, businesses, religions,
trade unions,

233
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,019
and really everything else in society.

234
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,050
So the government and the Party are really
not the same thing.

235
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,990
When the Chinese government does something,

236
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,570
it’s almost always because the Communist
Party

237
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,089
is pulling the strings.

238
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,899
That’s why, to be accurate,

239
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,940
I say Chinese Communist Party.

240
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,740
Thanks for your question, H.W.

241
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,220
