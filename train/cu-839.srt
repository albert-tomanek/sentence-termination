1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,270
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,910
Foreigners. What are we doing to your women?

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,679
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,839
If I were to create a Venn Diagram

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,340
of the most terrifying things to the Chinese
Communist Party,

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,740
it would look like this.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,240
Foreign spies!

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,460
Who are also Tibetan Falun Gong Pro-Democracy
Lawyers.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,689
But at least when it comes to foreign spies,

10
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,470
the Communist Party has a plan to stop them.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,550
That’s why they’ve just celebrated China’s
first-ever National Security Education Day!

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,980
A day for people throughout China

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,140
to have correct education thrust upon them
by their benevolent overlords.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,719
Now you might be wondering,

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,450
isn't that every day in China?

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,570
Well, on this day, there were comics!

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,649
Among the 100-plus promotional materials

18
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,090
put out by China’s Ministry of State Security,

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,539
there’s this lovely 16-panel comic called
“Dangerous Love.”

20
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,969
And it’s captured the world’s imagination.

21
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,449
It stars Little Li

22
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,080
—an innocent Chinese girl—

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,560
and David

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,580
—an unassuming foreigner.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,500
You can tell he’s a foreigner by the big
schnoz.

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,700
But while at first you might assume David

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,509
is merely your typical evil foreigner,

28
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,740
he’s actually an even evilier evil foreigner.

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,869
Let’s take a look.

30
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,240
A friend from overseas is holding a gathering
today.

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,330
Didn’t you want to improve your foreign
language skills?

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,579
You should go with me.

33
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,310
Sounds good!

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,680
I’m David. I’m a visiting scholar specializing
in China research.

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,310
I’m very eager to chat with you guys.

36
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,110
Let’s all introduce ourselves and our work.

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,649
How about we start with this beautiful lady
here?

38
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,659
(blushing) Ah, alright.

39
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,670
My name is Xiao Li.

40
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,939
I just finished university and got a job with
the civil service.

41
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:51,379
I work in the international propaganda department.

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,840
OK.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,260
After that gathering,

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,579
David began meeting with Xiao Li and giving
her gifts.

45
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,840
You are beautiful, warm, and bright.

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,619
In fact, I’ve liked you since we first met.

47
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,810
A handsome, romantic, and capable foreign
boyfriend…not bad!

48
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,069
A relationship develops between the two.

49
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,860
Dear, what specifically do you do at work?

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,230
I’m responsible for composing “internal
references”

51
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,610
that form the basis for central policies.

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,200
That’s great! You can let me borrow those
“internal references.”

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,260
They’ll be really useful for my academic
papers.

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,860
No, we’re under a confidentiality agreement.

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,340
Dear, do you have to keep secrets from me?

56
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,250
I just want to have a look for my research
work.

57
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,530
Uh, alright then.

58
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,610
Here’s a copy I made.

59
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,050
Once you’re done, give it back to me right
away.

60
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,780
Rest assured, my dear.

61
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,860
He hasn’t called and his phone is off...

62
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,349
You’re Xiao Li, right?

63
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,180
We’re with the State Administration of National
Security.

64
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,629
Please come with us.

65
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,650
Huh? What’s the matter?

66
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,129
David is an overseas spy who’s in China
to steal political and military information.

67
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,780
We have already apprehended him.

68
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,280
You provided him with these “internal references,”
correct?

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,760
What?!

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,819
For a state employee,

71
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,390
you show a very shallow understanding of secrecy.

72
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,170
You are suspected of violating our national
laws.

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,420
I didn't know he was a spy. He used me!

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,590
And then the last two panels describe

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,970
how providing state secrets to foreign forces
violates China’s Counter-Espionage Law.

76
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,159
And you can be sentenced to 5 to 10 years
in prison.

77
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,750
Happy National Security Education Day!

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,150
Ok, I can't in good conscience mock China's
Ministry of State Security

79
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,970
for their cheesy warning about foreign spies...

80
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,989
without also mocking the FBI for their cheesy
warning about being recruited by foreign spies.

81
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,030
Did you know that the FBI makes movies?

82
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,290
“I am an FBI agent!”

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,660
“I know, man! Isn’t it wild?”

84
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,590
Unfortunately nothing that good.

85
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,939
But they have made a 30-minute,

86
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:58,159
after school special-type movie warning young
Americans

87
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,559
about the dangers of being recruited as a
spy by the Chinese government.

88
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,280
Called Game of Pawns.

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,130
“Junior year in college,

90
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,840
I got to live the dream.

91
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,380
A year abroad in Shanghai studying language
and philosophy.

92
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,140
Wo hen hao. Xie xie, my man!”

93
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,940
It's based on the "ripped from the headlines"
story of Glenn Duffie Shriver,

94
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,800
a hapless American who innocently gets a lot of

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,979
"scholarship money" from his new Chinese friends,

96
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,030
and then promises them he'll join the CIA
and tell them all about it.

97
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,020
It could happen to anyone, am I right?

98
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,930
So China's intelligence agency isn't alone
in using popular media to warn their citizens.

99
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,840
But the Chinese Communist Party isn’t just
worried

100
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,449
that their hapless citizens will accidentally
leak state secrets.

101
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:56,790
They’re worried that ginger-haired foreigners
like David will steal Chinese people’s souls.

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,060
I mean, figuratively.

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,920
They don’t want foreigners influencing the
thoughts of the Chinese citizens

104
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,590
they’ve spent decades...educating.

105
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,250
For example, in this article,

106
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,830
a Quartz reporter interviewed 24-year-old
May Xu.

107
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,750
She said her foreign boyfriend once declared
that “Mao is a dictator.”

108
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,680
She didn’t like that,

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,630
“because that makes Mao the equivalent to
Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin, she explained.”

110
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,050
Outrageous, right?

111
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,660
As explained in this helpful internet graphic,

112
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,430
Mao killed way more people than Hitler and
Stalin.

113
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,830
Fortunately, May held fast to her soul, and
broke up with that shameful foreigner.

114
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,419
The Quartz article goes on to show how

115
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:44,470
foreigners sometimes try to talk about sensitive
political topics with their Chinese girlfriends.

116
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,560
And as you can imagine,

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,919
these foreign ideas like so-called democracy

118
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,020
cause chaos in the carefully honed minds of
innocent Chinese girls.

119
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,729
And the Communist Party isn’t just worried
about foreign political influence.

120
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,600
There’s religion, too.

121
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,430
In mid-April, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said
China

122
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,400
“must resolutely guard against overseas
infiltrations via religious means.”

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,069
But don’t worry,

124
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,470
they’ve already got a plan to

125
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,080
“direct the religious circle and their followers
to enhance social harmony.”

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,300
I think it’s this.

127
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,180
And this.

128
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,419
So if you’re a foreigner,

129
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,610
and you have ideas and/or beliefs,

130
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,720
you might want to stay away from China.

131
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,880
Because you know what the comic strip doesn't
show?

132
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,500
What happens to David.

133
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,419
I'm sure he's fine.

134
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,419
So what do you think?

135
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,039
Leave your dangerous ideas and/or beliefs
below.

136
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,800
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time.
