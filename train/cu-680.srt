00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:02,580
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,980
complex economic issues with no clear solution!

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,940
I’m Shelley Zhang,

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,310
filling in for Chris Chappell,

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,520
who’s out receiving vacation-style therapy.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,680
He's going to be so relaxed when he gets back.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,590
Speaking of relaxing professions,

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,840
in a little over a week,

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,440
Donald Trump will be sworn in as President.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,160
And here's one of the things he's vowed to
do

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,300
on his first day in office.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,120
“I’m going to instruct my treasury secretary

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,399
to label China a currency manipulator—

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,370
the greatest in the world.”

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,850
It was one of President-elect Trump's

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,120
repeated themes during his campaign:

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,150
that China is undervaluing its currency

19
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,360
to gain an unfair trade advantage over the
US.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,360
And he's promised to fight back with tariffs

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,070
and taxes on Chinese imports.

22
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,720
He's not the first person to talk about this

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,100
on the campaign trail.

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,000
"As president, I'll use all the diplomatic
avenues open to me

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,300
to insist China stop manipulating its currency.”

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,820
“On day 1,

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,540
I will label China a currency manipulator.”

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,680
Ah, the day one china currency manipulator
promise.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,020
A traditional part of presidential campaigning,

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,420
right up there with visiting the Iowa State
Fair

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,240
and eating whatever the heck this thing is.

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,170
That's why I love America.

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,760
Because if you want to be president,

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,380
you must first seek the blessing of the great
butter cow.

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,200
So, on day one,

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,860
the president will label China a currency
manipulator?

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,870
Let's be real,

38
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,370
on day one of a new job,

39
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,900
everyone is still trying to get their act
together.

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,670
I once spent six hours waiting for IT to get
me a computer.

41
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,920
But I'm sure that won't happen at the White
House,

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,640
because the US government is a bastion of
efficiency.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,920
Anyway,

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,500
is China a currency manipulator?

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,740
Well, it's complicated.

46
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
For years,

47
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,409
China had a fixed exchange rate.

48
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,680
I know, this already sounds incredibly boring.

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,380
But stay with me.

50
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,289
A fixed exchange rate meant that the yuan—

51
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,330
the Chinese currency—

52
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,260
would always be worth the same amount to the
dollar.

53
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,450
From 1994 through 2004,

54
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,750
it was 8.26 yuan equals 1 dollar.

55
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,060
Now, other countries have fixed exchange rates
too.

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,159
The issue is that as China's economy grew
rapidly,

57
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,069
the central bank kept their yuan fixed at
the same low rate,

58
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:30,939
so it was worth less than it should have been.

59
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,519
Which meant that Chinese-made stuff was artificially
cheaper.

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,159
So more and more American companies

61
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,670
moved their manufacturing to China,

62
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,260
where they could get more bang for their buck.

63
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,480
And by bang, I mean, yuan.

64
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,150
You could literally pay people in China a
fraction

65
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,150
of what you would pay in America.

66
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,230
And all that extra money?

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,450
Profit!

68
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,400
So China kept its people poor

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,459
to boost its manufacturing and exports.

70
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,900
And America gained cheaper goods

71
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,689
that led to a trade deficit with China

72
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:04,169
while losing manufacturing jobs.

73
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,620
Which is the real reason US presidential candidates

74
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,890
always talk about China manipulating its currency.

75
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,920
Now in 2005,

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,709
China stopped fixing the yuan to the dollar.

77
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,989
But they still heavily manage its exchange
rate.

78
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,579
They control how much it can change each day,

79
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,299
and buy and sell foreign currency

80
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,109
to affect the price of the yuan.

81
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,269
In fact,

82
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,409
China's central bank has the largest foreign
exchange reserves

83
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,409
in the world.

84
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,579
In 2014,

85
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,839
they owned 4 trillion dollars in foreign currency.

86
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,839
So yes,

87
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,779
China manipulates its currency.

88
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:40,030
But here's where it gets tricky.

89
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,879
In the last few years,

90
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,479
China's been going through an economic slowdown.

91
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,870
And people are moving massive amounts of money

92
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,339
out of the country.

93
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:52,139
Both of those things make the yuan less valuable.

94
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,579
And the US economic recovery

95
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:58,229
means the dollar the strongest it's been in
13 years.

96
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,040
So in the last couple years,

97
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,939
China's been trying to manipulate its currency
the other way.

98
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,199
Now it wants its currency to be stronger,

99
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,739
to keep it from falling against the dollar.

100
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,480
That's because if the yuan falls too quickly,

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,859
it could crash China's economy.

102
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:15,930
I believe we have a clip of Chinese economists

103
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,410
trying to save the yuan:

104
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,710
In fact,

105
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,650
the Chinese government has spent almost a
trillion dollars

106
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,849
of their foreign reserves

107
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,110
trying to slow down the slide.

108
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,810
And it's still falling.

109
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,830
Ironically,

110
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,900
if the Chinese central bank stopped manipulating
its currency right now,

111
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,539
it would have the exact opposite effect of
what Trump

112
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,100
and other US politicians want.

113
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,660
It might look kind of like this.

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,700
So what would happen if Trump does get the
Treasury Department

115
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,090
to officially label China a currency manipulator?

116
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,919
Well, under a law passed in 2015,

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,370
the Treasury would have to spend a year negotiating

118
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,150
with the Chinese government.

119
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,740
And then they still could do almost nothing
meaningful to stop it.

120
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Separately,

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,120
Trump could still put tariffs on imports from
China,

122
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,900
but that’d be a whole ’nother episode.

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
Here's the thing.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,639
When Trump and other US officials talk about
China gaming the system

125
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,820
against the US,

126
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,979
they're right.

127
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:20,979
For example,

128
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,010
we've talked before on this show

129
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,650
about how Chinese companies steal US technology
for profit

130
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,770
with the help of the Chinese military.

131
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,960
That sucks trillions from the US economy every
year.

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,650
But officially labeling China a currency manipulator

133
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,069
at this point won't really achieve anything
meaningful.

134
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:41,590
We need to be talking about the real issues.

135
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,750
Like this key economic indicator:

136
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,220
So, what do you think?

137
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,600
Leave your comments below.

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,630
I'm Shelley Zhang,

139
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,740
filling in for Chris Chappell, who is back
very, very soon.

140
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,870
And for you finance whizzes out there,

141
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,560
yes, this is an incredibly simplified explanation

142
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,999
that glosses over a whole bunch of economic
factors.

143
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,330
But, I didn't want to have to tell Chris

144
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,879
I drove away all his viewers by using words
like

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,780
“capital outflows” and “liquidity stress.”

146
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,480
You're welcome.

147
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,640
What do you mean, you and Shelley have taken over the show?!

148
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
I've only been gone a week!

149
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,240
That's it - I'm taking the next flight back to New York...
