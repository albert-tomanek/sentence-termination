1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,110
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,570
Ever wonder what the Communist Party

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,080
cares about most?

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,080
The answer will surprise you...

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,920
I spy with my little eye,

6
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,870
a People’s Liberation Army Navy Type 815

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,759
auxiliary general intelligence ship!

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,759
And finally,

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,380
make sure you’re not sitting in the splash
zone,

10
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,000
when China’s housing bubble bursts.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,180
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,600
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

13
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,079
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,079
If there’s one thing

15
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,369
the Chinese Communist Party cares about,

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,300
its sincerity.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,000
Party members are just so sincere

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,730
about listening to the people,

19
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,500
says Party mouthpiece People’s Daily.

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,940
They also say China deserves recognition

21
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,269
for sincerely promoting peace around the world.

22
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,460
And my heart trembles when I think about

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,180
how sincere China is in the South China Sea.

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,720
Actually, I’m pretty sure the Global Times

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,010
is right about that one.

26
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,960
I mean, setting up military bases

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,170
is a sincere commitment.

28
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,170
So what happens when some no-good

29
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,370
but duly elected Hong Kong lawmakers

30
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,500
aren’t sincere?

31
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,580
Well, they must be punished.

32
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,250
Newly elected lawmakers in Hong Kong

33
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,260
have to take an oath of office.

34
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,260
And of of course,

35
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,480
it must be done sincerely.

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,720
“Anyone should take the oath accurately,

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,800
solemnly and sincerely.”

38
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,410
But six of them made changes that…

39
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,460
“showed no respect to Hong Kong’s Basic
Law.”

40
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,530
So the Communist Party showed

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,630
just how sincerely they respect

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,210
Hong Kong’s Basic Law,

43
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,340
by disqualifying those lawmakers.

44
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,330
That’s right,

45
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,740
instead of asking them to retake the oath,

46
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,990
they kicked out them out,

47
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,070
even though they were properly elected.

48
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,630
I’m kidding of course.

49
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,470
It was the Hong Kong High Court

50
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,060
that made that decision.

51
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,490
Beijing totally, definitely,

52
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,920
had absolutely nothing to do with it.

53
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,290
Except for the part where Beijing

54
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,400
issued an “interpretation” of the Basic
Law

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,910
that said lawmakers should be disqualified

56
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,130
for taking oaths “in a manner which is

57
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,220
not sincere or not solemn,”

58
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,100
basically forcing the courts to kick them
out.

59
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,120
Two legislators were expelled back in November

60
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,590
and the other four on July 14.

61
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,629
So how did these no-good elected officials

62
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,840
take their oaths?

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,299
Well, Nathan Law added a quote from Gandhi

64
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,209
before he gave the oath.

65
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,960
You can never imprison my mind?

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,319
That’s very insincere.

67
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,530
I mean, he’s pretending not to know

68
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,390
that Chinese labor camps have had

69
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,939
brain-imprisoning technology for years.

70
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,409
With the loss of these six seats

71
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,390
in the Hong Kong Legislature,

72
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,090
it means the pro-democracy lawmakers

73
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,069
won’t be able to veto the other

74
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,400
40 more-or-less pro-Beijing lawmakers.

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
And lot of Hong Kongers are scared

76
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,690
that Beijing will eventually show

77
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,769
just how sincerely it respects

78
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,519
Hong Kong’s Basic Law,

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
by issuing an “interpretation” that the
Communist Party

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,340
should take over Hong Kong entirely.

81
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
In other news,

82
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,150
India and China might be getting ready

83
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,560
to have a war.

84
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Again.

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
Only unlike the one they fought in 1962,

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,600
now, both countries have nuclear weapons!

87
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,639
Yes, we might have a good old-fashioned

88
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,280
war between two nuclear powers.

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,379
Which has never happened before.

90
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,410
Except for the 1999 Kargil War

91
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,400
between India and Pakistan.

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,530
Which was over a border dispute.

93
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,079
But not to worry,

94
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,139
this latest conflict between India and China
is...

95
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,739
also over a border dispute.

96
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,620
My favorite state-run media the Global Times

97
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,650
is saying war is on the table.

98
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,359
Indian media have reported the government

99
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,670
gave a go-ahead for the emergency purchase

100
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,810
of weapons for a “short, intense war.”

101
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,810
Not a specific one,

102
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,290
but just in general.

103
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,310
The issue centers around a border dispute
here.

104
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,599
The Chinese military has been doing

105
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,999
live fire drills in nearby Tibet,

106
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,909
which resulted in rumors of Indian casualties.

107
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,480
Though both sides deny that.

108
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,529
But there are reportedly troops along the
border.

109
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,510
This is not looking good.

110
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,010
Can we get Xi Jinping to maybe watch Dangal
again?

111
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,969
We’ll have more on this as it develops.

112
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,419
And over to Southern China,

113
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,819
where the region has been suffering

114
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,650
from heavy flooding.

115
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,139
Dozens have died and the damage is widespread.

116
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,040
This really is a terrible tragedy.

117
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,920
But, if you’d like to offer any prayers
or words of support,

118
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,390
just be sure you don’t include candle

119
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,420
or prayer hand emojis on your Weibo posts.

120
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,620
Because the government banned them.

121
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,870
That’s because people were using those emojis

122
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,620
on Weibo when they were talking about

123
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,920
the recent death of Chinese human rights lawyer

124
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,700
Liu Xiaobo.

125
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Just be careful though.

126
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,980
Apparently, some people think the prayer emoji

127
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,440
is actually a high five.

128
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,740
So make sure people don’t think

129
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,790
you’re high fiving their terrible tragedy.

130
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,130
Because that would be insincere.

131
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,050
Speaking of crazy things the Communist Party

132
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,020
has banned—Pooh.

133
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,360
Winnie the Pooh.

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,630
If you searched for Winnie the Pooh

135
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,230
on Weibo last weekend,

136
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,630
you’d get a message saying

137
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,780
this content is illegal.

138
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,060
Wrapping your head around that

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,130
might be as difficult as stealing honey

140
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,080
from a hive of bees.

141
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,410
No official reason was given for the ban.

142
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,390
But here’s everyone’s best guess.

143
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,140
It’s not just China Uncensored

144
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,900
that has noticed a more than passing resemblance

145
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,010
between Chinese leader Xi Jinping

146
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,630
and everyone’s favorite Pooh bear.

147
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,320
Chinese neitzens have also noticed.

148
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Repeatedly.

149
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,740
For years.

150
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,770
Though the ban did happen

151
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,360
right after we made the comparison.

152
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,050
Maybe Xi Jinping watches China Uncensored.

153
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,010
He certainly does if you can trust China Uncensored’s

154
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,610
comment section.

155
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,610


156
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,710
Hey, wait a minute...

157
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,810
In any case, Xi,

158
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,110
if you are indeed watching,

159
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,050
you don’t need to feel threatened.

160
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,050
Just remember,

161
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,720
Pooh had a best friend named Christopher.

162
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
All in all,

163
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,370
the incident only spawned 230,000 news articles

164
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,730
about Xi Jinpooh.

165
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,740
I’m sure no one in China’s vast censorship
apparatus

166
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,300
is going to be fired over this.

167
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,620
Anyway, if you’ve been feeling concerned

168
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,190
about the obstruction, don’t worry:

169
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,870
Pooh has now been unblocked.

170
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,870
In other news,

171
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,970
according to a new survey by the Hurun Report,

172
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,270
half of China’s millionaires want to leave
China.

173
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,470
Remember that the next time

174
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,500
you hear about how great everything in China
is,

175
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,360
since as soon as people get some money in
China,

176
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,620
their first thought is to get out.

177
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,760
Why?

178
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,170
Well according to the report,

179
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,371
“Education and pollution are

180
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:18,190
driving China’s rich to emigrate.”

181
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,490
But also, 84% of those surveyed

182
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,640
are also worried that the government will

183
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,690
devalue the yuan.

184
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,220
So where do China’s rich want to go?

185
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,800
Apparently not to the UK.

186
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,770
Most want to move to the US.

187
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,020
Unlike those US businesses that want to move
to China.

188
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,360
Speaking of US companies,

189
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,580
the Chinese regime has laid out

190
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,470
some pretty scary new cyber security laws.

191
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,500
You see, they don’t like the idea

192
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,420
that Chinese user information

193
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,710
might be stored outside of China,

194
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,580
where they can’t get access to it.

195
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,340
So they’re requiring foreign companies

196
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,610
to store their data inside China.

197
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,090
That also gives the regime unprecedented access

198
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,750
to foreign companies’ technology.

199
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,300
And Apple has jumped on the bandwagon.

200
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,590
Well, it’s less of a bandwagon

201
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,470
and more of A TERRIBLE IDEA...WAGON!

202
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,400
But the Chinese regime has put a lot of pressure

203
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,210
on Apple over the years.

204
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,820
Banning iTunes Movies and iBooks for instance.

205
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,720
It’s not just Apple either.

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,140
The Chinese regime has also targeted Microsoft.

207
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,220
Now you’d think companies like Apple and
Microsoft

208
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,720
would get the hint.

209
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,400
But instead, they’re doubling down

210
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,590
on their China operations.

211
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,380
Apple jumps to comply with Chinese censors.

212
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,190
And now Microsoft is working with

213
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,800
the Chinese knockoff of Google, Baidu,

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,940
to make driverless cars.

215
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,380
Actually, driverless cars in China could actually
be

216
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,840
a big step to improve safety conditions

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,010
on the roads.

218
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,580
Especially since it only took a little tap

219
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,750
for this truck to turn all Last Action Hero.

220
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,060
Don’t worry, it was carrying paper.

221
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,230
No one was killed.

222
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,700
Thank goodness.

223
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
And don’t go anywhere,

224
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,880
we’ll be right back with a story

225
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,490
about a Chinese spy ship

226
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,280
that came a little too close for comfort

227
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,800
to US shores.

228
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Oh, Pooh! Are you watching on YouTube?

229
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,380
Did you know you can see the full half-hour episode

230
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,520
if you go to our website, ChinaUncensored.tv?

231
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,560
The most wonderful thing about Tigger

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,740
is that Tigger keeps himself educated about current events with China Uncensored.
