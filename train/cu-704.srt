1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,640
gun control?

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,759
To the Chinese regime,

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,700
that means using both hands...

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,530
to give guns to some of the world’s

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,700
worst violators of human rights.

7
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,480
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,310
Check out these guns!

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,180
Sorry, these guns.

11
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,780
They’re part of 22 million dollars worth
of guns and ammunition

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,490
the Chinese regime has just donated to the
Philippines.

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,950
The donation includes 3,000 assault rifles,

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,370
3 million rounds of assorted ammunition,

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,620
and 30 sniper scopes.

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,200
Look at those happy faces.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,770
You can almost hear him going,

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,540
“pew pew pew!”

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,560
Though it’s less funny

20
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,649
when you consider that the president of the
Philippines

21
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,230
has bragged about personally using guns

22
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,239
to kill people.

23
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,649
Now you may think 22 million dollars in weapons

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,500
isn’t all that much,

25
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
since you couldn’t even buy

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,630
one antique Chinese bowl with that!

27
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,900
But it’s just the latest in around 300 million
dollars,

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,330
“in military and disaster relief assistance

29
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,730
in a little over a year.”

30
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,940
And you could buy a lot of those antique bowls

31
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,630
with 300 million dollars.

32
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,690
Well, seven of them.

33
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,580
Plus 800 of these antique spoons.

34
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,110
The Chinese ambassador to the Philippines

35
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,040
Zhao Jianhua said the weapons deal was a sign
that,

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,800
“China is a sincere friend

37
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,140
and sincere partner [to the Philippines],

38
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,960
and will remain so forever.”

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
So why, you ask,

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,180
is China so generous with its arms?

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,360
Well, it actually follows a strategy

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,580
the Chinese Communist Party is using around
the world.

43
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,830
Buying friends with the the most loving gift
of all:

44
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,720
deadly weapons.

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Last year,

46
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,030
following concerns that Filipino President
Duterte’s

47
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,530
War on Drugs was devolving into

48
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,830
roving death squads killing loads of people

49
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,910
outside the law,

50
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,890
the United States blocked the sale

51
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,420
of 26,000 rifles.

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,570
But does the Chinese Communist Party care

53
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,190
whether the Philippines shoots

54
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,990
some piddly little drug dealers,

55
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,910
or people who may or may not be drug dealers?

56
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,880
Or users?

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,380
Or students?

58
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,700
No way!

59
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,140
That’s because

60
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,580
“China is vying to become Southeast Asia’s

61
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,140
primary weapons vendor.”

62
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,220
And the Chinese regime won’t have any strings
attached.

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,450
Strings like requiring the governments they
work with

64
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,370
to follow the rule of law or whatever.

65
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,770
The Pakistan government refuses to stop terrorists?

66
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,770
No problem!

67
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,800
The Chinese regime has sold their navy

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,110
$4 billion dollars worth of submarines.

69
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,100
The US condemns Myanmar for ethnic cleansing?

70
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
No worries,

71
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,930
“China is Myanmar’s biggest supplier of
weapons,

72
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,990
providing most of its fighter aircraft,

73
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,050
armoured vehicles,

74
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,980
guns and naval ships.”

75
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
In fact,

76
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,620
the top three buyers of Chinese weapons

77
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,130
are Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.

78
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,230
Look, the Chinese regime just sells the weapons.

79
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,410
What other governments do with them

80
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,480
is their own business.

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,970
Guns don’t kill people.

82
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,180
Oppressive regimes kill people.

83
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,740
With Chinese guns.

84
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,640
And it’s not just in Southeast Asia.

85
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,200
It’s the Middle East,

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Africa,

87
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,500
and Latin American as well.

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Last year,

89
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,780
an Iraqi drone strike accidentally killed
anti-ISIS fighters.

90
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,200
It was a Chinese drone.

91
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,319
In July,

92
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,810
Venezuela’s national guard chief said they
were,

93
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,660
“‘saving lives’ by using riot-control
gear

94
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,190
supplied by China

95
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,800
when confronting anti-government protests.”

96
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,310
Let’s look at that.

97
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
Clearly,

98
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,790
a lot of life-saving going on here.

99
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,620
China has been selling a variety of weaponry

100
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,069
to Caribbean and Latin American nations, too.

101
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,770
And when it comes to drones,

102
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,750
China wants to be part of a potentially

103
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,980
10 billion dollar market.

104
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,819
It’s this kind of sell-to-anybody attitude

105
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,340
that has put China in a position to battle
it out

106
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,060
for the world’s third-largest arms dealer.

107
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Of course,

108
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,940
as you can also see from this chart,

109
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,670
no one can come close to exporting as much
weapons

110
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,770
as the US and Russia.

111
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,790
But the US would never sell weapons

112
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,620
to countries with bad human rights records.

113
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,480
Maybe I should do America Uncensored.

114
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,910
But it’s still true that China

115
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,440
is a special kind of arms dealer.

116
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,890
China’s clients are countries,

117
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,190
“either too poor to buy Western or Russian
armaments,

118
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,019
or who are subjected to arms embargoes

119
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,400
(such as Venezuela).”

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,660
The US is at least more selective

121
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,630
about what countries it sells to,

122
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,740
and the stuff that’s made in America

123
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,810
is usually pretty good quality.

124
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
On the other hand,

125
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,440
most of what China sells is,

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,780
let’s just say it’s more on the

127
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,430
Robert Cop side of the spectrum.

128
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,460
Like that time China sold four brand new

129
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,190
attack helicopters to Cameroon.

130
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,120
And then “One of them crashed shortly after
delivery.”

131
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,600
Hmmm...

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,780
That’s not good.

133
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,620
Well, at least cheap Chinese weapons

134
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,760
have “become popular with warlords,

135
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
rebel groups

136
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,820
and militias around the world”.

137
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,160
Fortunately for the the buyers of Chinese
weapons,

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,030
the quality of made-in-China is getting better.

139
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,550
Like that CH-4 drone that

140
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,720
“experts believe...was engineered using
information

141
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,870
stolen from U.S. defense contractors.”

142
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,600
Intellectual property theft?

143
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,470
We should take it as a compliment that

144
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,530
America’s killing machines are so good,

145
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,470
China wants them too.

146
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,790
And as long as there are countries

147
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,630
who don’t mind pointing guns at their own
citizens,

148
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,040
the Chinese Communist Party will be there

149
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,949
to make sure they have the guns to do it.

150
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,120
And if no one wants to buy them,

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,990
China will donate them.

152
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,080
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

153
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,370
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell,

154
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,760
see you next time.

155
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,200
Guns, guns, guns!

156
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,240
Git yer Chinese guns!

157
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,889
Shaky human rights record?

158
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,360
Extrajudicial killings?

159
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,520
No credit,

160
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
no problem!

161
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,800
The Chinese military has all the best knock-off
designs.

162
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,710
Guaranteed not to fall apart some of the time.

163
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,610
Buy yer weapons from China now!

164
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,800
