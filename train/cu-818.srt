1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,720
Chinese billionaire Jack Ma\h
has been hiding a dirty secret

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,160
And it involves a high level power struggle\h

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,240
within the Chinese Communist Party

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,720
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris\h
Chappell. And boy do I have a doozy of\h\h

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,160
an episode for you today. But remember,\h
YouTube is demonetizing us all the time.\h\h

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
The only reason I can bring you these\h
episodes is thanks to the support\h\h

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,920
of viewers like you on the crowdfunding website\h
Patreon. Head over to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored,\h\h

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
and for as little as a dollar an\h
episode, you can help me make this show.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
Now as you may remember,\h
one of China’s richest men,\h\h

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Jack Ma, disappeared for three months\h
after criticizing state regulators.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,840
Generally the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t\h
take criticism well. And during the time Ma was\h\h

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,920
“disappeared,” the Communist Party blocked\h
the IPO of Ma’s company Ant Financial.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
That IPO would have been worth\h
over 300 billion dollars.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,840
Now Ma has recently been\h
appearing in public again.\h

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,440
But it turns out there was much more to this\h
story than what was previously reported.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,400
The Party didn’t block Ant Financial’s IPO just\h
because Jack Ma criticized Chinese regulators.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,440
I mean, that didn’t help. But it was also\h
about a deadly battle for power between rival\h\h

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,760
factions within the Chinese Communist Party\h
itself. And you know what that means. It’s\h\h

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,240
time for another episode of everyone’s favorite\h
Communist Party soap opera, General Hostility.

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,840
Previously on General Hostility:
Chinese leader Xi Jinping\h\h

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,520
is locked in a desperate bid for power. His\h
enemies—a rival political faction tied to former\h\h

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,840
Chinese leader and human toad hybrid Jiang Zemin.\h
Jiang’s connections spread out like a spider web\h\h

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,840
throughout China, waiting to ensnare Xi\h
Jinping. And this time the bait...is an Ant.

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,760
That’s right, it turns out Jack Ma and Ant\h
Financial have some pretty close ties to\h\h

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Jiang Zemin’s faction. And that could be the real\h
reason Xi Jinping blocked Ant Financial’s IPO.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,240
Because according to the Wall Street\h
Journal, Xi personally blocked the IPO.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
You know, that time Jack Ma did a cringe-worthy\h
Michael Jackson impersonation on stage—turns\h\h

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
out, it wasn’t the most ill-advised\h
decision he’s ever made after all.\h\h

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,960
At least when he says that Billie\h
Jean is not his lover, I believe him.

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,480
Anyway, back to less disturbing topics,\h
like Communist Party factional infighting.\h\h

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
More than a dozen Chinese officials and government\h\h

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
advisers secretly spoke to the Wall\h
Street Journal for this article.\h

33
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,600
They told the Journal of “a previously\h
unreported central-government investigation”

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,360
...that found through an opaque\h
web of investment structures,\h\h

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,840
that some of Xi Jinping’s biggest enemies were\h
heavily invested in Ant Financial. And they all\h\h

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,840
stood to make billions of dollars from the IPO.\h
That is, until Xi Jinping (Corner Box) stopped it.

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,200
It turns out the grandson of\h
former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin,\h\h

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,760
Jiang Zhicheng, was a major\h
investor in Ant Financial.

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,720
But it was well hidden. But\h
I’ll uncover it after the break.

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:56,320
Welcome back. Jiang Zhicheng was a\h
major investor in Ant Financial—but\h\h

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:04,640
here’s how it was hidden. Jiang Zhicheng cofounded\h
a company called Boyu Capital. Then Boyu Capital\h\h

42
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,480
set up this subsidiary in Shanghai. Which then put\h
money into a private equity firm called Beijing\h\h

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,840
Jingguan Investment Center. And it was that\h
company that finally invested in Ant Financial.

44
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,440
It’s like six degrees of Kevin\h
Bacon, but with investment firms\h\h

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,840
that funnel millions of dollars\h
to China’s corrupt elite.\h

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,720
The Beijing Jingguan investment firm eventually\h
got “a nearly 1% stake in the company,\h\h

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,640
according to Ant’s IPO document, putting\h
it among its top 10 shareholders.”

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,320
However, in Ant Financial’s official documents,\h\h

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,960
there’s no mention of how Beijing Jingguan\h
relates to Jiang Zhicheng or his other companies.

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,840
But it turns out Jack Ma and\h
Jiang Zhicheng go way back.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,880
In fact, Jiang Zhicheng played a big role\h
in making Jack Ma one of China’s richest\h\h

52
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,720
men. It has to do with a deal that gave Ma more\h
control over another company Ma created, Alibaba.

53
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,800
Back in 2012, Zhicheng led a\h
group of some of China’s biggest\h\h

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,080
state-linked investment firms to help Ma\h
buy out half of Yahoo’s stake in Alibaba.

55
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
And that chunk of Alibaba, “soared in value when\h\h

56
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
the company listed on the New York\h
Stock Exchange two years later.”

57
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,240
So a lot of people tied to Jiang Zemin\h\h

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,840
made a lot of money. But the connections between\h
Ma and Jiang Zemin go beyond Jiang’s grandson.\h

59
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,560
I’ll tell you more after the commercial break.

60
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,440
Welcome back.

61
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,560
Why did Xi Jinping block the IPO of Ant Financial?\h
According to the Chinese officials who secretly\h\h

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,160
spoke to the Wall Street Journal, Xi Jinping\h
had little interest in having the Ant IPO\h\h

63
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,880
funnel enormously lucrative financial\h
stakes to his political enemies.

64
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,200
And it was much more than just Jiang Zhicheng,\h
the grandson of former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

65
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,680
Also secretly invested in Ant Financial was the\h
son-in-law of a powerful retired Party official\h\h

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,120
in Jiang Zemin’s faction. This is Jia Qinglin.\h
He’s a former member of the Politburo Standing\h\h

67
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,600
Committee, the most powerful group of men in\h
China. He was very close with Jiang Zemin.\h

68
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Well, Jia Qinglin’s son-in-law is Li Botan.\h
He controls the Beijing Zhaode Investment\h\h

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,280
Group. And through a series of different\h
companies, he invested big in Ant Financial.

70
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,920
This is not the first time Li Botan and\h
Xi Jinping have gone to blows either.\h\h

71
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:05,120
Li owned a fancy private club for Communist Party\h
elite called the Maotai Club. Xi was not a fan.

72
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,360
“Events like those held by Mr. Li’s Maotai Club\h
were seen by [Xi Jinping] as harmful to the party.\h\h

73
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,200
‘You people, you either eat and\h
drink yourselves into the grave,\h\h

74
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,880
or die between the sheets,’ he said at a meeting\h
with senior officials earlier in his tenure.”

75
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,520
Somehow I get the feeling Xi just\h
wasn’t invited to the parties.

76
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,760
But these kinds of complicated political\h
connections are just how business is done\h\h

77
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,680
in China’s corrupt system. China’s\h
economy may look like capitalism,\h\h

78
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,640
but it’s not a free market. It’s actually\h
under heavy Communist Party control.

79
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,280
It wasn’t just people tied to the Jiang faction\h
that got rich through investing in Ant Financial.\h\h

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,560
Plenty of other rich and powerful Chinese\h
elite also had a stake. And Ma also\h\h

81
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,640
encouraged investment from Chinese state-run\h
investment funds, too. Which was a smart move.\h

82
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,880
See, Jack Ma\hbecame successful, not\h
through his ideas and hard work alone.\h\h

83
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,520
No, he was only able to make\h
it because in the process,\h\h

84
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,920
he made well-connected Party leaders rich as well.\h
He was able to avoid a lot of regulatory pressure\h\h

85
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,960
on Ant Financial by giving state backed companies\h
and powerful individuals a stake in the company.

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,680
“Having such ‘strategic investors’ on\h
board—all poised to profit from the IPO—helped\h\h

87
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,480
Ant’s stock-listing application\h
sail through various levels of\h\h

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,200
securities regulators last summer...The\h
application was approved in a month.”

89
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Of course, if you find yourself on\h
the wrong side of a power struggle,\h\h

90
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,280
those same connections end up hurting you.\h
The Chinese Communist Party can take away\h\h

91
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,520
the promise of a free market based on\h
its political whims. That’s because\h\h

92
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,160
it was never a free market in the first place.\h
It was always Party controlled. And it can\h\h

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,200
also take away your personal freedom,\h
and make you vanish anytime it wants.

94
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,080
Now, I’m not saying that Jack Ma and Ant\h
Financial’s connections to the Jiang faction\h\h

95
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
are the only reason that Xi\h
Jinping blocked Ant’s IPO.\h

96
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
From the Chinese regime’s point of view, there\h
were other problems, like the fact that Ant\h\h

97
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Financial was making money from people’s data\h
but not sharing that data with the government.

98
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
And it was making loans and selling financial\h
products without having to meet the same\h\h

99
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,760
requirements as a bank. Basically, it could\h
make money off of financial transactions,\h\h

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,040
while state-run banks actually supplied the\h
money for the loans and took on most of the risk.

101
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
So if people couldn’t pay back\h
those Ant Financial loans,\h\h

102
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,080
it’s actually the state-run\h
banks that would be in trouble.\h

103
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,320
But adding the fact that the\h
Ant Financial IPO would enrich\h\h

104
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,480
the close relatives of his political enemies,\h\h

105
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,400
well I’m just going to guess that cancelling it\h
wasn’t a really hard decision for Xi Jinping.

106
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,840
In any case, the situation with Ant Financial\h
shows pretty clearly all of the deeply entrenched\h\h

107
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,440
ways that Chinese Communist Party officials\h
and their relatives are getting rich in China.\h\h

108
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,080
But what will the aftermath be?\h

109
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Chinese leader Xi Jinping stopped his enemies\h
from getting rich quick. Well, from getting even\h\h

110
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,640
richer, quick. And China’s highest paid Michael\h
Jackson impersonator got burned in the process.\h\h

111
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,600
So what happens next? Will the Jiang faction try\h
to get back at Xi Jinping for making them less\h\h

112
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,520
rich? Will they try to get rid of Xi entirely?\h
Find out next time, on General Hostility.

113
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,800
And now, as a thank you to everyone who’s\h
joined the China Uncensored 50 cent Army\h\h

114
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,200
and supports China Uncensored on Patreon,\h
I’ll answer one of their questions.

115
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,800
Today’s question comes from Lunar Worx\h
“Hey Chris, what does Matt do off screen?\h\h

116
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,680
Is he there for comic relief, or just\h
to do all your top secret research?”

117
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
Oh that’s a good question Lunar Worx. Obviously I\h
can’t mention all the top secret stuff Matt does.\h\h

118
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
Or it wouldn’t be top secret.\h

119
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
But Matt does a lot for the show.\h
Why, he’s recording me right now.\h\h

120
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,400
He also helps manage our team and\h
keeps everything running smoothly.\h\h

121
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,440
About the only thing he doesn’t do is help\h
water the plants. That’s my job. And of course,\h\h

122
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,680
he’s the one we make watch things like the Hunter\h
Biden sex tapes. And we all know how that went.

123
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,640
He’s sacrificed a lot for this show.\h

124
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
So thank you Lunar Worx and all the 50 Cent Army\h\h

125
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,040
for supporting the show. So we can\h
make Matt do all kinds of things.

126
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
