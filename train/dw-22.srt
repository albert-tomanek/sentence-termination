1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,660
Let's switch it on.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,660
Let's see what it does.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,769
Through this coil of thick wire, we're about
to pass a huge alternating electric current.

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,490
On top is a 1 kg aluminium plate.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,259
So we hear that noise.

6
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,580
What's that noise?

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:29,100
It's the vibration of the plate, because it's
vibrating at two times the frequency of this

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
one.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Woah!

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
Woooaaaahhhhhhh!!

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
hahaha, how does it do that?

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,100
It's magical

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,100
To find out, I've come to the place where
it all started - The Royal Institution in

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
London

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,120
This is the key to Faraday's magnetic lab.

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,860
It's amazing that the lock still works.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,719
From the 1870's on this became a store room,
which is why it survived and it survived intact,

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,100
all the joinery giant electromagnet are exactly
the same as Faraday left it.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,130
So this is exactly as Faraday would have had
it.

20
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,130
That's right, yup.

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,690
In Faraday's time it was known that electric
current creates a magnetic field, but it remained

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,559
an open question whether the reverse is possible
-- if a magnetic field could generate electric

23
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,930
current.

24
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,160
Faraday answered this question with his most
famous apparatus.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,970
Faraday's electromagnetic induction ring.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,760
Which is this.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,330
In August, 1831 Faraday wrapped two coils
of insulated wire around this iron ring.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,070
But in 1831 you could not go down to your
local electrical hardware shop and ask for

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,230
x hundred meters of insulated wire, you had
to insulate the wire as you went.

30
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,320
So as you pushed and pulled the wire in and
out of the ring you had to insulate it.

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,180
It takes 10 working days, which was a huge
investment of time.

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,070
But the investment paid off.

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,560
When Faraday connected a battery to one of
the coils, he saw a brief pulse of current

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,580
in the other coil.

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,000
And when he disconnected the battery, he saw
a pulse of current in the other direction.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,490
He realized that current was induced in the
second coil only when the magnetic field through

37
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,490
it was changing.

38
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,520
And if they hadn't been wrapped on the same
ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,790
coils repel each other when the current is
induced and that's due to the interaction

40
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,500
of their magnetic fields.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,450
Which brings us back to this.

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,740
Through the bottom coil we are passing a huge
electric current: 800A which alternates in

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,640
direction 900 times per second.

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,890
This ensures there will always be a changing
magnetic field above the coil.

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,480
Instead of a second coil we're using the Aluminium
plate, but the principle is the same, the

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,230
changing magnetic field induces currents in
the plate that create an opposing magnetic

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,140
field -- so it levitates.

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,660
How awesome is that?!

49
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,170
This current is not only good for levitating
the plate.

50
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,950
It can also make lightbulbs glow.

51
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,950
A gift.

52
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,110
Uh, thank you.

53
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,110
Oh.

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,110
That is cool.

55
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,250
Not too close because it will burn the lamps.

56
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,530
Can I put it there?

57
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,530
Yeah.

58
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,720
And just as current in a toaster element heats
it up, the induced current in the plate dissipates

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,740
its energy as heat.

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,230
And some water too
Thank you.

61
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,900
Yeah to see the temperature.

62
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,960
Check out how hot this plate is.

63
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,270
Oh, that is nuts!

64
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,170
Is this your favorite demo?

65
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,650
It's a flying BBQ or something

66
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,450
Tell me this is not the best dinner table
centerpiece.

67
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,010
It levitates, gives you light, and you can
cook on it. and all the while you're demonstrating

68
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:45,510
Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction.
