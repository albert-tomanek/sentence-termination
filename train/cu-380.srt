00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,969
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:02,709
Finally!

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,240
Election coverage America cares about

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,920
and doesn't involved Donald Trump!

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,260
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored I'm your host
Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,700
Chinese voters on Saturday elected a new president:

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,130
Tsai Ing-wen!

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,360
And by Chinese voters,

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,200
I mean the people of Taiwan.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,680
Not the people living in the other China,

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,270
the one without elections

12
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,280
even though their leader is still called the
"president" for some reason.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,689
Still waiting for that interview, by the way.

14
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,590
Now sure, Taiwan has a democracy.

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,960
But according to my favorite Chinese state-run
media Global Times,

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
"the 'one person, one vote' system in Taiwan
is not mature."

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,390
By which, I assume, they mean

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,960
it's less mature than mainland China's

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,210
"one person, no vote" system.

20
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,489
Clearly superior.

21
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,239
Anyway, not only did Tsai Ing-wen win Taiwan's
election by a pretty big margin,

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,950
her party, the DPP, also took 60 percent of
the seats in parliament.

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,860
The opposing KMT party,

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,609
which has been leading Taiwan for the last
eight years,

25
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:07,799
suffered a big defeat.

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,229
Now the US government has been watching this
election closely

27
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,749
because US-Taiwan relations are,

28
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:18,630
let's say, politically sensitive with respect
to mainland China.

29
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,659
Tsai Ing-wen's party, the DPP,

30
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,369
is known for taking a more pro-independence
stance.

31
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:28,649
That is, asserting that Taiwan is not just
another province of China,

32
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,889
but its own sovereign entity.

33
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:33,469
You can learn more about that issue here.

34
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,369
The Communist Party,

35
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,119
in no subtle terms,

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,219
disagrees with this stance.

37
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,740
The Chinese Communist Party has hundreds of
missiles aimed at Taiwan and has promised

38
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,419
to use force to take back the island if it
declares independence.

39
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,280
They even held Taiwan invasion training drills
last year.

40
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,189
Global Times, always the rational voice,

41
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,310
responded to Tsai's election by saying any
pushes for independence were mere "hallucinations"

42
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,590
and that if she were to "cross the red line
of cross-Straits relations, she will meet

43
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,239
a dead end."

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,750
Hopefully that's just a poor choice of words,

45
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,220
and not a thinly veiled death threat.

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,770
But you can understand why Tsai's election
could be upsetting to the Communist Party.

47
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,130
The outgoing political party, the KMT

48
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,460
has for the past eight years pushed for closer
ties with mainland China.

49
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,700
They signed an important trade agreement,

50
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,140
encouraged cross-straight tourism,

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,100
and made it easier for mainland companies
to invest in Taiwan and vice versa.

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,470
Now Tsai hasn't exactly been against ties
with mainland China.

53
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,790
Her China policy has just been intentionally
vague.

54
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,540
So will Tsai push for Taiwan independence?

55
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,420
And will that mean the Communist Party will
invade Taiwan,

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,940
forcing the US to fulfill its promise to come
to Taiwan's defense

57
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,490
sparking the deadliest US military conflict
in Asia since the Vietnam war?

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,780
No.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,060
No, that's not going to happen.

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,040
Less than 10 percent of Taiwan's citizens
actually want Taiwan to declare independence.

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,540
The great majority want to preserve the status
quo:

62
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,360
That is, just leave it in the current, sort
of awkward state.

63
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
So if Tsai is smart

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,360
and by all accounts she is

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
she's going to go with... status quo.

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,540
Understandably, though, the US is concerned
that even without a war,

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,930
there could be some rocky relations with mainland
China.

68
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,140
When relations are smooth,

69
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,080
the US can free up its resources to deal withall the other rocky relations the US is involved with.

70
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,210
But even smooth relations, wellâ€¦

71
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,200
the Communist Party has a plan for that, too.

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,050
As the Communist Party worked with the KMT
to build stronger economic ties,

73
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,600
Taiwan has become increasingly dependant on
mainland China.

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,360
Case in point:

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,040
Taiwanese born singer Chou Tzu-yu,

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,630
member of the K-pop group Twice.

77
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,880
During her appearance on a variety show on
South Korean TV,

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,150
she waived the Taiwan flag.

79
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,180
Then Chinese people,

80
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,660
including possibly the same type of 50-cent
commentators who write pro-CCP things on my

81
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,980
YouTube channel,

82
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,680
were upset. Outraged, in fact.

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,440
How dare she wave the official Taiwan flag...

84
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,780
while in Korea?

85
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,880
Long story short,

86
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,260
after a media firestorm,

87
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,770
Chou was forced to apologize.

88
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,329
And now she's taking a break from performing
in China so she can, you know,

89
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,029
reflect seriously on her actions.

90
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:28,599
Many think her Korean management company JYP
Entertainment felt this apology was necessary to,

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,220
you guessed it,

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,009
preserve their access to the Chinese market.

93
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,000
So suffice it to say,

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,900
Cross-Strait relations are complicated.

95
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,280
Nobody wants war.

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,580
But a lot of people on both sides don't like
the way things are.

97
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,099
And the CCP is using economics to control
Taiwan.

98
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,120
In other words, Tsai's got her work cut out
for her.

99
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,380
But Beijing wouldn't be wise to underestimate
her.

100
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:56,860
A leaked US embassy cable called her, "extremely
capable and very persuasive."

101
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,789
Plus she likes cats.

102
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,449
And we know how dangerous cats are.

103
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,539
So what do you think is next for Taiwan?

104
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,520
Do you think Taiwan should be independent?

105
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,080
Leave your comments below and

106
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:11,840
Oh hey, what's this?

107
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
How did this get here?

108
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,880
Anyway, thanks for watching this episode of
China Uncensored,

109
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,529
once again I'm Chris Chappell, see you next
time.

110
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,640
"There is only one China.

111
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,499
The two shores are one.

112
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:29,680
I apologize for hurting the feelings of the
Chinese people with my reckless actions.

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,240
I will reflect on this seriously."

114
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:36,290
Can I go now?
