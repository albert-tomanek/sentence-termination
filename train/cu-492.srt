1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,259
the pettiest fight you'll see on the internet

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,259
all day.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,140
And that's saying something.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,800
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,750
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,200
Meet Yang Shuping.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,510
She was this year's student commencement
speaker

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,740
at the University of Maryland.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,380
And it's no wonder why.

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,840
When she came to the United States

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,130
five years ago,

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,410
she didn't speak a word of English.

14
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,800
She just graduated with a double major

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,650
in psychology and theater,

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,590
with a minor in German.

17
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,750
And to top it off,

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,230
she now speaks fluent English.

19
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,280
Now you would think,

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,340
this would be a proud moment

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,660
for Chinese international students.

22
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,660
One of their own,

23
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,810
singled out for achievement

24
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,010
at an American University.

25
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,810
Except, when she had the spotlight,

26
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,710
she said some things about the differences

27
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,430
between China and the United States

28
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,700
that were a little controversial.

29
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,239
It involved a student production

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,780
of a play about the beating

31
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,829
of Rodney King

32
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,960
and the LA riots of 1992.

33
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,170
The student actors were openly talking

34
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,159
about racism, sexism, and politics.

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,640
I was shocked.

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,329
I never thought such topics

37
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,320
could be discussed openly.

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,289
I have always had a burning desire

39
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:22,119
to tell these kinds of stories,

40
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,459
but I was convinced that only authorities

41
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,520
owned the narrative.

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
Only authorities could define the Truth.

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,869
You know, I applaud Ms. Yang

44
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,259
for tackling some big topics in her speech.

45
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,119
Of course, it's not quite as good

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,360
as my own commencement speech.

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,630
Which was about how as we go on,

48
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,709
we remember all the times we had together,

49
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,289
and about the importance of wearing sunscreen,

50
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,849
and also staying hungry and foolish.

51
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,990
It was a pretty great speech.

52
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,630
But back to Ms. Yang's speech.

53
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,139
Here was her key point:

54
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:06,419
Freedom is oxygen. Freedom is passion.

55
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,060
And then Chinese internet users

56
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,390
around the world exploded.

57
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,390
And believe me,

58
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,989
those were the more polite comments.

59
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,210
THEY WERE HARD TO FIND!

60
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,720
The speech also went viral on Weibo,

61
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,489
the Chinese version of Twitter.

62
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,950
The common theme was that she

63
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,879
shouldnt come back to China.

64
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,319
State-run media had a field day,

65
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,209
with article after article accusing her

66
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,870
of belittling and degrading China...

67
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,019
...and even worse,

68
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,390
convicted her of the worst crime imaginable:

69
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,189
being deemed unpatriotic

70
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:41,730
by cyber public opinion.

71
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,640
Wow. Unpatriotic?

72
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,230
That was way harsh,

73
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,280
cyber public opinion.

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,790
This is what China's Foreign Ministry spokesman

75
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,390
Lu Kang had to say.

76
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,830
Finish her!

77
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,989
Sorry, wrong clip.

78
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:01,230
This is what Lu Kang actually said.

79
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,900
As long as in the end

80
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,260
they still ardently love their motherland,

81
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,409
and are willing to make contributions for
her,

82
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,329
I believe that the Chinese government

83
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,189
will encourage, support and welcome it."

84
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:14,620
You see, as long as you wholeheartedly love

85
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,280
the Chinese Communist Party,

86
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,860
and do anything for it,

87
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,250
the Communist party will encourage

88
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,390
and welcome it.

89
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,260
I think that was what he was saying?

90
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,930
People always ask me

91
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,290
why did you come to the University of Maryland?

92
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,819
I always answer:

93
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,780
fresh air.

94
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,950
The air was so sweet and fresh

95
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,269
and utterly luxurious.

96
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:45,390
I was surprised by this.

97
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,870
I grew up in a city in China

98
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,760
where I had to wear a face mask

99
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,889
every time I went outside,

100
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,830
otherwise I might get sick.

101
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,579
However, the moment I inhaled and exhaled

102
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,060
outside the airport,

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,560
I felt free.

104
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,060
What happened?

105
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,579
Is attacking someone for a speech

106
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,280
on the other side of the world

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,160
somehow supposed to convince people

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
that China doesn't have a problem

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
with freedom of speech?

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For more on this,

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,280
I'm joined by China Uncensored's

112
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,790
resident Chinese person,

113
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,870
Shelley Zhang.

114
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,870
Shelley?

115
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,140
Hi, Chris.

116
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,810
Now Shelley, I know that talking about

117
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,350
freedom of speech in China can be a big deal.

118
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,690
But Yang Shuping was speaking in America.

119
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,050
Why are people so upset?

120
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,600
They weren't complaining about what she said

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
about freedom of speech.

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
They weren't?

123
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,050
They didn't get mad because she said

124
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,870
democracy and freedom are the fresh air

125
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,210
worth fighting for?

126
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,020
No, they were mad because she mentioned

127
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,710
a different kind of fresh air.

128
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,050
Hold on.

129
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,220
Chinese netizens are upset

130
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,720
that she complained about air pollution

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,030
in China?

132
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,220
Yep.

133
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,990
Chinese people aren't seriously denying

134
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,520
there's a pollution problem, right?

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,871
Well, let's let state-run CGTN America

136
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,360
explain it.

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,210
Some bashed her for degrading China,

138
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,870
while others accused her of telling outright
lies

139
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,960
about her hometown Kunming,

140
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,440
a city in China's southwest Yunnan province

141
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,970
known for its beautiful scenery

142
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,280
and good air.

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,190
Wow, Chinese state-run television's

144
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,590
use of promotional video

145
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,600
really gets across how beautiful Kunming is.

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,320
So the argument is,

147
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,050
yeah, well...pollution isn't really

148
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,220
that bad in that one city.

149
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,340
And I guess that if she's lying

150
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,040
about the air quality in Kunming,

151
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,620
that proves she's a lying liar

152
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,690
who lies about China in general.

153
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,170
And to prove how out of touch Shuping is,

154
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,510
the local Chinese Students and Scholars Association

155
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,790
got together a group to talk

156
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,330
about how much they love China.

157
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,460
What did they come up with?

158
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
This.

159
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,900
We are students from University of Maryland.

160
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,670
We are proud of China.

161
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,760
Nothing says freedom of thought

162
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,580
like a group of people reciting

163
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,110
a prepared speech that someone else wrote.

164
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,680
Well, then there was a video

165
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
of individual testimonials

166
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,380
from Chinese students.

167
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,950
Although we know that the US

168
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,640
is a very free speaking country,

169
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,510
80% of what Shuping Yang said today

170
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,890
were deceptions and lies.

171
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,800
And then it goes into a montage

172
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,370
of Chinese students talking about

173
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,370
how nice their own hometowns are

174
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,280
and that they never had to wear facemasks
there.

175
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,230
Well, that's...a good Chinese tourism video,

176
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,080
but it doesn't prove that Yang Shuping was
lying

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,740
about wearing a facemask.

178
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,050
What if she has asthma?

179
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,340
Or overprotective parents.

180
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,340
And interesting note,

181
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,700
although Kunming is today considered

182
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,550
one of the best air quality cities in China,

183
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,550
five years ago,

184
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,550
when Shuping left,

185
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,550
it did not meet China's

186
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,790
national air quality standards.

187
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,730
But to do an in-depth investigation

188
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,470
into whether Kunming has great air,

189
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,510
state-run Xinhua News did

190
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,730
an hour-long livestream on Twitter

191
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,240
where they repeatedly stopped people

192
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,310
on the street to ask if they

193
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,930
ever wore facemasks.

194
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,310
That's the hard-hitting journalism

195
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,960
I expect from Xinhua.

196
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,080
But this whole things seems like

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,320
kind of an overreaction.

198
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,810
Well Chris, I do have to say that I understand
where the Chinese students are coming from.

199
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,810
Really?

200
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,080
Sure. I came from China as a kid. I was the
only Chinese kid in my class. I loved Chinese

201
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,350
culture. I wanted Chinese sports teams to
win. I was proud of being Chinese. It was

202
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,250
either that or just be hurt everytime kids
made ching chong noises at me.

203
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,970
So you're saying that the Chinese students
were justified.

204
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,840
No, I'm saying I understand why they feel
hurt

205
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,650
and why they want their Chinese identity

206
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,390
to be respected.

207
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,390
But then they took that

208
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,520
and went so far into left field

209
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,840
they can't even see the ballpark anymore.

210
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,740
There's an obsession with national pride

211
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,150
that's frankly a little unhealthy.

212
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,150
Popular phrases like

213
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,500
"You're nothing without your motherland."

214
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,060
So people are mad at her because

215
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,490
she was being ungrateful

216
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,930
to her motherland?

217
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,280
Well, making the motherland look bad.

218
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,150
But really, Shuping is not the one

219
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,130
making China look bad right now.

220
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,060
The extreme reactions from Chinese people

221
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,250
are keeping this story in the headlines,

222
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,660
and it's making us look weird.

223
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,790
I mean, Chinese netizens

224
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,390
publicly bullied this girl into shutting down

225
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,950
all of her social media accounts

226
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,710
and abjectly apologizing for using

227
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,000
an air quality metaphor

228
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,740
to talk about her love of individual freedoms.

229
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Should we be proud of this?

230
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,640
Is the motherland triumphant,

231
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,870
now that this one voice

232
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,510
has been squashed?

233
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,980
This type of nationalistic anger

234
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,830
that won't be satisfied until someone

235
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,420
is made an example of

236
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,750
is an unfortunate legacy

237
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,730
of the Chinese Communist Party.

238
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,150
But here's what Shuping really did wrong.

239
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,430
And some of the criticisms of her

240
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,210
even say this bluntly.

241
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,620
She can feel the way she wants to

242
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,219
about freedom and democracy

243
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,221
and how great it is to be able to express

244
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,070
individual viewpoints.

245
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,780
Or even how crappy the air is in Kunming.

246
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,260
She just isn't supposed say it out loud.

247
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Publicly.

248
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,390
So your opinion is fine

249
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,170
as long as you don't express it.

250
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,550
Wait, aren't you concerned about

251
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,840
getting attacked for expressing that publicly?

252
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,180
Chris, I fully expect the flamewar

253
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,250
in the comments section

254
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,380
to burn brighter than the sun.

255
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,390
Well, if there's one piece of advice

256
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,750
I could give you, Shelley,

257
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,040
it would be:

258
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,310
Wear sunscreen.

259
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,310
So what do you think about

260
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,460
what Shuping Yang said

261
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,800
and the reaction?

262
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,850
Leave your comments below.

263
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,850
Once again,

264
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,110
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

265
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,220
See you next time.
