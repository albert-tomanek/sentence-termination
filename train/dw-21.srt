1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In my outer electron shell

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Lies an electron all by itself

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I seek elation

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Through oxidation

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have always felt incomplete

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
One electron shy of eighteen

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I’ve the highest

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Electron affinity

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If we exchange this one electron

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We’ll both achieve noble gas config’ration

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And we’ll release energy

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
As ions you’ll see

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A bond

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Made by metals and non-metals

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I’m positive

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I’m negative

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A force of attraction creates this bond

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Made by metals and non-metals

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ionic bonds

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Covalent bonds

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Metallic, these are the bonds of chemistry

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The octet rule says atoms like eight

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Electrons in their outermost state.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I’ll share mine with you

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I’ll share with you

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If we both share these six electrons

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We’ll both achieve noble gas config’ration

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And we’ll release energy

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Covalent there’ll be

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A Bond

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Electronegativity

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is similar for non-metals

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And so,we share this bond of electrons

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Electronegativity

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ionic Bonds

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Covalent Bonds

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Metallic,these are the bonds of chemistry

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Free

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Electrons all around

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Mutual attractive forces abound

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In this way

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will stay

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Crystalline with you

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Our Bond

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ionic bonds

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Covalent bonds

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Metallic
00:03:52,00:03:02
These are the bonds of chemistry
