1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,600
China sails into disputed Japanese\h
waters to intimidate a fishing boat.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,680
The NBA sells out to China even more.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,600
And France... doesn’t surrender?

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,040
That and more on this week’s China news headlines!

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,760
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,880
Japan says China is once again sailing near\h
disputed islands in the East China Sea.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,960
And by once again, I mean, “It\h
marked the 21st time this year that\h\h

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
Chinese boats have entered Japanese waters.”

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,920
This time was more aggressive though. Chinese\h
Coast Guard ships sailed near the Senkaku\h\h

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,760
Islands—which China calls the Diaoyu Islands—and\h
tried to approach a Japanese fishing boat. So\h\h

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,000
then the Japanese Coast Guard came out to protect\h
the fishing boat. This lasted more than two days.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,400
“It is the longest period\h
Chinese vessels have intruded\h\h

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,880
in the waters since the Japanese government put\h
the islets under state control in September 2012.”

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,040
Time to build those Gundams!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,880
It’s not quite a Gundam, but Japan has just\h
unveiled a new three thousand ton submarine.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
To defend itself against no country in particular.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
It just happens to come “amid China’s\h
growing assertiveness in the region”.

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Coincidence, I’m sure.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
You may have watched the US vice\h
presidential debate last week.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
And I think most Americans would agree,\h\h

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
it was at least easier to watch than\h
the US presidential debate in September.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
But it was not easier to watch in China.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
When Pence was responding\h
to the question on China,\h\h

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,120
CNN's signal went dark in mainland\h
China while Pence was saying China\h\h

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,680
was to blame for the pandemic. The signal only\h
returned when Kamala Harris began answering.

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,840
To be clear, that was China\h
blocking the CNN broadcast,\h\h

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,520
not CNN censoring the broadcast on\h
behalf of China. I’m pretty sure.

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Speaking of the US, you might remember an\h
episode we did back in August about how\h\h

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,040
Hong Kong’s Rich Corrupt Elite are\h
Screwed because of US sanctions.

30
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,480
I said at the time that things would get real when\h
US sanctions start targeting international banks.\h\h

31
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
The ones that do business with those\h
sanctioned Hong Kong officials.\h

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, things are about to get real.\h\h

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,320
The US State Department has issued a warning\h
to international financial institutions\h\h

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,360
that are still doing business with those officials\h
that they could soon face tough sanctions.

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
What kind of tough sanctions?\h\h

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Well banks could be facing “restrictions on U.S.\h
loans, foreign exchange, property transactions,\h\h

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,120
exports and transfers, in addition to\h
measures against their executives.”

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,080
Yeah if I were an executive at say,\h
HSBC, I would be worried right now.\h

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,360
Here’s a wild story. The Trump Administration has\h\h

40
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,600
been ramping up scrutiny of the Confucius\h
Institute, saying it’s an arm of Beijing.

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,320
Which is absurd. The Confucius\h
Institute is a *tentacle* of Beijing.

42
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
Anyway, an official for the Confucius\h
Institute at Webster University in Missouri\h\h

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
has been found dead.

44
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,800
Police haven’t given a cause of death.\h
However, it did follow a police investigation.

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:53,040
More specifically, the FBI searched his apartment\h
“amid a child pornography investigation”.

46
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,400
And that sure went in a different\h
direction than you were expecting.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,120
And maybe now you need a short break.
 Welcome back. If you think the Confucius\h\h

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
Institute is too beholden to the\h
Chinese state...how about the NBA?

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Mark Cuban, the richest shark on Shark Tank\h
and the owner of the Dallas Mavericks was on\h\h

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,840
the Megyn Kelly podcast. A decision I’m sure\h
he deeply regrets. Because she wanted to know,\h\h

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,800
why is it that the NBA will\h
tweet out silence is violence...

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
“Silence is violence.”

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,080
...while at the same time, the NBA has done\h
nothing to condemn human rights abuses in China?

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,160
After repeatedly dodging Kelly’s\h
question, Mark Cuban eventually said,\h\h

55
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,440
you know what, despite the genocide,\h
he’s fine doing business with China.\h

56
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,440
“Why would the NBA take $500 million-plus from\h
a country that is engaging in ethnic cleansing?\h

57
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
So basically you’re saying nobody\h
should do business with China ever.

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
Why don’t you just answer my question.

59
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,320
No! Megyn, I'm just trying\h
to get to the root of it.\h

60
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
Why would the NBA do that?\h
You are the one who said.

61
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,760
They are a customer. They are a customer\h
of ours. And guess what, Megyn? I’m okay\h\h

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,520
with doing business with China. You know, I\h
wish I could solve all the world’s problems,\h\h

63
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Megyn. I’m sure you do too. But we can’t.\h
And so we have to pick our battles.”

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,200
Huh, I wonder if the NBA calling out ethnic\h
cleansing in China instead of taking their money\h\h

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,720
would do anything to solve\h
some of the world’s problems.

66
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,440
But I think this was my favorite moment.

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,447
“Do you condemn the genocide\h
going on in China right now.\h

68
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,440
I condemn all human rights violations.\h

69
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
Why can't you be specific?\h

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,680
Yes. Because the way proclamations work\h
in this country, the minute you say them,\h\h

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
you're going to use it as a headline,\h
Cuban says this this and this.\h

72
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
What's wrong with that headline:\h
Cuban condemns ethnic cleansing?”

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
“Cuban condemns ethnic cleansing”\h
would have been a great headline.

74
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,440
Instead, the headline is “NBA’s Cuban:\h
Despite Genocide, China’s a Customer,\h\h

75
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
and I’m OK Doing Business With Them.”

76
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,880
But hey, good news. Chinese state-run media\h
has agreed to broadcast NBA games again.

77
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,360
That had stopped last year\h
after an NBA general manager\h\h

78
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
tweeted in support of protests in Hong Kong.\h

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,080
But the NBA has really gone out on a limb\h
since then to keep China as a customer.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:34,240
But China’s a tough customer to keep. And Korean\h
boy band BTS is finding that out the hard way.

81
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,960
They’re facing a boycott in China.\h

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,360
Because\h one of the members said something nice\h
about American and South Korean soldiers who\h\h

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,960
fought in the Korean War. Specifically he said,\h
“We need to always remember the history of pain\h\h

84
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,440
shared by the two nations, and\h
sacrifices of many men and women.”

85
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,640
But you see, inside of China, the Korean War\h
is called the “War to Resist U.S. Aggression\h\h

86
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,520
and Aid Korea.” Something you can also\h
learn about at the Confucius Institute.

87
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,640
And because of the BTS statement, a lot of\h
companies pulled a Mark Cuban—saying, hey\h\h

88
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,960
China’s our customer, we have to do business with\h
them. We can’t solve all the world’s problems.

89
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Hyundai removed ads featuring BTS\h
from Chinese social media outlets.\h

90
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,960
And Samsung pulled a BTS branded purple\h
smartphone from its stores and websites in China.\h

91
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,320
And the funny thing is, all this seems to have\h
started because of hissy fit thrown by my favorite\h\h

92
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times claiming\h
BTS hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.

93
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
I don’t know. I think the Chinese\h
people’s feelings will be hurt\h\h

94
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,200
more if they can’t get\h
their purple BTS smartphone.

95
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,040
And in this case, the Global\h
Times may have made a big mistake.\h\h

96
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,320
I for one would not want to\h
face off against the BTS ARMY.

97
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,240
And now it’s time for another short ad break.\h
Hopefully you’ll get an ad for a BTS smartphone.

98
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,640
Welcome back. BTS can’t solve China’s problems.\h
And apparently neither can the Vatican.

99
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,400
The Vatican is under fire for renewing\h
a deal with the Chinese Communist Party.

100
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,040
The deal allows the officially atheist Chinese\h
Communist Party to appoint catholic bishops in\h\h

101
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,720
China—although the text of the\h
deal has not been made public.\h\h

102
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,600
It’s unclear exactly what the Vatican gets in\h
exchange. I assume they want the Chinese Communist\h\h

103
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,840
Party to treat Christians a little better.\h
But that doesn’t seem to be part of the deal,\h\h

104
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,840
since the Communist Party has just created a\h
global blueprint for persecuting Christians.

105
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
When asked about it,\h\h

106
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,160
Pope Francis said they’re a customer of\h
ours. I’m okay doing business with China.

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
A new report from the UK has\h
come to a shocking conclusion.\h\h

108
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,840
And by a shocking conclusion, I mean the thing\h
that everyone else has already figured out:\h\h

109
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,800
Huawei works in collusion with the Chinese state.

110
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
All it took was a global pandemic to\h
get them to publicly acknowledge it.

111
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,560
And finally, and this will shock you,\h
the French have surrendered to pressure\h\h

112
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,240
from the Chinese Communist Party and halted an\h
exhibit they were planning about Genghis Khan.

113
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
What’s that Shelley? What do you mean\h
France didn’t actually surrender?

114
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,080
Apparently, the history museum in Nantes is only\h
temporarily delaying their exhibition until 2024.\h\h

115
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
The reason? “This would give it\h
time to build a new exhibition,\h\h

116
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,200
featuring works from European\h
and American collections.”

117
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,960
Originally, the French museum was\h
building an exhibit in collaboration\h\h

118
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,720
with a museum in China’s Inner Mongolia region.\h
But because the Chinese regime is currently\h\h

119
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,560
persecuting Mongolians there, and because\h
of their increasingly unreasonable demands,\h\h

120
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,520
the French museum has decided it just doesn't\h
want to be tied to the Chinese state at all.

121
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,560
So what were some of Chinese\h
regime’s unreasonable demands?\h\h

122
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,040
Well, in this exhibit about Genghis Khan, “The\h
Chinese authorities demanded that certain words,\h\h

123
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,240
including ‘Genghis Khan,’ ‘Empire’ and\h
‘Mongol’ be removed from the exhibition.”

124
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
Yes, come see our fantastic exhibit about...a\h\h

125
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,800
guy. In a region. Who built a thing.\h
You know the one. You’ll love it.\h

126
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,960
But good for the French museum\h
for standing up for their values.\h\h

127
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,360
They’re not ok doing business with china.\h

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

129
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

130
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:06,000
Logan asks, “I share your dislike for the Panda.\h
What are your feelings about the red panda?”

131
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,680
Logan, I am glad to know that there are people\h
like you out there who have accepted the truth\h\h

132
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
about giant pandas. Nothing\h
in life is black and white.\h\h

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,880
Except for pandas, which is\h
why you should hate them.\h

134
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,320
Don’t fall for the propa-panda, people!\h

135
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
But what about the red panda, you ask?\h\h

136
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, despite the name, red pandas are\h
not in fact related to giant pandas.\h\h

137
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,960
You might have heard they’re more closely\h
related to raccoons, but even that isn’t true.\h

138
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,760
According to Scientific America, “red\h
pandas form their own phylogenetic family.”

139
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,200
Which means, from a genetic perspective, red\h
pandas are more closely related to skunks.\h

140
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,480
And I would take a skunk any day\h
of the week over a filthy panda.

141
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
Thanks for your question Logan.\h

142
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
And if you’d like to have me respond to\h
your question or comment on the show for\h\h

143
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,000
hundreds of thousands of people to hear, join\h
what I call the China Uncensored 50 Army...

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,720
and support us in the battle against the Chinese\h
