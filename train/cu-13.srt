Hi, Chris Chappell here, live in Korea

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,080
—when I recorded this.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,120
I've chosen this as the perfect location

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,940
to announce the winners of the

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,190
3rd Annual China Uncensored

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,129
Viewer Contest Gala Extravaganza Spectacular
Event Thing!

7
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,830
I received so many Year of the Monkey submissions

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,310
that it was hard to choose just one.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,290
So that's why I chose two!

10
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,970
These are the two winners.

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,750
You'll receive in the mail a special

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,160
collector's edition China Uncensored poster

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,510
autographed by…

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,860
me! Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,660
So thank you to everyone who entered.

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,550
Check out the Facebook page to see all the
entries

17
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,030

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,860
you should email me your addresses so I can
send you those posters.

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,140
Thanks again to everyone who participated.
