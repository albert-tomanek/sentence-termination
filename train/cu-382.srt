1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,370
forget the stock market bubble,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,620
this is China’s incredible bike-share bubble.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,600
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,710
The good old bicycle.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,630
That trusty two-wheeled iron steed.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,239
So whether you’re out for some fresh air
and exercise

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,810
taking your kid to school

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,180
or grabbing some fast food at “WickDonald’s”,

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,069
bikes and China, like marriage,

12
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:31,499
go together like a horse and carriage.

13
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:35,699
Unfortunately, thanks to a bubble in dock-free
bike-sharing,

14
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:37,690
that relationship has turned toxic.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,570
So on today’s episode of China Uncensored,

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,469
let’s look at how China’s bike-sharing
program

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,109
has become a complete disaster.

18
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:50,089
One giant difference between China’s bike-sharing

19
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,230
and what you’re used to in the US is docking.

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,660
For bike-sharing in, say, San Francisco…

21
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,860
or New York—

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,739
you have to pick them up from a dock,

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,850
and return them to a dock.

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,019
And you can unlock a bike with a physical
key,

25
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,619
or a mobile app.

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,439
The benefits are that it’s easy for the
city governments

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,990
to keep them tidy in designated places.

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,770
It’s easy for the bike-share companies to
track them,

29
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,229
and use vans to move bikes around to where
they’re needed most.

30
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,880
But there’s a “last mile problem”.

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,930
That is, there are only so many docks,

32
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,229
and if there’s no dock within about a mile

33
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,080
of where a person wants to start or end their
trip,

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,120
they’re simply not going to use the bike-share.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Sorry, everyone who lives in the Bronx!

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,180
But in China, cities have a cure for this
last mile problem:

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,869
dockless bikes!

38
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,299
Thanks to GPS chips in every bike,

39
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,320
you can just unlock one using your mobile
app.

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,070
And when you’re done, leave it wherever
you want!

41
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,969
And I mean: Wherever you want!

42
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,200
Sometimes the cure can be worse than the disease.

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,250
This is a photo of the entrance

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,189
to a park in the city of Shenzhen.

45
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,219
Where, as you can see, people ride shared
bikes

46
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,039
right up to the entrance, and then just throw
them

47
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,210
on top of the ginormous pile of other bikes

48
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,380
before going inside to enjoy the scenery.

49
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,320
China’s dockless bike-sharing industry

50
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,750
grew like mad in recent years,

51
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,670
thanks to the brilliant combination of cutthroat
competition

52
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,250
and no government regulation.

53
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,720
There’s now about 500 or so competing dockless

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,860
bike-sharing companies in China,

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,390
each desperate to win market share

56
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,380
by filling cities with their bikes…

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,830
…with the idea being that if their bike
is on top of the pile,

58
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,890
people will choose their brand over their
competitors’.

59
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,880
With no limits to the number of companies

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,960
that could operate in a given region,

61
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,750
or to the number of bikes,

62
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,740
this led to unsightly clutter…

63
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,770
and crippling choice anxiety.

64
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,130
I think she realized she’s better off

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,660
just walking that last mile.

66
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,980
Two of the biggest bike-sharing startups in
China are Ofo

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,640
and Mobike…

68
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,730
Between them they’ve got more than 120 million
registered users

69
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,340
and more than 13 million bikes piling up in
Chinese cities.

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,040
And what made it all possible

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,870
is billions of dollars in venture capital.

72
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,670
Ofo, with its trademark canary yellow bikes…

73
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,100
…has raised at least 1.3 billion dollars
in investment

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,230
across five rounds of funding.

75
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,270
And Mobike,

76
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,530
recently got 600 million in its latest funding
round,

77
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,260
bringing its market cap to about $1 billion
dollars.

78
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,190
And these companies with 10-figure market
valuations

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,110
are locked in a cash-burning race to dominate
market share

80
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,510
by pumping out bikes as fast as possible,

81
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,220
keeping the prices as low as possible,

82
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,360
and stacking them in the streets as high as
possible.

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,860
To deal with this, some cities have starting
sending

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,770
crews out to impound shared bikes.

85
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,250
Which make sense.

86
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,250
This cyclist has to ride in the street with
cars,

87
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,330
because the bike lane has turned into a bike
pile.

88
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,090
Here’s a series of photos

89
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,760
from a Shanghai bicycle impound lot,

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,820
which thousands…

91
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,190
upon thousands

92
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,790
upon thousands

93
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,620
of bikes now call home.

94
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,330
Fortunately, there’s still space in Shanghai

95
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,840
to plant huge fields of colorful flowers…

96
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,420
Haha, no it’s more bikes.

97
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
And more bikes.

98
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,810
And more bikes.

99
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,080
And...more...bikes!

100
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,330
But at least there’s been some pushback
lately.

101
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,430
For example, after Shanghai realized

102
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,739
it had 1.5 million shared bikes—

103
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,599
that’s one for every 16 residents—

104
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,060
it started to say enough is enough.

105
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,110
On August 18, the Shanghai Transportation
Bureau

106
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,330
ordered bikeshare companies to stop

107
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,599
adding more bikes to the streets.

108
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,389
There’s also a proposal in China to punish
people

109
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,680
who park badly and misuse shared bikes.

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,259
And if anyone is good a monitoring and punishing
its citizens,

111
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,470
it’s the Chinese government.

112
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,759
According to the National Interest…

113
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,640
…their surveillance technology can scan

114
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,979
the entire population “in one second.”

115
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,260
I know it might feel like 1984

116
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
meets Terminator

117
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,810
meets Premium Rush...

118
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,000
but if it’ll prevent people from leaving

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,680
heaps of shared bikes all over the place,

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,890
it’ll be totally worth it.

121
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,639
Or—and I know this sounds crazy, but hear
me out—

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,229
instead of punishing individual citizens,

123
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,710
the government could step in to design

124
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,210
and implement thoughtful policies to make
sure

125
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,889
the bike-sharing companies act responsibly.

126
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,580
Haha, just kidding.

127
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,289
It’s way easier to just punish people.

128
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,210
So what do you think about China’s bike-sharing
disaster?

129
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,759
Leave your comments below.

130
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,940
And now it’s time when I answer a question
from one of you—

131
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,530
my 50-Cent Army supporters who contribute

132
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,919
to China Uncensored on Patreon.

133
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,919
Primo asks,

134
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,819
“One thing I've been wondering is have you

135
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,009
ever thought of going to being more serious,

136
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:40,969
or do you think the satirical way of the show

137
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,020
is the way it should be?”

138
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,190
Good question.

139
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,160
So I started China Uncensored back in 2012.

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,379
Before that I was covering China

141
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,160
but in a straight news kind of way.

142
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,090
And I’m sorry to say, I found nobody really
cared.

143
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,010
Which bothered me because I knew China is

144
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,560
a really important country and was having
a big impact

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,939
on our lives in the United States.

146
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,659
This was also around the time the Communist
Party

147
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:06,310
started building those artificial islands
in the South China Sea

148
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,939
and claiming that proved it was their territory.

149
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,259
I found I couldn’t keep a straight face
saying,

150
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,879
“the Chinese government has started to build
fake islands

151
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,290
and are claiming it as ancient Chinese territory.”

152
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,319
No, that’s absolutely redonkulous.

153
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,969
So I created China Uncensored with the tone
it has

154
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,340
because that’s the only way I felt like
I could really say

155
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,529
what I wanted to say about the Chinese Communist
Party.

156
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:30,529
And over the years,

157
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,029
I’ve found using satire has actually helped
bring

158
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,099
a larger audience to China news and politics.

159
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:37,419
And be honest:

160
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,120
If all I did was straight news reporting,

161
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,530
would you still be watching?

162
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,909
Thanks for your question, Primo.

163
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,719
And if you’d me to answer your question,

164
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:46,199
join up in the China Uncensored 50-army.

165
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,540
We have a very low mortality rate.

166
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,550
And for only a dollar or more per episode,

167
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,970
we’ll give you some cool perks

168
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,949
and you’ll have the chance to send me questions

169
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,370
that I could answer right here on the show.

170
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,969
So head over to Pateron.com/chinauncensored
to learn more.

171
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,470
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

172
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,419
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

173
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,460
See you next time.
