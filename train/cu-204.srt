1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,589
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:05,649
If you go to a Chinese pop concert, hide your
face.

3
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:09,140
Trump wants you to know that everything with
China will work out fine.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,110
Or maybe it won’t.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,360
And, going to watch the new Avengers movie
in China?

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,120
One theater has a special tip for all the
ladies.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,080
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,680
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,940
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,779
China has gotten one step closer

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,640
to putting an unmanned spacecraft

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,380
on the far side of the moon.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,800
On Monday, they launched a relay satellite.

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,480
It won’t actually land on the moon,

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,690
but it will help with the landing process
for a future craft.

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,680
China’s military-led space program wants
to be

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,430
the first to land on the far side of the moon.

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,710
It’s sometimes also called the dark side
because

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,370
that side always faces away from the Earth.

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,420
The new relay satellite would help solve the
issue of communication.

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,469
So, if China does manage to make it to the
dark side of the moon

22
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,500
later this year,

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,820
they’ll be the first to get a clear view
of when the Decepticons attack.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,670
But Chinese technological breakthroughs

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,520
aren’t just going to the dark side of the
moon.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,000
The dark side of technology has also arrived
in China.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,750
Chinese authorities just arrested

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,600
a dangerous fugitive by the name of Yu

29
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,310
at the concert of famous Hong Kong singer
Jacky Cheung,

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,240
whose nickname is the God of Songs.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,530
How did police find the man in that crowd?

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,549
Simple.

33
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,020
Facial recognition software picked out his
face

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,009
as his entered the venue.

35
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,640
Local police wrote on their WeChat account,

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,920
“Wearing a smile as he came to see his idol,

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,090
he hadn’t realized that he was already being
watched.”

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,090
Hahaha.

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,090
Haha.

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,090
Ha.

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,840
That’s not creepy.

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,500
They’d been watching for him for 3 years.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,680
And get this—this is the third time in two
months

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,549
that a fugitive was caught this way...

45
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,930
at a Jacky Cheung concert.

46
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,980
Wait a minute.

47
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,419
Is Jacky Cheung a secret crimefighter

48
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,129
known as the God of Songs

49
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:16,700
whose superpower is luring criminals to his
concerts?

50
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,959
That would explain so much.

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,060
So what was the heinous crime Yu committed

52
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,780
that got him arrested at the concert?

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,890
He owed almost 20,000 dollars...

54
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,650
on unpaid potatoes.

55
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,199
That’s no small potatoes.

56
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,969
Ah ha ha.

57
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:36,969
Wait,

58
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:41,499
what use could anyone have for 20,000 dollars
worth of potatoes?

59
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,120
Perhaps it’s the God of Songs’ archnemesis...

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,430
Chairman Potato Head?

61
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,219
Anyway, these kinds of arrests using facial
recognition

62
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,209
will happen more and more.

63
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,699
The Chinese Communist Party has invested heavily

64
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,449
in AI-powered surveillance cameras.

65
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,449
Within three years,

66
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,969
they plan to add 400 million new cameras

67
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,169
capable of recognizing and tracking citizens.

68
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,159
They will also be able to identify your car
and your friends.

69
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,079
Here’s another fun fact about China’s
facial recognition surveillance program.

70
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,089
They’ve started installing it in schools
behind the blackboard

71
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,829
to see how much kids are paying attention,

72
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,120
tracking every movement of students’ pupils.

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,560
I know, that sounds disturbing,

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,439
especially if you’ve ever fallen asleep
in class.

75
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,810
But don’t worry,

76
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,920
the system can be fooled.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,110
In other news,

78
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,419
Burkina Faso has severed diplomatic relations
with Taiwan,

79
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,530
reminding the world that Burkina Faso still
exists.

80
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,779
The US and China are continuing trade talks.

81
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:48,040
Last week, Liu He, China’s vice premier

82
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,650
and top economic adviser to Xi Jinping,

83
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,939
met with US President Donald Trump.

84
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,639
Liu gave a good presentation.

85
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,349
According to Larry Kudlow,

86
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,629
the head of the National Economic Council,

87
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:03,279
“President Trump was very engaged.”

88
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,989
I bet.

89
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,260
One of the main issues was the nearly 400
billion dollar trade deficit

90
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,540
the United States has with China.

91
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,569
President Trump wants that reduced by half.

92
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:20,560
US officials say China has proposed achieving
that by buying more US goods.

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,580
But it seems that President Trump doubts the
trade talks will work out.

94
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,520
"Will that be successful?

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,289
I tend to doubt it.

96
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:33,520
The reason I doubt it is because China has
become very spoiled.

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,210
The European Union has become very spoiled.

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,750
Other countries have become very spoiled,

99
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,270
because they always got 100 percent

100
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,000
of whatever they wanted from the United States.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,280
But we can't allow that to happen anymore."

102
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,620
He also tweeted this week that the trade deal

103
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,479
would need a different structure to succeed.

104
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,159
Speaking of different structures,

105
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,939
President Trump has cancelled the Singapore
summit

106
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,120
with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,669
That comes after North Korea had made

108
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:02,889
increasingly harsh statements,

109
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,040
including one that threatened a “nuclear
showdown”

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,629
and called Vice President Mike Pence a “political
dummy.”

111
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:13,680
To which the White House strenuously objected,

112
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
because quote,

113
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,780
“only President Trump gets to call Mike
Pence a political dummy.”

114
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,040
Last week, Trump had already thrown some doubt
on the summit,

115
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,139
while maybe possibly blaming China for things
going wrong.

116
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,440
I think things may have changed a little bit

117
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,740
when they met with China a second time,

118
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,710
as you know Kim Jong Un had a second meeting
with China,

119
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,349
which was a little bit of a surprise meeting...

120
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,469
but there has been a big difference since
they had

121
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:42,550
this second meeting with President Xi ,

122
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,349
with that said,

123
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:46,680
my attitude is, whatever happens, happens.

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,330
Could there be trouble in bromance paradise?

125
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,599
Only time will tell.

126
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,909
Avengers: Infinity War.

127
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:57,610
It’s called that because it will go on forever.

128
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,949
And it’s out in China!

129
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,830
And one theater in Inner Mongolia had a very
special message

130
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,820
for the ladies in the audience.

131
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,379
“You should do nothing but eat your popcorn
silently.

132
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:12,419
Don’t mess with your man while he is worshipping
the silver screen.

133
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,110
If your man gets really excited while watching
the movie,

134
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,789
please pretend to be interested.

135
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,680
And based on his facial expressions,

136
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,979
you should say things like ‘yes’ and ‘totally.”

137
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,599
But before you go crying “sexism,” yes,

138
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,819
there was a message to the men in the audience
as well.

139
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,940
“Don’t try to explain the characters to
your women

140
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,400
in the middle of the movie.

141
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,430
They won’t be able to recognize them

142
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,490
just like you can’t differentiate between
lipsticks.

143
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,530
Get them some popcorn, soda,

144
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,210
and snacks to keep their mouths full.”

145
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,550
A Communist utopia!

146
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,050
And finally, Zhao Kangmin has passed away
at the age of 81.

147
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,319
You may not know his name,

148
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,229
but I bet you know the thing he’s famous
for.

149
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,729
No, he wasn’t a terracotta warrior.

150
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,310
He was the archaeologist who discovered the
terracotta warriors.

151
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,380
Or more accurately,

152
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,370
he pieced together tiny fragments of pottery,

153
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,139
until they formed the terracotta warriors.

154
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,310
The Terracotta Warriors were made some 2,000
years ago

155
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,300
by Emperor Qin Shihuang,

156
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,810
the first emperor to unite China,

157
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,719
and they’ve become perhaps one of the most

158
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:23,779
recognizable symbols of ancient Chinese heritage.

159
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,529
But get this, at first, Zhao and his colleagues

160
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:30,389
were afraid of announcing the find.

161
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,560
Because it was during the middle of the Cultural
Revolution,

162
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,289
where across China, Mao Zedong had directed
people to destroy anything from China’s

163
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,870
cultural past.

164
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,150
Fortunately for everyone,

165
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,789
the terracotta warriors were treated better

166
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,940
than all those teachers and intellectuals

167
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
who were killed.

168
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,529
Maybe that’s because Mao Zedong admired

169
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:51,680
Emperor Qin who made them.

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,800
Qin was the emperor who himself bragged about

171
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,090
killing hundreds of Confucian scholars

172
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,020
for having traditional beliefs.

173
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,289
Fortunately, his dynasty only lasted 15 years.

174
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:07,949
And before we wrap up, here’s a question
from…

175
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,059
Jeppe Christensen

176
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,449
If China is to get rid of the ccp

177
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,999
and become a democracy,

178
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,180
and maybe unite with Taiwan again,

179
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,699
where do you see the push for change to come
from in China?

180
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,110
Interesting question!

181
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,460
This is something I’ve thought a lot about.

182
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,199
One scenario that could happen is that the
CCP

183
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,570
would start to lose control of some of the
southern provinces of China.

184
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,760
Particularly Guangdong and Guangxi.

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,260
Those are Cantonese speaking provinces,

186
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,470
which aligns them culturally and linguistically
with Hong Kong.

187
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,080
And we know Hong Kongers love to dissent.

188
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,089
Plus, Guangdong is where Shenzhen is—

189
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,540
the city that manufactures all your electronics.

190
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,750
As the Communist Party loses its grip in power,

191
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,290
it would focus its energies on maintaining
control over Beijing

192
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,370
and the surrounding regions.

193
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,160
Now this doesn’t have to be violent revolution.

194
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,970
In fact, across the world,

195
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,880
the vast majority of political change in the
past two decades

196
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,850
has come through nonviolent resistance.

197
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,699
In fact, the data shows nonviolent resistance

198
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:17,480
is actually more effective.

199
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,140
But of course that’s just one way things
could go down.

200
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,820
Maybe Presistator Xi Jinping does such a good
job,

201
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,240
they decide to just get rid of the Communist
Party

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,860
and let him rule for life.

203
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,470
Thanks for you question.

204
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,980
