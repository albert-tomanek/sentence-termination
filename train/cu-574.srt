1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,490
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,680
when Chinese state media brag about

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,110
deeper ties between China and Bolivia...

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,760
...you know Bolivia is deep trouble.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,620
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,620
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,020
I want to share with you an exciting story

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,630
of resistance against an oppressive regime.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,720
I’m not talking about China.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,390
And no, I’m not talking about the Last Jedi.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,890
There are some controversies I just will not
touch.

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,029
I’m talking about the resistance in Bolivia,

13
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,039
against President-for-life Evo Morales.

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,260
Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in
South America.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,940
So what is propping Morales up?

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,350
Well, like many countries,

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,530
Bolivia is part of China’s Belt and Road
Initiative.

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,100
And that could be bad news

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,690
for a lot of ordinary citizens in Bolivia.

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,429
I sat down with Bolivian activist,

21
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,769
member of the resistance,

22
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,829
and possible Jedi Jhanisse Vaca-Daza

23
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,060
on the sidelines of the Oslo Freedom Forum
in New York.

24
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,720
Well thank you for joining us today.

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,929
Thank you for having me.

26
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,530
So, for people who don't really know

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,020
much about the situation in Bolivia,

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,850
what's going on there right now?

29
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,920
Okay, Bolivia is in the middle of South America,

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,509
and we are a country that is currently going
through

31
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:17,909
a democratic crisis that has been seen previously

32
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,969
in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador,

33
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:23,270
we're just not at the tipping point quite
yet.

34
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,240
But, you have a president, so it's a Democracy
right?

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,439
It's a competitive authoritarianism

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,210
so it's a weird hybrid between Democracy and
Dictatorship.

37
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,420
We do have political-

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,420
That sounds awesome.

39
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,469
opposition parties, it's so great but everything

40
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:39,979
is controlled by the state at the end of the
day,

41
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,969
and there is a big resistance movement,

42
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,280
a citizen movement because the president asked
the country

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,900
in a referendum if we wanted to have a change
to the constitution

44
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,630
to make it legal for the president to be re-elected
indefinitely.

45
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,630
We said no.

46
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,630
We won.

47
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,770
We had a high percentage of the vote,

48
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,909
but then he turned to the constitutional court

49
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,869
and had them make it legal to be re-elected
indefinitely.

50
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:03,869
Okay.

51
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,340
Our elections are next year.

52
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,590
People are protesting we want him

53
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,500
to obey the results of the referendum

54
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,250
but we're not quite sure where it's gonna
go yet.

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,800
Why wouldn't you want a president for life?

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Why wouldn't we-

57
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
They have that in China, it's great.

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
It's works so well right?

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
It does.

60
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,330
I think it's worked very well for other countries
too but,

61
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,330
the funny part,

62
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,970
the irony out of all of this is that

63
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,000
our president is an indigenous president,

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,330
which has worked very well in his favor.

65
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,830
Our country was the first one to have

66
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,819
the rights of the environment

67
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,650
as mother earth recognizes part of the constitution,

68
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,180
but then again there are several human rights
violations

69
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,150
to indigenous people in Bolivia.

70
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,560
They are being displaced off their

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,140
national and natural parks right now.

72
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,390
Even under the current-

73
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,689
Under the current president-

74
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:48,689
President Morales.

75
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,340
and purposefully, he applied the supreme decree,

76
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,230
1366 on May this year,

77
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,879
which says that our natural parks and indigenous
areas

78
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,380
can be opened for hydro carbon exploration,

79
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,069
and guess which companies are doing such explorations
right now.

80
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,069
Nicaragua?

81
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,069
Definitely, no.

82
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,069
China.

83
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,329
Oh, hey that was my second guess.

84
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,329
Yup.

85
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,659
So, China has taken an interest in Bolivia?

86
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,670
A high, high, high, interest.

87
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,080
China is actually on a bilateral level,

88
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,250
China owns 80% of our external debt.

89
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,250
80%?

90
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,250
80%, yes.

91
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,490
We used to receive a lot of funds from Venezuela,

92
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,110
because our economy is very much-

93
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,560
They don't have much to give for funding-

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,579
Then things changed for those guys,

95
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,030
and we were like where should we go.

96
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,189
That's funny they were also getting

97
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,280
a lot of investment from China.

98
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Weren't they?

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,810
I'm sure it'll work out for Bolivia though.

100
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,810
That's what I'm saying,

101
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,110
there's a pattern that's being repeated and

102
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,940
that's why we need to raise awareness about
this

103
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,959
because we already have a huge crisis in Venezuela,

104
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,950
we have a very violent crisis in Nicaragua,

105
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,560
you don't want Bolivia to go there especially
because Bolivia

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,150
is in the middle of South America.

107
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,120
We're very well connected to the countries
around us,

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,659
and then at the same time

109
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,299
there's a high level of Narco traffic

110
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,000
and coca production in Bolivia,

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,640
because it's actually legal to grow coca in
my country.

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
It's legal?

113
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
It's legal, yeah-

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,969
Are there non cocaine reasons you can have
coca?

115
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:13,969
Most definitely,

116
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,160
there are a lot of typical ways to use coca
for tea,

117
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,380
for medicine,

118
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,500
but this current government, again,

119
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,560
president indigenous and also leader of the
coca growers unions,

120
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,770
that's where he came from.

121
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,860
He's taking the permits

122
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,090
to grow coca and giving it only to

123
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,890
the areas that take it to Narco traffic.

124
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,690
There is a UN study that says that those areas,

125
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,740
97% of the production goes towards Narco traffic

126
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,140
and the areas where they actually use it for
the typical legal ways

127
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,060
to produce coca are not getting the permits
anymore,

128
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,010
so they've been protesting and we've had several
coca growers

129
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,230
protest under this government,

130
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,580
which was unthinkable when he rose to power.

131
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,120
President Morales is sort of using his image

132
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,370
as an indigenous person representing the coca
growers

133
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,540
to basically use this as a propaganda.

134
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,300
Yes, most definitely,

135
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,240
both inside and outside of the country.

136
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,000
Outside of the country he's really appreciated

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,010
by the international community because of

138
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,450
the respect for indigenous rights and mother
earth,

139
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,540
while again inside the country we've seen
terrible,

140
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,680
terrible damage to our natural areas.

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,000
To take it to more specific examples,

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,140
we've found in Chinese citizens and companies

143
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,250
that are illegally trading our jaguars teeth
and skin,

144
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,320
and every time we try to take this to trial

145
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,990
because it's illegal and jaguars are endangered
in my country,

146
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,660
we haven't been able to have them process.

147
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,310
There's just, there's no rule of law in the
country at the moment,

148
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,840
everything is co-opted by the executive branch

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,270
but it's affected even more because most of
our natural resources

150
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,190
are being taken by Chinese companies.

151
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,880
Can we just go back for a moment?

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,270
Jaguar teeth and skin?

153
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,440
What is that used for?

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,520
It has a high value for collectors, I guess.

155
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,700
The statements that were given to the press;

156
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,610
farmers are getting paid $100 per jaguar

157
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,650
and then the skin is being taken illegally
to China and Europe

158
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,660
and other markets and it's being sold (by)
ten times the price.

159
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,770
So China is taking a real interest in Bolivia.

160
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,840
Besides the poaching that's happening,

161
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,870
what else are they investing in?

162
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,940
From 2013 until right now,

163
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,580
$609 million have been invested by the Chinese
government in Bolivia

164
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,460
and by 2025 it'll be over $1 billion

165
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,160
that are invested but here's the catch:

166
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,720
We invest in projects to create infrastructure
but we select,

167
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,610
China says, who's going to be the company
that carries

168
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,470
and executes these types of projects

169
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,850
and it's normally always Chinese companies.

170
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,190
Bolivian companies, business people and Bolivian
workers

171
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,530
have absolutely no access to these projects.

172
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,780
We are losing jobs,

173
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,460
if you want to see it that way, we have absolutely
no control.

174
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,090
There is no way to oversee these contracts

175
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,910
and it's a lot of money that's being used
and at the same time,

176
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,320
most of these projects either haven't been
carried to the end

177
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,730
so there are a lot of unfinished projects

178
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,210
or they've been executed poorly

179
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,330
and you have bridges that fall within a month.

180
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,130
One of the biggest issues with this is, given
the morale,

181
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,700
this government has successfully eroded the
independence

182
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,180
of the different branches of government.

183
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,920
You can't hold them accountable.

184
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,560
There's no way to take this to trial

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,350
because the trial's just not going to work

186
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,710
and if you make too much noise around it,

187
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,250
like some of our environmental activists have
done,

188
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,760
they get sued and persecuted judicially

189
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,160
and they're not able to continue doing their
activism.

190
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,750
So you're in a crossroads that's

191
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,230
really affecting our environment mainly,

192
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:21,190
but also it's part of a mission that is supporting

193
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,200
my governments erosion of democracy

194
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,780
which is going to have it's tipping point

195
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,960
in the elections next year.

196
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,520
So Chinese investment.

197
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
It's not helping the local economy,

198
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,339
it's helping prop up what is essentially a
dictatorship

199
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,319
and Bolivia's one of the poorest countries
in South America.

200
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:40,399
How are you going to pay back this debt?

201
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,680
That is the main question that everyone has
right now.

202
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,370
The current government rose to power with
a speech,

203
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,310
and a rightful speech in a way,

204
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,209
that we had been often selling our natural
resources

205
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:57,370
to big external forces such as the empire,

206
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,500
which is what they call the U.S.

207
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,889
and right wing governments all the time.

208
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:03,779
It's like we just switched empires from one
to the other.

209
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,100
China's owning most of what we do.

210
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,750
It's the money that we're getting from China

211
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,690
is going to really unnecessary stuff.

212
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,019
We've spent over $40 million buying two MA60
military airplanes

213
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,500
which we absolutely don't need,

214
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,170
we're not at war right now.

215
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,600
Yeah but those are really cool.

216
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
They are cool.

217
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,620
And so there are $150 million that have been
spent on buying

218
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,110
6 helicopters for the president.

219
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,879
And more thing I'd like to mention,

220
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,170
we've spent over $250 million buying a satellite
from China

221
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,310
and this happened recently after the government
nationalized

222
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,019
the biggest telephone company in Bolivia

223
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,560
which they are using through this satellite.

224
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
At the same time,

225
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,019
the satellite is allowing the national T.V.
station

226
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,670
to be able to reach even more rural areas
than it could before.

227
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,490
May I add this national T.V. station states
to be,

228
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,439
is giving nothing but propaganda about the
government

229
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:03,860
and it never reports on stuff

230
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,379
like the crisis in Venezuela or Nicaragua,

231
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,129
you don't hear about that in this news.

232
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,129
I am shocked.

233
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:10,129
Can you believe?

234
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,999
Do you see any similarities with any other
government

235
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,889
that we may have been talking about?

236
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:15,889
Interesting.

237
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:17,860
So really in Bolivia you're seeing the same
thing

238
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,449
that you're seeing in countries around the
world,

239
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:21,449
particularly in Africa,

240
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,629
but also in other places in South America
and Central America

241
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:29,480
where China's basically acting as sort of
modern day colonial power.

242
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,720
Exactly.

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
So China is extracting resources as well?

244
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,220
What do they want from Bolivia?

245
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,839
Our natural resources for sure

246
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,029
and then you also have to keep in mind,

247
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,290
Bolivia has the highest lithium reserves in
the world.

248
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,779
Around 70% is estimated to be there,

249
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:52,629
so you want to be in good relations with us,
in a way.

250
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,629
At the same time,

251
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,600
it's a great way for China to expand

252
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,330
it's geo-political power in South America.

253
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,810
Again we're in the middle of everything.

254
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,949
There's a reason that Che Guevara wanted to

255
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,120
start his revolution in Bolivia specifically.

256
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,319
Very strategically located.

257
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,050
It is very strategically located and then
you also

258
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,829
have a country that has no rule of law

259
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,120
so you can get away with not paying your workers
properly,

260
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
not finishing the projects that you're working
on,

261
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,290
and also I should add, this is very important;

262
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,940
there have been, not just Bolivian's denouncing
this,

263
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,519
but we also know the Chancellor of Bolivia

264
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,460
spoke about this with the Chancellor of China.

265
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,769
There are Chinese convicts that are taken
to Bolivia

266
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,860
to finish their term in my country while working
on

267
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,319
infrastructure projects or mining projects.

268
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,009
They're basically slavery conditions.

269
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,600
They're really doubling down on the colonialism.

270
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,671
They are really going back to it

271
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:52,059
and it's really bad and at the same time,

272
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,240
there's no way to have it.

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,889
Check and balance to oversee all this.

274
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:02,170
Is China playing a direct role in the drug
trade?

275
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,470
I wouldn't dare say directly

276
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,129
but there's this one case that was really
big for my country.

277
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,129
It's about the TIPNIS.

278
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,699
TIPNIS is the name of a national park that

279
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,480
was also an indigenous territory that's

280
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,699
incredibly important for the ecosystem of
the entire country

281
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,269
so it's very protected by law, for years already.

282
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,769
The TIPNIS is really close to the places where

283
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:31,809
you grow coca and suddenly the government
came up with this plan

284
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,769
that they were gonna build a road,

285
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:37,320
executed by Chinese companies through the
middle of the TIPNIS

286
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,100
which was not only unnecessary but suspicious
as it would make

287
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,980
transporting coca a lot easier for them.

288
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Indigenous groups that live there,

289
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,980
they had this big march towards La Paz,

290
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,940
the city capital, and there was heavy, heavy,
violent repression

291
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,020
against indigenous groups including children
and the elderly.

292
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,850
It became a big problem and the government
tried to shut it down

293
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,670
and after that they started persecuting the
activists

294
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,290
and indigenous people that were talking about
this.

295
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,130
China's not necessarily clamping down on our
indigenous people

296
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,259
but they are being the economic provider

297
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,249
for all of this actions to happen

298
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:18,149
otherwise we wouldn't have these companies
going in.

299
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:25,509
I wouldn't dare to say that China is the one
strategist

300
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:30,120
behind my government because we know that
it is Venezuela and Cuba

301
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,910
that are sticking their nose inside my country.

302
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,470
We do know that it is Chinese money, again,

303
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,819
80% of our external debt is to China only.

304
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,410
They are the ones that are sustaining the
system,

305
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,720
the authoritarian system that we have in Bolivia
right now.

306
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,890
What's even worse,

307
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,130
no one's is paying any attention.

308
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,720
Well the audience of China Uncensored will
be paying attention.

309
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,639
Well they better do-

310
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,990
So what's your role in all of this.

311
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,769
As one of many activist in the resistance
movement,

312
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,200
to Morales attempt to hold onto power for
even longer,

313
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,680
we are trying to educate the citizenship of
Bolivia

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,850
about what's happening.

315
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,100
Why these elections that are coming are really

316
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,040
a very important moment for our democracy

317
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,339
and at the same time we are doing that through
nonviolence.

318
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,009
We're really committed to nonviolent actions
from the citizenship.

319
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,910
We're really committed to strategic work

320
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,420
and including different areas of Bolivia.

321
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,899
If there is something that I do give to Morales's
government,

322
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,759
is that he brought representation to many
minorities

323
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,730
that were previously ignored by the system.

324
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,899
So we want to keep this,

325
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,120
we want to keep this inclusion,

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,379
this union that we have in the country

327
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,740
but at the same time we want democracy.

328
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,879
Most people from my generation have known

329
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,230
no other president than Morales and it's so
difficult

330
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,410
to explain both to the international community

331
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,930
and sometimes to people within the country

332
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,170
that despite being an indigenous president,

333
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,279
you have heavy violation to indigenous rights,

334
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,509
environmental rights and you also have

335
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,220
absolutely no rule of law.

336
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,560
We're trying to work with what we have.

337
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,509
The movement I'm in is called Standing Rivers,

338
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,449
Rios de Pie and again,

339
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,450
we're trying to translate all of this information

340
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,160
through social media,

341
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,839
nonviolent mobilization and education to other
people.

342
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,899
If somebody wanted to learn more about your
group,

343
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,610
what you're doing or just the situation in
Bolivia,

344
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,980
where would you point them to?

345
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,629
To our Facebook page, Rios de Pie, Standing
Rivers.

346
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,069
If you want to look out for me on social media

347
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,679
or just checkout our many activists

348
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,589
talking about Bolivia at the moment.

349
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,100
It shouldn't be difficult to pin us down on
the internet.

350
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,530
We can definitely provide a link in the comments
section below.

351
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,999
Yes please do and check our movement.

352
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,930
You're going to have such good laughs.

353
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,360
We do a lot of relativism.

354
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,259
We try to use humor as a way to educate people

355
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:00,480
so our activities tend to be really funny
and strategic too.

356
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,120
So you're a laughtivist?

357
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,220
Activist if you want because you need more
than laughter,

358
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,929
you need to mobilize people on the street.

359
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,499
Well thank you so much for joining us.

360
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,949
That was very interesting.

361
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:14,940
Thank you so much.

362
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,080
It's great to be able to bring some light
to

363
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,520
this situation.

364
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,260
Good luck to you

365
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,420
Thanks!

366
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,280
Hope you enjoyed that interview; but there's more to know!

367
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,340
Why don't you give us a rundown of some of the things you talk about on the China Unscripted podcast?

368
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,520
Yes, in this podcast we have a second Bolivian so it's not just me.

369
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,400
And we will be two Bolivians telling you about

370
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,420
how the president is the reincarnation

371
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,640
of indigenous gods.

372
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,640
And also many other things, including corruption,

373
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,100
as well as the influence of China within our elections and how that

374
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,960
and how the played out for the election of the president indefinite, so

375
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,200
there's a lot more material to cover.

376
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,940
Plus the story of a lovechild, and miners who throw dynamite!

377
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,220
Yes, and how we're using nonviolence to counter that.

378
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,700
Effectively - They're not using dynamite.

379
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,120
No, we're not using dynamite. Effective nonviolence we're using though.

380
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,020
...which is the best kind of dynamite.
