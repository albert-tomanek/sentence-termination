this is why they don t allow guns in China

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:12,910
Logo Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I m
Chris Chappell. Civilians in China aren t

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,480
allowed to own guns and there s a good reason
why. Local officials couldn t get away with

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,260
stuff like this. No, this isn t photoshop.
Its the home of Luo Baogen, a farmer in China

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,670
s Zhejiang Province. There used to be a village
there, with over a thousand people living

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,360
in it. But they all moved out four years ago
when construction on a new freeway began.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,989
Everyone except Luo that is. He and his wife
weren t given enough compensation by government

8
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,110
contractors. So they just built the road around
it. But you know, it doesn t matter that you

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,670
make a crappy road that endangers people s
lives. Whats most important is that you show

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,440
an elderly couple who s BOSS OF CHINA! And
don t think this is a one-time thing. It s

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,449
happened over and over and over again. It
s so common that they have a name for it,

12
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:07,130
nail houses. They stick up out of construction
sites like nails, waiting to be hammered down.

13
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,370
So this is what the world s second largest
economy looks like. According to Amnesty International,

14
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,040
forced evictions and demolitions are on the
rise. Since the Chinese government technically

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,190
owns most of the land in China, corrupt officials
are able to seize land and sell it to contractors,

16
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,180
often to pay off debt. Since it s their own
government doing it, people really don t have

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,920
many options. So you end up with stories like
this: Chen Xuxing didn t want to move out

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,640
so the developer sent thugs to beat him up.
He was hospitalized for two months and when

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,180
he went back home, this was all that was left.
Then there was Wang Jiazheng. He lit himself

20
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,700
on fire, even as the bulldozers were at his
front door. He died a week later. His family

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,540
was not allowed to see him. According to Amnesty,
between 2009 and 2011 there have been 41 cases

22
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,470
of self-immolations over land grabs. In one
incident, after 36-year-old farmer Wang Shujie

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,470
ignited himself, police rushed forward and
shot him dead. I guess burning to death wasn

24
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,470
t fast enough for them. Construction was already
delayed, after all. So what happens when armed

25
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,820
police acting under corrupt officials beat
and murder unarmed civilians? Well, sometimes

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,620
they make their own guns. This is from back
in 2010. Yang Youde built homemade cannons

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,731
out of a wheelbarrow, pipe, and fireworks
to fend off violent demolition crews. His

28
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:23,160
story became such a hit that shortly after,
someone made an online game called, The Nail

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,410
Household Versus Demolition Team. You play
as the Ding family, select family members,

30
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,680
strategically place them and kill hordes of
demolition crews that come your way. Each

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,891
level becomes progressively harder until inevitably,
the house is brought down, Ding family and

32
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:44,850
all. Seems kind of ironic they call it the
People s Republic of China. That s all for

33
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,961
today. Once again I m Chris Chappell, thanks
for watching this episode of China Uncensored.
