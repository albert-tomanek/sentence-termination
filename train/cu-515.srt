00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,629
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,629 --> 00:00:03,600
it’s getting hot in here…

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,460
So put on that radiation suit.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,690
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,400
Bad news folks!

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,130
Nuclear war with China is imminent.

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,110
The good news is that we all know what to do.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,119
Duck and cover!

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,479
This is the Dongfeng-31.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,679
It’s equipped with a nuclear warhead

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,460
and can fly almost 5000 miles,

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,969
far enough to hit the continental US.

14
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,469
Now, don’t worry,

15
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,940
I’m not going to tell you China just sent
several of these

16
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,949
to Heilongjiang Province,

17
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:43,750
which is along the border with Russia

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,430
and the closest point in China to the United
States.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,820
Because allegedly China just sent several
Dongfeng-41’s

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,219
to Heilongjiang Province,

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,519
along the border with Russia

22
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,589
and the closest point in China to the United
States.

23
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,660
There have been reports for years

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,920
that China was testing these missiles,

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
but we haven't seen them until now.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,530
Maybe.

27
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,080
According to always accurate state-run media,

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,200
the Global Times,

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,160
the Dongfeng-41 can carry not one,

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,970
but 10-12 nuclear warheads,

31
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,220
and can fly over 8500 miles,

32
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,110
to hit anywhere in the world.

33
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,770
Yes, even your backyard, little Jimmy.

34
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,190
So you know what to do, right?

35
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,780
Duck and cover!

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,250
That potato salad will never be the same.

37
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,990
Anyway, what was the Kremlin’s response

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,290
to China putting nukes on their border?

39
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,200
They don’t care!

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,700
Apparently,

41
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,460
images have been surfacing on Chinese social
media

42
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,200
of the Dongfeng 41 in Heilongjiang Province.

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,860
Remember,

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,910
we haven't seen confirmed images before.

45
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,210
And media have been eating it up,

46
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,530
like a barbeque on the fourth of July.

47
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,490
Some media are reporting it’s a response

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,880
to President Trump’s provocative remarks
on China.

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
At least, the Global Times said that

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,180
some media are saying that.

51
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
Hey, it makes sense, right?

52
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,450
Therefore it must be true.

53
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,530
Just listen to what Trump’s Press Secretary,

54
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,940
Sean Spicer said about the South China Sea.

55
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,560
I think the U.S. is going to make sure

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,190
that we protect our interests there….

57
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,400
yeah we're going to make sure that we defend
international territories

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,720
from being taken over by one country."

59
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,130
And Trump’s Secretary of State

60
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,300
is even talking about blockading China’s
access

61
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,100
to artificial islands they built in disputed
territorial waters.

62
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,390
We’re going to have to send China a clear
signal

63
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,440
that first the island-building stops

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,220
and second your access to those islands

65
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,480
is also not going to be allowed.”

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,650
Well China’s having none of it!

67
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,690
"China's position on the South China Sea issue

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,690
is clear and consistent.

69
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,560
China's resolve to protect its sovereignty
and maritime rights

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,290
in the South China Sea will not change.”

71
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,190
And now Global Times is saying

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,650
“China's nuclear capability should be so
strong

73
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,709
that no country would dare launch a military
showdown

74
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,670
with China under any circumstance,

75
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,400
and such that China can strike back

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,660
against those militarily provoking it.”

77
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,260
So if you’re freaking out, good.

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,720
Continue to watch China Uncensored.

79
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,120
Only China Uncensored can protect you.

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,950
So are you ready to see the footage

81
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,730
that has everyone up in arms?!

82
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,040
Yes, 7 seconds of...

83
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,940
something under a black tarp.

84
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,490
That is the only evidence that China

85
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,599
has put an experimental nuclear missile on
the border of Russia.

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,310
When asked about the reports,

87
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,680
China's Foreign Ministry called them

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,930
"speculation circulated on the Internet."

89
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,440
Hey, just because something's on the internet

90
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,070
doesn't mean it's not true!

91
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,500
Or, that it's true, either.

92
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,770
Even Global Times says,

93
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,630
“there has been no authoritative information

94
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,840
on whether China has a Dongfeng-41 strategic
missile brigade,

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,390
how many such brigades it has,

96
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,700
and where they are deployed.”

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
So really,

98
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,540
this is probably all smoke and mirrors.

99
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,910
So what’s actually going on?

100
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,129
Well, this all follows almost immediately

101
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:21,590
on the heels of Chinese leader Xi Jinping

102
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,120
calling for a world without nuclear weapons

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,069
in a speech in front of the United Nations.

104
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,470
So is Xi a hypocrite?

105
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,949
Well, maybe.

106
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,819
But going before the UN

107
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,449
and saying nuclear weapons should be completely
prohibited,

108
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,620
then immediately putting nuclear weapons

109
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,659
on the border of Russia,

110
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:42,749
in striking distance of the US?

111
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,800
That’s just stupid.

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,860
And you don’t get to make it to the top
of the Communist Party

113
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,539
by being stupid.

114
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,659
Psychopathic toad, yes.

115
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,050
Actually stupid, no.

116
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,050
Xi Jinping is,

117
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,750
as you know if you’ve been watching,

118
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,050
locked in a life or death struggle with a
political faction

119
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,740
within the Communist Party

120
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,860
tied to former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.

121
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,169
And there’s been so many instances,

122
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,169
like this,

123
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,050
where Xi says one thing,

124
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,610
then the Party seems to do, immediately, the
exact opposite.

125
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,819
Which makes Xi look stupid.

126
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,490
And bad.

127
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,979
So when the Global Times,

128
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,800
the hawkish publication with ties to the Jiang
faction,

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,830
runs a story based off one really shaky video,

130
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,889
is the message really to tell Trump

131
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,400
to back off the South China Sea?

132
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,099
Or is it a message to the world that

133
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,539
“hey, this Xi Jinping guy is lying

134
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,169
and probably plotting something evil behind
his stoic facade.

135
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:41,210
Unlike his predecessors in office,

136
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,460
who were all goodness and light.”

137
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,849
But, just in case, you know what to do.

138
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,249
Duck and cover!

139
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,990
And try not to get run over by your tractor.

140
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,990
What do you think?

141
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,979
I’ll be delving more into the power struggle

142
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,740
inside China on an upcoming episode.

143
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,120
So stay tuned.

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,199
And don’t forget to support China Uncensored
on Patreon.

145
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,119
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

146
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,199
see you next time.
