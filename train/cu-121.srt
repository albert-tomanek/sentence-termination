1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,179
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,500
What is Falun Gong, and Why is it Persecuted?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,839
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,980
July 20 is the 15 year anniversary of the
Chinese regime's persecution of Falun Gong.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,890
To mark it, I've decided to compile everything
I've said previously about Falun Gong in one

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:23,720
episode.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,109
So what is Falun Gong?

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,669
Why, just the gravest threat facing China!

9
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,480
Look at them there, standing still!

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,149
Or here, sitting still!

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,480
Can't someone do something about this menace?!

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,739
Yes, good.

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,370
Okay.

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,629
Oh, wow.

15
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,789
Okay okay I get the idea.

16
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,870
Wow.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,109
So what is Falun Gong and why is this happening
to them?

18
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:52,410
Now, there's nothing I'd like more, than to
treat this issue the way most Western media

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:52,690
have--

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,699
ignore it and hope that it goes away.

21
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:58,300
I mean, do you know how hard it is to report
on this stuff?

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,129
The Communist Party gets a little touchy about
Western media reporting on Falun Gong.

23
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,670
Even if the Western journalists want to report
on it, that puts media companies in a tight

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,680
spot.

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,390
Are these companies going to risk getting
kicked out of China?

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,520
Are they expected to risk losing all that
money for a poorly understood spiritual group,

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,220
just because it's the right thing to do?

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,470
I mean just the other day I heard about this
crazy group of people who believe in drinking

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,470
some poor guy's blood and eating his flesh.

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,140
Sounds like those sickos should be fed to
lions for sport.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,100
I mean, I'm sure there's no way people might
have some misunderstandings about a heavily

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,930
persecuted and suppressed underground spiritual
movement.

33
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,180
When there's a massive regime trying to spread
misinformation about it.

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,280
Ah, if only there was an Ancient Rome Uncensored

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,670
But, since this is China Uncensored, I guess
I'll have to try and clear up some of the

36
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,770
misunderstandings about Falun Gong, myself.

37
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,710
Have you heard of qigong?

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,430
Qigong is a broad term for movements meant
to exercise the flow of qi, or energy, through

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,290
the body, that's supposed to be good for the
health.

40
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,370
Think of Taichi as an example.

41
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:11,060
Falun Gong, which is also called Falun Dafa,
includes 5 qigong exercises.

42
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,459
I think we can all clearly see why this is
a threat to the Party.

43
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,799
Falun Gong also has roots in Buddhist and
Taoist philosophy and thought, so you get

44
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:23,599
talk about things like karma and reincarnation,
tranquility,

45
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,540
giving up anger and jealousy, trying to be
less selfish.

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,599
Now, Li Hongzhi, the man who first taught
Falun Gong publicly in 1992, claims that he

47
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,159
was taught a version of Falun Gong from a
master when he was young.

48
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,799
And that the practice had been passed down
from a single master to a single disciple

49
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,249
for a very long time.

50
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:46,749
But, just because there are hundreds of traditional
Chinese practices like Falun Gong,

51
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,079
passed down through the generations in exactly
the same way,

52
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,430
does that mean it’s true?

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,439
I mean, look at the symbol of Falun Gong,
the Falun or Law Wheel.

54
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:59,810
That's a swastika, a symbol of pure evil,
no matter how many thousands of years people

55
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,060
have been using it before Hitler.

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,329
Really? This is from 10,000 BC?

57
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:06,689
But it gets worse.

58
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:12,219
Whereas qigong usually is just about doing
exercises to keep fit and healthy, Falun Gong

59
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,519
goes beyond that,

60
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,859
and requires its practitioners to live their
lives based on three dangerous, subversive

61
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:19,499
principles:

62
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,120
Truth, Compassion, and Tolerance.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,629
Luckily, there are those willing to stand
up to this madness.

64
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:33,310
After the Communist Party started persecuting
Falun Gong in 1999, state-run Xinhua News

65
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,290
Agency wrote,

66
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,670
“The so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance'
principle preached by Li has nothing in common

67
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,769
with the socialist ethical and cultural progress
we are striving to achieve."

68
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,370
Thank you, Xinhua.

69
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,779
Now there is the voice of the people.

70
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:51,340
I mean, Truth, Compassion, Tolerance?

71
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,719
If everyone followed that, China wouldn't
have the kind of systemic corruption that

72
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,849
has made China great.

73
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,079
Corruption is why people the world over know
the reputation of Chinese baby formula.

74
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,590
And you know what they say, there’s no such
thing as bad publicity.

75
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,010
So, obviously, the only people who would be
interested in this kind of thing would be

76
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,109
a few, probably poor, elderly, uneducated
women from the countryside.

77
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:17,930
I mean, the facts speak for themselves!

78
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,850
When Li Hongzhi gave his first seminar in
’92,

79
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,530
it was to a little over a hundred people in
a middle school in Changchun, Jilin Province.

80
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,160
7 years later, according to surveys taken
by the government, there were 100 million

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,800
people practicing it?

82
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
Wait, is that right?!

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,030
That would have been one out of every 12 people
in China practicing Falun Gong.

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,110
Huh. I don't think, poor, uneducated peasant
women can really cover that.

85
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,480
Actually, it even seems like some pretty high-ranking
people in the Communist Party were practicing.

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,640
And in every park in China, you could see
more people practicing Falun Gong than even

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,690
Taichi.

88
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,130
It was also spreading overseas pretty rapidly.

89
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,290
Man, Li Hongzhi must have been making a fortune!

90
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,820
On all of the…free public workshops…and…free
online books…and especially when people

91
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,810
were going around teaching their friends and
family the exercises…for free.

92
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,980
So why was this becoming such a big thing?

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,790
Well, China, as you may know, is not exactly,
well, it's a sludge-coated wasteland.

94
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,320
People tend to get sick, and healthcare was
becoming a problem.

95
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,100
But apparently, one of the big draws of Falun
Gong was that people were reporting a lot

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,660
of health benefits--even some rather miraculous
ones.

97
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,810
People with cancer, tuberculosis, paralysis,
all kinds of nasty stuff, were getting better.

98
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,750
So many people were getting healthier from
the practice, that government organizations

99
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,550
started calling Falun Gong a beneficial public
health activity,

100
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:53,390
and it was praised in state-run media and
by Chinese officials.

101
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,960
If you took a walk in the park this morning,
you can see that the recent hard work the

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,300
government has put into public health activities
has not been wasted.

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,070
Every morning starting from 5 to 6 am the
city’s green grass, parks, and public squares

104
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,190
become a morning exercise heaven.

105
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,480
Wait, a minute!

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,300
Isn't state run media always telling me how
evil Falun Gong is?!

107
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,770
Oh my, if you can't trust state-run media,
who can you trust?!

108
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:23,440
So for years, the government was actually
promoting Falun Gong because of all the health

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,910
benefits people were experiencing.

110
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,670
But more than that, China researchers tend
to point out that Falun Gong filled a spiritual

111
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,250
vacuum that had been left in China after the
Cultural Revolution.

112
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,610
Falun Gong was a traditional, Chinese kind
of spirituality that appealed to Chinese people.

113
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,280
At a time when making money was the only thing
considered important, and getting rich was

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,620
glorious,

115
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,940
people liked something that taught them life
was bigger than the size of your bank account.

116
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,930
And Falun Gong really must have meant a lot
to people, considering anyone's practicing

117
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,690
it after how hard the Chinese regime has been
trying to crush them.

118
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,390
In 1999, then Chinese leader Jiang Zemin declared
the Party had to eradicate Falun Gong.

119
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,490
The people’s daily reports that Falun Gong
is an evil cult.

120
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,770
Falun Dafa is an illegal organization and
the decision is to outlaw it.

121
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,020
Since then, Falun Gong practitioners have
disappeared, been tortured, raped, and killed

122
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,390
in labor camps and prisons, sent to mental
institutions,

123
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:26,180
even become the cornerstone of China's organ
“donation” system, as they, have their,

124
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,150
organs, ripped out and sold.

125
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,220
And in the 15 years this persecution, genocide,
has been going on, Falun Gong practitioners

126
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,590
have never fought back with violence.

127
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,200
They have, however, been trying to tell people
about all of the stuff that’s happening

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,590
to them in China.

129
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,940
Which, really, is almost as bad.

130
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,480
Why are Falun Gong practitioners always trying
to give China a bad name?

131
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,240
I mean, they claim they're a peaceful meditation
qigong practice or whatever, but they're clearly

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,890
getting political.

133
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,630
That's what I often hear Chinese people complain
about is political; that Falun Gong is political.

134
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,510
No, the way you're supposed to handle it,
when Chinese authorities do something bad

135
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,150
to you, is…well, definitely don’t question
why they’re doing that.

136
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,250
Just keep your head down and try not to think
about it.

137
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,900
Definitely don’t talk about it, ever.

138
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,120
It’s worked in the past, right?

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,820
That way, the Party can keep all those horrible
crimes against humanity behind the scenes.

140
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,390
Then, they can put on some nice shows like
the Olympics opening ceremony, or get placed

141
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,510
on the UN Human Rights council,

142
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,590
and then everyone in the world thinks China's
great! And that's what really benefits the

143
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,920
Chinese people.

144
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,639
Because the Party says so.

145
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,300
But so why did Jiang Zemin launch the persecution
against Falun Gong?

146
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,649
To understand what really happened, you need
to understand how Jiang Zemin came to power.

147
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,959
Now, in case you didn't know, politics in
China is a fairly dangerous game

148
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,639
In China, you're either rising in power, or
getting purged.

149
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,579
And when you're at the top, that just means
everyone else is gunning for you.

150
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,490
Case in point, these two guys, Hu Yaobang
and Zhao Ziyang.

151
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,970
China was just emerging from the decade of
horror that was the Cultural Revolution.

152
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,350
Deng Xiaoping, the guy in charge at the time,
began a policy of reform and opening up.

153
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,459
In other words, China was allowed to have
an economy again.

154
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,370
If you ever have trouble remembering his name,
just think, with economic reforms, this guy

155
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,399
didn't want Chinese people to ever be done
shopping.

156
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,319
Now Deng called Hu and Zhao his "left and
right hands."

157
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:25,790
Together, they implemented Deng's economic
reforms.

158
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,970
But they had their eye on some political reforms
as well.

159
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,319
They proposed an increase in government transparency,
and pushed for greater accountability from

160
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,459
officials, Hu believed in more freedom of
speech and of the press.

161
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:42,009
They also launched an anti-corruption campaign
that even targeted the children of top-ranking

162
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:43,470
Party elders.

163
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,790
Hu Yaobang apologized for the misrule of Tibet
by the Party and pushed for greater Tibetan

164
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,709
autonomy.

165
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:53,949
What happened?! Why can't we have that China?!

166
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:58,329
Well, that's where the Party hardliners, or
"conservatives" come in.

167
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:02,600
They weren't too fond of that whole, let's
loosen the reins of power and let's investigate

168
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,170
our children thing Zhao and Hu were proposing.

169
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,999
Ultimately Hu alienated a lot of people and
was forced to resign.

170
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:10,720
Sorry Tibet!

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,189
Problem is, even though he made a lot of enemies
in the Party, he was really, really popular

172
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,420
with the people.

173
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,059
And so when he died in April 1989, 50,000
students came to Tiananmen Square to participate

174
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,279
in his memorial service.

175
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,540
Then they figured, well, while we're here,
might as well hold some protests. And the

176
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,339
hardliners thought, eh, not so much.

177
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,389
The Tiananmen Square Massacre marked the end
of the hope for political reform.

178
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:38,040
Li Peng, the premier at the time, pushed for
getting the students out of the Square by

179
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,959
force declared martial law on May 20

180
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,899
and he and other hardliners blamed Zhao Ziyang
for the protests and got him stripped of all

181
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:46,319
power.

182
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,420
Zhao Ziyang spent the next 15 years under
house arrest until his death in 2005.

183
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,970
But now there was a problem.

184
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,319
I mean, besides the piles of corpses in the
streets of Beijing.

185
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,120
Zhao was supposed to be Deng’s successor.

186
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,759
Who would replace Deng as the "Paramount leader?"

187
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,949
They needed to find a compromise, someone
conservative enough to please the hardliners,

188
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,759
but not so conservative that they would stop
Deng's economic reforms.

189
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,399
And that man in the end was Jiang Zemin, the
Party Chief of Shanghai.

190
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,309
He had quickly supported the hardliners' decision
to use force against the students, which they

191
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,050
liked, and he had taken care of a little problem
for Deng, which he liked.

192
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,550
The thing is, no one really liked Jiang.

193
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,949
Nowadays, the Chinese youth today lovingly
refer to Jiang as haha.

194
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:28,689
That's because he kind of looks like a toad,
which in Chinese is hama.

195
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,129
So they just changed a letter and turned him
into a living joke.

196
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,120
And that's about as much respect people had
for him back then too.

197
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,970
Since he was from Shanghai, he had a very
small powerbase in Beijing.

198
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,370
The Beijing clique, as it came to be known,
was led by Beijing mayor Chen Xitong, who

199
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,129
became Jiang's political rival.

200
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:52,589
It was even believed that prominent a military
general and his brother, the President of

201
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:55,180
China, were plotting a coup against him.

202
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,100
That was only stopped when Deng Xiaoping,
who still was wielding real power behind the

203
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,839
scenes, forced the president to retire, and
gave the position to Jiang,

204
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,709
making him both the head of the Communist
Party and the quote un quote president of

205
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,689
China, a tradition that carries on to this
day.

206
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,050
That's not to say Deng liked Jiang either.

207
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,350
During his famous Southern Tour in 1992, he
specifically stopped by Shanghai, Jiang's

208
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,920
powerbase,

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,680
and said the pace of economic reform wasn't
fast enough, and that "central leadership,"

210
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,009
in other words Jiang, was to blame.

211
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:32,869
That was also right around the time Deng appointed
Jiang's successor, Hu Jintao, who would replace

212
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:35,990
Jiang at the 2002 National People's Congress.

213
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,519
Hu Jintao was the man Deng really wanted to
carry on his policies.

214
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,579
So Jiang had until Hu came to power to create
for himself a powerbase, or else possibly

215
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,519
face the kind of political purge that befell
so many others.

216
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,399
So he started purging all the other jerks
that got in his way.

217
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,079
First up was Chen Xitong, who was thrown out
of office in 1995 after a corruption investigation,

218
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,339
and then sentenced to 16 years in jail.

219
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,619
His son was also sentenced.

220
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,999
By the way, you'll want to remember that whole,
corruption investigation as a ploy to take

221
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,850
out your political rivals.

222
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,709
It happens kind of a lot.

223
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,839
However, because Jiang focused all his energy
on internal political struggles, China wasn't

224
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,420
in such great shape.

225
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,899
Systemic government corruption, a surge in
organized crime, unemployment, environmental

226
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:23,129
destruction,

227
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:27,329
and an ever-growing wealth gap threatened
the regime's grip on the country.

228
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:29,680
Whoa, I'm getting déjà vu.

229
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,970
So what did Jiang do?

230
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,240
He began a massive propaganda campaign to
show how great he was.

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,350
Starting sometime after 1996, he made sure
state-run People's Daily and the 7pm CCTV

232
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,179
national news always carried stories about
him as the top news.

233
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:51,439
That was a policy that would remain in effect
until 2006; four years after Jiang officially

234
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,819
stepped down.

235
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:58,100
At the same time state-run media was praising
him, he was also using it to crush his political

236
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,059
opponents, like Chen Xitong.

237
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,579
That didn't sit too well with other Party
leaders.

238
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:08,329
Using the media to smash political rivals
and promote a personality cult was something

239
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:10,019
that fell out of favor

240
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,449
after Mao Zedong kind of used it to ignite
the chaos of the Cultural Revolution,

241
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,459
so it was pretty frowned upon in the Deng
Xiaoping era.

242
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:23,009
And when Deng died in 97, Jiang lost the closest
thing he had to support.

243
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:28,410
So as the 1990's were coming to a close, Jiang's
position looked shakier than ever.

244
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,050
Jiang needed something that would cement his
power after retirement.

245
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,649
And in China, there's one way for that to
happen: Control the police, control the army.

246
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,079
But how was he going to do that?

247
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:45,240
On April 25, 1999, Jiang got his answer.

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,110
Now as someone trying desperately to stay
on top,

249
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,220
why won’t any of those jerks just like him?

250
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,679
It must have been frustrating Jiang Zemin
to see how incredibly popular Falun Gong,

251
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,519
and its founder Li Hongzhi, were becoming,
seemingly without even trying.

252
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,779
Li was even invited to speak at government-sponsored
events, like this event hosted by the Ministry

253
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:06,920
of Public Security.

254
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,439
And after that event, the People’s Public
Security Daily wrote an article praising Li

255
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,800
for his contributions

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,179
"in promoting the traditional crime-fighting
virtues of the Chinese people, in safeguarding

257
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:21,589
social order and security, and in promoting
rectitude in society."

258
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,999
Come on, People’s Public Security Daily,
what about Jiang Zemin’s contributions to

259
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,540
"safeguarding social order and security?"

260
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,499
Now wouldn't it be great, if Jiang could take
Falun Gong down a peg, while at the same time

261
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,009
cementing his own power base in the Party?

262
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,389
Remember, Jiang rose to power by supporting
the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

263
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,439
He knew what kind of fears mass movements
could inspire in the Party and he learned

264
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:46,920
his lesson from that.

265
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,519
So for the later half of the 90s, Jiang tried
repeatedly to make Falun Gong seem like a

266
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,739
threat.

267
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:56,999
China has a history of rebellions being started
by mystics and religious leaders, so if he

268
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,069
could make Falun Gong look dangerous,

269
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:03,029
he could convince the other Party officials
that they needed to fight the threat by beefing

270
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,829
up the security apparatus, which he could
then control.

271
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:09,720
So Jiang could be the valiant savior of China.

272
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,749
But Jiang's greatest enemy stood in his way--facts.

273
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:18,019
Jiang launched a nationwide investigation
into Falun Gong trying to dig something up

274
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,540
he could use against them.

275
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,679
And since this is China after all, investigations
usually involved tapping phone lines, spying

276
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,009
on people, and raiding homes.

277
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,989
No expense was spared.

278
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:35,779
And the investigation, well, let's just say,
they didn't turn up anything.

279
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:40,420
In 1997, China's Public Security Bureau launched
an investigation to determine whether Falun

280
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,009
Gong should be labeled a “heretical organization”

281
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,449
They determined, "No evidence has appeared
thus far."

282
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:51,550
In 98, an investigation by the National Sports
Commission of China concluded, "We’re convinced

283
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,679
the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are
excellent.

284
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,679
It has done an extraordinary amount to improve
society’s stability and ethics.”

285
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,139
An extremely influential retired general in
the People's Liberation Army, with impeccable

286
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,679
Party credentials, Li Qihua,

287
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,529
who said he began fighting the communist cause
when he was 10, wrote an article saying China's

288
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,209
leaders should look kindly on Falun Gong,

289
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,799
and that they should actually start practicing
because it would improve their physical and

290
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,370
mental health.

291
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,699
And an investigation by Qiao Shi, Chairman
of the National People's Congress, third most

292
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,519
powerful person in the Communist Party,

293
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,329
and biggest political rival of Jiang Zemin
at the time, found,

294
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,580
"Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the
Chinese people and nation, and does not a

295
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,149
bit of harm."

296
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:38,809
It's like these idiots have something against
launching a baseless political campaign against

297
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,380
harmless people!

298
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,820
Don't worry though, that would actually be
one of the last things Qiao Shi did as a public

299
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,320
official. With the help of Bo Yibo, father
of Bo Xilai,

300
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,039
Jiang defeated Qiao Shi in a power struggle
and forced him into retirement.

301
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,760
So the investigations weren't really working
out, but gosh darn it, that wouldn’t stop

302
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,640
Jiang Zemin from trying to discredit Falun
Gong.

303
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,880
In 1996, the Falun Gong books, which were
bestsellers, were banned from official publication.

304
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,350
In 98, articles attacking Falun Gong start
appearing in state-run media.

305
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,240
Police began stopping people from exercising
in parks, and started searching people’s

306
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,529
homes.

307
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:20,529
And on April 25, 1999, Jiang Ze Min finally
got what he was looking for.

308
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:24,870
10,000 Falun Gong practitioners assembled
outside the Central Appeals Office, right

309
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,760
next to Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound
of the Communist Party.

310
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,220
They were petitioning in response to the arrest
and beating of 45 practitioners in Tianjin

311
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,840
the previous day.

312
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,850
They lined up, appealed for official recognition
and an end to escalating harassment, and hours

313
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,159
later, left as quickly and quietly as they
came.

314
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:50,690
It was the largest demonstration in Beijing
since the 1989 Tiananmen Protests.

315
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,200
Jackpot!

316
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,019
So what, if the premier, Zhu Rongji, met with
the Falun Gong practitioners, and the issue

317
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,490
was peacefully resolved.

318
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,700
Jiang Zemin was there to stoke the flames.

319
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,470
He argued that if they didn't act quickly,
the Party would lose control of China!

320
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,299
Don't worry though!

321
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,230
Jiang said he could wipe out Falun Gong and
in just three months.

322
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,269
The only problem is, Jiang said, since there
were 70-100 million Falun Gong practitioners,

323
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:21,309
they had “infiltrated” all levels of the
Party, even the highest ranks of the military

324
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,370
and security bureaus.

325
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:28,610
So it would be necessary for him to create
a security force that had unlimited power

326
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,990
and existed outside the law,

327
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,080
and outside the control of any other government
body and answered only to him or someone appointed

328
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,370
by him.

329
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,510
And that was how Jiang Zemin created the 610
Office, named after the day it was created,

330
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:47,580
June 10, 1999--almost a decade to the day
of the Tiananmen massacre.

331
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,929
And the 610 Office sprang into action on July
20.

332
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:54,690
Journalist Ian Johnson, who won a Pulitzer
Prize for his coverage of the crackdown on

333
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,679
Falun Gong, describes the purpose of the 610
Office was,

334
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,870
"to crush Falun Gong, no measures too excessive.

335
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,799
Within days a wave of arrests swept China.

336
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,850
By the end of 1999, Falun Gong adherents were
dying in custody.”

337
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:13,090
Now giving this kind of unlimited power to
Jiang Zemin, that didn't sound too appealing

338
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,240
to the other 6 members of the Politburo Standing
Committee,

339
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,250
the highest echelon of power in China.

340
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,559
Especially Hu Jintao.

341
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,450
But Jiang bought off Li Lanqing by making
him the first head of the ultra powerful 610

342
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,100
Office.

343
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,710
Li Peng didn't have too much of a problem,
because, well, he did push for the Tiananmen

344
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,240
Square Massacre, so he didn't mind bloodshed.

345
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,720
But also because Jiang had already made his
protégé Luo Gan the head of the Political

346
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,380
and Legislative Affairs Committee.

347
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,830
Which controls all of China's internal security
forces and wink wink was about to see a major

348
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,860
expansion, and promised him control of the
610 office after Li Lanqing stepped down.

349
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,740
As for the other three they didn't really
support the persecution.

350
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,070
And, funny thing, they didn't have careers
after 2002.

351
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,090
That was during the 16th National People's
Congress.

352
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,220
Not only did Jiang knock out his rivals, as
the final kicker, he upped the number of Standing

353
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,360
Committee Members to 9, filling the extra
spaces with his people

354
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,019
Man, Luo Gan really had a lot of power.

355
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,330
Jiang Ze Min had finally fixed his game.

356
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,549
He was able to retire in 2002 and control
things from behind the scenes just as his

357
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,049
predecessor Deng Xiao Ping had done.

358
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,190
And maybe now everyone will love him!

359
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,669
So even though Hu Jintao officially became
China’s top leader that year, he and his

360
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,110
premier Wen Jiabao had next to no power.

361
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,620
That's why Jiang, technically retired, would
always sit right next to Hu at important meetings

362
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,630
and meet personally with important world leaders.

363
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,710
Wow, look at those two.

364
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,690
The political future that Deng Xiaoping had
given Hu Jintao had been stolen by Jiang Zemin.

365
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:53,450
That's how Hu went from this happy go lucky
guy, to wood face, as some Chinese started

366
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,559
calling him.

367
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,940
Meanwhile, the 610 Office, along with the
number of police and secret police, kept growing

368
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,159
in size and power.

369
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:06,179
Officials were using eliminating Falun Gong
as the main excuse to amass personal fortunes.

370
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,580
The message was clear: if you want to move
up in the Communist Party, help persecute

371
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,019
Falun Gong.

372
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:15,269
No one took that to heart quite like this
guy, Zhou Yongkang.

373
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:20,750
He used to be the Party Secretary of Sichuan
Province from 2001-2002.

374
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,789
But then he made a very important life decision.

375
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:28,720
Some people, like his own son, think he had
his first wife murdered.

376
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,620
That way, he was able to marry Jiang Zemin's
niece.

377
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,639
And suddenly he went from an official in way
out Sichuan, to being hand selected by Jiang

378
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,230
as head of the Ministry of Public Security,

379
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,830
even though he had no experience with police
work.

380
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:48,710
Then, in 2007, he got on the Politburo Standing
Committee, and replaced Luo Gan, becoming

381
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,950
the head of both the PLAC.

382
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,940
That's the organization that controls all
those police, secret police, paramilitary

383
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,470
police, and pretty much the entire legal system,
plus, the 610 Office.

384
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,750
No one has ever made it into top leadership
by working for the security forces. Until

385
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,799
Zhou Yongkang.

386
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,850
Zhou grip on power grew by massively expanding
China's labor camp system.

387
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,799
At its peak, half of all those detained in
China's labor camps were Falun Gong practitioners.

388
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,019
Not only that, but for a few years he was
able to get a budget for China's internal

389
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:25,370
security forces worth billions more than the
army's budget.

390
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:31,760
He also had a staff of 10 million, while there
were only 2.5 million in the army!

391
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,570
But while Jiang and his allies used persecuting
Falun Gong to glut their power, there was

392
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,760
one tiny little problem.

393
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,630
Instead of being wiped out, Falun Gong grew
and spread around the world.

394
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,070
And one thing they seemed pretty fond of doing
was exposing everything Jiang and his cronies

395
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,210
were doing.

396
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,710
Jiang’s persecution of Falun Gong was becoming
a huge liability and an international embarrassment

397
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,990
for China.

398
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,990
The end result was a political stalemate between
Jiang's faction, and Hu Jintao's.

399
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,649
And that's why up until 2012, no significant
political changes and decisions were made

400
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:08,740
in China.

401
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,740
The Communist Party was in deadlock.

402
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,750
The very power that Jiang’s side had gained
through persecuting Falun Gong became the

403
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,080
biggest weapon of their rivals.

404
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,940
And it was about to all come crashing down.

405
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,370
If we've learned anything from the Communist
Party, it's that the power struggle isn't

406
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,929
over until the fat lady sings.

407
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,330
Even though Jiang retired and moved his people
into position, they’re not safe.

408
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,309
Now that they’ve amassed all this power
by persecuting Falun Gong, they've got a giant

409
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,909
target on their backs.

410
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,269
So now it’s time to play Communist Party
Takedown™.

411
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:44,480
That's a registered trademark.

412
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,179
Who’s our lucky first contestant?

413
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,289
Looks like it’s everybody’s least favorite
princeling, Bo Xilai!

414
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,460
Bo is the son of prominent Party elder, Bo
Yibo.

415
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,789
You might remember him from the last episode,
when he helped Jiang get rid of a little problem

416
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,200
named Qiao Shi in 1998.

417
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,110
In return, Jiang made Bo Xilai one of his
people, and helped him move up the Communist

418
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,080
ladder.

419
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,179
Now let's meet contestant number two!

420
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,600
Bo Xilai’s right hand man, Wang Lijun.

421
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,809
When Bo and Wang were in Liaoning province,
they both persecuted Falun Gong practitioners

422
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,279
with gusto.

423
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,500
Bo expanded the labor camp system, and more
Falun Gong adherents were sent to labor camps

424
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,120
there than in any other province.

425
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,769
There’s also evidence that Wang Lijun personally
oversaw forced organ harvesting from Falun

426
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,669
Gong practitioners.

427
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:39,110
So for taking part in his benefactor's genocide,
lets see what they won, folks!

428
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,850
Promotion after promotion!

429
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,169
Now he could stop there, or risk it all for
whatever's behind these doors.

430
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,799
Behind door number 1, is a fabulous promotion
to the position of Vice Premier, followed

431
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,779
by membership in the 9-member Politburo Standing
Committee,

432
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:59,470
The inner, inner circle of the Party--possibly
by taking over the seat of fellow Jiang faction

433
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,130
member and persecution buddy, Zhou Yongkang,
when Zhou retired.

434
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,019
That would make him the heir of the Jiang
faction.

435
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,389
And maybe even someday…the supreme leader.

436
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:12,169
Instead he choose what's behind door number
2.

437
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:16,279
Purged, sorry Bo. That's how things go sometimes.

438
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:22,279
You see, then leaders Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao
started fighting back against Jiang’s faction.

439
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,309
So Wen said that Bo was too much of a liability
to become vice-premier, because Falun Gong

440
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,580
practitioners kept bringing lawsuits against
Bo whenever he went overseas on state business.

441
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,639
And not too many people argued.

442
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:39,350
So instead of becoming vice-premier, Bo Xilai
was sent off to become Party chief of Chongqing,

443
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,710
a huge, troubled provincial-level city in
southwest China.

444
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,029
Chongqing was supposed to be the dead end
to Bo’s career.

445
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:53,350
The thing is, Bo was ruthless and a flamboyant
self-promoter and he wasn't going down without

446
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,200
a fight.

447
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,500
He brought Wang Lijun in as police chief,
and together they struck terror into the hearts

448
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,149
of anyone who opposed Bo in Chongqing.

449
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,980
Bo also started the "Chongqing model," a mix
of populism and economic development that

450
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,070
directly challenged the leadership.

451
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,190
And got him a lot of good press.

452
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,100
Behind the scenes, Bo was still working with
Zhou Yongkang.

453
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,279
And doing things like wiretapping Hu Jintao’s
phone calls.

454
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,049
I’m gonna say, he overreached himself there.

455
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:26,700
Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao decided to take Bo
down, and they start by investigating Wang

456
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,149
Lijun.

457
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:31,750
You see, in a traditional Communist takedown,
you don’t go directly for the guy, you start

458
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,779
with his associates.

459
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:37,799
Wang and Bo both knew how Communist takedowns
work, so they both freak out.

460
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:43,690
Bo refuses to protect Wang, so Wang, afraid
that Bo will kill him, flees to the US consulate.

461
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,730
Setting in motion the most interesting year
that China journalists have ever had.

462
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:53,309
Luckily, Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, has also
possibly murdered a British man named Neil

463
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,059
Heywood.

464
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,429
So that whole thing massively distracts everyone
and partially conceals the takedown and ongoing

465
00:27:58,429 --> 00:27:59,269
power struggle.

466
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:06,220
So at the end of 2013, Wang, Gu, and Bo are
all in prison for corruption, murder, and

467
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,799
corruption.

468
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,360
Hu Jintao steps down, and instead of a rising
starlet in Jiang's camp, the new leader of

469
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,840
China becomes Xi Jinping.

470
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,759
But the power struggle isn’t over.

471
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:16,879
So who’s next?

472
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:22,320
It’s Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai’s persecution
buddy, and the next highest person in Jiang

473
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,549
Zemin’s chain of command.

474
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:28,549
I’ve talked before about how Xi Jinping
has tried to cut out Zhou’s powerbase, by

475
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:32,080
doing things like reducing the influence of
his former position,

476
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,419
ending the labor camp system Zhou expanded
to persecute Falun Gong, and investigating

477
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:41,940
Zhou’s cronies in the oil industry for,
14.5 billion dollars worth of corruption.

478
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,149
Surprisingly, by which I mean, completely
unsurprisingly, people who are willing to

479
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:50,789
beat peaceful meditators to death in order
to gain power,

480
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:55,120
are also the same kind of people who dabble
in massive amounts of corruption on the side.

481
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,919
They used the persecution to get the power,
and they used the power to get the money.

482
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,570
But Xi Jinping can just use his anti-corruption
campaign to take all of them down, so he can

483
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,970
become supreme leader.

484
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,440
And there are already signs that it’s not
going to end with Zhou.

485
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,610
Li Dongsheng, the former head of the 610 Office,
is already being investigated.

486
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,710
And there are reports that Zeng Qinghong,
who was Jiang Zemin’s right hand man, is

487
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,600
next.

488
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,059
So where has Jiang Zemin been through all
of this?

489
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:27,039
As his people get knocked down, Jiang has
tried to “stay above the fray.”

490
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,860
There were reports that he supported the removal
of Bo Xilai, so he’s willing to sacrifice

491
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,240
people in the hopes that it will end there.

492
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,620
But according to the Financial Times, Jiang
recently warned Xi Jinping that

493
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,289
“the footprint of this anti-corruption campaign
cannot get too big.”

494
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,419
Sounds like someone's getting a bit nervous.

495
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:48,039
And with rumors that his son and grandson
are being investigated, it sounds like he

496
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,149
should be.

497
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:52,629
The power struggle is still ongoing though,
because Jiang’s faction is still fighting

498
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:53,470
back.

499
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,559
They need to stay in power, so that they can
make sure the things they did to get power

500
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,679
stay under wraps.

501
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,690
So, I know what you’re thinking.

502
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,120
Chris, if Jiang and his cronies gained power
through persecuting Falun Gong, and many of

503
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,340
the Party leadership never supported the persecution
in the first place.

504
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,250
Why doesn’t Xi Jinping just stop persecuting
Falun Gong and use that to take down Jiang’s

505
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:16,299
faction, instead of using an anti-corruption
campaign?

506
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,669
First of all, don't question me.

507
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,519
Secondly, it's complicated.

508
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,590
The Falun Gong issue touches on a key issue
for the Communist Party--freedom of belief.

509
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,350
The Party has never allowed religious freedom;

510
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,279
if you want to attend church or go to a temple,
you have to go to the church or the temple

511
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,049
that are directly sanctioned and controlled
by the Communist Party.

512
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:40,659
So reversing that position and letting people
practice Falun Gong freely would be difficult.

513
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:45,460
And stopping the persecution would mean admitting
that doing it was wrong in the first place.

514
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,120
The Party has never admitted wrongdoing for
anything, except the Cultural Revolution,

515
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,840
which they only did because it directly threatened
the Party, and they managed to blame it all

516
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,570
on Mao’s wife.

517
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,649
How could they redress the Falun Gong issue?

518
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:02,190
Wouldn't the people who were imprisoned, or
those whose friends and family died, demand

519
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,009
justice?

520
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:07,159
They also have to admit that everything in
state-run media about Falun Gong for the past

521
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,549
15 years was just something they made up.

522
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,169
So bringing up Falun Gong would be a huge
political risk for Xi Jinping, especially

523
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,460
since he doesn’t have unlimited power yet.

524
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,629
So could he just, quietly stop putting Falun
Gong people in jail, and just not address

525
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,139
it publicly?

526
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:26,019
That's also impossible, because of all the
different powerbases that Jiang set up for

527
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:30,249
the persecution, like the 610 office and all
of the security departments that were under

528
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:31,070
Zhou Yongkang.

529
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,610
There would have to be a direct order from
the top of the Politburo Standing Committee

530
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,940
to stop the persecution; there's no way to
do it quietly.

531
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,340
So where does that leave us?

532
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,309
The power struggle will continue, but as long
as the persecution of Falun Gong remains unresolved,

533
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,440
it will be a problem for the Communist Party.

534
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,710
But resolving it is also a problem for the
Communist Party.

535
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,700
A decade and a half ago, Jiang Zemin said
Falun Gong would destroy the Communist Party.

536
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,710
But ironically, as Xi Jinping deals with the
consequences of decades of abuse by Jiang's

537
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,399
faction,

538
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,840
could Jiang’s persecution of Falun Gong
be what destroys the Party in the end?

539
