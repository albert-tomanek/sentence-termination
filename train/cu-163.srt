1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,870
Italy just snubbed its European allies

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,569
by signing a Belt and Road deal with China.

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:10,940
Italy hopes it’s a win-win-win.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,720
But history suggests China might get most
of the wins.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,500
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,610
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,610
Italy.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,840
It might look like a worn-out old boot

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,010
but it’s brought the world historic masterpieces

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,910
like the Sistine Chapel

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,460
the Mona Lisa

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,040
and of course the most magnificent of all—pizza.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,079
Now that is a work of art.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,149
This past weekend,

15
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:39,590
Italy again made history

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,670
by ignoring the advice of its allies,

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,149
and becoming the only G7 country to sign up

18
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,239
for China’s global infrastructure project,

19
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,700
the Belt and Road Initiative.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,160
Or, as it was initially known,

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,550
One Belt, One Really Bad Idea

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,270
for Every Country Except China.

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,000
Italy rolled out the metaphorical red carpet

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
when Chinese leader Xi Jinping

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,699
and first lady Peng Liyuan

26
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,010
arrived in Rome last Thursday.

27
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,010
The next day,

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,049
Xi Jinping met with Italy’s president,

29
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,850
Sergio Mattarella.

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,490
And like those corporate emails that everyone
hates,

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,180
Xi Jinping was all about the “synergy and
cooperation”!

32
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,729
"We want to strengthen the synergies

33
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,869
between our respective development strategies

34
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,980
to enhance cooperation in the infrastructure,

35
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,270
port, logistics and maritime transport sectors.”

36
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,880
But President Mattarella was all like

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,790
“win-win must NOT mean China wins twice.”

38
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,870
"The ancient Silk Road was an instrument of
knowledge

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,110
among peoples and a tool to share reciprocal
discoveries.

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,540
Even the new Silk Road must be a two-way street.”

41
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,790
Kudos there to the very professional translation

42
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,119
done by Mario.

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,840
Anyway, you can’t blame President Mattarella

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,540
for emphasizing the two-way street part.

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,500
Although you can maybe blame him

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,720
for signing the deal in the first place.

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,080
Because the Chinese regime has a shady history

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,460
of lending money to countries for its own
gain.

49
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,320
Like when debt-ridden Sri Lanka

50
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,209
couldn’t pay back a big Chinese loan,

51
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,720
and had to sign away its seaport.

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,620
Or when cash-strapped Greece absorbed

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,220
a ton of Chinese capital and sold the port
of Piraeus

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,629
to a Chinese state-owned company.

55
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:31,349
Of course, Greece was grateful for the money.

56
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,769
So grateful, that they even helped block EU
criticism

57
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,080
of China’s terrible human rights record.

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,170
And now comes Italy,

59
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,440
with its crushing public debt.

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,180
But instead of austerity,

61
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,410
Italy’s populist government has promised

62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,959
to use even more state spending

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,840
to climb out of the recession.

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,209
Plus Italy has some crumbling infrastructure

65
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,450
that desperately needs fixing.

66
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,460
They can’t depend on tourists to hold it
up forever.

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,040
But I was more thinking about the modern infrastructure.

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Like the Genoa Bridge that collapsed last
year.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
I can’t say it was unexpected.

70
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,010
Four other Italian bridges have collapsed
since 2013.

71
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,150
And that’s partly because a lot of Italy’s
construction

72
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,880
was allegedly built by mafia firms

73
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,040
that scammed money

74
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,900
by using weakened cement.

75
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,239
But don’t worry,

76
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,840
because now that Italy is working with China,

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,519
everything’s going to be top quality.

78
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,260
That’s why, this past Saturday,

79
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,959
Italy penned a deal with China

80
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,239
to join the Belt and Road Initiative.

81
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,159
Actually, the signing included 29 separate
deals,

82
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,450
worth a total of 2.8 billion dollars.

83
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,700
For example,

84
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,530
a deal to work together on technology for
gas turbines.

85
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,760
Which Chinese companies will definitely not
steal.

86
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,690
Pinky swear.

87
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,750
And Italy’s CDP Bank signed

88
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,980
an agreement with the Bank of China

89
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,410
to create “panda bonds”.

90
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,630
These panda bonds will let mainland Chinese

91
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,010
invest in Italian debt.

92
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,970
To me, the red flag here is that

93
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,730
they’re named after the one animal which—

94
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,930
no matter where it’s born in the world—

95
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,470
ultimately belongs to China.

96
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,450
Nothing involving pandas is ever a smart choice,
people!

97
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,199
You think these fangs are really for eating
bamboo?!

98
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,090
Anyway, Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Luigi
Di Mario—

99
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,680
What’s that, Shelley?

100
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,800
It’s Luigi Di Maio?

101
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,430
I knew it was too good to be true.

102
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,430


103
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,470
Anyway, he called the whole thing

104
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,470
not just a win-win,

105
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,470
but a win-win-win.

106
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,860
"Today is the day when the 'Made in Italy'
wins,

107
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Italy wins,

108
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,780
Italian companies win.

109
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,460
But there’s at least one Italian official

110
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,760
who’s not convinced it’s a win-win-win
for Italy.

111
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,150
Italy’s other Deputy Prime Minister—

112
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,880
wait, why does Italy have two Deputy Prime
Ministers?

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Is that normal?

114
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,650
What’s that Shelley?

115
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,910
Wow.

116
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,120
That’s... really complicated.

117
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,949
Anyway, Italy’s other Deputy Prime Minister
Matteo Salvini

118
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,160
made headlines by boycotting the signing ceremony.

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,330
Instead, he attended an event in northern
Italy

120
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,550
where he told reporters that doing deals

121
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,389
with the Chinese Communist Party

122
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,970
is risky business.

123
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,680
Salvini said “Don’t tell me that China

124
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,479
is a country where the free market prevails,

125
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,410
where the state doesn’t interfere in the
economy,

126
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,630
in the legal system,

127
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,630
in information.”

128
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,360
Yeah, I’m going to have to agree with

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,960
Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister on this one.

130
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,070
The second Deputy Prime Minister, I mean.

131
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,750
The European Union is also not thrilled with
Italy

132
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,710
jumping aboard the Belt and Road train.

133
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,919
The EU’s budget commissioner said that

134
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,040
“The expansion of transport links

135
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,639
between Europe and Asia

136
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,919
is in itself a good thing,

137
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,460
*as long as* the autonomy and sovereignty
of Europe

138
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,389
is not endangered.”

139
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,479
But that’s the problem.

140
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
Because he then expressed “concern that
in Italy

141
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
and other European countries,

142
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,930
infrastructure of strategic importance

143
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,990
like power networks,

144
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,030
rapid rail lines or harbors are no longer
in European

145
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,910
but in Chinese hands.”

146
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,820
The EU is very connected.

147
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,890
Unified currency,

148
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,890
free trade,

149
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,460
basically no borders.

150
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,120
So what happens in Italy,

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,860
doesn’t stay in Italy.

152
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,069
It affects all of Europe.

153
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,660
Of course, that’s exactly what

154
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,000
the Chinese Communist Party is hoping for.

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
Italy is a great way for them

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
to get another foot in Europe’s door.

157
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,350
Like through investing in the Italian port
of Trieste.

158
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,180
And guess who else is yelling across the water
at Italy?

159
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,229
America!

160
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:52,580
The National Security Council said in a tweet
that

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,340
“Italy is a major global economy

162
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,810
and a great investment destination.

163
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,710
Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy

164
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,110
to China’s predatory approach to investment

165
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,430
and will bring no benefits to the Italian
people.”

166
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,319
The US government’s main concern

167
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,210
is that Italy’s Belt and Road deal

168
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,569
could be a ploy to strengthen China's military
influence

169
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,720
and could be used to spread technologies

170
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,750
used for espionage.

171
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,510
And spread them not just in Italy,

172
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,180
but potentially throughout Europe.

173
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Back in February,

174
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,919
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

175
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,710
warned that the US wouldn’t partner with
countries

176
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,060
that use Huawei technology

177
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,170
because of security concerns.

178
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,060
Some Italian politicians have pushed for a
Huawei 5G ban

179
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,780
after Pompeo’s warning.

180
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,440
But Deputy Prime Minister Luigi “Win-win-win”
Di Maio

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,620
doesn’t seem the slightest bit concerned.

182
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,400
He told CNBC that the deals he signed contain

183
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,370
“nothing for them to worry about,

184
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,669
nothing relating to 5G or any agreement

185
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,340
on strategic telecommunications.”

186
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,680
And then, he says,

187
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,819
there’s always “golden power.”

188
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,979
Golden power is special legislation

189
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,560
that gives the Italian government greater
control

190
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,850
over strategic assets.

191
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,879
But now that China’s got its first G7 country

192
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,560
hitched up to the Belt and Road train,

193
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,479
time will tell what win-win-win really looks
like.

194
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,270
So what do you think about Italy

195
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,000
signing onto the Belt and Road?

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,039
Leave your comments below.

197
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,670
And now it’s time for me to answer

198
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,520
a question from one of you—

199
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
fans who support China Uncensored

200
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,160
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

201
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,959
The Maddest Hatter asks:

202
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,250
“Do you think the Belt and Road Initiative

203
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,360
is inherently bad?

204
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,289
Or do you think it could benefit everyone

205
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,880
if the CCP stopped using debt traps

206
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,980
and turned it into a more cooperative venture?

207
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,840
Good question.

208
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,280
Investment is not inherently bad.

209
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,010
But with the Belt and Road Initiative,

210
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,269
you have to consider the Chinese Communist
Party’s

211
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,390
strategic purpose behind the investment—

212
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,709
and you can tell by what they’re investing
in.

213
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,240
China is investing in technology partnerships

214
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,040
and raw materials.

215
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,800
Chinese companies then take this know-how

216
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,230
and materials back to China,

217
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,700
whether they make, well,

218
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,930
they make everything in China.

219
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,440
China also invests in building shipping ports,

220
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,580
airports, and rail lines.

221
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,440
This is largely so they can sell those

222
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,339
made-in-China goods to all the same countries

223
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,760
they took the technology and raw materials
from.

224
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,130
If some of this strategy sounds familiar,

225
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,390
it is.

226
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,070
It’s like what European colonizers did

227
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,760
back in the day.

228
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,700
Take other countries’ raw materials,

229
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,720
manufacture everything in Europe,

230
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,820
and then sell them finished goods—

231
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,500
but don’t encourage those countries

232
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,649
to do their own manufacturing.

233
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,290
And who got rich in that scheme?

234
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,130
The colonizers.

235
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,839
So the Belt and Road strategy

236
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,040
is inherently designed to exploit other countries.

237
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,180
Not to mention building military bases,

238
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,959
like the one in Djibouti.

239
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,880
In that sense, the Belt and Road Initiative

240
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,529
is fundamentally problematic.

241
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,790
I don’t think it could ever be turned into

242
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,040
a truly cooperative venture,

243
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,209
because that’s just not what it’s designed
to do.

244
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,790
Thanks for your question, Maddest Hatter.
