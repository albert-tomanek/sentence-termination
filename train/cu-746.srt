00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,159
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,800
don’t partake in the forbidden fruit.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,679
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,239
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,540
Doing business in China.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,260
It’s a foolproof way to make huge profits.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,880
Say you’re a company like,

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,990
oh, I don’t know, Apple.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,019
You have a great, innovative, original product

10
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,779
that surely the 1.3 billion people in China
would love.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,480
Now conditions apply

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,020
any time a Western company wants to do business
in China,

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,080
but it’s totally worth it, right?

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,600
Well, it turns out,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,520
it’s a business plan that makes about as
much sense as this:

16
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,270
“You see, Phase 1: collect underpants.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,400
Phase 2...

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,660
Phase 3: Profit.”

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,660
And Apple might be discovering that

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,660
getting to Phase 3 is harder than it thought.

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,660
“This soap opera between the Chinese government
and Apple just continues…

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,770
Unfortunately, [there’s] huge opportunity
still in China,

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,760
and you just gotta kinda deal with the

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,240
bumps in the road with these types of announcements.”

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,660
Well, “bumps in the road” might not be
quite the right analogy.

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,850
It’s more like the Chinese government

27
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,530
is a giant gorilla throwing barrels at you.

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,650
And get a load of this barrel.

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,100
This is the Chinese smartphone, 100C.

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,920
Not the iPhone, as you might have first thought.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,320
It’s a company so small,

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,200
it doesn’t even appear to have its own website.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,800
And it just sued Apple in a Beijing court
for stealing its design.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,040
Apple immediately appealed the decision, of
course.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,700
So for now, the iPhone is still on sale,

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,920
and a final ruling could take a full year.

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,640
Now you might be wondering,

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,720
a no-name phone company sues Apple for stealing
its design,

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,560
when clearly it’s the other way around.

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,600
In what world does that happen?

41
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,980
China.

42
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,620
“It seems to me there could be some

43
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,870
backdoor political cronyism happening here.”

44
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
Because no matter how much money Apple invests
in Chinese companies,

45
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,629
or how willing it is to comply with Chinese
censorship,

46
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,170
the Chinese government has the same plan for
Apple

47
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,859
as it does for every Western company:

48
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,599
Lure them in with profits,

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,499
steal their intellectual property,

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,720
and make homegrown Chinese knockoffs to eventually
replace the original.

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,420
But they’ve been particularly harsh with
Apple.

52
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,590
“It reflects the challenges that I think

53
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,610
a lot of Western companies face when they
go to China.”

54
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,780
Chinese courts don’t really care about copyright.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,239
If you don’t believe me,

56
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,919
check out this photo of my new iPhone.

57
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,140
No, that’s the 100C again.

58
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,540
No, that’s an actual iPhone.

59
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,900
I mean this,

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,600
my Chinese-made “iPhone” leather carrying
case!

61
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,560
In May, Apple lost the appeal

62
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:54,599
to stop a Chinese leather goods maker

63
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,969
from putting the brand label “iPhone”
on things

64
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,509
that are clearly not iPhones.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,379
And just a few days before,

66
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,169
the Chinese regime had forced Apple to shut
down

67
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:07,879
iBooks and the iTunes movie feature,

68
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,019
just seven months after it had been launched.

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,600
This has been happening for a while.

70
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,040
This is from March 2013.

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,500
It’s a CCTV yearly exposé on scams,

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,770
defective products, and lousy customer service.

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,140
It also had some pretty rad song and dance
numbers.

74
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,700
And Apple was slammed for treating Chinese
consumers

75
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,430
differently from its other consumers around
the world.

76
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,489
The backlash was so intense,

77
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,409
Tim Cook had to issue a formal apology.

78
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,940
There’s even evidence that CCTV hired celebrities

79
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,949
to post negative comments about Apple.

80
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,359
Now this lawsuit in and of itself probably
won’t hurt Apple much.

81
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,449
By the time the court case is finished,

82
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:55,620
Apple will be onto the iPhone 7 and it will
be a moot point.

83
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,300
The real problem is that Chinese law,

84
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,620
and China’s courts,

85
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,760
are pretty much like the Wild West.

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,920
“Rules? In a knife fight?

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
No rules!”

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,060
And the hits Apple is taking in China has
some investors scared.

89
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,320
This one sold off $5 billion in Apple stock.

90
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,520
Yes, you heard me right: $5 billion.

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,299
Due in part to Chinese competitors and knockoffs,

92
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:25,579
Apple had a 26% year-on-year drop in iPhone
sales in China.

93
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,199
So what do you think of the hits Apple is
taking in China?

94
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,780
Leave your comments below.

95
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,800
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,570
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

97
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,970
See you next time.
