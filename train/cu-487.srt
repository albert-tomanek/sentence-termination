00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,969
Game of Thrones Finale Shocker

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,120
A song for the trade war

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,410
And what can happen when a Chinese company

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,930
owns an American dating app.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,420
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,220
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,749
This week’s China news headlines.

8
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:25,080
After 8 years, Game of Thrones has come to
an end.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,580
And I haven’t seen a show finale create
controversy like this...

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,820
...since the end of Lost.

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,820
But to everyone disappointed by how Game of
Thrones ended,

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,820
let me tell you,

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,930
you should at least be grateful that you got
an ending.

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,829
Because fans in China did not.

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,660
Chinese censors blocked the finale

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,350
on the Tencent web streaming platform.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,550
Why?

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,910
Because of technical difficulties.

19
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,100
That is, technical difficulties with the US-China
trade war.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,740
Yeah, China restricting Game of Thrones was
a terrible idea.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,240
“Game of Thrones is one of the most popular
shows in China,

22
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,489
with the season being viewed more than

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,610
‘550 million times on Tencent Video

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,300
during the most recent season.’”

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,329
That decision is going to make millions of
Chinese people

26
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:14,229
finally realize they’re living under an
authoritarian regime.

27
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,500
I mean, sure,

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,760
Tiananmen Square Massacre, or whatever,

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,820
but people have been waiting 8 years for that
series finale!

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,110
What’s that, Shelley?

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,829
Chinese people just watched pirated versions
of the finale.

32
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:30,170
Ok yeah, should have seen that coming.

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,540
Unlike the ending of Game of Thrones.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,340
Of course, with the US China trade war heating
up,

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,159
the Chinese regime is launching an all-out
propaganda campaign.

36
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,990
Like accusing the US of bullying China.

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,020
But sometimes the official propaganda organs

38
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,750
need a little help from the people.

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,710
Which is why a retired Chinese official

40
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,900
wrote a catchy anti-US trade war theme song!

41
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,760
Trade War! Trade War!

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,340
Not afraid of the outrageous challenge!

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,360
A trade war is happening over the Pacific
Ocean!

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,780
Wow, Mr. President, pack it up,

45
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,760
the US can’t compete with this level of
bad karaoke music.

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,290
“‘Trade War,’ is set to the tune of
an anti-Japanese song

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,209
from the 1960s film ‘Tunnel War’—

48
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,180
in which a Chinese town defends itself from
invasion.”

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,730
The song went viral in China,

50
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,100
getting over 100,000 views on WeChat.

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,480
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,780
100,000 views on WeChat?

53
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,840
WeChat has 1 billion users.

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,650
100,000 views is not viral!

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,230
This is starting to sound like a setup

56
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,650
to get unwitting Western media to report on
the song.

57
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,569
But the trade war isn’t just being compared

58
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,630
to the fight against the Japanese.

59
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,140
My favorite Chinese state-run media The Global
Times

60
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,489
is is comparing the economic trade war

61
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,920
to the actual Korean War of the 1950s.

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,569
And you know how that ended.

63
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:05,489
“Maybe some in the US believes that the
Korean War was a draw,

64
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,450
but if you know the history well,

65
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,200
you will understand it was a symbolic military
victory

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,450
of China against the US.”

67
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,580
Yes, nothing screams victory,

68
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,330
like sending wave after wave of Chinese troops
to their deaths

69
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,019
to force a draw.

70
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,830
But that’s not the perspective you’d get

71
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,680
from watching Chinese movies about it.

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,959
According to Radio Free Asia,

73
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,810
the Communist Party’s Propaganda Department

74
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,620
issued an order requiring CCTV to air anti-America
movies

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,980
everyday during prime time.

76
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,660
Most of them were set during the Korean war.

77
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,760
“The films portray North Korea as a righteous
nation

78
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,900
and the United States as an evil imperialist,

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,760
and contain scenes of Chinese soldiers

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,939
opening fire on their ‘American enemies.’”

81
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,280
Not a bad strategy to turn the Chinese people
against America.

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,829
Except of course for one small flaw.

83
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,720
You banned the finale of Game of Thrones!!!

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,569
There have also been calls on Chinese social
media

85
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,989
to boycott US products.

86
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:06,170
This strategy worked when China and South
Korea

87
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,409
had a dispute a few years ago.

88
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,299
But then messages suggested boycotting McDonald’s
and KFC—

89
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,459
and Chinese people were like nahhh.

90
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,640
Meanwhile a Chinese embassy official tweeted

91
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,890
the reason Trump hates the Chinese company
Huawei.

92
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,640
It’s that the Huawei logo looks like an
Apple cut into pieces.

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,910
There are two things that make this tweet
slightly unfortunate.

94
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,660
One, he’s using Twitter which is banned
in China.

95
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,440
And Two, he made the tweet on his iPhone.

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,250
Now that’s truly cutting.

97
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,900
But perhaps more US companies

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,310
should be banned from working with China.

99
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,940
For instance—Grindr, the gay dating app.

100
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,420
It’s owned by a Chinese company.

101
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,510
Well, according to a Reuters exclusive,

102
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,270
Grindr’s Chinese owner,

103
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,100
“gave some Beijing-based engineers access

104
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,430
to personal information of millions of Americans

105
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,650
such as private messages and HIV status.”

106
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,710
Talk about the potential for blackmail.

107
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,470
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the
US

108
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,720
has now told the Chinese company to sell Grindr,

109
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,200
because they consider Chinese ownership of
the app

110
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,140
to be a national security risk.

111
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,220
I wonder why.

112
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220


113
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,050
Of course not all US companies are having
a hard time in China.

114
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,170
Oreo is doing quite well, thank you.

115
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,332
I mean, it’s basically the cookie version
of the Yin-Yang symbol.

116
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:28,510
But more specifically,

117
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,150
they will be releasing “six new flavors
of Oreo cookies,

118
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,410
including Chaozhou-style barbecued-pork pastry

119
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,080
and honey red-bean cake.”

120
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,000
Sorry folks, those flavors will only be available
in China.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,190
And a promotional video for Oreos has gone
viral.

122
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,400
It shows the Palace Museum at the heart of
Tiananmen Square

123
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,330
being made out of cookies.

124
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,910
Unfortunately for the company,

125
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,190
the Chinese foreign ministry released a statement
saying

126
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,420
the video proves Oreos have been a part of
Chinese territory

127
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,900
since ancient times,

128
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,290
and has seized control of the business.

129
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,100
From now on Oreos will only be red and yellow,

130
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,070
and taste like the bitterness of the struggle

131
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,040
against American imperialism.

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Former Vice President

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,480
and current presidential candidate Joe Biden

134
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,600
has been criticized on the campaign trail

135
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,040
for being soft on China.

136
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,810
And now reports are questioning

137
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,870
his son Hunter Biden’s ties to China,

138
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,200
including how he became a very rich man

139
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,500
at the same time his father was negotiating
with China.

140
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,980
That’s according to the 2018 book “Secret
Empires:

141
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,520
How the American Political Class Hides Corruption

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,580
and Enriches Family and Friends.”

143
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
“The vice president is negotiating

144
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,280
a bunch of very sensitive issues with the
Chinese,

145
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
including the South China Sea,

146
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,740
trade, tech transfer, etc.

147
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,020
Shortly after they return to the US,

148
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,870
Hunter Biden’s firm receives a $1 billion
private equity deal

149
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,710
from the Chinese government.”

150
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,240
And according to the Intercept,

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,580
Hunter Biden’s investment company in China,

152
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,470
Bohai Harvest RST,

153
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,300
has invested in facial recognition technology

154
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,020
that’s being used to monitor Uighurs in
Xinjiang.

155
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,050
Nothing to see here, folks.

156
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,310
But not everyone is so thrilled about the
Chinese government.

157
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,020
A local Fox News station in Los Angeles

158
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,270
got ahold of undercover footage of Falun Gong
practitioners

159
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,070
being abused in Chinese labor camps.

160
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,240
I can’t actually show it to you,

161
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,270
because YouTube would probably age-restrict

162
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,460
or demonetize this video.

163
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,160
But I’ll provide the link below.

164
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,030
They did an excellent 9-minute report

165
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,770
and I encourage you to watch it.

166
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,690
Canada is sending a delegation to China to
appeal

167
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,280
for the release of two Canadians.

168
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,160
The two Canadians were accused of spying,

169
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,380
but it's much more likely their detention
was retaliation

170
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,760
for Canada detaining Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou.

171
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,150
They’ve been in jail for months.

172
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,850
But the delegation might not do much good.

173
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,470
According to Canada’s former ambassador
to China,

174
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,070
the relationship has gotten so bad,

175
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,190
Chinese leader Xi Jinping

176
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,110
won’t even pick up a call from Trudeau.

177
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,370
The hardest part for Trudeau?

178
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,120
Wondering when he’ll get to hold those pandas

179
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,380
in his arms again.

180
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,310
What a tragic loss for all peoplekind.

181
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,350
In a sign that maybe Hong Kong isn’t doing
so well,

182
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,930
two Hong Kong activists had to flee—

183
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,780
and were granted asylum in Germany.

184
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,640
The two pro-democracy activists were involved

185
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,130
in a 2016 protest that turned violent.

186
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,630
They jumped bail and turned up in Germany,

187
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,800
recently disclosing they were granted asylum
status.

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
One of them said,

189
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,150
“If the German government thinks that

190
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,840
the Hong Kong judiciary is independent,

191
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,070
they would not grant me refugee status.

192
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,750
It’s because they think that Hong Kong

193
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,790
uses the judiciary to persecute Hong Kong
people.”

194
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,919
This of course is happening as Chinese officials

195
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,060
are really encouraging Hong Kong

196
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,080
to pass new extradition laws.

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,770
The laws would allow the easy extradition
of people

198
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,210
from Hong Kong to Mainland China.

199
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,580
The kind of laws that would,

200
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,210
I don’t know, make two Hong Kong pro-democracy
activists

201
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,910
feel like they need to flee the country

202
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,900
because they won’t get a fair trial.

203
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,340
And that does it for this week’s China news
headlines.

204
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
Before you go,

205
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,550
it’s time for me to answer a question from
one of you—

206
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,170
a fan who support China Uncensored

207
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,950
with a dollar or more per episode,

208
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,600
by contributing through Patreon.

209
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,890
Today’s question comes from:

210
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,890
Joel Neatrour

211
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,470
“May I have China Uncensored's permission

212
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,330
to appropriate Pepe the Pooh in social media?”

213
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,360
Ahhh, Pepe the Pooh.

214
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,880
One of my favorite creations from the show,

215
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,560
and a great illustration by our video editor
Seamus.

216
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,710
It’s a horrendous-slash-delightful mashup

217
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,630
of Pepe the Frog and Winnie the Pooh,

218
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,800
creating the ultimate in China meme trolling.

219
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,400
Anyway, yes, you have my permission.

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,190
Spread Pepe the Pooh far and wide,

221
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,810
to the deepest corners of the Internet.

222
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,140
Fill the 4chan forums with it.

223
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Even 8chan.

224
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Tweet it.

225
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Instagram it.

226
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,620
This is China Uncensored’s gift to humanity.

227
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Treasure it.

228
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,140
I’ve put a download link in the Description
below.

229
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,260
Thanks for your question, Joel.

230
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,890
And thanks to everyone watching!

231
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,500
We could not make this show without your support—

232
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,360
whether it’s supporting us through Patreon

233
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,940
or just watching and sharing the show

234
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,630
with your friends and family.

235
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,970
So thank you from me and everyone

236
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,890
on the China Uncensored team.

237
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,280
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

238
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,380
see you next time.
