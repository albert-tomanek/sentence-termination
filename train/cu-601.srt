00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,580
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,340
I'm your host, Chris Chappell

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,300
I here, outside Hong Kong's legislative council building,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,960
also known as LegCo.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,520
In Hong Kong, some of the biggest news over the past few weeks

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,040
has been the oath-taking scandal.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,700
Two newly-elected pro-indendence Hong Kong lawmakers

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,360
Sixtus Baggio Leung and Yau Wai-ching,

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,380
from the Youngspiration party,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,560
took their oaths to join Hong Kong's Legislative Council.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,460
But they brought out flags that said Hong Kong is Not China,

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,040
called Hong Kong a nation,

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,680
and referred to mainland China using a slur

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,200
used by the Japanese in World War II.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,820
That did not go over very well.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,440
The the controversy escalated when China's National People's Congress

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,300
issued a rare "interpretation" of Hong Kong's Basic Law

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,080
that effectively disqualified both elected lawmakers from taking office.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,600
Now, Hong Kong chief executive and daywalking vampire CY Leung

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,080
has suggested implementing Article 23,

21
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,440
a Draconian national security law

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,400
that would basically allow Chinese police to go after anyone in Hong Kong

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,440
accused of “subversion.”

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,380
It would make Hong Kong’s freedoms look closer to those in Beijing.

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,580
CY Leung's government dropped another bombshell

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,160
when it announced it wants to disqualify four other pro-democracy lawmakers

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,440
who protested while taking their oaths of office.

28
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,500
Unlike the Youngspiration duo,

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
these lawmakers' oaths were accepted by LegCo

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,900
and they are already in office.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,880
Don't worry, though,

32
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,240
the government promises there were "no political considerations involved" in their decision.

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,440
One of the targeted lawmakers is well-known activist Leung Kwok-hung,

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,160
also called Long Hair. 

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,260
He’s clearly guilty of subversion,

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,420
because when he took his oath of office,

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,180
he held a yellow umbrella,

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,120
a symbol of the Umbrella Movement, and called for universal suffrage.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,560
I sat down to interview this hostile subversive force earlier last week,

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,200
before the government announced it would try to remove him from office. 

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,940
Mr. Leung, thank you for joining me today.

42
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,560
I know you're also known as "Long Hair."

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,780
Why is that?

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,780
Well, you can see it!

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,460
What can you call me when you see I wear this length of hair?

46
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,860
So, "Long Hair."

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,700
Is there a nickname you could give me, based on my physical appearance?

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,900
So you've lived in Hong Kong your entire life,

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,560
you've been a member of the Legislative Council for twelve years,

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,480
How have you seen the political situation in Hong Kong change over the years?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,900
What happened after the PRC joined the WTO

52
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,120
their attitude toward Hong Kong,

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,240
or more precisely, their global strategy, has changed.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,200
So you think that gave them the feeling that they could flex their muscles a little more?

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,540
Yes, yes, yes...

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,760
Now I heard rumors that recently there was a fight in the Legislative Council

57
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,840
that involved luncheon meat.

58
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,140
It sounds like you guy have a little more fun than the US legislature. Is that true?

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,800
The story is that, since I was a major filibuster,

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,120
a legislator from the pro-Beijing side -

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:23,440
he claimed that if I do the filibusting,

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,260
Per minute, it cost a lot of money,

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,240
he counted it by the luncheon meats.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,200
That's why. I showed them the luncheon meat,

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,260
"You need to pay back the luncheon meat."

66
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,520
And then I throw it to them,

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
And they throw it back.

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,600
It's like a volleyball game or whatever.

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,180
If it really were about money, wouldn't you have thrown a more expensive cut of meat?

70
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,640
I know you were a big supporter of the Umbrella Movement.

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,300
How do you feel about it now, two years later?

72
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,240
I think a lot of people

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,660
got their first empowerment in their own life.

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,560
Hundreds of thousands of people turned to the streets

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
and blocked the roads for almost 80 days.

76
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,620
But the government didn't respond.

77
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,500
And eventually, the occupation died down.

78
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,220
And I think a lot of people, young people,

79
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,340
they feel very frustrated.

80
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,400
So I want to talk about the latest political issue in Hong Kong.

81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,480
What's been the reaction in the Legislative Council

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,520
to Beijing's "interpretation" of Hong Kong Basic Law?

83
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,800
Well, I mean,

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,100
In the very beginning, we all know that it's a fake

85
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,340
because we're talking about rule of law.

86
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,420
The first thing you talk about is the constitution.

87
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,620
Okay, so,

88
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,320
the construction of the constitution was done by someone else

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,620
which is far away from our community.

90
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,700
So, you know, rule of law didn't really emerge.

91
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,880
Neither under the British rule, nor under the Chinese rule.

92
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,400
Do you think Yau Wai-ching and Baggio Leung crossed the line with their oath-taking?

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:35,400
At the end of the day, whether they're politically correct or politically right,

94
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:43,580
we need to pay full attention to facts that

95
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,500
they were chosen by tens of thousands of voters.

96
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,220
That is very important. That is

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,020
the essence of democracy.

98
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,040
Free choice, in a fair way, in a public procedure.

99
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,500
And justice.

100
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,920
And do you think their behavior can represent the young people of Hong Kong?

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,880
Partially. That's politics.

102
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,660
You can't represent all the people all the time.

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,320
So you also creatively took your oath.

104
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,180
Would you mind saying what you did?

105
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,360
It was in 2004,

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,820
and I wanted to change the content of the oath.

107
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,180
And someone told me you cannot do this.

108
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,880
And the government was very concerned, and I went to court,

109
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,040
and asked for judicial review.

110
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,120
Their opinion was that I cannot change the oath.

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,980
But I can add something before and after.

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,960
So I did it.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,620
Of course I changed the slogan,

114
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:06,240
and bring a dress code that was different.

115
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,080
A yellow umbrella, which is a symbol of the Umbrella Movement.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,480
So it's a protest.

117
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:24,740
And I know at least two other people from pro-Beijing organizations

118
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,060
have called for other lawmakers, pan-democrat lawmakers,

119
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,580
to be disqualified for their oaths, including you.

120
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,060
Are you worried about losing... - Six of them.

121
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,580
Six of them.

122
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,740
Not just two, it's six.

123
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,260
I mean, as I say, they talk.

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,640
If a government or something above the government

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,200
tried to tell the people of Hong Kong,

126
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,940
"Oh, this guy got your mandate, but I don't like him - he should go,"

127
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,360
I think it's totally irrational.

128
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,500
Because if you go to a rally, it's the most solemn thing in your life.

129
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,700
If you didn't say the oath proper,

130
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,800
and the officer will tell you, "please repeat it,"

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,740
What's so wrong about it?

132
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,020
If it's not okay, you should tell the oath taker

133
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,180
to do it again.

134
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,700
Because the most important thing is the mandate.

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,740
So are you worried at all about losing your seat?

136
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,500
No, why should you worry about it?

137
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,240
Can you worry about the rain?

138
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,900
And then the rain will not come down? I don't think so.

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,660
So at the end of the day, you think it's the people that have the power to make a change.

140
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Yes!

141
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,740
They are the master! Who is the master of the master?

142
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,160
Come on...

143
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,540
And in response to the oath-taking controversy,

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,420
Chief Executive CY Leung has talked about reviving

145
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,760
the draconian anti-subversion law, Article 23.

146
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,780
Do you think there's a chance Article 23 could be implemented?

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,880
I don't know. I don't think it's the right time anyway.

148
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,380
I think

149
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,900
In 2003,

150
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:34,700
the Chinese side wanted to make the legislation through the Hong Kong legislature - why?

151
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,420
Because they promised Hong Kong people might have the opportunity

152
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,400
to enjoy universal suffrage after the 10th anniversary of the handover.

153
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:54,140
So in 2007, 2008, there may be a thing called universal suffrage in Hong Kong.

154
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:02,820
Okay, so what they want you to do is the legislation of Article 23 in order to secure that,

155
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:09,540
the candidate of the Chief Executive would be in control politically.

156
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,820
And then they fell.

157
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,840
And then, now, they change.

158
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:24,080
They're not so keen on the implementation of Article 23.

159
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,500
But they denied the universal suffrage.

160
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,500
So if - IF - the Chinese side wanted to do the, quote unquote,

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,020
implementation of universal suffrage, they would do the same thing. That's okay.

162
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:49,160
I would like to have the interpretation of Article 23

163
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,120
first, and then you might have some kind of, quote unquote, universal suffrage.

164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,400
So I think they would like to try something.

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,780
What do you think that would mean for Hong Kong?

166
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,100
Well, it's like a sword just above your head.

167
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,180
That's hanging on a very thin hair.

168
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
One thin Long Hair.

169
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,960
Well, Mr. Leung, I really appreciate you taking the time

170
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,560
to be interviewed by us.

171
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,500
As a token of our thanks, I'd like to present you with

172
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,260
some luncheon meat.

173
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,280
Oh! Terrific!

174
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,760
I will save it, if they are going to,

175
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,540
my colleagues, the loyalists, are going to

176
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,420
walk out of the chamber in order to boycott the meeting,

177
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
they will enjoy your present.

178
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,720
I would say thank you, for them to you, very much.

179
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,500
Tell them it comes from China Uncensored.

180
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh, terrific. Thank you very much indeed.

181
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,700
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

182
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,800
Thank you for the luncheon meat.
