This is the Technical Difficulties, we are playing
Citation Needed...

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,520
Carry on, Tom(!)

00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,060
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it’s Chris Joel.

Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan –
Gary Brannan.

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,640
"Burn the cities.

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,289
"Salt the earth so that no-nothing may ever-y
there grow ag..."

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,680
Can I do that again,
because I really screwed that up?

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,960
No! And the bounciest man
on the internet, Matt Gray.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,980
Hello, live studio audience!

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,460
In front of me I’ve got an article from
Wikipedia, and these folks can’t see it.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,120
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding…

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,300
And there's a special prize for particularly
good answers, which is…

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,620
And today we are talking about the $100 hamburger.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,060
Whoa!

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,580
Tastes crap, no beef in it.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,800
Just two bread buns.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,080
Dollars.

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
“This seems like a waste!”

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,340
The worst thing was: all ones.

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,200
Well at least there's fibre content there!

22
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,379
I was thinking a single $100, which would
just look lousy.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,860
And now, Gary Brannan’s burger opinions.

24
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,860
Yes.

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,280
Too many things on top: s***.

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
McDonald’s!

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,180
Oh, depending on what you get, alright-

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,189
Wimpy.

29
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:18,320
Oh, by far the superior because they give
their prices in pence.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,479
And it comes on a plate,
like a civilised person.

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,110
Wimpy comes on a plate?

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,530
Wimpy’s, if you go into a Wimpy, and there’s
not many left, I’ll mark you,

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,039
they come on a plate,
with like a knife and fork.

34
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,039
Phrasing!

35
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,529
They do, they do.

36
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:38,939
Is this one of things that’s been invented
by a chef as ostensibly a publicity stunt

37
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,310
that needs something like wagyu beef,
or something like that?

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,969
Those do exist, I’m fairly sure there's
a $1,000,000 burger

39
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,549
with gold leaf or something out there,

40
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:46,549
but this is not that.

41
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,630
It is not actually even a hamburger.

42
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,929
Is it the genetically grown in a petri-dish
kind of one that they did?

43
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,462
Oh no, right now that’s a lot more expensive
than this is.

44
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:57,700
Oh yes, it is, isn’t it.

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,539
It's at least, like, $200
or something like that.

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,600
If it was only £100 to grow your own burger
without a cow…

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,159
I was going to say, it would still be cheaper
to slaughter a cow.

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,850
Is it a person from Hamburg?

49
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,869
Oh!

50
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,840
Or anyone with the right to vote in a township?

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,380
- What?
- It is a phrase...

52
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,900
A burger is someone who has a burgage and
therefore holds a burgage plot

53
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,280
and has the right to vote in a town.

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
- Really?
- Thank you very much.

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,400
- There you go.
- I am learning!

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,940
- Archivist fact.
- Fact.

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,580
A $100 hamburger is certainly about food,
but this is slang

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,910
for something you might do in general aviation.

59
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,410
Is this... is this Elvis?

60
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,030
Oh.

61
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,450
You have jumped ahead in my script,
but you know what,

62
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,150
yes, I am going to give you the point.

63
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes, this is the fool’s gold loaf that he-

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Yes.

65
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,890
So what's a $100 hamburger then?

66
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,070
Before we get into the fool’s gold-

67
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,340
Is it where someone rocks up and goes,

68
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,670
“I’m going to get a burger, and I’m
going to go in a plane to get the burger,”

69
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,070
and then eat the burger in the sky, and go,
“Ha, ha, ha, sky burgers.”

70
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,480
Yes, you know what, I'm going to give you
the point there.

71
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,550
It is basically an excuse
to use your plane and fly,

72
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,900
to keep your hours up, “I’m going to
go get a hamburger from that place.”

73
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,200
Wimpy!

74
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,930
I would love to see you try and land a plane
at a Wimpy.

75
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,930
Bowling alleys.

76
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,380
Oh, all slippy.

77
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,070
Also, that would be a 10,000 pence hamburger.

78
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,060
Yes.

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,540
In the environs we are talking of, in York,

80
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,590
there is a ring road around the bowling alley.

81
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,130
Now if you were to do that
about one in the morning,

82
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,280
I reckon it would be quiet enough to get a
Cessna down there.

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,060
Yes, but the Wimpy’s not open.

84
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,020
S***.

85
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,140
Elvis...

86
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,200
I forget, I think he heard about it at a party,

87
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,000
as Elvis would, you know, in the Jungle Room.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,780
My mum and dad went to Graceland, and I think
it can be described as ‘disappointing’.

89
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,960
I went there a long, long while ago-

90
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,720
It looks like a ’60s council planning officer’s
self-designed house.

91
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,460
It looks really poor from the outside.

92
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,100
That’s a really specific gag,
but he's right.

93
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,940
He is absolutely right.

94
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
It does.

95
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,360
But Elvis heard about this thing, and...

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,980
Is it a loaf of bread that's hollowed out,

97
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,950
and it's full of peanut butter, and jam, and
banana, and it's fried?

98
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,069
You have missed- it’s not banana, it is
something even worse for you than...

99
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,480
- Jelly?
- Banana ice-cream?

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,500
- Bacon!
- Oh, I forgot the bacon.

101
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,720
It is an entire loaf.

102
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,300
We are not talking like a small-

103
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,650
I mean, I will give you a point-

104
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,720
It's not, like, a little one,
it is a full loaf, hollowed out,

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,760
filled with a couple of pounds of bacon,

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,159
and peanut butter, and grape jelly.

107
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,090
So, jam, but like-

108
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,090
Oh jam.

109
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,090
Oh fine.

110
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,090
Oh yes that’s fine, yes(!)

111
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,490
Well jelly is all wobbly, it'll sq...

112
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,479
Well  it's not a children’s treat now,
is it(?)

113
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,960
Roughly how many calories does the fool’s
gold loaf…?

114
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
All of them.

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Yes.

116
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,979
All right, Price is Right rules,
closest without going over.

117
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,650
There's not a number, there's just a letter!

118
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,080
It's got an ‘about’ in here.

119
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,360
And bearing in mind the bread is baked with
margarine and oil

120
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,020
and things like that in it as well.

121
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,270
Ten thousand.

122
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,270
Ten thousand?

123
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,960
I think it's about a daily allowance.

124
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,520
I think it is about 2,500.

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Fifteen thousand.

126
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,140
Gary wins, it's 8,000.

127
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,300
Price is Right rules.

128
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,240
Only barely!

129
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm still giving you the point.

130
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,600
It is four days’ worth of food.

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,460
- Jesus wept.
- Every evening.

132
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,639
Because doesn’t he get everyone together,
goes to his private jet,

133
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,509
flies four hours or something, to wherever
this place is that makes it.

134
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,740
They have some waiting in an aircraft hangar
for him,

135
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,740
and I assume that can’t waddle out of the
aircraft hangar at this point in time.

136
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,800
They sit on the steps of the plane,
scoff it, and then fly home.

137
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,900
Where do you get this?

138
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,360
I'd like to try some of it.

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,419
Ah, right.

140
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,780
So it was made by a restaurant called the
Colorado Mine Company in Denver, Colorado.

141
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,229
Which is quite a way away from
where they were-

142
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,850
Yes, Memphis to Colorado.

143
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,850
Who invents this?

144
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,889
You can’t do that by mistake.

145
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,529
It is not like a Bakewell pudding, you know,
or anything like that.

146
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:55,199
That is genuinely someone has seen bread,
jam, bacon, peanut butter,

147
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,199
pfft, go for it.

148
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,199
Whatever happens, happens!

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,379
That is a common American sandwich though.

150
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,379
Not the size, quantity though.

151
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,539
- Peanut butter and jelly-
- Isn’t it?

152
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,879
Yes, peanut butter and jelly is a normal thing,
but the bacon's in there as well.

153
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,820
You are pretty much right – "taking his
private jet from Graceland,

154
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,719
"Presley and his friends purchased 30 of them-"

155
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,499
Whoa.

156
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,319
You can’t open a window on that plane.

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,999
That's a long four hour flight.

158
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,340
They didn’t turn the engines on though,
they just sat in the back and waited.

159
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,669
Yes, they never left the airport, they invited
the pilots to join them as well.

160
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,760
Ha, I think the pilots would be well advised
to lock the doors(!)

161
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,380
There is also something called the
‘Elvis Sandwich’,

162
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,999
and you got some of the ingredients
of this earlier.

163
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:30,999
This is a...

164
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,270
I have had one.

165
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,189
Or something that claims to be one, in a
burger place vaguely near here.

166
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,199
And it was a lot of food.

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,400
Does it start with a slice of Elvis?

168
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,960
'Cos the one I’ve had was banana, peanut
butter, bacon and-

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,979
That’s it, you have got the ingredients.

170
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:46,979
You are absolutely right.

171
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,440
Peanut butter, bacon and banana.

172
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, so that’s not as bad as it could be, then?

173
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Well, no, but erm-

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,259
If you are ordering one,
don’t order the chips.

175
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,270
You don’t need them.

176
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,889
Don’t order bacon chips either, because
you really don’t need them(!)

177
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,729
In a sandwich that pretty much killed Elvis?

178
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,199
They've thought: how could we make this more
deadly.

179
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,370
Again, I am going to give you a point.

180
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,860
It's "the sandwich that killed Elvis".

181
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Yeah.

182
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,939
Well not specifically one.

183
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,080
The many sandwiches that killed Elvis.

184
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,110
No, no, there was just one.

185
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,080
It was at the back of the theatre that night.

186
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,660
Just waiting.

187
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,270
Elvis was known for a ludicrous
calorie intake.

188
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,229
Oh, I thought he was famous for singing?

189
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:24,629
I was going to say!

190
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,260
I mean, he was famous for many things...

191
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,860
They just found it afterwards.
Oh, he can sing(!)

192
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,090
He could hold a tune(!)

193
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,240
I don’t think that the massive calorie intake
got him that Vegas residency, Tom.

194
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,300
I don’t know.

195
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,159
Hoovering up the ‘all you can eat’ buffet,
what’s left?

196
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,300
Oh don’t, I...

197
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,080
All he can eat, yes!

198
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,550
Last time I went to- it's a shaming story
but I'm going to share it with the world,

199
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,589
because this needs to be out there.

200
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,560
Last time I went to an
all you can eat buffet, right-

201
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Oh boy.

202
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I had a few beforehand.

203
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,400
I mean, there's a picture of like a big jug
of lager appearing on the table.

204
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,150
And it's one of these world buffets.

205
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,520
It's underground, there’s no windows, you
can go in there and not be judged, and just

206
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
eat whatever.

207
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,949
You want a Yorkshire pudding with custard
and chicken tikka in it?

208
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:03,949
Gonna do it, right.

209
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:04,949
Can happen.

210
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,139
I didn’t, I didn’t, I didn’t, I didn’t.

211
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,589
They were on separate plates, that's fine.

212
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,120
They didn’t have any custard, they had to
use Pepto-Bismol.

213
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,600
But there was one point later on.

214
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,710
They have an ice cream section,

215
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,350
and this was later in the evening, and I wanted
some ice cream, right?

216
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,029
And I manhandled the lid open.

217
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,800
Only afterwards I realised it should be opened
by a staff member, but you know, whatever.

218
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,720
"Mine.

219
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
Ice cream.

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
Grrr!"

221
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
Are you doing the thing where you take a plate,

222
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,080
and then you leave the plate
and take the tray?

223
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,090
Well, that's... yeah!

224
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,360
There was a point where I saw this lovely
yellow sphere there,

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,940
and I was like, that’s a lovely looking
ball of lemon sorbet.

226
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,990
It’s got a little bit of chocolate on it,
that’s exactly what I fancy right now.

227
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,459
Popped it on my plate, and I was chased by
someone

228
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,690
because I had picked up a
plastic ball pool ball

229
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,580
that had chocolate on it as decoration.

230
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,889
Stuff that looks like food near an
all-you-can-eat buffet is a recipe for disaster.

231
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:54,889
Well, that was my argument!

232
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:55,880
Ha, ha, hey!

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Thanks Matt, no-one else liked it.

234
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,579
I'm the only one that liked that,
aren’t I?

235
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,970
There is a reference: increasing fuel prices
mean that a Cessna

236
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,910
now costs about
$95-130 per Hobbs hour to rent.

237
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,170
What is a Hobbs hour?

238
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,620
It's got an imaginary tiger in it.

239
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,560
Sadly, no E, but it would be good.

240
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,519
Oh, screw that then.

241
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,519
Flying hours?

242
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,019
Or is it the time you are in the air, or something
like that?

243
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,470
The time you are off the tarmac, as opposed
to fannying around getting on the runway?

244
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,040
Yes. What might you measure that with?

245
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,080
Hobnobs.

246
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,960
A big tape measure...?

247
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,940
For time?

248
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,280
Don’t judge me, it is the way it’s always
worked for me.

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,940
You should see his watch.

250
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,520
“It’s 37 inches this afternoon.”

251
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,140
Chronometer?

252
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes, what's the chronometer called?

253
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
Geoff.

254
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,130
Swing and a miss.

255
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,160
The clue is in the question.

256
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
The Hobbs Chronometer!

257
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Yes.

258
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
It is a Hobbs meter.

259
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
It is a-

260
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,070
“Yes, I have got seven Hobbs.”

261
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,800
It is a meter that measures hours in the air,

262
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,389
but how do you measure that?

263
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,560
How do you rent an aircraft and work out the
time it has been flying for?

264
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,410
Is it triggered by when the wheels go up?

265
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,220
If you are renting the plane, you want your
Hobbs Meter

266
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,540
to not run for as long as possible,

267
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,339
because while it is running, then you're paying.

268
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,470
So what system are they using to make sure
that people don’t cheat it?

269
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,380
Airspeed meter that only comes in above the
stall speed?

270
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,380
Yes, you are absolutely right.

271
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,610
And in fact, I am going to give you a point
for landing gear as well.

272
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,980
A pressure switch attached to landing gear,

273
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,040
or an air speed sensing vane under a wing.

274
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,520
Either way, you make sure it is up.

275
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,270
Does that mean they do a lot of stalling to
get some free hours out of it?

276
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,270
Oh my God!

277
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,790
Stall all the way down, and then fly back
up again.

278
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,480
This is one of the things, it used to be how
long the electrical system was on.

279
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,610
How did people get around that?

280
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,580
Were they gliding to land?

281
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
More than that.

282
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,759
Just doing long glides?

283
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,209
Just not turning the electrics on?

284
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,209
How?

285
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,209
Yes, absolutely right.

286
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,209
Flying with the electrics off.

287
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,209
Oh, boy!

288
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,300
Get up in the air, get going – because once
you have started,

289
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,300
you don’t need the electrics.

290
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Turn them off.

291
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Oh, because it's an... engine.

292
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,440
Yes, spend 20 minutes with no radar or-

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
No cigarette lighter.

294
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
No radio.

295
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Ahh.

296
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
And no radio...

297
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,569
Your phone's got a battery, so it'll keep
playing the music, it'll be fine.

298
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,360
But you keep getting those notifications from
Spotify, and the next time...

299
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,860
...I'm in a mountain!

300
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,100
Yes.

301
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,110
There is also Tach Time.

302
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,110
Tachometer?

303
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,010
Yes, have a point.

304
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,140
What's that measuring?

305
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,140
Distance.

306
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,100
Tachometer.

307
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,940
Like in a lorry.

308
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,020
Not in this case.

309
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,060
Not for a plane.

310
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,740
Because plane not on motorway!

311
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,280
- Very good, Gary!
- Unless something has gone very, very wrong.

312
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,040
Or unless you want to rock up outside
York Megabowl one morning!

313
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,490
Good point there.

314
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,960
You won’t be laughing when I do that
in a 737.

315
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I will!

316
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:49,260
At which point we smash-cut to five days later
and York local news,

317
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,649
‘Man Lands 737 at York Megabowl’.

318
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,940
“They said I couldn’t do it!”

319
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,509
It is the speed that the engine is rotating.

320
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,100
Oh, is it the amount of rotations of the propeller,
or whatever?

321
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Yes.

322
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,260
So if it, if it is designed to run at 2400rpm,

323
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,240
you can reduce your tach time
by making the aircraft

324
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,910
go a bit slower and a bit safer.

325
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,490
So if you've been out for, say, 20 minutes
on your normal timer,

326
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,579
and then your tach time says you have been
out for three hours’ worth,

327
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,310
they know you have been bombing around going…

328
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,100
I am not entirely certain that's the noise
that a little Cessna makes,

329
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,740
as opposed to a Spitfire.

330
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,139
It is when he's making that noise in it!

331
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,820
I tell you what,
I have been on a plane with you.

332
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,139
He just does that constantly.

333
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:35,009
With the flying helmet and the mask.

334
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,449
Yes, you get funny looks at Stansted
when he's-

335
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:43,060
As you are walking past the queue to get on,
shouting “I’m the driver!”?

336
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
Driver. Yes.

337
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,500
Which, to be fair, when you're going down
a motorway

338
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,760
outside York Megabowl at one in the morning-

339
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,460
At the end of the show-

340
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,600
Congratulations Gary, you win this one.

341
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,140
Whay!

342
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,220
You win a visit-

343
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,940
I can’t believe you're cringing and you
wrote it.

344
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,340
You win a visit to a late night
electrically-boosted bathing spray,

345
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,360
run by a member of boy band Another Level.

346
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,940
It is Dane Bowers After Hours Power Showers-

347
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,960
F***!

348
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,680
You try writing a description for ‘shower’
that doesn’t include the word ‘shower’.

349
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,690
Bathing spray!

350
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,900
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel.

351
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Bye, everybody.

352
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,250
To Gary Brannan.

353
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,220
To Matt Gray.

354
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,640
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time.
