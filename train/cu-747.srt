00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,910
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,710
China’s peaceful military

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,940
just got more peaceful.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,540
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,520
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,530
Last week,

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,140
China launched its first aircraft carrier

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,369
that can proudly carry the label,

9
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:20,720
“Made in China.”

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,449
Why, they even broke a champagne bottle on
it

11
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,460
and it didn’t sink.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,130
Xinhua reported the new aircraft carrier

13
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,099
comes complete with “propulsion

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,839
and electricity installed.”

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,320
That means no more paddling.

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
Now this is a big deal for China.

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
How big?

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,390
Well, I think the Register put it best—

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,040
it’s 2.1 brontosaurus big.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,490
That's about one brontosaurus shorter

21
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,030
than the Empire State Building.

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,711
The yet-unnamed aircraft carrier

23
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,740
is based on a Soviet design

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,030
and can carry 69 aircraft.

25
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,120
China’s other aircraft carrier,

26
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,120
the Liaoning,

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,080
is a refurbished one bought off Ukraine

28
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,760
during the Soviet Union’s

29
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,010
going out of business sale.

30
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,920
Type 001A, as it’s known

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,420
now will be fully operational by 2020.

32
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,509
And don’t worry,

33
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:10,979
state-run Xinhua assures us,

34
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,640
it’s all part of China’s “peaceful development...

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,560
as well as to protect world peace.”

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,369
Ah, world peace.

37
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,240
I guess Xinhua is getting ready for pageant
season.

38
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,420
World Peace.

39
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,039
World peace.

40
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,039
World peace!

41
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,920
Definitely world peace!

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,539
It will be particularly good

43
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,590
for protecting the peace

44
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,389
in China’s territory in the South China
Sea

45
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:35,249
from those no-good, invading

46
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:37,810
Filipino fishermen.

47
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,329
The new aircraft carrier was launched

48
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,179
as part of a celebration marking the 68th
anniversary

49
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:45,350
of the People’s Liberation Army Navy.

50
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,229
It’s a little confusing because

51
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,159
they have the word “army” in there,

52
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,850
whether it’s the People’s Liberation Army
Air Force,

53
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,429
People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force

54
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:57,619
or even the People’s Liberation Army Army.

55
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,619
Maybe that's one of the things

56
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,679
that Xi Jinping will be streamlining.

57
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,029
Anyway, the People's Liberation Army Navy
celebration

58
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:06,209
was not without SNAFU—

59
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,209
a Chinese term meaning

60
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,240
the Party planned it that way all along.

61
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,340
The Ministry of National Defense

62
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,170
released this image on its social media account

63
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,940
of the Liaoning.

64
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,000
Apart from it looking terrible,

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,170
as Chinese netizens were quick to point out,

66
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,970
that’s a Russian jet,

67
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,240
those are US destroyers,

68
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,180
and those J-10 jet fighters,

69
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,070
while indeed Chinese planes,

70
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,710
are not the J-15s that are actually found

71
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,710
on the Liaoning.

72
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,790
To be fair,

73
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,780
it is much better than other government

74
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,860
photoshop attempts.

75
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,180
Now they built this incredibly fast—

76
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,060
in only four years.

77
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,280
And according to a Defense Ministry Spokesman,

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,860
the lessons learned from building it

79
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,670
“will help China build more carriers

80
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,750
faster in the future and enable them

81
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,480
to reach combat readiness quicker."

82
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,620
By comparison,

83
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,720
the United States latest aircraft carrier,

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,130
the USS Gerald Ford,

85
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,310
began construction eight years ago,

86
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,530
launched in 2013,

87
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,720
and is still being worked on.

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,350
Probably because it kept falling down stairs.

89
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,550
It is a more advanced aircraft carrier,

90
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,170
but the US has been building aircraft carriers

91
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,770
since World War 2.

92
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,730
Which explains why the USS Gerald Ford

93
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,010
is 2.4 brontosaurus big.

94
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,900
But bigger isn't always better.

95
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,000
Is this the start of a new and formidable
Chinese navy

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,020
capable of projecting its power throughout
the region?

97
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,630
Well, not so fast.

98
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,630
The speed with which

99
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,020
this new aircraft carrier was built

100
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,050
should be your first clue

101
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,070
something isn’t right.

102
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,840
There are huge technological gaps

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
between this new Chinese aircraft carrier
and others,

104
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,860
particularly with US carriers.

105
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,560
The engines are steam powered,

106
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,110
rather than nuclear.

107
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,560
It's about half the size of the the Ford.

108
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,340
It also relies on a ski jump ramp

109
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,960
to get aircraft into the air,

110
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,200
versus the catapult system the US has been
using

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,080
since World War II.

112
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,470
The problems go deeper.

113
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,819
Like a lack of a joint operations command.

114
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,160
That’s how the different branches of military

115
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,120
talk to each other.

116
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,510
Even with a shiny new aircraft carrier,

117
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,550
without a functioning joint command,

118
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,260
the PLA’s ability to project power

119
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,760
will be stunted.

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,590
I spoke to Senior Researcher and Defense Analyst

121
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,390
Andy Wolf, who described it

122
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,330
“like trying to get a baseball team,

123
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,810
a chess team and a racing team

124
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,299
to become a professional hockey team overnight.”

125
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,680
Well that sounds easy.

126
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,250
And explains why the New York Rangers

127
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,280
have recruited Derek Jeter, Dale Earnhardt
Jr.,

128
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,500
and Garry Kasparov for the Stanley Cup playoffs.

129
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,940
Another issue is,

130
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,080
China needed this yesterday.

131
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,670
If the US is carrying out military action

132
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,440
in its backyard to deter North Korea,

133
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,820
and there aren’t any Chinese naval vessels
around,

134
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,720
that makes China look weak.

135
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,670
That’s why Mr. Wolf also told me his sources

136
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,780
in the Chinese military have said

137
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,820
there’s been a surge in military activity

138
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,050
along the coast

139
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,590
and some bases have been ordered

140
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,470
on high alert.

141
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,470
But hey,

142
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,190
the Chinese regime is saying they’ve already
started

143
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,380
on a Type 002 aircraft carrier,

144
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,470
which will have a catapult system.

145
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,910
Then, they could have up to four nuclear-powered

146
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,380
Type 003s completed in the 2020s

147
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,400
that could rival US aircraft carriers.

148
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,970
And then the PLA Navy would truly be

149
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,330
a high-tech model

150
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,200
of peaceful development…

151
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
and world peace.

152
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,020
So what do you think

153
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,770
of China’s new aircraft carrier?

154
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,060
And more importantly,

155
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,530
what do you think it should be named?

156
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,310
I'm going with Aircraft McCarrier Face.

157
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,840
Leave your suggestions below.

158
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,880
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell,

159
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,760
thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.
