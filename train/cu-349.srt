1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,190
Beijing will host its second Olympics next
year

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,299
The CCP hopes for a propaganda victory

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,450
But an Olympic Boycott threatens everything

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:18,100
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,020
The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are fast
approaching.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,840
Back in 2008, the first Beijing Olympics was
an enormous propaganda victory for the Chinese

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,990
Communist Party.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,780
The entire world was fixated on the vibrant,
colorful opening ceremony.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,390
And a little less focused on the genocide
of Tibetans.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,090
Falun Gong.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,290
And Uyghur Muslims.

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,030
The Olympics changed how people around the
world thought about China and the Chinese

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,030
Communist Party.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,750
It was no longer the country of this.

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,649
But the country of this.

16
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,600
And right now, there’s a lot of things the
CCP would like people to forget.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,720
The coronavirus.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,320
Economic espionage.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,900
And of course more genocide.

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,070
Maybe another Olympics will make everyone
forget about that stuff!

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,430
But there’s a growing, international push
to boycott the Beijing Olympics.

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,780
And it has the CCP terrified.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,980
Joining me to talk about what an Olympic boycott
could do is Chris Fenton.

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,680
He’s the former president of DMG Entertainment
Motion Picture Group, and he worked in Hollywood

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,410
for two decades on some of the biggest blockbuster
movies.

26
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:41,549
He’s also the author of the new book “FEEDING
THE DRAGON: Inside the Trillion Dollar Dilemma

27
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,630
Facing Hollywood, the NBA, & American Business.”

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,490
Thanks for joining us again, Chris.

29
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,490
Yeah.

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,490
Thanks for having me, always honored.

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,490
Yeah.

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,860
So as somebody who worked in Hollywood you
got a sense for what China wants and doesn't

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
want.

34
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,659
And you've been arguing that a boycott of
the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics is a serious

35
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,400
threat to the Chinese Regime.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,729
Why is that?

37
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,729
Well it's interesting.

38
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,540
I lecture quite often at the National War
College for a soft power specialist who's

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,239
actually an active captain in the US Military.

40
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,900
His name's Captain [Corey Ray 00:00:35].

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,680
And he actually argues that boycotts themselves
aren't the most effective use of getting change

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,660
between the dynamics of multiple countries
or in a bilateral relationship.

43
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,319
So we actually came up with the idea of using
a threat of a boycott to create the leverage

44
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,160
that would constructively disrupt the US China
relationship and allow us to push for certain

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,540
changes that can get done in the next 300
days.

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,379
And I actually did an op-ed recently where
I cited some of his theory and historical

47
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:59,830
perspective on boycotts, but then also talked
about the effectiveness of actually saying,

48
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:06,690
hey look, if you don't give us these handful
of things, these check the box type of achievements,

49
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,940
then we're not showing up.

50
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,459
And there's a lot of reasons why I think that
will create the leverage we need to get the

51
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,159
change done.

52
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,269
But for a threat of a boycott to be effective
there has to be the actual threat of a boycott.

53
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,269
100%.

54
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,730
So what do you think the boycott should look
like?

55
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,909
Well I think what needs to happen is, well
first of all you have to look at the perspective

56
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,400
of China, right?

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,550
In the 2008 days, that huge summer Olympics
was sort of their coming of age party, right?

58
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:41,690
They were in this preteen adolescent state
as far as a developed nation, as far as a

59
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,209
capitalistic economic powerhouse.

60
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:51,190
That 2008 stage was, on a global platform
it was allowing them to say, here we are,

61
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,190
right?

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:58,450
Since then, in the next 13 years, they have
developed from preteen into adolescence and

63
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,030
into an adulthood stage.

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,750
So this upcoming Beijing Olympics in 2022
is really like this fancy adult dinner party

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,590
that they want to throw in a perfect manner.

66
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,569
It needs to be meticulous to detail and it
needs to have perfect attendance.

67
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,680
And if people don't show, if countries do
not show up it will be a major face issue,

68
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,490
not only for them on a global stage, but also
for them inside their own country.

69
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,840
And remember that our number one priority
is to keep 1.4 billion people just happy enough

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,680
that they don't revolt.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,600
So by putting a line in the sand and saying,
hey, we have serious things we want to achieve

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,090
in the next 300 days.

73
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,720
If you do not do that we will not show up.

74
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,440
That is going to wake them up to the fact
that we are serious and that their fancy dinner

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,590
party is in jeopardy if they don't abide by
some of the ideas that we present to them.

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,080
So for instance, the Olympic athletes might
still go to the games, but President Biden

77
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,919
might not show.

78
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,000
No.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,500
I think actually the threat needs to be followed
through if they don't.

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,639
For instance, all this provocation, all of
these pushes into Taiwan airspace, into Taiwan

81
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,560
maritime territory by the PLA, by these military
exercises, those need to stop.

82
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
If any more of those occur between now and
Beijing 2022 we simply will not show up and

83
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,270
we will try to find and get behind us others
of our Western allies to also agree to not

84
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,280
to show up.

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,389
Now if you look at who's out there that I
think can provide that strength in numbers,

86
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,479
united we stand type of discipline, I would
argue Australia would definitely be one of

87
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,479
them.

88
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,600
Canada would be another.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,430
And the UK would probably be another.

90
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,280
So between those four that's a pretty good
start.

91
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,490
I would also argue there's lots of European
nations that might back us too.

92
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,720
And on behalf of the actual athletes involved,
which by the way, none of us want to penalize

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,919
over this geopolitical issue, I would argue
that we could actually throw our own, whether

94
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,660
it's in Park City, Utah, whether it's in Vancouver
at one of the former Olympic sites in one

95
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,009
of our allies or within our own nation so
there is a way to allow them to still compete

96
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,150
yet also uphold the threat and the red line
that we put in the sand.

97
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:29,419
But we need to give them what those things
are so that we use the leverage that we have

98
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,759
over the next 300 days to actually get this
done.

99
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,260
The checklist you mentioned, what would some
of those things be?

100
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,889
You mentioned Taiwan, which if a threat of
a Olympic boycott could actually affect how

101
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,910
the Chinese Communist Party treats Taiwan,
that would be a pretty powerful thing.

102
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,910
Well think about it.

103
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,830
It's actually a bit of a baby step.

104
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,990
I mean obviously the big North Star we would
like to say is that Taiwan is no longer China,

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,830
we are not abiding by the One-China policy
anymore, you guys cannot touch Taiwan even

106
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,849
though you believe it's part of the PRC.

107
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,449
That would be the North Star.

108
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:09,850
I would say over the next 300 days there's
probably a baby step approach we can achieve,

109
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,550
which is no more provocation, no more threats,
no more thumping the chest, no more military

110
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,550
exercises.

111
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,810
You do that, the red line will be crossed,
we will not come.

112
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,510
There's other things like that that we should
do too.

113
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,669
Obviously the human rights issue is something
that's a big situation right now that's creating

114
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,169
lots of controversy.

115
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:34,710
We should have access to the Jinjiang Province
without huge prescheduled visits too.

116
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,190
And open access to everything we need to see.

117
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,470
Because quite frankly, if there are propaganda
about how they're not doing anything wrong

118
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,699
or inhibiting human rights issues when it
comes to the Uighurs, if that's actually true

119
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,449
we will see it and we'll drop that argument.

120
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,520
But the fact is, we know that's not the case.

121
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,050
When you look at the WTO designation that
we gave them back in 2001 as a developing

122
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,840
nation, I think right now we have the leverage
to say you're no longer developing nation,

123
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,340
you should be developed.

124
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,030
That right away, that little baby step, that
change in terminology will rebalance the trade

125
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,729
dynamic drastically because they will have
to abide by developed nation principles rather

126
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,310
than developing nation.

127
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,610
Those are just three examples.

128
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,850
And obviously my examples are just ideas that
I want to throw out there and get the discussion

129
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,720
going because we have 300 days left and we're
going to lose this point of leverage if we

130
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,699
don't act on it soon.

131
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,719
So why are the Olympics such an important
battle?

132
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,719
It's interesting.

133
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,510
The Olympics by itself is just a sporting
event.

134
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,909
I mean what's the big deal honestly?

135
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:49,720
But when you think about the way the Chinese
Communist Party operates in that 1.4 billion

136
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,250
people just having enough that they don't
revolt, a lot of that has to do with providing

137
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:59,380
them all of what they need and some of what
they want, but it also has to do with giving

138
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,209
them the aspirational idea that they can achieve
more if they work harder and keep moving in

139
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,660
the right direction.

140
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,830
And then on top of it, it's about promoting
the leadership that works for them, that 1.4

141
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,440
billion people as something that's respected
on a global stage as well as internally inside

142
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,560
of China.

143
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,890
So that respect on a global stage is completely
symbolic by the people that show up to see

144
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,640
what this Olympics is going to be, to see
what the communist party was able to put together

145
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,080
infrastructure wise and the kind of party
and dinner party atmosphere it's going to

146
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,390
be overall, and to be impressed with what
China has built over such a short amount of

147
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,010
time since they've really opened up over the
last 40 years.

148
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,780
And the eyes of the Chinese populace are going
to be watching every one of those moves.

149
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,200
So if anything doesn't go exactly according
to plan there's going to be doubt in the eyes

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,680
of the people that they rule and that is not
good for them if they want to keep everybody

151
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,430
content.

152
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,370
And you mentioned earlier the idea that if
Beijing does cross whatever the red line is

153
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,300
we could hold our own quote unquote games
somewhere else in the world.

154
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,080
And this is something that I've always wondered
about.

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,149
Why does the international Olympic committee,
they've just been so willing to turn a blind

156
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,320
eye to China's human rights abuses.

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,190
Well it's an unfortunate thing that goes back
to why lots of companies, lots of industries

158
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,660
are turning a blind eye to human rights abuses
and all the other things that we have issues

159
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,630
with when it comes to China or various other
countries around the world.

160
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,570
If there's money to be made, capitalism and
that reckless form of capitalism tends to

161
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,790
trump things that are maybe morally and ethically
correct or the values and principles that

162
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,850
we hold dearly.

163
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:57,150
When you look at the IOC, they not only are
looking to provide the revenues that they're

164
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:02,130
looking for from the given Olympics every
two years, but on top of it they need major

165
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,270
infrastructure put together over the course
of a decade prior to pull those Olympics off

166
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,270
well.

167
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,200
And quite frankly, one of the only kinds of
countries that's willing to put that type

168
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,900
of taxpayer money or central planning money
towards that cause happens to be centrally

169
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,250
planned countries around the world.

170
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,149
And that's why we unfortunately see more Olympics
carried on in non-democratic countries than

171
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,830
in democratic countries.

172
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:35,241
Well so for the people watching, what can
they do to help build momentum for a boycott

173
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:38,170
of the Olympic games?

174
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,200
Well that's a fantastic question.

175
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,580
And if we always look at everything stops
at the buck, that's probably one of the best

176
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,610
places to do that.

177
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,181
Since the Daryl Morey tweet, the GM of the
Houston Rockets back in October 2019 when

178
00:11:52,181 --> 00:12:00,070
he supported essentially the protest rights
of Hong Kong citizens back in that situation,

179
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:07,880
we became more cognizant as citizens, as journalists,
as policy makers, as elected officials to

180
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,680
what essentially was this head in the sand
action that companies and industries had when

181
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,420
it came to obvious human rights abuses that
were happening in China.

182
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,480
And that was all because investors benefited
from keeping that head in the sand, stocks

183
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,649
and the stock prices and the share prices
benefited, revenues benefited, profits, et

184
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,649
cetera.

185
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,959
The best way to attack that is to say to those
companies, hey, look, we will support you

186
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,959
if you support what we think is American,
what we think is the value and principle that

187
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,070
we want you to abide by.

188
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,850
We will buy your product and service.

189
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,200
And if they stop buying the products and services
of these companies, whether it's here in the

190
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,950
United States or in other Western allied markets,
those companies will start to feel it.

191
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,300
And suddenly the negative effect of what's
happening in markets outside of China will

192
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,889
counteract the actual benefits of continuing
to continue down this path with China and

193
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:12,320
hoping that the China revenues offset that
negative, right?

194
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,029
Once that imbalance gets there, suddenly they're
going to have to pay attention.

195
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,950
And it's moving that direction.

196
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:25,589
So for instance, if the American people say
we will boycott Coca-Cola if Coca-Cola doesn't

197
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,709
boycott the Beijing Olympics?

198
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,110
Yes.

199
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,000
That's probably more of a negative way to
make it work.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,139
Boycotts in general to me feel like more of
a destructive form of resulting in change,

201
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,440
but that is one way to go.

202
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,630
I think in another aspect it could be the
benefit of actually becoming a brand that's

203
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:55,360
known to uphold the ethics and morals and
American values that we think so dearly of,

204
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,520
right, and essentially allow those companies
to grow as far as the way that brand builds.

205
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,339
Almost in a Muhammad Ali type of scenario
where he took a stand on something and suddenly

206
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,930
he became bigger than the sport he actually
was a part of and he became more valuable

207
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,760
because of that.

208
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,959
That's the way I see somebody like for instance
LeBron James could do.

209
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,589
If he took a stand, says I don't want my 50
million out of China because I want to be

210
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,579
on a crusade to actually fix the wrongs in
the world, he suddenly transforms from just

211
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:35,740
the best in basketball and the best in essentially
domestic social issues to one that he is fighting

212
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,279
for on a global level.

213
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,190
And I would say that would take his $1 billion
and make it into 3 billion.

214
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,230
Well I hope...

215
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,230
That's very optimistic.

216
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,790
I hope we can see that kind of change happen.

217
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,110
Well you know what, as we talked about earlier,
I look at the China challenge, the challenge

218
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,930
that faces us and our Western allies as one
of those common causes that red and blue,

219
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,160
any type of ideology can get behind because
there's national security interests involved,

220
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,740
there's economic security interests involved,
there are justice and human rights issues

221
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,300
involved, there are freedom of speech issues.

222
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,600
Those are things that all Americans and all
people a part of the democratic world can

223
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,540
agree on and if that is what drives us to
try to fix this challenge, we're going to

224
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,870
unite in the process.

225
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,110
So China really brings us all together?

226
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,519
Well it hasn't yet, but that's my goal.

227
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,861
And that's what gets me to fall asleep at
night even though I'm thinking about all of

228
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:33,861
this all the time.

229
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:38,399
And it's what gets me up in the morning excited
to talk to people like you who are creating

230
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,360
the platform to say, hey look, everybody,
this is something that affects you.

231
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,890
I know it's a slow moving train wreck, which
is the unfortunate part about this challenge,

232
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,990
it's not something that happens right away,
but it's something we're running out of time

233
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,990
on.

234
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:59,540
Something that I look at the 2025 initiatives
that they have there and I say, you know what,

235
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,670
once they get there it's going to be hard
to get past that day of reckoning and actually

236
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,279
fix some of these things.

237
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,790
We have a ticking clock.

238
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,459
And if you talk to a lot of greater China
experts like a Matt Pottinger or a Liz Economy

239
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:15,050
or a Bill Bishop, they will say the same thing.

240
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,990
We are running out of time and we need to
wake up to this issue.

241
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,930
Well thanks so much for joining us today and
sharing this with us.

242
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,860
Absolutely a pleasure.

244
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,350
I appreciate people engaging in the book and
thank you again.

245
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,040
I'm super humbled to be on the show.

246
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,250
I'm a big fan.

247
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,930
It's been a pleasure.

248
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,720
And thank you for watching.

249
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,890
Now you have an idea of what you can do to
help make a Boycott of the Beijing Olympics

250
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,360
possible.

251
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,641
And if you’re interested in an inside look
into how China influences American society,

252
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:53,870
be sure to check out Chris’ book, “FEEDING
THE DRAGON: Inside the Trillion Dollar Dilemma
