00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,699
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:03,160
fun fact:

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,440
a live donkey,

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,810
and a tiger pit,

5
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,130
don’t go so well together.

6
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,980
Unless you’re the tiger.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,340
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,720
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,820
We’ve all been there, right?

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,660
You’re a shareholder in a zoo,

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,450
but the courts have for some reason

12
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,439
frozen the zoo’s assets for two years.

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,930
You can’t sell your stake.

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,840
Your money is stuck.

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,810
So what do you do?

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,140
Obviously, you hire a group of men

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,840
to steal the zoo’s donkey and goat.

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,850
Because you can sell them

19
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,660
to recoup your loses.

20
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,680
But then the zoo staff blocks your exit,

21
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,229
and is all like,

22
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,780
“Noooo, that’s illegal.”

23
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,460
So what do you do?

24
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,200
Obviously you get frustrated

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,199
and throw the donkey

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,199
in the tiger pit.

27
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,260
We’ve all been there, right?

28
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,260
On Monday,

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,929
zoo goers at the Yangcheng Wild Animal World

30
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,999
in Changzhou, Jiangsu province

31
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,690
watched in horror as the donkey

32
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,510
was forced down a slide

33
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,339
into a tiger pit.

34
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,439
The tiger pit,

35
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,810
having tigers in it,

36
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,120
proved to be a bad place

37
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,680
for that donkey to be.

38
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,860
Don't worry folks, the donkey was fine...

39
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,780
for dinner. The tigers ate it.

40
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,280
Luckily for the goat,

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,000
visitors and staff prevented the men

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,990
from throwing it in as well.

43
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,540
I wonder why they chose to throw

44
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,020
the donkey in first?

45
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,240
The video went viral in China

46
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,799
and the zoo has since apologized.

47
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,799
But this is just the latest scandal

48
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,429
involving animal abuse at zoos in China—

49
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:34,850
a country where,

50
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,460
let’s just say,

51
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,759
animal rights protections are a bit lacking.

52
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,480
Meet “the world’s saddest polar bear,”

53
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,799
as he came to be known.

54
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,290
He was being held in an interrogation room/exhibit

55
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,340
at the Grandview Aquarium in Guangzhou.

56
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,840
Footage of this very sad polar bear

57
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,980
went viral all over the world.

58
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,979
After public outrage at the deplorable conditions

59
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,360
the bear was living in,

60
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
the Aquarium decided

61
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,119
to move him out and make renovations.

62
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,240
The list of abuse goes on.

63
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,990
These guys were caught beating a black bear.

64
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,399
And then the guy taping it was caught.

65
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,340
This guy must be very confident the tiger

66
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,760
won’t confuse him with a donkey.

67
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,750
And ever wonder what would happen

68
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,099
if you force a bear and a couple of monkeys

69
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,260
into a bicycle race?

70
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,849
Pretty much what you’d think.

71
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,200
So what do you think?

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,620
Are you Team Tigger or Team Eeyore?

73
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,090
Leave your comments below.

74
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,150
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

75
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,489
Once again, I’m your host, Chris Chappell,

76
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,060
see you next time.
