1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,760
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,280
can we trust China to honor its promises?

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,860
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,460
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,340
China.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,540
What else can you say about it other than...

7
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,650
"I love China because they buy my apartments,

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,839
they spend, you know,

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,529
fortunes in Manhattan they give me millions
and millions of dollars for these apartments

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:23,060
and they're great."

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,460
Yes, China is great!

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,189
So much different from the Communist Party
of even 15 years ago,

13
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,140
when people could just get "disappeared."

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,219
You see China is a major global player now.

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,760
One that you can trust to honor its commitments.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,000
Take the "one country, two systems" policy
for example.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,399
When Great Britain handed Hong Kong over to
China in 1997,

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,250
they called on the Communist Party to honor
Hong Kong's core liberties and way of life,

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,109
which include freedom of speech and an independent
judiciary,

20
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:56,679
things denied in Mainland China.

21
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,570
And the Communist Party said it would,

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,899
at least for a while.

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,379
Its promise was "50 years, no change."

24
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,080
And it's only been less than 20 years,

25
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,590
so you'd think everything would be going pretty
well.

26
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,280
Except for some reason,

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,400
Hong Kongers are unhappy.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,370
No, that footage is from 2003,

29
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,990
when half a million Hong Kongers protested
Article 23.

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,700
It would have allowed police to,

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,940
among other things,

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,990
search and arrest Hong Kong citizens without
evidence.

33
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,520
It didn't pass.

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,080
No, this is from when I was in Hong Kong in
2014 covering the Umbrella Movement.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,650
Hong Kongers were unhappy about the Communist
Party's interference in their elections.

36
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,490
No, that's Hong Kong McDonalds' delicious
taro pie that for some reason they feel should

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,000
be denied to American consumers.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,530
Ah, that's what I'm talking about.

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,630
The protests this month.

40
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,470
They're over the mysterious "disappearance"
of five booksellers who sold political books

41
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,030
critical of the Communist Party.

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,680
"I would say that this is a turning point
for suppression of our freedom."

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,210
Hong Kong is full of these kind of bookstores.

44
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,490
In fact, that's the first thing I saw in the
Hong Kong airport.

45
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,400
All sorts of books criticizing political figures:

46
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,459
Xi Jinping.

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,500
Jiang Zemin.

48
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,320
Guo Meimei?!

49
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,500
Wow, that's hard-hitting politics.

50
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,239
Anyway, these kinds of books are banned in
Mainland China.

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,150
But because of the one country two systems
policy,

52
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,879
they can be freely sold in Hong Kong.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,480
That's why the main clientele of these bookstores
are Mainland Chinese tourists.

54
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,600
"Where are most of your customers from?"

55
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:36,269
"I can say like 80-90% are from Mainland,
Mainland visitor, yeah."

56
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,900
"So they come here and buy the books and take
them back, illegally?"

57
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,280
"Haha, yeah, they try. "

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,689
Now surely, the Communist Party must be frustrated
by this.

59
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:51,900
But since it made a commitment not to touch
Hong Kong's freedoms till 2047,

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,200
it would never do something like, say,

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,019
kidnap the people who run these bookstores,
right?

62
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:58,780
Because if they did...

63
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,230
"I think you are spelling the death knell
for one country two systems.

64
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,510
You can forget about it.

65
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,449
Nobody would feel safe in Hong Kong simply
by speaking up."

66
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:11,489
And the Communist Party would never want people to not feel safe speaking up.

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,479
It's just...a coincidence that in the course
of 3 months,

68
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,959
five people from Causeway Bay Books disappeared

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,530
and that it came ahead of the publishing of
a book that allegedly exposes an extramarital

70
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,499
affair of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

71
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,870
So how about this, my China Uncensored super
sleuths:

72
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,840
Let's piece together the chain of events,

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,540
and see if we can't figure out who's behind
it!

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,799
The game is on!

75
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,260
Let's start with the latest,

76
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,010
the Case of Lee Bo.

77
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,989
He disappears on December 30,

78
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,069
after telling his wife he's going to his warehouse
to fetch some books.

79
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,560
He leaves his Mainland travel permit at home,

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,730
which means he couldn't have entered the Mainland--voluntarily.

81
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,799
It also means there'd be no official record
of him leaving Hong Kong.

82
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,620
But, about a week later,

83
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,779
he calls his wife,

84
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:05,150
telling her that in fact he is in the Mainland,
"assisting with an investigation."

85
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,340
He also speaks to her in Mandarin,

86
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,290
even though the couple usually speak Cantonese
together.

87
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,239
So let's see what we have so far:

88
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,849
A 65 year old man,

89
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,400
who said in recent interviews he hasn't been
back to the Mainland in two or three years

90
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,880
because he feared for his safety,

91
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,240
is on a secret mission in China,

92
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,940
but won't say where he was or when he'd be
back.

93
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,440
I'm sorry gang,

94
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,970
this case is unsolvable.

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,280
And even though Lee was also a British citizen,

96
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,180
China doesn't recognize dual citizenship.

97
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:40,440
"This person in question is first and foremost
a Chinese citizen...it is not necessary for

98
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,620
anyone to make groundless speculations."

99
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,060
"Hong Kong's affairs are purely China's internal
affairs, (in which) any foreign country has

100
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,920
no right to interfere.

101
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,460
So basically they're saying no other country
can say who China can and can't kidnap.

102
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,410
Not that they kidnapped anyone, mind you.

103
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,140
Lee went to China to help with that investigation.

104
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,590
As for the other four, well, if you really
think about it, anyone unscrupulous enough

105
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,070
to be willing to publish slanderous tales
about the great and glorious leaders of the

106
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,140
Communist Party, probably were also involved
in some other shady things.

107
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,300
Oh, hey this just in!

108
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,220
One of the guys who disappeared,

109
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,210
didn't disappear at all! Gui Minhai,

110
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,980
who also has Swedish dual citizenship,

111
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,530
just so happened to show up for a conveniently
timed,

112
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,190
tearful confession on Chinese state-run TV.

113
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,620
You see, he didn't disappear in Thailand in
October after all.

114
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,950
He voluntarily turned himself in to Chinese
authorities after being on the run for killing

115
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,360
a young woman in a car crash back in 2003.

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,080
And it's not important that there are some
discrepancies in the case.

117
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,460
For example, according to a CCTV report from
2005 on the crash,

118
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,870
the perpetrator Gui Minhai was 46 years old.

119
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,780
But this book publisher Gui Minhai was only
39 back then.

120
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,890
And his name is written like this,

121
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,660
but that CCTV report used a different character
with a similar sound.

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,610
It's also not important that Gui's daughter
never even heard about any accident or manslaughter

123
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,640
charge.

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,020
What matters is that in his confession, he
specifically says it's unnecessary for the

125
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,900
Swedish 
government to get involved.

126
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,680
"I don't want any individuals organizations

127
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
including the Swedish government,

128
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
to get involved or intervene in this matter.

129
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Though I hold Swedish passport,

130
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
I still feel I'm a Chinese."

131
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,170
So now we know that of the five missing booksellers,

132
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,950
one is clearly helping with an investigation,

133
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,290
and the other is clearly a very bad man.

134
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,530
So in conclusion...

135
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,610
we should just stop asking questions about
the other three.

136
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,080
Because at the end of the day,

137
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,530
China honors its commitment to one country,
two systems.

138
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,620
And anyone who disagrees,

139
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,270
won't for long.

140
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,370
So what do you think?

141
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,860
Can China be trusted?

142
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,710
And there's only one correct answer to that.

143
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,520
So leave your "yes" comment below,

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,180
and subscribe for more episodes of China Uncensored.

145
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,240
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, see 
you next time.
