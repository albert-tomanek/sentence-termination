1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,160
The Chinese Communist Party\h

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,400
Has a propaganda field day

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,760
Chinese billionaire Jack Ma goes missing\h

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,280
Plus mass arrests in Hong Kong

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China News Headlines

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,640
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,680
Before I begin, did you know YouTube\h
has been randomly unsubscribing people\h\h

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,800
and demonetizing a lot of our videos? You\h
can help the show by hitting the like button\h\h

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,760
and sharing this episode. If you’re not seeing\h
notifications for our episodes, we publish new\h\h

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,080
ones every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and\h
sometimes Saturday. So check back often.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,400
So, this week in China news: America news.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,160
No matter where you sit on the US political\h
spectrum, we can all agree that the real\h\h

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
winner of what happened at the US Capitol\h
this week was...the Chinese Communist Party!

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,560
You see, for a long time one of the Chinese\h
Communist Party’s propaganda messages has been\h\h

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,160
about how chaotic and terrible Western democracy\h
is. And now, Chinese media are having a field day.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,920
My favorite state-run media, The Global\h
Times, called it America’s Waterloo.

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,520
“Words like ‘karma,’ ‘retribution’ and ‘deserving’\h\h

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,560
were frequently mentioned in\h
Chinese netizens’ comments.”

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,960
Yes, these are just online comments that\h
the Global Times just happened to notice,\h\h

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,160
and they happened to not get censored, so\h
they happened to include them in the article.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,080
The article also says that “Chinese\h
observers”—who are not named here but\h\h

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,400
are definitely not the Global Times editorial\h
staff—say “the US has totally lost legitimacy\h\h

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,240
and qualification to interfere in\h
other countries’ domestic affairs.”

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Aw, gee. That’s too bad.\h
Because up until this week,\h\h

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
the CCP had welcomed the US\h
interfering in their domestic affairs.

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,720
Another state-run media article compares\h
this week’s US protest to the 2019 protests\h\h

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,480
in Hong Kong—and reminds Chinese people of\h
just how restrained Hong Kong police were.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes, when Hong Kong police fired tear gas\h
directly at journalists, including me,\h\h

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,120
while I was walking on a public street,\h
I also felt they were very restrained.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,080
And this editorial says the Capitol mob represents\h
an internal collapse of the US political system.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,880
The problem, you see, is the result\h
of society’s severe division,\h\h

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,480
and the US government’s failure\h
to control such division.

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,480
If only the American government would\h
use a strong hand to crush dissent!

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
Yes, that’s the way to do it.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,040
Speaking of crushing dissent, one of China’s\h
richest men, Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba\h\h

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
is missing!

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,680
What’s that Shelley? Oh, he’s\h
not missing, he’s just lying low.

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,080
He’s probably just...really busy with a new hobby.\h\h

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
Like learning how to bake a\h
perfect loaf of sourdough bread.

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,040
I mean, sure, he hasn’t been seen in public\h
since October. That’s when Jack Ma gave a\h\h

41
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,600
speech at the Bund Summit in Shanghai—where\h
he criticized China's financial regulators.\h\h

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,920
He said they stifle innovation.\h

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,840
Apparently, communism and\h
innovation don’t go together.

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,560
And sure, there’s a long\h
history of Chinese tycoons\h\h

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
disappearing when the Communist\h
Party decides they’ve gotten too big.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,840
But surely that didn’t happen to Jack Ma.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,120
Chinese regulators simply decided to halt the\h
blockbuster IPO of Ma’s company Ant Group.\h

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
And then the central bank\h
summoned him for questioning.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,880
And then regulators ordered the\h
restructuring of the company he founded.

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,120
And then launched an antitrust investigation\h
into Ma’s biggest company Alibaba.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
But it’s not like the Chinese Communist Party\h
is using Ma to send some kind of message.\h\h

52
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,600
No, they’re using someone\h
else to send a message to Ma.

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,800
Lai Xiaomin, one of China’s top bankers, has\h
been given a death sentence for taking bribes.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,440
So I wouldn’t be too surprised\h
if soon Jack Ma does reappear,\h\h

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,800
with a new attitude that’s very\h
grateful to the CCP and its regulators.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,120
Speaking of total submission, it’s\h
time for my unfortunate catchphrase.\h\h

57
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,760
Hong Kong police have arrested\h
more democracy activists.

58
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,480
Like, a lot more.

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,280
“Until now, we have arrested 53 people in total,\h
including 45 males and eight females, aged 23\h\h

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,680
to 64. They are suspected of being involved\h
in the crime of subverting state power. Six\h\h

61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,960
people were acting in the role of organizing and\h
planning while the other 47 were participating.”

62
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
Good old vague, subverting state power. Just\h
like the mass arrests in Mainland China.\h\h

63
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,240
More than 1,000 police were involved in the\h
raid that captured an American lawyer as well.\h\h

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes, you heard me right. An American\h
citizen has been arrested in Hong Kong.\h

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,960
Clearly he’s a serious danger to society.\h\h

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,560
This is John Clancey, chairman of\h
the Asian Human Rights Commission.

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
So what horrible crime was\h
committed? Well, back in July,\h\h

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,680
the Hong Kong Democratic Party tried to hold\h
a primary election, and he was involved.

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
The Democratic Party said police arrested the\h
activists for participating in an independently\h\h

70
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,400
organized, unofficial primary in July to select\h
candidates for last September's legislative\h\h

71
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,440
election. In the end that vote was postponed\h
for a year due to public health restrictions.\h\h

72
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,720
The pro-democracy movement had hoped to win a\h
majority - and some candidates wished to use it to\h\h

73
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,160
block government proposals, which the Democratic\h
Party says was seen as an "act of subversion,\h\h

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,160
in violation of the national security law." Local\h
media said the police operation included searches\h\h

75
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,440
of the offices of the Hong Kong Public Opinion\h
Research Institute and lawyers who helped organize\h\h

76
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,240
the primaries. The Hong Kong government and\h
Beijing warned that the unofficial primaries could\h\h

77
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,920
violate the national security law. Under the law,\h
anything Beijing broadly defines as secession,\h\h

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,840
subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign\h
forces is punishable by up to life in prison.

79
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,320
John Clancey’s crime? He was the\h
treasurer of a political group\h\h

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,400
involved in those unofficial primaries.

81
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,880
So to sum up, the Hong Kong police just\h
arrested 53 people for organizing a primary\h\h

82
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,320
election—because it was designed to help\h
the pro-democracy groups win a majority\h\h

83
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,480
of the seats in the legislature. Which they would\h
then use to get the government to listen to them.

84
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
That’s it. That’s the crime.\h

85
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,440
Because of how the system is designed,\h
the pro-democracy camps had never gotten\h\h

86
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,960
a majority before. And now thanks to the\h
National Security Law, they never will.

87
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,480
Also, the existing pro-democracy legislators\h
have all either been kicked out or resigned.

88
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,960
And a lot of those lawmakers were in the\h
group of 53 people who were just arrested.

89
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,040
So things are going really well in Hong\h
Kong...for the Chinese Communist Party.\h

90
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,840
Especially since the Hong Kong authorities\h
carried out the mass arrests on\h\h

91
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,200
January 6. I wonder if they were banking on the US\h
government being a little distracted on that day.\h

92
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
Boy, that really worked out well for them.\h

93
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,880
Speaking of the Chinese Communist Party\h
being able to get away with anything,\h\h

94
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,840
stay tuned after the break. I’ll show you how\h
they’re getting away with the coronavirus coverup.

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,040
Welcome back.

96
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,000
After a year, the World Health Organization\h
is finally trying to get a team into Wuhan to\h\h

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,840
study the origin of the coronavirus.\h
And China’s not letting it happen.

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Almost as if they’ve got something to hide!

99
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,840
But if you’ve seen this wonderful\h
propaganda piece in the New York Times,\h\h

100
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
you know that China has the real freedom.

101
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,680
Did you know, “The pandemic has upended many\h
perceptions, including ideas about freedom.\h\h

102
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,880
Citizens of China don’t have freedom of speech,\h
freedom of worship or freedom from fear...but\h\h

103
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,360
they have the freedom to move around and lead\h
a normal day-to-day life. In a pandemic year,\h\h

104
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,920
many of the world’s people would envy\h
this most basic form of freedom.”\h

105
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,560
Which is why it’s so sad to see a free country\h
like China, emulating the United States. Look\h\h

106
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,800
at what happened when this woman tried to leave a\h
coronavirus quarantine zone in Shenyang this week.

107
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,400
Of course, despite all the wonderful words from\h
the New York Times about the openness of China,\h\h

108
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,280
they just locked down a city of 11 million people.

109
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,760
And in the city of Dalian...

110
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,840
Residents are running out of food.

111
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,680
“We are like lambs to be slaughtered.\h
There’s no way to save ourselves.\h\h

112
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
We don’t know how long we will be locked inside.”

113
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
Well, if they’re like lambs to the\h
slaughter, they’ll be plenty of food!

114
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,600
But we do have some good news. The New York Stock\h
Exchange will delist three big Chinese telecoms.

115
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,160
That was after they said they wouldn’t do that.\h\h

116
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Which was after they first\h
said they would do that.\h

117
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,360
Those companies were delisted to comply with\h
this executive order from President Trump.

118
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
It’s aimed at protecting American\h
investors from putting their money\h\h

119
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
into companies tied to the Chinese military.

120
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
This week, Trump also banned\h
several Chinese software apps,\h\h

121
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,840
like Alipay, citing potential espionage risks.

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,760
For more on Trump news that happened this week,\h
check out my other channel, America Uncovered.

123
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,920
And considering everything happening in the\h
US right now, I’m glad you’re watching China\h\h

124
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,240
Uncensored. It’s important for people to know what\h
the Chinese Communist Party is doing. But YouTube\h\h

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,880
has been soft censoring China Uncensored—by\h
demonetizing our videos, secretly unsubscribing\h\h

126
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,640
people, and not notifying people when we release\h
new videos. So join us in the fight, what I call\h\h

127
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,320
the China Uncensored 50 cent army. They’re\h
viewers like you who contribute as little as\h\h

128
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,280
a dollar an episode on the crowd funding website\h
Patreon. That’s patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

129
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,880
As a thank you to them, I answer\h
their questions on the show.\h\h

130
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,920
And today’s question comes from\h
50 Cent Army member Richard Combs.

131
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,280
He says “I see America Uncovered,\h
and China Uncensored on Patreon.\h\h\h

132
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,320
I get notifications on my email, not YouTube.”

133
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,760
You know Richard, that actually is one of the\h
often overlooked perks of supporting the show on\h\h

134
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Patreon. YouTube does not send out notifications\h
about new episodes for everyone who’s subscribed.\h\h

135
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
Often even if you have the\h
notification bell turned on.\h\h

136
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Even worse, people have been secretly unsubscribed\h
by YouTube. But I post every episode on Patreon,\h\h

137
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,600
and Patreon notifies everyone who\h
supports China Uncensored on Patreon.\h\h

138
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,440
So it’s another way to be sure you’re\h
getting notified when I make new episodes.

139
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
If you’re interested in supporting\h
China Uncensored on Patreon,\h\h

140
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,360
go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn more.

141
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:55,840
And thanks again for watching. I’m\h
Chris Chappell, see you next time.
