1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,870
could China’s plans to become the world
leader in artificial intelligence

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,800
let the Chinese Communist Party rule forever
and enslave us all?

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,820
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,050
Just when you thought Skynet was going to
be the one

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,599
to kick off the final showdown of man versus
machine,

8
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,099
the Chinese Communist Party announced its
plans

9
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,089
to become the world leader in making superintelligent
machines

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:30,639
that could spell our doom.

11
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,559
Haha, don’t worry.

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,780
The Terminator was just a movie.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,769
And it doesn’t take place until 2029.

14
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,030
What’s that, Shelley?

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,560
The Chinese Communist Party actually has a
Skynet?

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,460
Wow.

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,460
What are they going to name

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,719
their new artificial intelligence projects?

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,719
HAL?

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,719
Ultron?

21
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,649
The Machines?

22
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,159
Because there will be more AI projects.

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,309
China’s State Council announced their goal

24
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,899
to be a leader in AI in a document called

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,220
“A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence
Development Plan.”

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,129
It’s a plan that aims to give China

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,780
the “first-mover advantage in the development
of AI”

28
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,030
by “making China the world’s primary AI
innovation center” by 2030.

29
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,720
I guess we have nothing to worry about since
that’s

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,990
a whole year further into the future than
the Terminator movies.

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,040
Wait a second.

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,020
2030 is only 12 years away.

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,549
I just realized are closer in time to 2030
than we are

34
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,369
to Hurricane Katrina, which happened in 2005.

35
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,259
I think I just got a glimpse of my own mortality.

36
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,539
But back to the Chinese regime’s plan for
leading the world in AI.

37
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,000
They plan for China’s AI industry to be
worth

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,400
nearly $150 billion dollars by 2030.

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
And, by 2025, they plan to have achieved

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,610
“major breakthroughs in basic theories
for AI” technology.

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,620
Oh good, that’s only seven years away.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,689
And they plan for AI to become the “driving
force

43
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,570
for industrial upgrading and economic transformation.”

44
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,240
And of course, to “protect national security.”

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,280
Which has absolutely no sinister undertones
at all.

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,030
So the Chinese government has put together

47
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,880
a three-year action plan to make sure this
all really happens.

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,940
Action point number one is money.

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,250
And lots of it.

50
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,630
For example, they’ll be dropping 2.1 billion
dollars

51
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,040
on a park in the suburbs of Beijing.

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,130
Not that kind of park.

53
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,130
This kind of park,

54
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,010
where adults have to work all day.

55
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,810
But that one single 2.1 billion dollar investment

56
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,110
is almost twice as much as the US government

57
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,580
spent in a year on its entire AI program.

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,560
And the Chinese Communist Party wants private
companies

59
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,920
to cough up dough, too.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,740
Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group—

61
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,930
owned by Jack Ma—

62
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,380
is leading the way.

63
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,540
They provided 600 million dollars

64
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,900
in a C-round investment to an AI startup called
SenseTime.

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,590
That investment makes SenseTime

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,530
the most valuable artificial intelligence
tech startup in the world;

67
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,200
it’s now valued at 4.5 billion dollars.

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,440
The company specializes in intelligent facial
recognition.

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,250
This is super handy for “protecting national
security”—

70
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,910
protecting China from dangerous criminals.

71
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,740
And old people who meditate.

72
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,650
And the AI facial recognition business is
booming in China.

73
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,660
At least that’s what the SenseTime CEO told
Quartz.

74
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,680
He said it’s because China has “real world
problems.”

75
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,800
Yeah, real world problems.

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,380
Like people wanting to be left alone to practice
their religion.

77
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,900
And that’s a problem that they’re already
on their way to solving.

78
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,400
SenseTime brags it’s helped Chinese police

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,260
spy on citizens in Guangzhou and in Yunnan
province.

80
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,760
This is a demo reel released by SenseTime
of their new app,

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
SenseFace.

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,920
It shows people going into a subway station,

83
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,150
and how it can quickly recognize them and
match them up

84
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,280
with other their IDs.

85
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,430
It’s so cool!

86
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,070
These systems can even match your face with
your car,

87
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,370
and then match you with all the people you’re
in touch with.

88
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,329
And software like this is even more important
for authorities

89
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,180
in places like China’s Xinjiang region—

90
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,449
which is home to the most dangerous people
of all:

91
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,030
ethnic minorities.

92
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,500
Police in Xinjiang use facial recognition,

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,050
biometric data, internet monitoring,

94
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,840
and other tools to keep tabs on members of
the Uighur minority

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,520
and restrict their movement and behavior.

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,780
And it’s all there in black and white in
China’s big AI plan.

97
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,590
According to “Deciphering China’s AI Dream,”

98
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,070
a detailed analysis of the State Council’s
plan,

99
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,740
...AI should play an “irreplaceable” role
in maintaining social stability

100
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,789
and predict social unrest before it happens.

101
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:03,389
And in case companies like SenseTime might
object

102
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,729
to their technology being used to stifle Chinese
dissidents,

103
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,050
don’t worry.

104
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,629
The AI plan includes a strategy for that,
too.

105
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,490
The Chinese regime is looking for ways to

106
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,200
“exert more influence over large tech companies”

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,020
just to make sure they play ball.

108
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,919
But developing AI to repress dissidents inside
China

109
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,610
isn’t the only thing that’s worrying experts.

110
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,499
Berlin-based political scientist Sebastian
Heilmann,

111
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,650
who coined the term “digital Leninism”

112
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,849
to describe China’s AI fueled surveillance,

113
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,730
says China’s authoritarian regime will use
AI

114
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,669
to to challenge Western democracies.

115
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,449
He says it goes beyond what George Orwell

116
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,770
had in his vision in Nineteen Eighty-Four.

117
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,289
...because China’s system constantly moves
with you

118
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,699
and tracks your every movement.

119
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,499
But, uh, if an authoritarian regime

120
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,960
develops the world’s most powerful AI,

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,909
it couldn’t, like, take over the world,
right?

122
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,889
“Because if one company or a small group
of people,

123
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:03,520
manages to develop god-like digital power,

124
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,689
they could take over the world.

125
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,520
When there’s an evil dictator,

126
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,259
at least that human is going to die,

127
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,879
but for an AI there would be no death.

128
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,400
It would live forever.

129
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,699
And you would have an immortal dictator,

130
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,939
from which we could never escape.”

131
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,680
Thanks, Elon.

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,090
I feel much better now.

133
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,909
But maybe the Chinese Communist Party

134
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,979
isn’t interested in clinging to power forever.

135
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,259
Then again, maybe they are.

136
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,919
Hopefully the resistance sends someone back
in time

137
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,340
to protect us.

138
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,600
Wait, is Elon Musk Kyle Reese?

139
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,229
So how do you feel about China’s plans

140
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,569
to become the world leader in artificial intelligence?

141
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,949
