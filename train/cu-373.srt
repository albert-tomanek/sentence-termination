00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,060
As former US officials travel to Taiwan

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:06,900
China performs combat training over the island

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,650
Plus, Jack Ma gets reined in

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,790
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:21,920
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,550
This episode is sponsored by Daily Pnut.

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,480
The news can be a tough pill to swallow.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,690
That's why Daily Pnut gives you a daily dose
of news in equal parts humor and substance.

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,930
That’s something I can appreciate.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,340
This week, President Biden sent an unofficial
delegation to Taiwan.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:48,020
The delegation included former Senator Chris
Dodd and former Deputy Secretaries of State

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,910
Richard Armitage and James Steinberg, who
served under the George W Bush and Obama administrations.

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:01,129
It’s an unofficial delegation in that none
of them are currently US officials—not unofficial

14
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,690
like these guys just randomly decided to go
to Taiwan on their own.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,080
You know, visit Sun Moon Lake.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,820
Eat fried squid at the night market.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,189
Meet with Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-Wen.

18
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,180
Just normal tourist stuff.

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,020
Biden’s move isn’t especially provocative
or unusual.

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,049
In fact, the White House emphasized that they
were following “a long-standing bipartisan

21
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:29,000
tradition of U.S. administrations sending
high-level, unofficial delegations to Taiwan.”

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,340
But of course that didn’t stop the delegation
from, say it with me folks, angering China.

23
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,030
Why did Biden send this delegation now?

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,689
“The dispatch of the ‘unofficial’ delegation
comes as the United States and Taiwan mark

25
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,770
the 42nd anniversary of the Taiwan Relations
Act.”

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,920
Plus, the Biden Administration sent this delegation
to Taiwan at the same time they also sent

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,590
John Kerry to China to talk about climate.

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,030
Which got totally overshadowed by the Taiwan
thing.

29
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,340
Because the Communist Party is really starting
to freak out.

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,690
It warned the US: don’t play with fire.

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,290
Really?

32
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,599
Playing with fire is Wall Street encouraging
Americans to invest in China.

33
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,350
Defending a democratic country from a hostile
communist takeover is the right thing to do.

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,790
It’s defending against fire.

35
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,150
Speaking of defending against fire, Taiwan’s
going to need some help with that.

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,610
Because the Chinese Communist Party knows
that you don’t just use your words in a

37
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,030
conflict.

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,410
You also take action!

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:44,230
That’s why the People’s Liberation Army
is holding live-fire drills near Taiwan during

40
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,580
the US delegation’s visit.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,739
But as I’ve mentioned before, the Communist
Party has been escalating its actions against

42
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,660
Taiwan for months.

43
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,650
Earlier this week, before the US delegation
arrived, China sent a record number of warplanes

44
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,060
around Taiwan.

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,550
“The planes flown Monday included 18 fighter
jets, four bombers, two anti-submarine planes

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,099
and a surveillance aircraft.”

47
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,940
And the Chinese regime is no longer calling
these incursions routine military exercises.

48
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,740
As Biden’s emissaries go to Taiwan, China
is now calling them combat drills.

49
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,019
Hu Xijin the editor in chief of my favorite
Chinese state run media the Global Times,

50
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:32,460
warned, “If the U.S. and Taiwan take further
prominent actions, PLA fighter jets will fly

51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,580
over Taiwan island to declare sovereignty.”

52
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,269
That’s not how it works.If it were, then
I would really be the owner of the Scarborough

53
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,150
Shoal in the South China Sea.

54
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,159
Hu Xijin also said, “If Taiwan forces open
fire, that will be the moment of all-out war

55
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,099
across the Taiwan Strait.”

56
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,099
Yes.

57
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,629
Instead, Taiwan should just let the Chinese
military invade Taiwan without defending itself.

58
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,959
That’s the best way to avoid war.

59
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,460
Unfortunately it seems like Taiwan just won’t
learn.

60
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,439
Besides meeting with US delegations, Taiwan
insists on unveiling new weapons it can use

61
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,659
for defense.

62
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:19,290
Doesn’t Taiwan understand the best defense,
is a quick unconditional surrender?

63
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,770
Obviously things are very tense right now
between the US and China.

64
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,160
That’s why the Chinese premier is calling
for more communication.

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,759
How’s this for more communication?

66
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,669
“We have a serious commitment to Taiwan
being able to defend itself, we have a serious

67
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,500
commitment to peace and security in the Western
Pacific and in that context it would be a

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,250
serious mistake for anyone to try to change
that status quo by force.”

69
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,280
Hmmm I wonder who would try to change the
status quo by force.

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,400
And more on the threat of communist China,
after the break.

71
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,020
Welcome back.

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,270
Once again, the annual threat assessment from
the US Director of National Intelligence,

73
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,949
says China poses the biggest threat to the
US.

74
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:10,979
“China increasingly is a near-peer competitor,
challenging the United States in multiple

75
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,590
arenas—especially economically, militarily
and technologically—and is pushing to change

76
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,550
global norms.”

77
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,639
Near peer competitor?

78
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,470
Not according to China.

79
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,460
Their message is the US and China are equal
now.

80
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,770
I mean, not in terms of military power, economic
advantage, or international respect, but other

81
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,160
than that, totally equal.

82
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,430
And the Communist Party knows a thing or two
about equality.

83
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,990
Speaking of equality, the Chinese regime is
also equally threatening Australia.

84
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,720
That’s according to this new report by the
Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a leading

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Australian think tank.

86
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,260
Basically, China’s navy is targeting Australian
ports.

87
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,500
But not with weapons.

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,300
With investments.

89
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,050
The Australian government is under pressure
to take back a major Australian port that

90
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,360
was leased to a Chinese company.

91
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Why?

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,289
Because, as the Darwin Port website says,
it’s a strategic location.

93
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,300
Just look at all the places you can get to
from it.

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,360
Taipei.

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,069
Very convenient.

96
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:22,710
And now, let’s hear from a man who really
doesn’t want to keep his job, Gau Fu, the

97
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,810
director of the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention.

98
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,190
He...may have admitted Chinese Covid vaccines
aren’t very effective.

99
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,610
But then he clarified: When he mentioned Chinese
vaccines aren’t very effective, he didn’t

100
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,690
mean Chinese vaccines aren’t very effective.

101
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,950
“In a message to The Associated Press, Gao
said...he was speaking about the effectiveness

102
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,449
rates for ‘vaccines in the world, not particularly
for China.’”

103
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,280
Yes, he was definitely not talking about China’s
Sinovac vaccine, which has an efficacy rate

104
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,740
of barely 50%.

105
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,039
He meant all Covid vaccines are ineffective,
including the American ones.

106
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,770
Coincidentally, the Communist Party has just
announced that Gao will be “volunteering”

107
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,170
for the next phase of human vaccine experiments.

108
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,130
And leaked documents from the Chinese government
show that the Communist Party is doing everything

109
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,610
it can to prevent the spread of Covid...from
getting in the way of persecuting Falun Gong

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,610
practitioners.

111
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,270
“The official document, from a district
in eastern China, listed a campaign to suppress

112
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,470
Falun Gong practitioners among the key achievements
in that area in 2020, alongside other tasks

113
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,319
such as controlling the pandemic and ‘maintaining
social stability.’”

114
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,810
Ok, so just imagine working for the Chinese
Communist Party.

115
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,319
Here’s your list of employee performance
goals for 2020:

116
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,560
Let’s see: attend leadership training, improve
time management, ah there it is.

117
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,520
Torture people for meditating.

118
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
Check that one off the list.

119
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,629
And it’s not just Falun Gong practitioners
being persecuted.

120
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,289
Elite Communist Party members are, too.

121
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,210
That includes billionaires.

122
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,110
More after the break.

123
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,550
Welcome back.

124
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,819
Jack Ma is a Communist Party member, and one
of China’s richest men.

125
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,879
But that hasn’t stopped the Chinese regime
from hitting him with a double-whammy.

126
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:28,360
Ma’s company, Ant Group, was hit with a
record 2.8 billion dollars in fines, and is

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,479
being forced to completely restructure.

128
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,140
This is clearly a warning to other Chinese
tech companies.

129
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,700
No matter how successful of a businessman
you might be , it's the Chinese Communist

130
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,810
Party that’s in charge.

131
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,610
Elon Musk must be taking that message to heart,
as it’s come out that Tesla is collecting

132
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,720
data on Chinese citizens and storing it in
China.

133
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,310
Where by law, the Chinese Communist Party
can freely access it.

134
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,760
Good news for the youth of China!

135
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,720
Your beloved Party is preparing you for the
meat grinder!

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,640
High School students are getting more military
training to strengthen national defense.

137
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,089
Might Chinese high school students be getting
nervous?

138
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,230
Well there’s no way to know, since China
has begun censoring speech about military

139
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,860
affairs.

140
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,340
Some of the most popular forums on WeChat,
China’s biggest social media app, have been

141
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,010
shut down.

142
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,500
It was “implied that agencies from other
countries use the discussion on military affairs

143
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,000
or weapons to analyze the regime’s military
developments, imposing a threat to national

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
security.”

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,800
It’s definitely not because Chinese youth
might express concern about the war with Taiwan

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,720
and the US they’re being pushed into.

147
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,240
Because Chinese youth are all patriots.

148
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,420
They have to be or else.

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,350
But just in case any of China’s youth might
be misled, the CCP has launched a hotline

150
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,640
to report on people distorting or denying
the Communist Party’s excellent history

151
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,140
and culture.

152
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,019
The notice from China’s top internet regulator
said, “For a while now, some people with

153
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:12,010
ulterior motives…have spread historically
nihilistic false statements online, maliciously

154
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:18,350
distorting, slandering and denying Party,
national and military history in an attempt

155
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,010
to confuse people’s thinking.”

156
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,630
And the punishment?

157
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,630
Totally unclear.

158
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,920
Though “Last week, authorities in Jiangsu
province detained a 19-year-old for his ‘insulting’

159
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,720
online comments about Japan’s 1937 invasion
of Nanjing during the Second Sino-Japanese

160
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,940
War.”

161
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,590
But don't forget, the internet surveillance
isn’t limited to just patriotic Han Chinese

162
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,720
kids.

163
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,310
The Communist Party hasn’t forgotten the
Uyghurs.

164
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,720
The CCP is forcing them to download a surveillance
app that will let authorities know if anything

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,550
on their phone might be dangerous.

166
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,710
The app is called web cleansing.

167
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,710
Such a nice name.

168
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,330
Not sinister at all.

169
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:09,090
“If a ‘dangerous’ file is identified,
the app sends a message to the person using

170
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,649
the phone telling them to delete it.”

171
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,630
And according to a research team with the
Open Technology Fund , “Any user with this

172
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,290
app installed will have every file stored
on their device sent to an unknown entity

173
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,330
for monitoring.”

174
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, did I mention when the app sends files
to the outside server, it’s not encrypted

175
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,450
either?

176
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,630
But speaking of the patriotic youth of China,
here’s a small group of young men attacking

177
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,920
a Hong Kong newspaper printing press.

178
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,810
This is the Hong Kong branch of the Epoch
Times—a newspaper known for supporting human

179
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,450
rights and democracy in China.

180
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,670
The Communist Party is not a fan.

181
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,680
Neither are the guys with sledge hammers.

182
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,140
Or as the Party calls them, equality sticks.

183
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,570
The attack has been condemned by US lawmakers.

184
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,710
The State Department.

185
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,000
And sledge hammer manufacturers worldwide.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,510
They would like to remind everyone of their
motto—please use as intended.

187
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,350
Which I assume is for sledges.

188
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,820
Whatever those are.

189
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,390
