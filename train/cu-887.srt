00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,720
making mischief in the South China Sea.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,800
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,910
A US Navy destroyer has just sailed through

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,980
sacred Chinese territory.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,380
And by sacred Chinese territory,

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,109
I mean the artificial islands

9
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,220
China began building three years ago

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,499
in the middle of the ocean.

11
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:26,899
The destroyer USS Dewey

12
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,429
sailed 12 miles off the coast of this—

13
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:31,539
Mischief Reef.

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,960
Which is a fitting name.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,610
It’s part of a chain of islands

16
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,050
called the Spratlys—

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,140
a chain claimed by China,

18
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,520
Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines.

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,890
Except, this isn’t what the Mischief Reef

20
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,690
looks like today.

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,830
That photo is from 2014

22
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,510
when it was just a boring old

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,390
submerged reef—

24
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,810
underwater at high tide.

25
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,900
But while those other countries

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,430
have been trying to solve the dispute

27
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,350
with international arbitration,

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,149
the Chinese Communist Party took action.

29
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:04,100
First they dredged up a little sand.

30
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,479
And then some more sand.

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,830
And now, that little reef is a full-fledged

32
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,830
island.

33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,729
Yes, a tropical island getaway,

34
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,090
full of white sand beaches,

35
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,090
palm trees,

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,210
a well stocked tiki bar--

37
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,880
And, of course, military installations.

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,380
China, in addition to building those islands,

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,229
is now militarizing them,

40
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,090
basing military aircraft,

41
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,520
military warships and missile systems

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,619
on these manufactured reefs.

43
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,649
The US is responding by sailing

44
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,609
its warplanes and warships

45
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,609
through these waters

46
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:37,990
to demonstrate its point

47
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,259
that they remain international.”

48
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:41,049
Now this isn’t new.

49
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,009
The US has been conducting what it calls

50
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:44,490
“Freedom of Navigation” Operations,

51
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,619
or FONOPs,

52
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,740
for years under former US President Barack
Obama.

53
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,649
Thanks, Obama!

54
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:51,649
That's when the US Navy

55
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,880
sails ships through international waters

56
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,420
to challenge excessive territorial claims

57
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,099
made by other countries.

58
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,709
And according to the US Navy,

59
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,409
they're pretty standard procedure,

60
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,499
and not just directed at China.

61
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,499
In fact,

62
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,499
last year the US Navy

63
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:09,290
challenged excessive claims from 22 countries.

64
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,420
But this is the first patrol

65
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,220
conducted in the South China Sea

66
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,480
since Donald Trump took office.

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,360
And just like FONOPs are standard procedure

68
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,860
for the US Navy,

69
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,110
reacting to them with anger is standard procedure

70
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,140
for the Chinese Communist Party.

71
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,470
The actions by the U.S. undermined

72
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,190
China's sovereignty and security interests,

73
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,390
and they are very likely to cause

74
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,500
unexpected sea and air accidents.

75
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,790
Yeah, if you’re not careful,

76
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,590
maybe one of your precious destroyers

77
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,210
might accidentally fall down the stairs.

78
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,280
In fact, according to China’s Defense Ministry,

79
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,620
two Chinese frigates had ‘warned and dispelled’

80
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,430
the USS Dewey after it had entered its waters

81
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,750
without permission.

82
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,430
That isn’t exactly how the US put it, though.

83
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,300
In fact, the US has said very little at all

84
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,180
about the incident.

85
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,870
CNN only got the story from an American official

86
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,140
whose name wasn’t cited.

87
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,340
It follows a May statement

88
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,930
from Pentagon Spokesperson, Captain Jeff Davis

89
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,400
that the Trump administration is going to
do things

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,110
a little differently.

91
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,470
Instead of announcing each of the FONOPs,

92
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,600
they would only be released publicly in an
annual report.

93
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,560
Despite his strong campaign rhetoric against

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
China,

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
President Trump has been trying to build

96
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,480
a positive relationship with Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

97
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,320
over the last few months.

98
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Mostly because Trump wants China’s support

99
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,100
tackling the North Korea issue.

100
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,720
This whole incident comes as Xi Jinping

101
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,900
called for a strong, modern navy

102
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,230
at the 12th Party congress

103
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,480
of the People's Liberation Army.

104
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,710
It also follows Philippine President Duterte

105
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,290
alleging that Xi Jinping threatened him with
war

106
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,710
if the Philippines drills for oil

107
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,710
in disputed waters.

108
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,000
He said: 'Well if you force the issue,

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,510
we'll be forced to tell you the truth.

110
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,510
What is the truth?

111
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,870
We will go to war.

112
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,440
We will fight you.

113
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,990
And despite what Duterte said last October...

114
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,200
I will break up with America.

115
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,530
I would rather go to Russia and to China.

116
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,760
...now he seems to be asking for US help.

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
So we seek the help of America,

118
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,110
a concerted effort of all the member states

119
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,741
of the United Nations,

120
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,741
are they willing to fight?

121
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,741
Because if they're willing to fight

122
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,741
then we are,

123
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:20,950
but if it was only me,

124
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,220
why would I do that?

125
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,630
It will result in a massacre

126
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,810
and it will just destroy everything.

127
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,210
So maybe the Trump administration

128
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,330
wants to show it will make good on its promise

129
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,050
to defend the South China Sea.

130
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,100
Or maybe, it's the just the US's turn

131
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,830
to make a little bit of mischief

132
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,540
at Mischief Reef.

133
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,370
So what do you think about the US Navy's

134
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,860
Freedom of Navigation operations?

135
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,410
Leave your comments below.

136
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,470
And let me just take a moment again

137
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,690
to thank everyone who supports this show

138
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,941
