1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,389
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:04,769
China’s shocking military secret.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,920
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,820
Big news coming out recently.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,000
And it’s upset a lot of people.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,199
“Great Britain is breaking apart from the
European Union.”

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,060
No, it’s more upsetting than that.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,900
“A shambolic performance by the national
team.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,789
2-1 loss to Iceland last night will go down

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,800
as the worst moment in England's football
history.”

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,950
Well, not what I was thinking either.

12
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,559
Yes, China is killing millions of innocent
meditators for their organs.

13
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,530
Which is what a lot of people might call “genocide.”

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,940
This comes after this incredibly detailed
680-page report

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,690
revealed that as many as 1.5 million innocent
people in China

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,309
have been murdered for their organs.

17
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,530
And I’m not talking about this being done
by some

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,920
underground gangs or criminal networks.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,400
I’m talking about official hospitals.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,720
Including hospitals run by the Chinese military.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
Like this one, the 301 Military Hospital in
Beijing.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,780
It’s a place where a lot of high-ranking
Community Party members get treated.

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,479
The Chinese military is killing Chinese citizens
for their organs

24
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,890
on a massive scale.

25
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,829
And across China, other hospitals have been
following their example.

26
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:36,680
“The Chinese regime not only deprives its
people of their basic rights on a daily basis,

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,590
but literally steals their body parts for
a profit.”

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,990
Because there’s nothing more valuable than
a human life.

29
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,189
Now you’d think that this discovery should
be making major international headlines.

30
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,049
And to a degree, that’s happened.

31
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,810
The problem is that news, like comedy, is
all about…

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,060
…timing!

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,820
And the timing for this wasn't the greatest.

34
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,070
Hashtag Brexit.

35
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,590
But this story is still huge.

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,830
And the long-term implications haven’t even
begun to set in.

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,480
Eventually, I think it’s going mean more
countries will go from attitudes like this:

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,520
“I think this is going to be a very important
moment for British-Chinese relations

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
which are in a very good state,

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,440
something of a golden era in our relationship.”

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
...to attitudes like this:

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,120
“We recommend an international investigation
into forced organ harvesting in China,

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,160
and that the British government take a lead.”

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,720
Because it’s hard to have a golden era with
a regime

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,260
that’s currently committing crimes against
humanity.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,250
I mean, once enough people know about it.

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,700
So, here’s what people ought to know about
it.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,810
In most of the world,

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,870
it takes months or years to get an organ transplant.

50
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,420
But in China, it’s so easy!

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,210
“Patients typically must wait only a few
weeks for a donor organ.”

52
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,940
And they somehow perform a crazy number of
organ transplants there.

53
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,090
Officials say there's a total of 10,000 organ
transplants a year in China.

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,190
But this report finds that there are,

55
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,800
in fact, mega hospitals across the country,

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,420
each with thousands of beds,

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,320
performing thousands of transplants.

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,330
So many, that, according to the report,

59
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,410
many surgeons have simply

60
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,040
“lost count” of how many they performed.

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,180
Using data gathered from Chinese media reports

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,760
and the websites of individual hospitals,

63
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,130
the report goes on to estimate that between

64
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,980
60,000 to 100,000 political prisoners are
killed

65
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,850
—every year—

66
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,870
to supply China’s hospitals with fresh organs.

67
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,290
By contrast, the total number of transplants
in the US

68
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,770
in most years is less than 30,000.

69
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,190
Of course this raises the question:

70
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,100
If the Chinese Communist Party is killing
all these people for their organs,

71
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,080
where are these people coming from?

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,610
Wouldn’t, you know, people in China start
to question so many disappearances?

73
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,320
Well, not if the Party convinces you

74
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,290
that a certain group of people,

75
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,880
aren’t really people, and can be treated
however they want.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,590
Is there...any group like that in China?

77
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,410
Falun Gong practitioners.

78
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,410
The people who are thrown into labor camps

79
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,770
for doing this.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,200
That’s where the vast majority of the organs
are coming from, according to Bloody Harvest.

81
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,310
The report also says that other organ "donors"

82
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,200
include Tibetans, Uyghurs, and House Christians.

83
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,510
Note that one of the report’s authors is
David Kilgour,

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,100
who’s Canada’s former Secretary of State
for Asia-Pacific.

85
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,110
Bloody Harvest goes into detail about the
evidence behind their claim

86
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,070
that Falun Gong practitioners make up the
majority of organ harvesting victims.

87
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,470
Like how undercover investigators called dozens
of Chinese hospitals,

88
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,310
asking for those healthy Falun Gong organs.

89
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,160
And the doctors even boasted about it!

90
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,790
For example...

91
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,030
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h Let me tell you,

92
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,030
it should be OK to have liver transplant in
your case.

93
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,940
Investigator:\h\h\h I just want to know how
long we have to wait.

94
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,000
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h We have supplies everyday.

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,880
Today for example,

96
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,960
we are performing transplant surgery.

97
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,140
Investigator:\h\h\h Well, I mean not just
a fresh one.

98
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,880
We need one from live human body…

99
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,480
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h Sure, the organs we use
are all from live persons.

100
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,080
Investigator:\h\h\h What?

101
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,880
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h They are all live organs!

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,540
Ours are the best.

103
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,680
Yes, for the best live organs,

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,990
visit Jiaotong University Affiliated Hospital.

105
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,920
Investigator:\h\h\h So I want to know how
long you have been in operation.

106
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,720
I want to find out your skill level.

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,820
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h We’ve done this for 5-6
years.

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,780
We have performed such kind of operation for
5-6 years already.

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,860
Investigator:\h\h\h Then how many do you do
per month?

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,180
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h We have done 400 to 500
cases.

111
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,320
Investigator:\h\h\h What? 400 - 500?

112
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,960
Doctor Dai:\h\h\h Yes, that’s right.

113
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,900
Now the day after the Bloody Harvest report
was released,

114
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,770
a reporter in Beijing asked Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying about it.

115
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,480
Unsurprisingly, her response was that,

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,900
“such stories about forced organ harvesting
in China

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,230
are imaginary and baseless.

118
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,080
They don’t have any factual foundation.”

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,190
Which I can only assume means she didn’t
read the 680-page report,

120
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,480
the last 230 pages of which are filled with
all of their references,

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,480
because man, there’s a lot of facts.

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,810
But China’s Foreign Ministry had a better
solution

123
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,120
than reading the report and addressing the
facts.

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,480
It simply removed the reporter's question 
and her answer

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,200
from that day's official press conference transcript.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,040
Now no one will know!

127
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,360
Now although the update to the Bloody Harvest
report

128
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,410
just came out a couple weeks ago,

129
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,340
this story has been out for much longer.

130
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,760
The first press conference about it was 10
years ago.

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,430
And here’s someone you may know reporting
on it in 2011,

132
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,180
back when people still watched news on television:

133
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,960
"An investigation has raised the issue that
some Chinese organs

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,139
may have been taken from prisoners of conscience."

135
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,010
But like Leonardo DiCaprio,

136
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,650
the organ harvesting story has taken a long
time

137
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,950
to finally get the recognition it deserves.

138
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,660
In fact, the US House of Representatives

139
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,850
passed a resolution on June 13th this year

140
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,020
condemning China’s wide-scale murder

141
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,690
of Falun Gong practitioners for their organs.

142
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,900
Now that is shocking.

143
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,740
Democrats and Republicans actually agreed
on something!

144
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,210
But the biggest shock may come from inside
China.

145
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,330
Because now that this news is getting more
and more attention,

146
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,710
Chinese authorities will have to do more to
address it

147
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,200
than simply deleting all mentions of it from
the Foreign Ministry website.

148
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,830
And there’s some evidence that Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

149
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,790
is already taking steps to address it

150
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,310
but of course in a very roundabout way.

151
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,520
As I’ve mentioned before,

152
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,590
Xi Jinping’s so-called anti-corruption campaign

153
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,840
is really aimed at taking down his political
enemies.

154
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,830
One of his enemies is former Chinese leader
Jiang Zemin.

155
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,730
He’s the guy who originally orchestrated
the entire persecution of Falun Gong.

156
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,630
And he’s been controlling the military from
behind the scenes,

157
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,669
even after he stepped down in 2003.

158
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,810
Well, just a few days before the Congressional
resolution passed,

159
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,010
Jiang Zemin was allegedly taken into custody
by Chinese paramilitary troops

160
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,889
according to the Epoch Times.

161
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,580
So if the head guy responsible

162
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,380
for organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners
gets taken down,

163
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,020
does that mean Xi Jinping can make it stop?

164
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,350
And will he?

165
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,660
Perhaps we can gently nudge him towards the
right move

166
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,880
with a tremendous amount of international
pressure.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,820
One thing you can do is sign this petition

168
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,669
calling for the UN to push China to stop killing
people for their organs.

169
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,700

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,710
And like I said,

171
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,650
more people need to know about this.

172
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,920
So share this video with at least three people
you know.

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,830
And then they can share it with three people,

174
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,520
who can share it with three people,

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,490
and pretty soon the whole world will see this
video!

176
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,270
That's how YouTube works, right?

177
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,620
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.
