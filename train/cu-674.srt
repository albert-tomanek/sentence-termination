00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,230
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,530
foreign aggression in the South China Sea.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,220
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,110
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,650
The South China Sea!

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,090
A vast body of water rich in natural resources.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,980
It sees 5 trillion dollars worth of shipping
pass through it every year.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,369
And it's under attack!

9
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:30,529
Yes, one country has been aggressively pursing
its own selfish interests in the region,

10
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:31,680
angering its neighbors

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,530
and possibly even incurring the wrath of Neptune.

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,110
And that country is...Japan!

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,780
What, you expected me to say China?

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,260
I mean, sure Chinese ships took over the Jackson
Atoll in the South China Sea.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,030
But it's the South China Sea.

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,190
It clearly belongs to China.

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,280
Just like my mother's pantry cabinet.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
Filled with China--'s sovereign territory.

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,200
The latest news is that, according to Reuters,

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,850
a Japanese submarine and two warships will
sail to the Philippines and then on to Vietnam.

21
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,140
Understandably, China is upset.

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,580
It's outrageous!

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,930
Remember the last time Japanese warships sailed
through that area, the disputed Spratly Islands?

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,810
Well, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong
Lei sure does.

25
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,300
"Japan occupied China's Spratly Islands during
World War Two,

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,200
so we are on high alert for Japan's moves
in the South China Sea."

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,380
Yes, World War Two!

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,670
Gahhh, do you remember the aggressive territorial
expansion of the Japanese Empire?

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,460
That's why China is now actively engaged in
preserving peace in the region.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,159
Ok, well, ignore that time this Chinese ship

31
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,409
accidentally rammed a Vietnamese fishing boat
in disputed waters back in 2014.

32
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,290
And these artificial islands they're building
and filling with

33
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,100
military-grade runways, missiles launchers,
and radar.

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,100
"China is clearly militarizing the South China
Sea,

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,419
and you'd have to believe in a flat earth to
think otherwise."

36
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,480
Hey, some people do believe in a flat earth.

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,669
And while we're at it,

38
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:18,289
let's pretend those Chinese airplanes in the
night sky are just shooting stars!

39
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:23,689
"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?"

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,360
Anyway, maybe China's alleged military actions
are really just simple misunderstandings.

41
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,389
Like what happened earlier this month

42
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:37,219
when some Filipino fishermen mistakenly thought
Chinese naval vessels

43
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,659
had "seized" the disputed Jackson Atoll in
the Spratly Islands.

44
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,870
And chased them off with guns.

45
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,049
But in reality, the Chinese were just helping
tow a grounded Filipino ship,

46
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,949
which somehow no one knew about other than
the Chinese, and...

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,419
"China advised the fishing boats in nearby
waters to leave in order to ensure navigation

48
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,109
safety and operating conditions."

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,100
See? China is just looking out for everyone's
safety.

50
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,059
Oh, well that was back in 2011. Ignore that.

51
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:13,169
Anyway, China's more recent, ummm, appearance

52
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,949
at the Jackson Atoll is understandable

53
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:19,019
considering the "provocation" by the Philippines.

54
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,709
You see, the Philippines is seeking international
arbitration over territorial disputes in the

55
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,699
South China Sea

56
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,790
arbitration that China has flatly rejected.

57
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,859
Obviously. I mean, it all belongs to China
anyway.

58
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,229
Look at all those navy ships they have there.

59
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,979
Why involve the international community?

60
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,129
Now Chinese ships have since left the Jackson
Atoll.

61
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,019
Yet despite all of China's efforts to preserve
peace in the region,

62
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,709
warships from around the world are flooding
the area.

63
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,529
Not just Japan, but also the US,

64
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:52,879
and India.

65
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,499
And there's even a North Korean ship there...somehow.

66
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:02,309
So clearly it's not just Japanese aggression
China has to worry about.

67
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:06,589
As Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for China's National
People's Congress, said,

68
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:09,199
“If you take a look at the matter closely,

69
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,829
it's the US sending the most advanced aircraft
and military vessels to the South China Sea."

70
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,689
Yeah, what's up with the US throwing its weight
around,

71
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:26,849
holding joint military exercises on its own...with
the Philippines...and Japan...and India.

72
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,039
Clearly no one wants America there.

73
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,840
China's doing a fine job maintaining order
there all by itself.

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,379
So ask not for whom the bell a-tolls.

75
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,990
It tolls…for China. It's China's bell.

76
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,430
It has been since ancient times.

77
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,300
So what do you think of China's Jackson Atoll
occupation

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,689
I mean solidifying of its long-held, totally
legitimate claims?
