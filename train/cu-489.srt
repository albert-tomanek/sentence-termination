1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,520
Hello.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,540
Are you…?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,259
I’m Gina Shakespear,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,560
from the YouTube channel Declassified.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,620
Yeah, I know Declassified.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,820
But...why are you here?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,580
This bloke let me in.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,590
You mean Matt?

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,160
That blonde guy with the blue eyes?

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
That’s the one.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Right.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
So what are you doing at my desk?

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,169
Well, I’m doing some research for Declassified,

16
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,860
about Chinese Communist Party subversion of
the US.

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,530
And I figured China Uncensored would be the
place to go.

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,760
So...you infiltrated my studio, and hacked
into my computer?

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,740
Actually, the blonde guy gave me the password.

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,740
Matt!!

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,760
Well, since you’re already here, did you
find anything good?

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,290
Yeah, I’ve put together 5 Ways China is
Subverting the United States.

23
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,240
Great, let’s take a look.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Alright.

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
We’ll start with…

26
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,160
Number 5: Government officials

27
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,000
The Chinese Communist Party wants to get in
good

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,310
with US government officials.

29
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,310
And if that doesn’t work,

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,850
they put pressure on them.

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,850
For example,

32
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,430
they’ve got people like US Senator Dianne
Feinstein.

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,870
China’s former leader Jiang Zemin

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,820
spent years building a relationship with her.

35
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,420
World’s most uncomfortable karaoke night.

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,420
Yeah.

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,070
Feinstein’s husband enjoyed big business
profits in China.

38
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,070
And meanwhile,

39
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,460
Senator Feinstein supported legislation

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,820
like giving China most favored nation status
to increase trade.

41
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,110
Also, her driver was allegedly a Chinese spy.

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,640
Feinstein is a pretty obvious case.

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,560
But not every US official is like that.

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,090
No, sometimes it takes more pressure.

45
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,660
Like last summer,

46
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,990
California state senator Joel Anderson

47
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,590
wanted to pass SJR-10.

48
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,770
It was a state resolution condemning the Communist
Party’s

49
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,490
persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.

50
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,510
But then, the senate suddenly blocked it right

51
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,610
before it was about to come to a vote.

52
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,600
It turns out, a bunch of senators received

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,099
a threatening email that morning

54
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,269
from the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco.

55
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,540
It warned them about SJR-10,

56
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,480
saying it could “sabotage the friendship

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,359
and sustainable development between California
and China.”

58
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,359
Right.

59
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:23,620
Because passing a law through a democratic
vote...

60
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,310
that’s what sabotage is.

61
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,569
Friends don’t let friends call out

62
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,590
each other’s human rights abuses, Chris.

63
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,640
And this kind of pressure happens all the
time.

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,000
Anyway, moving on to...

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,859
Number 4: Businesses

66
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,569
The Chinese Communist Party has been

67
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,819
pretty successful at pressuring American companies.

68
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,279
For years, one of the rules of doing business
with China

69
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,950
is that foreign companies have to share their
technology

70
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,799
with local Chinese companies.

71
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,629
You’d think that companies wouldn’t make

72
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,769
these kind of stupid deals.

73
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,959
Yeah, except they’re scared that if they
don’t,

74
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,719
their competitors will.

75
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,499
So a lot of companies feel like they have
no choice.

76
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,669
Fortunately, the US government has recently

77
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:04,709
called China out on this.

78
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,579
Because when it happens on a large scale,

79
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,379
it becomes a big drain on the US economy.

80
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:10,379
And of course,

81
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,090
if a company resisted sharing their technology
with China,

82
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,359
the Chinese military would—

83
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,140
how should I put it?—

84
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,120
enforce the sharing anyway.

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,870
IP theft costs America hundreds of billions
of dollars a year,

86
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,219
maybe trillions.

87
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,709
And we haven’t even talked about

88
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,959
the subversion they do from inside the US,

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,670
which is directly planting spies—

90
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,300
especially in the tech industry.

91
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,930
Chinese employees can be pressured to be part-time
spies,

92
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,029
and provide information or technology to their
handlers

93
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:43,480
who work for China’s Ministry of State Security.

94
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,920
Sometimes they do it because there’s pressure

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,190
on their families inside China,

96
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,719
or they do it for patriotism,

97
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,019
or just for the money.

98
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,830
Non-Chinese employees can also do it for the
money, too.

99
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,480
So the US loses a lot of technology to China.

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,709
At least we get entertaining Chinese knockoffs,

101
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:05,370
like the iPnoho6.

102
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,669
You can’t make this stuff up.

103
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,799
Number 3: Universities

104
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,969
Universities in the US love having

105
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:12,890
international students from China.

106
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,730
They pay full tuition.

107
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,730
And of course,

108
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,500
it’s a great way for Chinese students

109
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,329
to get introduced to American culture.

110
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,770
Except...a lot of them aren’t really integrating
that much.

111
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,530
Yeah, that’s one problem.

112
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,949
And the Chinese Embassy and consulates

113
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,449
try to maintain a tight grip of these students.

114
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:33,449
For example, they set up

115
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,740
the Chinese Student and Scholar Associations.

116
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,740
On the surface,

117
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,919
they’re about welcoming and caring for Chinese
students.

118
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,220
But they’re also ways to track and monitor
students,

119
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,419
and make sure they hold the “correct”
political views.

120
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,530
Like that Taiwan is a province of China.

121
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,110
And that people who criticize human rights
abuses are anti-China.

122
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,460
People like you, Chris,

123
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,539
who undermine China’s harmonious society.

124
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,550
Strangely, no one says that your Declassified
channel

125
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,919
is undermining America’s harmonious society.

126
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,449
That’s because America can handle truth
bombs, Chris.

127
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,280
Anyway, there are other ways the Chinese Communist
Party

128
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,569
is subverting American universities.

129
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:13,780
Like the Confucius Institutes.

130
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,050
As Confucius said,

131
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,509
“Political power grows out of the barrel
of a gun.”

132
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,449
Or maybe that was Mao Zedong.

133
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,340
That’s not too far from what they’re teaching.

134
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,310
Confucius Institutes give money to Chinese
universities

135
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,810
to host their Chinese language classes.

136
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,940
But in the course material,

137
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,520
they present a pro-communist view of China’s
development.

138
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,870
And of course they conveniently avoid sensitive
topics.

139
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,210
“Teacher, how do you write the characters
for ‘Free Tibet’?”

140
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,400
And there’s another way American universities

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,580
are being undermined.

142
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,070
“Some people in academia have submitted

143
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,080
to a sophisticated global censorship regime.”

144
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,759
One student told The New Republic,

145
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,550
“I would not willfully do anything that
would endanger

146
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,370
my ability to get a visa to China in the future.”

147
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,430
In other words, don’t be like Chris Chappell.

148
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,139
Speaking of which…

149
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,770
Number 2: Journalism.

150
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,300
As you know, the Chinese Communist Party

151
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,690
has the “Three Warfares” doctrine.

152
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,180
And the first “warfare” is about shaping
public opinion,

153
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,719
both inside China and around the world.

154
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,182
For example, they allow big media companies

155
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,182
to set up bureaus in Beijing and Shanghai.

156
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,182
But in exchange for access,

157
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:25,182
they have to avoid politically sensitive topics.

158
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,182
And reporters are restricted about

159
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:27,182
which places they can visit inside China.

160
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:28,182
Big booming cities, yes.

161
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:29,182
Polluted cancer villages,

162
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,182
not so much.

163
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,182
And if reporters cross the line,

164
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,182
they get kicked out of China.

165
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,182
So news organization can self-censor,

166
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:35,040
just like some academics do.

167
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,220
And over time, American public opinion on
China

168
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,520
gets skewed in favor of Beijing’s narrative.

169
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,340
You even get American media publishing opinion
pieces like this:

170
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,319
I mean really,

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,689
all America needs to do to become superior
again

172
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,969
is silence public opinion,

173
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:53,969
take away rights,

174
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,020
and throw a million people in re-education
camps

175
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,560
for their religion.

176
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,909
Of course, foreign newspaper reporters in
China

177
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,099
don’t usually praise the Communist Party
directly.

178
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,970
That’s the job of state-run China Daily.

179
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,659
Like when they put these paid inserts into

180
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,979
influential newspapers like the Wall Street
Journal.

181
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,449
C’mon, who wouldn’t want another Great
Leap Forward?

182
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,360
It only killed like 45 million people.

183
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
And speaking of propaganda...

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,879
Number 1: Meddling in US Elections

185
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,849
We always knew that the Chinese Communist
Party

186
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:26,889
wants to direct US policy towards China.

187
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,379
But now, US officials have started talking
about

188
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:31,530
the Chinese Communist Party trying to

189
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,350
influence US elections, as well.

190
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,659
“China has initiated an unprecedented effort

191
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,569
to influence American public opinion,

192
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,069
the 2018 elections,

193
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,070
and the environment leading into the 2020
presidential elections.

194
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,310
To put it bluntly, President Trump’s leadership
is working;

195
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,400
and China wants a different American President.”

196
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,279
But the Chinese Communist Party’s influence
operations

197
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,960
are different from countries like Russia.

198
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,410
Here’s one example.

199
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,120
One of America’s biggest exports to China

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,050
is agricultural products, like soybeans and
pork.

201
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,210
When the Chinese regime put tariffs on US
soybeans and pork,

202
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,009
farmers--who were more likely to vote for
President Trump--

203
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,760
were also the most affected.

204
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,439
And then when Chinese state-run media place
ads in US newspapers

205
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,300
calling the US-China trade war the “Fruit
of a President’s Folly,”

206
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,830
well, they want those farmers to change their
minds about Trump.

207
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,220
For an authoritarian regime, the Chinese Communist
Party

208
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,509
is surprisingly good at manipulating democracy.

209
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:27,461
Well, we don’t yet know all the ways that

210
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,919
the Chinese Communist Party is influencing
US elections.

211
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,350
Hopefully US officials will say more about
that in the future.

212
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,250
Well, that’s a pretty scary list, Gina.

213
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,250
It is.

214
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,210
And I think Vice President Mike Pence

215
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,300
did a good job of summing it all up.

216
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,860
“The Chinese Communist Party is rewarding

217
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,950
or coercing American businesses,

218
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,690
movie studios, universities, think tanks,
scholars,

219
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,790
journalists, and local, state, and federal
officials.”

220
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,790
But the real question is,

221
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,260
how can we influence American businesses,

222
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,430
movie studios, universities, think tanks,
journalists,

223
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,280
and government officials?

224
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,390
I guess everyone will have to watch China
Uncensored.

225
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,780
And what can Americans do to learn more about
this?

226
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,380
Well, viewers can see more about that

227
