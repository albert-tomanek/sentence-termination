1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,190
The Chinese Telecom Giant Huawei

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,660
wants to dominate the international market.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,100
And that’s key to the Chinese Communist
Party’s plans.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,620
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,940
I’m Chris Chappell.

when we publish a new episode.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,140
Huawei.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,790
It’s the largest telecom equipment maker
in China—

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,539
and the entire world.

13
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,360
How did this Chinese company become

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,230
a global force in just a few short decades?

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,160
Well, it was more than just their entrepreneurial
spirit.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,940
It was largely thanks to the company’s close
relationship

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,170
with the Chinese Communist Party.

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,890
Which explains why Huawei’s phones redistribute

19
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,760
all of your data to the Chinese regime.

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,380
Huawei’s relationship with the Chinese Communist
Party

21
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,310
is something the US government has been worried
about for years.

22
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,130
But it’s become international news

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,219
following the arrest of Huawei’s CFO

24
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,380
Meng Wanzhou in Canada last December.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,390
The US has filed criminal charges against
Meng and Huawei

26
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,290
for various forms of fraud and violating US
sanctions on Iran.

27
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,530
Now, the US wants to extradite Meng.

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,530
Despite that,

29
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,290
Huawei is still a critical part of

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,210
the Chinese Communist Party’s plan

31
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,850
to become a world superpower.

32
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,479
And the Chinese regime has pushed Huawei

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,880
onto unsuspecting countries

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,130
through its Belt and Road Initiative,

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,580
also known as One Belt, One Road.

36
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,940
Which is much better than the original name,

37
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,280
One Loan, One Debt Trap.

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280


39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,299
Since the Belt and Road Initiative began in
2013,

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,130
the Chinese regime has financed infrastructure
projects

41
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,400
in more than 60 countries.

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,790
And while it might be hard to see Huawei’s
role in say,

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,460
building a bridge in Kenya—

44
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,320
that may or may not collapse,

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,630
—the telecom equipment maker is the digital
bridge builder

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,729
of the Belt and Road.

47
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,380
In a March 2015 directive about the goals
for the Belt and Road,

48
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,420
Chinese authorities said

49
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,770
“Two key objectives were the ‘construction

50
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,119
of transnational fiber optics for communications’

51
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,409
and ‘synchronizing technological standards

52
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,709
between China and other countries.’”

53
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,670
And that’s where Huawei comes in.

54
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,180
According to one Huawei official speaking
to Chinese media,

55
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,069
“different [One Belt One Road] infrastructure
projects...

56
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,849
would all require modern telecom equipment

57
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,560
to allow systems to communicate with each
other—

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,950
prime business opportunities for Huawei.”

59
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,340
Huawei also received huge loans

60
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,450
from the state-owned Silk Road investment
fund,

61
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,099
and the \hAsian Infrastructure Investment
Bank,

62
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,620
which is backed by the Chinese regime.

63
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,790
Here are 5 ways Huawei is being used

64
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,870
for the Belt and Road Initiative.

65
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,340
Number 5

66
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,129
Underwater Internet Cables

67
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,569
The Internet may not be a series of tubes,

68
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,819
but it is a series of cables—

69
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,560
including thousands of miles of cables

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,810
that run underneath the oceans.

71
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,520
Which is part of the reason why the Atlanteans

72
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,730
are so mad at us surface-dwellers.

73
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,810
But really, the Atlanteans should direct their
anger

74
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,150
at Huawei Marine.

75
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,430
It’s a joint venture between Huawei,

76
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,190
and a U.K.-based submarine communications
firm

77
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,220
Global Marine Systems.

78
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,730
They built 7 thousand miles of undersea cables.

79
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,900
They called it the PEACE Cable Project.

80
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,320
Which sounds super sketchy.

81
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,319
It’s an underwater high-speed internet cable
system

82
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,320
linking Pakistan, South Africa, Kenya,

83
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,489
Somalia, Djibouti, Egypt, and France.

84
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,050
They say it will be a new information expressway

85
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,430
for China, Europe and Africa.

86
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,800
Which is just what everyone wants.

87
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,360
Internet brought to you by the world’s

88
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,930
worst abuser of internet freedom.

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,030
According to the Huawei Marine COO,

90
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,220
they were building enough underwater cable

91
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,120
to circle the entire Earth.

92
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,470
But they ran into a little undersea problem.

93
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,760
And I don’t mean Cthulhu.

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,590
I’m talking about Australia.

95
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,030
In June, the Australian government agreed
to fund

96
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,650
its own undersea internet cables for the Solomon
Islands,

97
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,879
leapfrogging Huawei’s plans to build their
cables there.

98
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,879
According to Reuters,

99
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,880
that was done because if Huawei had built
it instead,

100
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,110
it “could have compromised Australian internet
security.”

101
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,160
Number 4

102
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,770
Smart Cities

103
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,170
You live in a dumb city.

104
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,249
No, I’m not insulting the place you live.

105
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:19,129
I’m just saying, it’s not a “smart city.”

106
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:22,039
“Similar to how a person’s nervous system
detects

107
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,520
and reacts to changes in its environment,

108
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,539
a Smart City using Huawei’s Smart City solutions

109
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,789
can sense, process and deliver informed decisions

110
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,240
that improves the environment for its inhabitants.”

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
That may sound pretty good,

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,569
but remember that it’s a company connected

113
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,909
to the world’s largest authoritarian regime

114
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,520
that’s saying it can sense, process and
deliver

115
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,020
informed decisions that affect its inhabitants.

116
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,389
And according to a 2015 research paper

117
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,909
from China’s State Information Center,

118
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:53,819
smart cities could help lead the Belt and
Road Initiative.

119
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,949
“The paper applauded Huawei...

120
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,419
for undertaking an important role

121
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,570
in building ‘smart cities’ in other countries.”

122
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,949
And what would a top feature of these smart
cities

123
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,129
designed by a company with shady links

124
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,360
to the Chinese Communist Party be?

125
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,389
Why, better governance.

126
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,570
Brr, I’m shivering.

127
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,599
And it’s not the polar vortex.

128
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,110
I think it’s something to do with

129
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,680
how the Chinese Communist Party

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,809
uses that same technology in China

131
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:22,090
to harass and monitor its own population.

132
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,559
And the Belt and Road Initiative,

133
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,259
using Huawei technology,

134
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,990
is trying to export that model.

135
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,399
According to the Jamestown Foundation,

136
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,710
“While the smart cities of the future could
be

137
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,550
better, more efficient cities,

138
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,119
they could also provide authoritarian regimes

139
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:40,460
with previously undreamt of tools of surveillance
and control.”

140
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,559
Why, let’s take a look at one example of

141
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,490
a Huawei Belt and Road Smart City.

142
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,360
Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.

143
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,090
It began its transformation into a smart city
in 2016.

144
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,149
To start with,

145
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,469
that meant Huawei adding around

146
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,460
10,000 surveillance cameras.

147
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,399
What a wonderful contribution to an authoritarian
state.

148
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,399
In fact, Jamestown notes,

149
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,879
“It is both interesting and suggestive that

150
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,770
the list of countries where Huawei’s safe
city solutions

151
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,240
were first deployed includes a number of authoritarian

152
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,400
and hybrid regimes with close ties to China,

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,550
among them Russia, Pakistan,

154
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,969
Venezuela, Laos, and Angola.”

155
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,370
And since that worked out so well for them,

156
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,539
Germany is now interested as well.

157
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,710
But don’t worry.

158
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,309
There’s no way Germany could ever

159
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:31,869
transform into an authoritarian state.

160
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:32,969
Number 3

161
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:33,969
Smart Energy

162
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,689
Can’t have a smart city without smart energy.

163
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,409
That’s why Huawei is now selling smart energy
systems

164
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,330
to oil-producing countries and companies.

165
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,139
Which turns out are also usually authoritarian
regimes.

166
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:48,770
Go figure.

167
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,610
Some of these contracts Huawei has

168
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,229
are official Belt and Road projects.

169
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,909
One of the major strategic goals of the Belt
and Road initiative

170
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:59,219
is to funnel global oil supplies to China,

171
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,999
which struggles to keep up with growing energy
needs.

172
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,610
But it’s not just oil.

173
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,749
Shanghai Electric,

174
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,539
a subsidiary of China’s state-owned construction
company,

175
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:09,539
PowerChina,

176
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,219
is building a new solar power plant in Argentina.

177
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:14,520
According to the Huawei website,

178
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,159
“It is the first successful project in Argentina

179
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,139
after the Belt and Road Initiative proposed
by China.”

180
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,930
And “the project adopts Huawei Smart [photovoltaic]
solutions”,

181
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,459
which may include connecting Huawei technology
to the power grid.

182
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,459


183
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,459
Wow, great idea.

184
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:31,270
Give the Chinese Communist Party easy access

185
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,599
to your nation’s power supply.

186
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,880
Number 2

187
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,789
National Emergency Systems

188
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,659
Ecuador has hitched its trailer to the Belt
and Road.

189
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:46,059
A big part of that was the ECU 911 national
emergency system.

190
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:48,249
It was built by China’s state-owned

191
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,869
China National Electronics Import and Export
Corporation.

192
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,279
And they turned to Huawei

193
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,989
for their facial recognition surveillance
cameras,

194
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,879
routers, wireless access points, network switches,

195
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,239
and wireless access controllers.

196
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:04,310
So basically, using the excuse of providing
Ecuador

197
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,099
with a national emergency service,

198
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,300
China got to install an all seeing eye.

199
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,000
First of all, that’s a cyber espionage threat.

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,129
But beyond that,

201
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,419
it risks exporting the Communist Party’s
authoritarianism

202
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,689
around the world.

203
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,939
“Countries like [Ecuador] may have difficulties
acquiring

204
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,419
sophisticated types of surveillance—

205
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,550
of course they can buy it off the shelf,

206
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,270
but what China can give them is a whole system,

207
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,209
from physical centers to processing software.

208
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,140
And when they export those systems,

209
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,370
it’s not just the physical aspect

210
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,870
but the political norms that come with them.”

211
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,399
So Chinese investment,

212
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,190
backed by state-owned enterprises and Huawei,

213
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:49,139
might come with a bit more than a lot of countries
bargained for.

214
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:50,290
Number 1

215
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,290
5G

216
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,230
5G is the future of wireless communication.

217
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,690
And companies around the world

218
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,290
are trying to dominate the market.

219
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,430
According to the New York Times,

220
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,810
“A Huawei spokesman said it had been

221
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,670
working on 5G since 2009,

222
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,339
having spent $600 million on related research

223
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,639
already and committing $800 million more in
2018 alone.”

224
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,339
And “Huawei...owns about 10 percent of 5G
essential patents.”

225
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,970
This could be a big win for Huawei.

226
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,660
It could pocket licensing fees from both government

227
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,149
and mobile service providers that use a Huawei
5G network.

228
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,180
This report by U.S.-based think tank

229
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,899
Center for Strategic and International Studies

230
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,720
shows that Huawei leads the world

231
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,050
in manufacturing a certain vital component
of 5G service:

232
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,779
the radio access network or RAN.

233
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,570
RAN is what connects your mobile phone to
the network.

234
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,490
If Huawei gained control of the world’s
5G networks,

235
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,970
it means the Chinese Communist Party

236
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,810
could also get access.

237
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,589
And that would create mayhem and mass surveillance,

238
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,500
according to a retired US General.

239
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,000
However, Huawei’s 5G ambitions may not be
coming to fruition.

240
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,230
Countries around the world have begun

241
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,629
banning Huawei from working with their governments

242
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,870
and building their 5G networks.

243
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,939
For a rundown on that,

244
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,240
check out my recent episodes,

245
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,709
How 8 Countries Are Dealing with Huawei.

246
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,600
So what do you think of how Huawei

247
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,959
is getting in on China’s Belt and Road Initiative?

249
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
And before we go,

250
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,100
now is the time when I answer questions from
you,

251
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,850
my loyal 50-cent army—

252
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,300
fans of the show who support what we do

253
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,079
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

254
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,420
Zhou Rui asks, “With Xi Jinping’s

255
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,699
consolidation of power mostly complete

256
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,959
is there even a small chance that he will
invoke

257
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,300
his power to make China Democratic

258
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,930
or even Democratic with Chinese characteristics?”

259
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,230
What Xi Jinping ultimately will do is the
million yuan question.

260
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,899
However, I don’t want you to have the misconception

261
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,230
that Xi is an untouchable all-powerful leader.

262
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,360
There’s still infighting going on within
the Communist Party.

263
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,240
China is facing unprecedented economic and
social challenges.

264
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,180
The US-China trade war is just one of them.

265
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,579
And Xi will get all the credit or blame

266
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,910
for however it all goes down.

267
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,449
And if Xi Jinping can’t save the ship

268
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,000
by doubling down on the Chinese Communist
Party,

269
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,850
he may try to pull a Gorbachev:

270
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,070
Dissolve the Communist Party,

271
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,500
and make China democratic—

272
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,060
or as you said,

273
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,300
“Democratic with Chinese characteristics.”

274
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,089
Which could mean less like Taiwan,

275
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,949
and more like Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

276
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,129
Xi Jinping is politically very savvy.

277
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:28,560
If he feels democracy is the best option—

278
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,190
or the least bad available option—

279
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,470
he may try it.

280
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,100
But don’t hold your breath for China

281
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,130
creating a democracy as open as Taiwan’s.

282
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,670
There is a small chance,

283
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,779
but these things are very hard to predict.

284
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,269
Thanks for you question, Zhou Rui.

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,800
