1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,261
Trump has said China needs\h
to pay for the coronavirus.

2
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:04,640
“China’s going to pay a big price”

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
And there’s one creative way

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,640
the US could make China pay.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,240
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,600
A lot of Americans—who don’t have crippling\h
student loan debt—are looking for new ways\h\h

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,760
to invest their savings. The interest\h
rate on government bonds here in America\h\h

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
is...basically zero. But don’t worry,\h
because investment firms that I trust,\h\h

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,800
like BlackRock, are encouraging us to\h
invest in Chinese government bonds.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,320
We know China is a great\h
place to throw our money into,\h\h

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
because they’ve been issuing government\h
bonds for more than a century.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
But according to the American\h
Bondholders Foundation,\h\h

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,760
there have been a few small problems in the\h
past for investors who’ve bought Chinese debt.\h\h

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,840
Small problems, like not ever getting paid back.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
Matt Gnaizda sat down with Jonna Bianco, President\h\h

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,240
of the American Bondholders\h
Foundation, to learn more.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,816
INTERVIEW

18
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,800
All right. Thanks for joining me Jonna.

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,480
Happy to be here. Thank you.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,520
Now you're an expert on Chinese bonds which is\h
good because they're really hot right now. A\h\h

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,360
few weeks ago the Chinese government raised\h
$6 billion in a huge international sale of\h\h

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,640
their sovereign bonds. So my question is, how much\h
should I be investing in these new Chinese bonds?

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,520
Well look, when it comes to China\h
history has a tendency to repeat itself.\h\h

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
I represent 20,000 U.S. citizens\h
holding defaulted Chinese sovereign debt\h\h

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,400
that they defaulted on, refused to pay, although\h
paid Great Britain. So as we know, history does\h\h

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,680
repeat itself. Your money gets tied up, they\h
default, you have nowhere to go to collect it\h\h

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,160
with China other than your government. And we have\h
seen nothing but game playing in politics when it\h\h

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,120
comes to China especially with Beijing Biden and\h
the Democrats. I mean, we've seen that with the\h\h

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,200
election, we've seen it with our national\h
security, we've seen it with the continued\h\h

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,280
ignoring of the most existential threat we've\h
ever seen facing this country which is China.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,280
I mean, so you're suggesting\h
that maybe we shouldn't trust the\h\h

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,160
Chinese communist party? I mean,\h
what have they ever lied about?

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,680
I think that the list would be shorter to say what\h
have they told the truth about. In all honesty,\h\h

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,720
we cannot trust China. Look, we see President\h
Donald Trump speaking about it, we see\h\h

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,560
DNI Ratcliffe, we see secretary Pompeo. Everybody\h
is saying China is the most existential threat\h\h

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,080
facing this country and yet it continues to fall\h
on deaf ears with our politicians on both sides of\h\h

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,720
the aisle. They know of this threat. I mean\h
gosh look at this, it took 10 years for the\h\h

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,320
Senate under McConnell's leadership to get a bill\h
to the Senate floor and a vote just to make China\h\h

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,920
and their state-owned enterprises comply with the\h
very same rules and regulations that every other\h\h

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,760
company trading on Wall Street from around the\h
world has to comply with. There's no disclosure,\h\h

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,280
there's no information available to the\h
investor. China hides behind state secrets.

42
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,920
And so, it took 10 years just to get that bill\h
to the floor and in that vote they agreed, "Let's\h\h

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,040
give them three years to come into compliance with\h
SEC rules and regulations to audit their books.\h\h

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,000
So investors know where their money's actually\h
going." Well, I can tell you where it's going,\h\h

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,480
it's going for nefarious reasons as we've seen\h
with the military buildup in the South China Sea,\h\h

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040
their technology information\h
stealing. The list is a mile long.\h\h

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,080
And so, investing in China is very, very dangerous\h
and there is no control. We've seen the same thing\h\h

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,760
in the house. I've seen nothing but political\h
rhetoric pandering to Wall Street and the big\h\h

49
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,720
Chinese contributions and donors that fill\h
their pockets and yet nothing is ever done,\h\h

50
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,800
at the peril of the citizens of the\h
United States and those around the world.

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Well, and this ties back into what you're\h
working on because you're the president of\h\h

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,560
the American Bondholders Foundation. And\h
back in 1912, so more than a hundred years\h\h

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,040
ago after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the\h
Republic of China government issued a huge\h\h

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,640
tranche of debt to build their new republic. I\h
think it was about 25 million pounds of debt,\h\h

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,360
British pounds. So that's like four billion\h
U.S. dollars in today's money, right?

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Right. And they did that in '12, '13, '14, all the\h
way up through 1938 and then they went into big\h\h

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,920
default and then the U.S. government—because\h
they were then an ally in the war—allowed\h\h

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,480
them to borrow U.S. taxpayers' dollars to which\h
they still never paid back. And then we have the\h\h

59
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,080
communist regime, the Chinese communist party\h
that came in and took over. And other than\h\h

60
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,320
being held to account by Margaret Thatcher\h
in 1987 to pay back this debt, these bonds,\h\h

61
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,400
to their citizens no one else has told China you\h
have to pay your debt, you have to pay your bonds.

62
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,760
So let's talk about these bonds\h
specifically. So the debt that\h\h

63
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,920
they'd been issuing in the first half of\h
the 20th century: Who bought these bonds?

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,840
Well, banks bought these bonds. I mean,\h
these bonds were sold around the world,\h\h

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,480
the French, the Belgians, all over the place.\h
They were advertised in the New York Times,\h\h

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,800
sold through Wall Street firms in New York,\h
American citizens, a lot of military people\h\h

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,080
because it was promoted to military people\h
to help support our then-ally in the war to\h\h

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,760
purchase these bonds. And then China defaulted,\h
the communist regime came in and they now refuse\h\h

69
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:55,120
to pay. Keep in mind governments issue long-term\h
debt 30, 40, 50, 60 year long bonds. In fact,\h\h

70
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,800
China is issuing 100-year bonds in Europe as we\h
speak. And look, sovereign debt does not expire.

71
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,200
It's important to note that during World War II,\h
which was in the 1940s, Great Britain borrowed\h\h

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:17,360
back then $21 billion from America.\h
It was only December 31st of 2006\h\h

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,120
that they made their last and final payment paying\h
off that debt of sovereign debt owed to America\h\h

74
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,120
which was from tax payers dollars. So\h
again, sovereign debt does not expire,\h\h

75
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
government debt does not expire. It would\h
be no different than somebody who bought\h\h

76
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,800
a 30 year treasury bond today 20 years from now\h
under a different administration says, "Oh gosh,\h\h

77
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,000
that was 20 years ago, 30 years ago, that's\h
old. We shouldn't have to pay that now. Move on,\h\h

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,640
just move along and don't get your\h
money." And that's basically what we see.

79
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,160
And it's a big bully dealing with China\h
and their political allies on Wall Street\h\h

80
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:04,000
and corporate America who sold out middle-class to\h
profit themselves and put Americans out of work,\h\h

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,640
out of manufacturing. The middle to low\h
income individual was just out of a job\h\h

82
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,480
and it all went to China. And we see the results\h
of that just like we saw during this pandemic of\h\h

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,880
not being able to get pharmaceutical supplies,\h
PPE equipment, so on and so forth. And so,\h\h

84
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,120
the only people that profited from that is your\h
senior executives in these Wall Street firms.\h\h

85
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,000
And unfortunately, with all of the thousands of\h
state owned enterprises that China has trading on\h\h

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,880
our markets that unwitting American citizens\h
through their retirements, 401ks, pensions\h\h

87
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,920
are being invested in China and it's not going\h
to be too much longer as we've seen the massive\h\h

88
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,120
amounts of default go on in businesses in China\h
that they're going to default again. And those\h\h

89
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,560
people are going to lose their pensions, their\h
401ks, their retirement, and have nothing left.

90
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,880
That's a really good point but I want to talk\h
a bit about the continuity of these long-term\h\h

91
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,920
bonds that were issued 100 years ago. I mean\h
look, I don't want to be held responsible\h\h

92
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,600
for things I did 20 years ago but I understand\h
that for governments it's different. However,\h\h

93
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,680
comparing that to what happened in China\h
to getting a new U.S. president maybe\h\h

94
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,440
isn't the best analogy because in 1949\h
the People's Republic of China took over\h\h

95
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,320
from the Republic of China and now the Republic\h
of China government that had issued those bonds\h\h

96
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,360
is now basically what we call the government\h
of Taiwan. So why should the People's Republic\h\h

97
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,240
of China have to pay the debt issued by the\h
previous government that occupied that region?

98
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Because they occupy and control the infrastructure\h
that these funds were used to create. To this\h\h

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
moment they're still collecting the salt\h
tax that was used to underwrite these bonds,\h\h

100
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,600
it's called successor government doctrine. So,\h
basically the current government is responsible\h\h

101
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,360
for the debts and obligations of the former\h
government. Look, and China mandates a One\h\h

102
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,960
China Policy not recognizing Taiwan as we\h
very well know. And so, I'm quite confident\h\h

103
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,680
that the Republic of China in fact they passed\h
it in their constitution under Article 63\h\h

104
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,360
just not too many years ago that when they become\h
the real China again they're more than happy, and\h\h

105
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,760
are recognized as such, they're more than happy\h
to pay their financial debts and obligations.

106
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,760
In the meantime, they're under the control under\h
a One China Policy of Beijing and the communist\h\h

107
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,280
party and under law, international law, U.S.\h
law, successor government doctrine prevails.\h\h

108
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,520
And there's precedent. Look, Margaret Thatcher\h
recognized this and in 1987 made it clear\h\h

109
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,680
to the People's Republic of China,\h
the Chinese communist party,\h\h

110
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,960
"You're not going to issue more bonds on\h
our soil taking more money from our citizens\h\h

111
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,080
until you start paying the bonds in the defaulted\h
debt that you already owe." And so in fact,\h\h

112
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,600
the Chinese communist party, the PRC, did in\h
fact pay Great Britain for the very same bonds\h\h

113
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,480
that American citizens are holding, the French,\h
the Belgiums and many others around the world.

114
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,240
Well, so the Chinese communist party\h
recognized the validity of the debt\h\h

115
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
and paid it back but only to the\h
British investors and not to the\h\h

116
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,120
American investors or bond holders.\h
Is that what you're saying?

117
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,800
That is correct. And it's because no American\h
administration, no president has said to China,\h\h

118
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,000
"You have to pay your debts to the American\h
people." I mean, we hear during election time\h\h

119
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,480
on both sides of the aisle of course until this\h
recent one, "We have to hold China accountable.\h\h

120
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,320
We're going to be tough on China." President\h
Trump ran in 2016 on holding China to account\h\h

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,240
and in fact made it clear that we are where\h
we are with China not because that he blamed\h\h

122
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,760
China but he blamed former administrations for\h
not being tough on China and making them play\h\h

123
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,080
by the same rules that the rest of the world\h
played by especially when it comes to trade.

124
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,120
So until President Donald J. Trump came\h
around no previous administration would\h\h

125
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,640
hold China accountable. They wouldn't make them\h
play by the same rules. Now, Donald Trump says\h\h

126
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,320
he's going to make China pay, he's going to hold\h
them accountable. And on behalf of the American\h\h

127
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,200
Bond Holders Foundation we do believe he's a\h
promises made promises kept president. I have\h\h

128
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
met with him. He has assured me faithfully that he\h
would resolve this issue but the clock is ticking\h\h

129
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,120
and Americans are suffering at the hands of the\h
Chinese communist party and their plague. And\h\h

130
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,040
we're paying $72 million a day of our tax dollars\h
going to China for Chinese held U.S. Treasuries.\h\h

131
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,080
Why can that money not go to the American people\h
that are suffering because of the Chinese plague?\h\h

132
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,880
And so, we're now calling upon President Trump\h
to uphold your word, your promises that you have\h\h

133
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,400
made. Let's keep those promises and let's actually\h
do something and be tough on China and hold them\h\h

134
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,520
accountable versus just political rhetoric that\h
we see from all of these various politicians.

135
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Right. So you guys actually have a very\h
specific proposal to essentially force the\h\h

136
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,360
Chinese communist party to pay back that debt\h
to U.S. bond holders. What is that proposal?

137
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,160
Well, it's actually in the law. It's something\h
that Congress passed long ago. Basically at the\h\h

138
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,560
president's request the treasury secretary can\h
bring in the bonds held by the American citizens\h\h

139
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,480
here—over 20,000 families in 46 states—and\h
they can use those bonds to extinguish the debt\h\h

140
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,000
that America owes to China so basically\h
you're basically swapping paper for paper.

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,160
Okay. So basically what you're\h
saying is that the U.S treasury\h\h

142
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,360
buys the Chinese bonds from American bond\h
holders and then the U.S. Debt that the\h\h

143
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,840
Chinese government holds. The U.S. treasury\h
doesn't pay China back in American dollars,\h\h

144
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,615
instead we pay China back with its\h
own debt. Am I getting that right?

145
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:06,720
That is correct. That is correct. Which will save\h
hundreds of billions of dollars to the American\h\h

146
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,280
people. Because I mean look, the American Bond\h
Holders Foundation and typical debt settlements\h\h

147
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:20,880
to this capacity, this isn't new. There's been\h
47 previous bond settlements of defaulted debt in\h\h

148
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,480
this country to the Foreign Bondholders Protective\h
Council which was established in 1934 under\h\h

149
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,080
President Roosevelt and secretary of state Cordell\h
Hall. So what we propose is not anything new.\h\h

150
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,800
It just needs to have the political willpower and\h
the backbone to stand against the communist regime\h\h

151
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,320
and hold them accountable. This would be\h
actually debt settlement number 48. And so,\h\h

152
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,600
typical settlements are done at pennies on\h
the dollar, however utilized at full value to\h\h

153
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,320
extinguish debt under a debt offset owed to that\h
foreign entity. So this isn't anything uncommon,\h\h

154
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,480
this isn't anything new, it's already in the\h
law. It just needs to be upheld and enforced.

155
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,640
What's the total amounts of\h
Chinese government debt from this\h\h

156
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,600
20th century tranche of debt,\h
what's the total amount held by\h\h

157
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,080
Americans and what's the total value that you\h
think could be gotten back by these bond holders?

158
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,520
Well right now, of course you have the accrued\h
interest and these are gold bonds so it's based\h\h

159
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:33,920
on the current market value of gold. We're holding\h
nearly $2 trillion worth of these bonds based on\h\h

160
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:42,320
how the courts have ruled on time value, loss of\h
money, et cetera, by the experts. And so, China\h\h

161
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,720
is currently holding approximately 1.1 trillion\h
in U.S. treasuries. And so, which is why we're\h\h

162
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,080
paying $72 million a day of taxpayer dollars that\h
are going to China. So if you took in these bonds\h\h

163
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,960
and you paid out a small fraction of that,\h
a very, very, I'm talking literally pennies\h\h

164
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,480
like under a nickel on the dollar kind of thing\h
to the American bond holders that hold these\h\h

165
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,560
you could extinguish hundreds of billions of\h
dollars of debt to China that they use those\h\h

166
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,880
funds to buy up America as we've seen and\h
also for nefarious reasons around the world.

167
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,240
So, it would be a huge benefit savings to the\h
American people. It would also help put China\h\h

168
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,680
in check. It would hold them accountable. And in\h
fact, these very same funds could be used as a\h\h

169
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,200
stimulus to the American people that have lost\h
their jobs, are losing their homes, can't feed\h\h

170
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,760
their families as a result of the Chinese plague\h
that we have seen bestowed upon this country.

171
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,120
So, the American bond holders under this\h
proposal themselves would maybe only get\h\h

172
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,200
a nickel back on every dollar that they\h
were originally owed but overall you're\h\h

173
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,840
saying that American taxpayers would\h
save in addition to that because it\h\h

174
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,160
would reduce the amount that the U.S.\h
has to pay back in U.S. treasury debt.

175
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,520
That is correct.

176
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,000
So, I think one of the interesting things\h
here that you point out is that the law\h\h

177
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,200
that gives the U.S. government the tools\h
to do this is already in place but it's\h\h

178
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,160
not really a question of the law at this point\h
it's a question of political willpower, right?

179
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
That is correct.

180
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,920
And you have met with Trump,\h
but so far in four years the\h\h

181
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,480
Trump administration has not actually done this.

182
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,400
Well, President Trump sent it to Secretary Mnuchin\h
and that's the problem. He doesn't want to do\h\h

183
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,080
anything to rock the boat with the Chinese and so\h
he keeps pushing the issue off. President Trump\h\h

184
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,880
would like to see this done and is committed\h
to seeing this done and getting it resolved.\h\h

185
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,720
And it keeps being sent to Secretary Mnuchin\h
who pushes it off and does not want to do\h\h

186
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,440
anything to rock the boat with China, that's\h
evident. I mean, he is Mr. China. He's making\h\h

187
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
decisions that is in China's best interest,\h
not in the interest of the American people.

188
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,480
So if Joe Biden becomes the next president\h
and I recognize that's by no means certain\h\h

189
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,000
because obviously this is 2020 and you\h
never know but if Joe Biden does become\h\h

190
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,600
president how do you think he and his treasury\h
secretary possibly Janet Yellen would handle this?

191
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,120
I don't think they would. I mean, we are talking\h
Beijing Biden here. So, I don't see any support\h\h

192
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,560
whatsoever coming from the democratic party.\h
Unfortunately prior to President Trump coming\h\h

193
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,280
into office there's been multiple resolutions\h
out of the House and the Senate on this issue\h\h

194
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,440
bi-partisan. It was always a bi-partisan issue\h
until President Trump was elected president.\h\h

195
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,560
And now have you heard one Democrat condemn China\h
for their handling of the COVID-19? Have you heard\h\h

196
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:50,400
one Democrat condemn China for their spying in\h
our country through their Confucius Institutes?\h\h

197
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,880
Have you had one Democrat condemn China for\h
anything whatsoever? You will not hear it because\h\h

198
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,240
they're working in collusion with the Chinese\h
communist party to take down President Trump\h\h

199
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,280
to turn our country into a socialistic communistic\h
country and turn it upside down and destroy the\h\h

200
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,400
American freedoms that we have. So to get justice\h
under a Beijing Biden administration? I think not.

201
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,360
And I understand your criticism of the\h
Democrats. I would like to point out that a\h\h

202
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,520
number of democratic Senators and Congresspeople\h
have supported the Hong Kong Human Rights Act\h\h

203
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,040
and the Uighur Freedom Act. I forget the actual\h
name. Nancy Pelosi has been outspoken about the\h\h

204
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Tiananmen Square massacre. And some of the stuff\h
that we've seen is bipartisan support for Hong\h\h

205
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,800
Kong and the Uyghurs. Now you're right that you\h
haven't seen bipartisan support over the COVID-19.

206
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,560
I agree with you. They have spoke out in that\h
regard but what actions did they actually take\h\h

207
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,400
to punish China, to go after China, to hold\h
China accountable? So all of those things\h\h

208
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,800
while I think it's great that they spoke out\h
and condemned it but again political rhetoric.\h\h

209
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,000
We need action, action, action and\h
that is not what we are seeing.

210
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
Well, I think there's maybe some good news here\h
because the Hong Kong Freedom and Democracy Act\h\h

211
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,200
did give the president essentially the tools to\h
sanction specific individuals for their abuses in\h\h

212
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,920
Hong Kong. And so, you had bipartisan legislation\h
and then you had the Trump administration actually\h\h

213
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,520
activate it so to speak and that\h
gives me hope that maybe if this...

214
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,960
But tell me if sanctioning those people and\h
sanctioning those handful of people, please\h\h

215
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,280
tell me how that affects the rest of Hong Kong and\h
their citizenry and their freedoms or the Uighurs,\h\h

216
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,560
It does not. Tell me how that puts food on the\h
table to the American people who have lost their\h\h

217
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,280
jobs because of the Chinese communist party\h
and COVID-19. So the same with the travel ban.\h\h

218
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,320
While I think the tools that they're using and the\h
actions that have been taken thus far have been\h\h

219
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,760
so minuscule in the grand scheme of things\h
that it makes it appear that they're doing\h\h

220
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,760
something but to what benefit did that help the\h
Uighurs? To what benefit did that help the freedom\h\h

221
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,720
of the Hong Kong people? To what benefit\h
did blocking travel or sanctioning a handful\h\h

222
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
of Chinese communist party leadership,\h
what benefit was that to the\h\h

223
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,080
millions of American people that have lost their\h
jobs or the hundreds of thousands that have died\h\h

224
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,760
as a result of COVID-19 and the\h
Chinese communist party plague?

225
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, you're absolutely right. And the benefit to\h
those policies is really that it disincentivizes\h\h

226
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,600
Chinese officials from committing further abuses.\h
I mean, whether it's effective or not I think it's\h\h

227
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,080
hard to say so far. But what it does show is that\h
there is some ability of Congress to come together\h\h

228
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,440
from both sides of the aisle and take some action\h
on China. And the action that you're proposing\h\h

229
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,040
needs to happen through the American Bondholders\h
Foundation is something that would really require,\h\h

230
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,720
there's already the law but it still requires\h
probably more bipartisan political willpower.

231
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,560
Actually it only takes a national security\h
presidential memorandum, not even an executive\h\h

232
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,720
order. It's a national security presidential\h
memorandum from President Trump to his secretary\h\h

233
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,320
of treasury instructing him to follow the process\h
legalities that we just mentioned and complete\h\h

234
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,280
this transaction in holding China accountable.\h
So it doesn't require congressional involvement\h\h

235
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,160
or approval, the laws are already in place. It\h
actually takes the backbone of President Donald\h\h

236
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,840
J. Trump in actually holding China accountable to\h
the American people, to the bond holders, to the\h\h

237
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,880
citizens of the U.S. and actually holding China\h
accountable. So an NSPM is basically all it takes.

238
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,000
So given that even under the Trump administration\h
Secretary Mnuchin has not done this and also given\h\h

239
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,760
that the next president might be Joe Biden\h
what advice would you have for the American\h\h

240
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,840
people who are watching this show, something\h
that they can do to possibly push this along?

241
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,680
I recommend they contact the White\h
House and urge President Donald J.\h\h

242
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,840
Trump to sign the National Security Presidential\h
Memorandum and actually hold China accountable\h\h

243
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,920
to not only pay the bond holders but to do\h
the debt offsets and utilize those funds\h\h

244
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,320
as an economic stimulus across America to\h
help those that are struggling as a result\h\h

245
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
of the Chinese communist party plague\h
bestowed upon the American people.

246
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:46,800
This is money that China owes that they\h
haven't paid. So collect that debt,\h\h

247
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,920
let it benefit the American people and the bond\h
holders and actually hold China accountable.

248
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,080
Well, I like your advice to have viewers write\h
to the White House and I think it's a very\h\h

249
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,800
clever solution to have the U.S. Treasury\h
pay China back for U.S. bonds with China's\h\h

250
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,040
own debt that they refuse to pay back. So\h
thank you very much for joining me Jonna.

251
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

252
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
And thank you for watching.

253
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,160
Tell us what you think in the comments below—and\h\h

254
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,200
let us know if you plan to write to\h
the White House like she suggested.

255
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,840
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
