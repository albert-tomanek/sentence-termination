1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,940
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,970
what do China’s military and Australian
universities

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,420
have in common?

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,100
They were both started by criminals!

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,800
Probably.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,460
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,369
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,369
The Chinese Communist Party

9
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,359
wants to dominate the world.

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,600
In fact,

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,679
for a regime that’s secretive about everything—

12
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,679
from pollution levels,

13
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,679
to state executions,

14
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,140
to even basic economic numbers—

15
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,180
they’ve been surprisingly transparent about
this:

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,090
Their plan to turn the Communist Party

17
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,870
into the dominant global power.

18
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,170
So you’d think the rest of the world

19
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,980
would perhaps have heard about this.

20
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,180
Take Australia for example.

21
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,609
A few months ago,

22
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,679
an investigation showed that the CCP

23
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,829
was buying political influence in Australia.

24
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,730
“The Chinese Communist Party is waging

25
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,730
a covert campaign of influence in Australia—

26
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,899
an aggressive form of ‘soft power’—

27
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,019
and while loyalists are rewarded,

28
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,519
dissidents live in fear.”

29
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,940
That sounds pretty serious.

30
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,160
It even gained the attention

31
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,530
of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,

32
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,530
or ASIO —

33
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,840
Australia’s equivalent of the Department
of Homeland Security.

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,930
It warned, “that espionage

35
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,930
and foreign interference in Australia

36
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,210
were occurring on ‘an unprecedented scale.’”

37
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,040
And ASIO told Australia’s political parties
that,

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
you know,

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,500
taking money from Chinese billionaires

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,180
with dubious ties to the Communist Party,

41
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,950
might not be the wisest idea.

42
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,009
So to sum up:

43
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,009
The Chinese Communist Party

44
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,930
wants to dominate the world.

45
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,189
To achieve that goal,

46
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,759
they buy political influence in foreign countries,

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,110
like Australia.

48
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,900
Australia’s top security agency is like:

49
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,899
“The Communist Party is trying to infiltrate
our country.

50
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,799
Don’t take their money!

51
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,520
Crikey, mate!”

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,680
So how did Australia’s political parties
respond?

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,340
They put country before politics

54
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,649
and returned all the Chinese money,

55
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,390
vowing that it would never happen again.

56
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,020
Just kidding.

57
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,210
They kept on taking Chinese money.

58
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,570
More than a million dollars worth.

59
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,170
Because this is the darkest timeline.

60
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,190
Hmm...okay

61
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,360
I can see how that might look bad.

62
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,710
But wait!

63
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,990
As this editorial in the Australian says,

64
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,440
Australia should not isolate itself

65
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,000
from the benefits of China.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,840
The author is Laurie Pearcey,

67
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,800
former CEO of the Australia China Business
Council

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,950
and now pro-vice-chancellor international

69
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,610
at the University of New South Wales.

70
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,000
And we should all listen to him because

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,900
he’s a pro vice-chancellor,

72
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,160
not like those amateur vice-chancellors.

73
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,260
Anyway, Pearcey complains that the “media”

74
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,720
is out to portray that,

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
“Beijing is on a mission

76
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,210
to undermine our democratic institutions

77
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,170
by buying off politicians,

78
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,520
stealing the crown jewels

79
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,100
of Australia’s research discoveries,

80
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,080
and invading our university campuses

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,200
with Chinese Communist Party intelligence
operatives.”

82
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,300
And that’s ridiculous.

83
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,390
I mean, he should know,

84
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,090
as a pro-vice-chancellor...person

85
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,570
at one of Australia’s top universities.

86
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,650
Like, take this recent article

87
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,960
by the Sydney Morning Herald.

88
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,310
Australian universities helping the Chinese
military?

89
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,150
That sounds ridiculous!

90
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,580
Except…that’s exactly what’s happening.

91
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,840
Australian universities are helping China

92
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,660
develop military technology.

93
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,110
And even better,

94
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,760
some of it’s being funded by Australian
taxpayers.

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,500
But I guess—

96
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,100
if Australian political parties

97
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,030
are happy to ignore warnings

98
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,470
from the Australian intelligence agency—

99
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,990
why would universities worry about

100
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,010
working with the Chinese military

101
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,200
on technology with military applications?

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,880
Here’s an example.

103
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,410
Let’s look at Mr. Pro-Vice-Chancellor’s

104
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,680
very own University of New South Wales.

105
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,920
In particular, at Xue Jingling,

106
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,130
a Professor of Computing Science and Engineering
there.

107
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,130
Back in 2009,

108
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,380
Xue was a professor at China’s

109
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,070
People’s Liberation Army National University
of Defense Technology.

110
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,920
Or as it’s called for short,

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,080
NUDT.

112
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,970
Think of it like the MIT of the People’s
Liberation Army.

113
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,800
Professor Xue was doing joint research

114
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,390
that created one of the world’s

115
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,810
most powerful supercomputers.

116
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,120
And he worked closely with the president of
NUDT,

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Lieutenant-General Yang Xuejun.

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,840
Yang Xuejun, incidentally,

119
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,060
just got promoted to the Central Committee

120
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,990
of the Chinese Communist Party—

121
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,020
which makes him one of the 205 most powerful
people

122
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,419
in the entire Communist Party.

123
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,960
Here he is standing next to Xi Jinping

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,699
in a CCTV documentary.

125
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,360
He’s the military guy holding the flag.

126
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,610
So Professor Xue

127
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,740
worked with a Chinese lieutenant-general

128
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,340
to develop a supercomputer.

129
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,300
One that can help with new aircraft designs

130
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,620
and advanced combat simulations.

131
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,509
Plus, “NUDT supercomputers

132
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,669
are also used in the simulation and testing

133
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:01,599
of tactical nuclear weapons.”

134
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,900
And to top it all off,

135
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,500
“Some of Xue's research with NUDT

136
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,039
has been funded by grants from the Australian
Research Council

137
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,949
worth over $2.3 million.”

138
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,610
The Australian Research Council

139
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,389
is a government agency,

140
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,840
so it’s funded by taxpayers.

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,409
So Professor Xue Jingling

142
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:23,530
at the University of New South Wales

143
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,090
used Australian taxpayer money

144
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,919
to research supercomputers

145
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,199
that had applications for

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,350
Chinese military combat and nuclear weapons.

147
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,469
And he did it under the guidance

148
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:38,699
of one of China’s top politicians-slash-generals.

149
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,449
And that’s just one example.

150
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,440
Now might be a good time to remind everyone

151
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,949
that China’s military technically belongs

152
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,939
to the Chinese Communist Party,

153
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,460
and not the Chinese government.

154
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,480
Scientists at other Australian universities

155
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,690
have also been collaborating with China’s
NUDT,

156
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,690
which again,

157
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,310
is a military academy—

158
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,009
not just some regular Chinese university.

159
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,009
And they’ve been working together

160
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,610
to develop technology that directly helps

161
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,710
the Chinese military become more advanced.

162
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,999
The Sydney Morning Herald found

163
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:13,529
“NUDT has collaborated with Australian researchers

164
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,610
on hundreds of papers in high-tech fields

165
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,370
like materials science,

166
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,370
artificial intelligence

167
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,029
and computer science.”

168
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,880
Here’s another example:

169
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,289
Professor Tao Dacheng at the University of
Sydney.

170
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,780
Tao’s specialty is artificial intelligence.

171
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,810
He’s written over a dozen papers

172
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,900
with NUDT researchers.

173
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,270
And as with Professor Xue,

174
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,659
Tao’s research was partially sponsored by

175
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,550
the taxpayer-funded Australian Research Council.

176
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,660
“His ARC funding totals $3.2 million

177
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,540
and in 2017 he was awarded

178
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,360
an ARC Laureate Fellowship.”

179
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,300
Lieutenant-General Yang has spent years

180
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,990
developing a network of connections

181
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,370
with high level researchers in Australia—

182
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,279
people like Professor Xue and Professor Tao—

183
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,800
and having them oversee Chinese students.

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,319
In just 5 years,

185
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,909
NUDT sent more than 700 Chinese scientists

186
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,639
and students to study abroad,

187
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,729
many in Australia.

188
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,129
And when the Sydney Morning Herald

189
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,430
asked the universities and the Australian
Research Council,

190
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,610
“What’s up with all of this taxpayer-funded
research

191
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,129
that benefits the PLA?

192
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:18,680
Ya bunch of bloomin’ buffoons!”

193
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
They were like,

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
“No wukkas!

195
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,870
We’ve got safeguards in place.

196
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,639
We do lots of due diligence.

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,659
It’s heaps good.”

198
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,630
Well, if they’re doing due diligence,

199
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,330
then I feel much better about

200
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,650
what’s happening in Australian universities.

201
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,780
But apparently ASIO still does not.

202
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,529
Which is why it has once again

203
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,150
tried to issue a warning

204
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,740
about China’s clandestine influence.

205
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,080
Let’s see if Australia’s universities

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,590
are more receptive than Australian politicians.

207
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,590
What do you think?

208
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,919

209
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,990

There’s a top secret weapon

213
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,720
the China’s People’s Liberation Army

214
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,840
doesn’t want you to know about.
