00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,950
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,240
China’s propaganda targets the heart of
America:

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,080
Iowa.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,980
Wait, Iowa??

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,820
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,249
When I heard about the 4-page spread called
China Watch

8
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:21,289
run in Iowa’s biggest newspaper,

9
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,789
the Des Moines Register...

10
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,720
I thought, well look at that adorable little
kid

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,349
with that adorable robot!

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,669
Surely there’s nothing sinister about this!

13
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,800
China Watch is a paid supplement—

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,760
that is, an advertisement—

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,500
designed to look like news articles.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,640
And they’ve got great content!

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,129
Like about the book that tells of Xi Jinping’s

18
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,850
fun days in Iowa in the 1980s.

19
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,260
And the part about “Women’s Liberation:

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,140
How...feminine face of China changed”...?

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,699
Who writes this stuff?

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:54,760
Oh, wait.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
China Daily,

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,620
an official publication of the People’s
Republic of China.

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,949
And there’s also this helpful front page
article

26
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,840
“Duel Undermines Benefits of Trade.”

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,990
Yes, Trump’s trade war is bad for you,

28
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,560
the good people of Iowa.

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,770
That’s why we paid tons of money for this

30
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,340
benevolent public service announcement,

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,659
coincidentally right before US midterm elections.

32
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,219
I mean, imagine if the US governmentpaid

33
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,649
to put anti-Xi Jinping propaganda

34
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,659
in a provincial newspaper in China

35
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:28,940
right before China’s midterm elections?

36
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,870
For those of you who are new here,

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,549
China does not have national elections.

38
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,890
And the price for putting articles

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,420
critical of China’s leader in a local newspaper

40
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,500
would be...going to prison.

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,969
Anyway, placing propaganda in Iowa’s biggest
newspaper

42
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:47,450
is one small piece of the Chinese Communist
Party’s plan

43
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,420
to undermine farm-country support for the
Trump administration—

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,250
and its tough trade policies with respect
to China.

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,960
It also takes advantage of America’s

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,600
democratic process and free press.

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,570
Now granted, the Chinese regime wanted people
in Iowa to read it.

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,149
But they probably didn’t expect President
Trump would.

49
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,060
“China is actually placing propaganda ads

50
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,900
in the Des Moines Register and other papers,

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,090
made to look like news,” Trump tweeted.

52
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,760
Iowa is a crucial state in presidential elections.

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,900
It went big for Trump in 2016.

54
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,190
But now the trade war between the world’s

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,320
two largest economies is heating up,

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,290
and Iowa exports corn, soy, and pork to China.

57
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,060
The US just announced tariffs on

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,420
200 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports.

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,860
And that’s on top of the 50 billion dollars
in goods the US

60
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,420
already hit with earlier tariffs.

61
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,990
The tariffs are meant to be a response

62
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,710
to years of unfair trade practices by China,

63
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,950
that include allegations of state-sponsored

64
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,110
intellectual property theft.

65
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,880
Like Chinese spies stealing corn seeds from...Iowa.

66
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,010
Hmmm... no articles about that in China Watch.

67
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,010
The US ambassador to China is Terry Branstad,

68
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,380
who also happens to be Iowa’s former governor.

69
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,650
He criticized the China Watch advertorial
in a letter,

70
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,540
saying that China is “doubling down on [their]
bullying

71
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,930
by running propaganda ads in our own free
press.”

72
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,290
But not to worry, says Trump.

73
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,470
“We are beating them on Trade, opening markets,

74
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,870
and the farmers will make a fortune when this
is over!”

75
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,620
The trouble is, until the trade war is settled,

76
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,010
China’s $50 billion of retaliatory tariffs—

77
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,950
soon to increase to $110 billion—

78
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,450
could mean pain for Iowa’s exporters.

79
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,480
“The tariffs and counter-tariffs we are
enduring

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,800
in this trade war with China and the U.S.

81
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,710
is having a real impact on Iowa farmers."

82
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,770
According to an Iowa State University study,

83
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,240
Iowa farmers are projected to lose up to $2.2
billion dollars

84
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,120
from Chinese counter-tariffs.

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,040
"Is that a lot?

86
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,340
Yeah, that is a big number.”

87
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,980
That’s John Crespi, an economics professor
at Iowa State

88
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,590
and and co-author of the study.

89
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,820
He said the trade war could cost Iowa’s
soybean industry

90
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,730
up to $891 million,

91
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,420
and Iowa’s corn industry could lose as much
as $579 million.

92
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,250
Because the Chinese regime isn’t just targeting

93
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,449
the good people of Iowa with badly written
newspaper advertorials.

94
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,629
They also created tariffs on corn, soy, pork,

95
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:24,810
and other agricultural products that hurt
midwestern farmers—

96
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,789
conveniently also the people who tend to

97
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,039
vote for Trump and the Republicans.

98
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,770
Former US National Security Council spokesperson
Tommy Vietor

99
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,740
called it a “Pretty savvy political play
being run by China.”

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,620
That article “Duel undermines benefits of
trade”

101
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,280
warns that Chinese importers may have to to
turn to South America

102
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,620
as their go-to soybean source.

103
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,930
So basically, the Chinese regime imposes tariffs

104
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,810
that hurt farmers in pro-Trump states.

105
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,939
Then they say it’s Trump’s fault.

106
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,770
And then maybe those farmers will think twice
about

107
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,729
voting for Trump in the next election.

108
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:03,030
It’s like you put a banana peel on the ground,

109
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,659
so someone slips on it.

110
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,659
And then you tell them,

111
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:07,159
“Hey, it’s Chiquita’s fault

112
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,510
for making products with slippery peels.”

113
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,219
That’s why, you, the good people of Iowa,

114
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:15,530
should remember that “as long as Trump is
president...

115
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,050
it will cost both countries in terms of innovation

116
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,620
and economic performance.”

117
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,419
Yes, for you Iowa farmers,

118
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,379
this trade war will definitely not be fun.

119
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,349
You know what would be fun, though?

120
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,849
Another visit to Iowa by Chinese leading Xi
Jinping,

121
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,400
whose last visit to Iowa was very fun!

122
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,569
Joking aside, Iowa is actually kind of famous
in China,

123
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,590
because of Xi’s visits there.

124
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,229
Arguably more famous than Iowa is in the US,

125
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,830
where people often confuse it with Idaho.

126
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,979
And it didn’t just start with Xi.

127
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,659
Iowa has been establishing ties with China
since the 1970s.

128
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,890
Last year, the Des Moines Register

129
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,050
did a series of stories on Iowa’s ties to
China.

130
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,939
Including one on the “Iowa mafia,”

131
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:05,810
a close group of Iowans doing business in
Beijing.

132
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,220
You don’t want to double cross them.

133
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,490
They’ll break your kneecaps with corn cobs.

134
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,979
10 percent of students at the University of
Iowa are from China,

135
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,300
and they contribute about 170 million dollars
to the local economy.

136
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300


137
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,289
China’s even building a “friendship farm”
outside Beijing

138
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:28,650
that will include a “Disney-style version
of a small town in Iowa.”

139
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,259
A Disney-style small town in Iowa?

140
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,840
I hope they have singing pigs.

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,719
Speaking of small towns in Iowa,

142
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,280
Muscatine is the town where Xi Jinping visited
in 1985,

143
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,800
and which has seen a lot of Chinese investment

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,770
in the last few years.

145
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,159
Last month, Chinese officials visited Muscatine

146
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,550
and commiserated about the trade war.

147
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,949
Iowa is a place with a decades-long relationship
with China.

148
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,919
It’s gotten a lot of positive attention
from Chinese officials,

149
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,259
and it has an economy that’s increasingly
tied

150
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,629
to doing business with China.

151
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,650
Sounds like the perfect place for the Chinese
Communist Party

152
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,210
to start changing how Americans feel about
the US-China trade war.

153
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,110
But it might not be as easy as Chinese officials
are hoping.

154
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,160
When the Washington Post talked to farmers
in Muscatine,

155
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,030
they found farmers were concerned about

156
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,249
things like intellectual property theft,

157
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:23,419
and supported the US taking a stronger stand.

158
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,889
And take the China Watch advertorial.

159
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,229
Even the Des Moines Register,

160
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,330
which ran the China Watch advertorial,

161
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,349
pulled no punches in exposing

162
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,759
the true intent of their big advertiser.

163
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,379
It quotes an expert saying that readers

164
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,930
“may not appreciate trying to be manipulated

165
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,280
by a foreign government.”

166
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,370
But China’s information war against the
US

167
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,800
goes way beyond running ads in corn-country
newspapers.

168
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,249
For years, they’ve run China Watch sections

169
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,330
in major national papers like the New York
Times

170
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,520
and the Wall Street Journal to influence public
opinion.

171
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,300
I mean really, it’s the original “fake
news.”

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,419
And a US official told Reuters that China
is guilty

173
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,979
of perpetrating a “broad malign influence
campaign”

174
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,270
in the United States.

175
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,659
“‘They employ a whole of government approach

176
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:15,509
using political, economic, commercial, military
and informational tools’

177
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:18,729
to influence U.S. public opinion.”

178
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,589
Now there does seem to be a bright side in
all this for Iowa farmers.

179
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,749
To offset the impact of China’s tariffs

180
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,759
the Trump administration announced in July

181
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,779
that U.S. farmers will be helped with a $12
billion bailout.

182
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,040
And Iowa growers could see about $550 million

183
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,440
in the first round of federal aid.

184
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,250
And at least some of that money’s going
to come from—

185
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,349
that’s right—

186
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,950
tariffs on Chinese goods.

187
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,070
So what do you think of China’s propaganda
advertorial?

188
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,870
Will it affect US elections?

189
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,390
Leave your comments below.

190
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,160
And before we go, it’s time when I answer
a question

191
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,140
from a viewer who supports China Uncensored

192
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,820
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

193
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,540
Rabbit L. Benkei asks:

194
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,970
“Hey Chris, some big drivers of the tariffs
are the demands

195
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,620
that China stop stealing American intellectual
property

196
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,160
and stop requiring joint ventures with Chinese
firms,

197
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,580
but did American entrepreneurs ever even lobby

198
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,090
or ask the US government to do something about
it?”

199
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,900
Good question, Rabbit.

200
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,910
American business have actually complained
about

201
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,070
China stealing intellectual property for years.

202
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,140
This article from 2005 talks about how China

203
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,660
was creating cheap knock-offs of Viagra,

204
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,760
which is a blood pressure medication.

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,140
They wanted the Bush administration to act.

206
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,830
But ultimately, their response proved to be
a bit impotent.

207
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,030
Meanwhile, Chinese theft of US intellectual
property escalated.

208
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,430
Some US companies continued to complain.

209
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,100
Others kept quiet because they wanted the
opportunity

210
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,270
to do more business in China.

211
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,180
But it seemed neither the Bush nor Obama administrations

212
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,020
were able to do much to change the situation.

213
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,840
By 2015, it had gotten so bad that President
Obama and Xi Jinping

214
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,460
made a very public agreement to stop stealing
commercial secrets.

215
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,830
And this sort of worked, but not as well as
people hoped.

216
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,890
Because when US companies get hacked,

217
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,930
the Chinese government would issue public
statements

218
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,940
like “It totally wasn’t us.

219
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,420
It was rogue hackers.

220
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,160
And how do you even know they were from China,
huh?”

221
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,630
Now President Trump has a different philosophy,
which is:

222
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,440
Put direct economic pressure on China until
the Chinese leadership

223
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,370
feels enough pain to rein in the problem themselves.

224
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,630
So far, there has been pain on both sides
from the trade war.

225
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,320
But it’s not clear yet what the ultimate
outcome will be.

226
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,530
Thanks for your question, Rabbit.

227
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,520
