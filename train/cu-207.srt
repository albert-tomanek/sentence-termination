00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,170
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,390
China brings you Sonic Attack 3!

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,920
This one’s not much fun, though.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,600
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,110
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,320
The pen is mightier than the sword.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,470
But sound can be an even more dangerous weapon.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,249
Just ask anyone who’s been to karaoke with
me.

9
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:24,909
Near, far…

10
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:28,900
Wherever you are…

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,609
Yes, sound can be a weapon.

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,610
And some people are concerned that US diplomats
in China

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,340
have fallen victim to sound weapons,

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,230
or sonic attacks.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,690
At least two Americans tied to the US consulate

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,320
in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,350
have been evacuated due to mysterious ailments

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,040
that came after they heard odd sounds.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,400
A US State Department Spokeswoman said Wednesday
night

20
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,240
that the Department has sent a number of individuals

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,250
for further evaluation in the United States.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,530
A US official spoke to ABC news,

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,600
saying the evacuated Americans were,

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,340
“being brought for testing to the University
of Pennsylvania.”

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,700
It follows this health advisory from the US
embassy in China,

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,550
warning that, “If you experience any unusual
acute auditory

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,990
or sensory phenomena accompanied by

28
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,040
unusual sounds or piercing noises,

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,000
do not attempt to locate their source.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,610
Instead, move to a location

31
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,500
where the sounds are not present.”

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,549
Which seems like the plot to a bad 1950’s
B-movie.

33
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,979
“The Sound from Space.”

34
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,920
One US consulate employee was diagnosed

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,140
with a “mild traumatic brain injury.”

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,659
And that followed a similar incident last
year in Havana, Cuba.

37
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,530
24 US Embassy employees reported symptoms

38
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,920
similar to a concussion after, “some sort
of ‘acoustic element,’

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,979
such as a ‘high-pitched beam of sound’

40
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,560
or a ‘baffling sensation akin to driving

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,880
with the windows partially open in a car.’”

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
“US believes that several state department
employees

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
at US embassy in Havana,

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
have been have been subjected to acoustic
attack?

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
What does that even mean?”

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
That’s exactly how my college girlfriend
reacted

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
when I told her I was starting a baroque metal
band

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,180
called Acoustic Attack.

49
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,830
Back to China.

50
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,470
The New York Times uncovered the identity

51
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,819
of one of the two most recent evacuees

52
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,260
from the US consulate in Guangzhou.

53
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
And apparently,

54
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,230
he had complained in an email to the entire
consulate

55
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,099
that they were lied to about how serious the
situation was.

56
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,540
That’s why he and his wife

57
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,690
didn’t report their symptoms right away.

58
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,310
His symptoms included “dizziness,

59
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,770
headaches and an inability to concentrate.”

60
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,680
Wait, that just sounds like a normal day at
the office.

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
But in all these cases,

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,500
victims report hearing a strange sound

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,010
before suffering physical symptoms.

64
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,370
No one knows for sure what’s behind it.

65
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,590
One explanation is it’s a sonic attack.

66
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,459
I know what you’re thinking,

67
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,320
I haven’t had a sonic attack since 1991.

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,570
Yeah, the original game was from 1991.

69
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,660
You are old.

70
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,630
But weaponizing frequencies is very real technology,

71
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,069
not just some crazy scheme by Dr. Robotnik.

72
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,600
There are three types of sonic weapons.

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,930
The first type is simply playing

74
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,740
music or sound really, really loud.

75
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,180
Like a Limp Bizkit concert.

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,230
Now that’s a sonic attack.

77
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,569
Another type of sonic weapon

78
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,450
is called an infrasonic weapon.

79
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,810
It blasts loud, low frequency sounds

80
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,069
that can’t be heard by the human ear,

81
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,700
but can be felt.

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,261
This technology has been used to,

83
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,319
I kid you not,

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,190
fight off pirates.

85
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,450
And everyone knows that pirates

86
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,030
are just like diplomats.

87
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,849
But it’s unlikely infrasonic weapons are
the culprit.

88
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,319
They’re typically pretty bulky—

89
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,739
not something you can hide in a consulate.

90
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,220
The effects include excruciating headaches,

91
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,620
ear pain, and even involuntary defecation.

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,349
That’s not what the consulate employees
reported.

93
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,480
But then again,

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,020
would you tell your boss if you had involuntary
defecation?

95
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,530
The third type of sonic weapon is ultrasonic
weapons.

96
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,500
Those are frequencies too high to hear.

97
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,850
They can cause nausea and headaches—

98
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,650
which is like the symptoms the US diplomats
suffered from.

99
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,409
But there are problems with this theory.

100
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,819
Ultrasonic emitters are very short range.

101
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,569
Like, if you’re standing on the other side
of the room,

102
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:15,769
that’s too far,

103
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,980
kind of short range.

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,410
Then there’s the fact that,

105
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,140
“Ultrasound is also highly directional.

106
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,120
Precise alignment in millimetres would be
needed to steer

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,310
an ultrasonic ‘beam’ to hit someone from
across a room.”

108
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,760
It’d be like if Goldfinger said,

109
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,660
“I expect you to die, Mr. Bond. J

110
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,060
ust uhh...that bench doesn’t have chains,

111
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,860
so...stay right there.”

112
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,060
OK, so probably not ultrasonic weapons either.

113
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,639
So...are there any other theories?

114
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,660
Yes, actually.

115
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,820
These might not have been ultrasonic weapons,

116
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,440
but rather just sloppy ultrasonic spying.

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,840
You see Ultrasound is also used in motion
sensors.

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,190
And studies have found it can even be used
to read

119
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,530
a person’s mouth in noisy rooms,

120
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,669
or even whispering.

121
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:05,979
Ultrasonic frequencies can also be used to
take over

122
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,050
voice-controlled devices like Amazon’s Alexa.

123
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,290
Alexinator: Rise of the Machines,

124
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,280
available now on Amazon Prime Video.

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,630
But then the problem is,

126
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,780
if that ultrasonic emitter is trying to target
your Alexa

127
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,330
on the other side of the room,

128
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,630
and you walk right in front of it,

129
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,120
the strength could be thousands of times greater.

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,419
Even short exposure could cause damage.

131
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,389
And if there are several ultrasonic spy devices,

132
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,070
if you get in just the right position where
all of them

133
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,550
are directly focused on your brain,

134
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,229
your head explodes.

135
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:41,680
Okay, not really,

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,710
but it could cause the kind of damage we’ve
seen

137
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,270
with US diplomats in China and Cuba.

138
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,380
This might make more sense.

139
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,510
Trying to spy on diplomats,

140
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,940
well everyone does that.

141
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,380
Attacking diplomats with experimental sonic
weapons

142
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,350
on the other hand, that’s kind of raising
the bar.

143
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,160
Like going from Sonic, to Tails.

144
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,320
Either that, or it was the aliens all along.

145
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Before you go,

146
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,170
now’s the time when we answer questions

147
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,490
from fans who support China Uncensored

148
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,630
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

149
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,080
J R Harrison asks:

150
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,740
“What do you plan on doing once the CCP
collapses?”

151
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,289
One final episode, and then a long snooze
on the beach.

152
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,229
But until then, I’ve got work to do.

153
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:32,570
Speaking of work, Shelley,

154
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,810
on the next China Uncensored karaoke night,

155
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,830
it’s you, me, and A Whole New World.

156
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,570
What’s that?

157
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,090
What do you mean, you’re busy?

158
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,150
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

159
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,340
Leave your comments below.

160
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,919
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

161
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,280
See you next time.

162
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,340
A whole new world

163
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,880
A whole new world

164
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,620
That's where we'll be

165
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,520
That's where we'll be

166
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,600
A thrilling chase

167
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
A wondrous place

168
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,100
For you and me
