This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,720
In front of me I have an almost-randomly selected Wikipedia article

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,200
from everybody's favourite reliable source of knowledge, and these folks can't see it.

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,100
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING]

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,120
and there's a special prize for particularly good answers, which is:

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,960
Good Lord.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,300
— Good grief!
— [Grunts]

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,240
So today we are talking about the Counts of Andechs.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,700
[Laughter]
The what, sorry? The cow —

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,260
— The Counts of Andechs.
— *Counts* of Andechs.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,920
Oh, is that how they determine how many, er, sheets there are on a roll of bog roll?

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
— Yes!
— That's the Count of Andrex.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, okay.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,280
Of course, the Andrex Company was started by a Count Andrex of Bohemia.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,160
[Sesame Street 'Count' voice]
'Ha ha ha! One! Ha ha ha!'

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,220
[Sesame Street 'Count' voice]
'One sheet not enough! Two, not enough!'

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,660
'Three, getting there. But we'll go for four! Just in case.'

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,260
You have to check in with him before you enter the toilet and gamble on how much you're going to need.

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah. He's stood outside, sliding them under the door, sheet by sheet.

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,860
[Laughs] 'What is sheet five worth to you?'

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,140
'Ha, ha, ha, ha!'

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,940
'I have insatiable thirst for human blood!'

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,140
[Laughter]

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,940
It's the thought of the Count actually submitted to his baser, non-counting instincts one night...

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,480
'Ha ha! Try to find virgin on Sesame Street. Impossible!'

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,920
[Laughter and groans]

[Laughter]

35
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,800
There was a lovely quote from the creators of Sesame Street

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,700
when they were tired of commenting on the Bert and Ernie rumours,

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,780
which was: 'They're puppets. They don't exist below the waist.'

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
No, but they've got a man's fist up their arse, ain't they?

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,680
[Laughter and groans]

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,660
Somewhere back in that rant, you did mention Bohemia.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,520
Does anyone know what Bohemia actually was?

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,980
— Er, Germany...
— An area of Germany, yeah.

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
— What is now Germany.
— Or Austria, or...

44
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,440
One of the many states that coalesced into Germany over the 19th century.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,800
It's modern day Czech Republic.

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,960
All: Oh!

47
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,340
There you go. Prisoner of Zenda inspiration basically, Bohemia, wasn't it?

48
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,560
Prisoner of Zenda?

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,720
Yes. Yes, the novel. Ruritanian, erm...

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,900
I know the name but not much else, I'm afraid.

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,280
Big castles and big pointy hats and large 'taches and big swords and all that.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,860
— Are there large castles?
— Yup.

Sorry, I'm doing Terry Wogan's Castle Defence there.

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,280
'Repel all boarders...'

61
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,700
Terry Wogan's castle defence of a *ship*, I think you'll find, was 'repel all boarders'.

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,080
I think we've found the British version of Takeshi's Castle.

63
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,980
Well! Actually, no offence to T-Wogs himself, but...

64
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,060
he is too low a level. Takeshi Kitano, am I right?

65
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,100
Beat Takeshi.

Massive, huge movie star of Japan.

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
If you were doing it, it'd be Connery's Castle.

68
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Ahh!

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,120
That's the level — or Moore's Mansion or something like that, is what you would be looking at.

70
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,160
Brosnan's Bungalow!

71
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,700
Dalton's Dormer. Doesn't quite work.

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,880
I've got Brosnan's Bungalow as just being an alternative Saturday morning kids' show.

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,920
Dick and Dom!

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,380
'Now we're going to look at some silly things outside.'

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,920
The thought of Roger Moore driving round in one of those little carts they have on Takeshi's Castle,

76
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,380
spraying people with water while laughing, in a military uniform.

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,540
That's what he does!

78
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
Yeah, but he'd have a big cocktail in his left hand, wouldn't he?

79
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,780
[Suave Roger Moore voice]
'Ah, ha ha ha ha!'

80
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,900
That's the greatest impression of anybody I've ever seen!

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Roger Moore driving a car, shooting water while carrying...

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,600
It was so good, I popped a button on me shirt, Gary.

83
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
I was that stunned by it.

84
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,520
I think the idea is not that you have to knock out the paper targets...

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,660
By the way, if you haven't watched Takeshi's Castle, this whole section's lost on you.

86
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,260
Open a tab, just give it five minutes, come back.

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,600
It's not that you have shoot out the targets — it's that you have to knock his drink out of his hand,

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,020
or dilute it sufficiently...

89
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,940
No, surely it is you have to hit something very close to the cocktail,

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,180
but if you hit the cocktail that's a death sentence.

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
If you water it down, you get lightly maimed.

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,860
Ah, but you just cheat by having a cocktail umbrella.

93
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,300
So that's what they're for!

94
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,300
The Counts of Andechs, then, if I can drag this back to where we were.

95
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,180
Oh yeah, yeah.

96
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
In northern Dalmatia.

97
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,920
Was it a bit spotty?

98
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,780
Now, I didn't know Dalmatia was actually a region. I've only just put two and two together.

99
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes! Same way that Alsace is a region.

100
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,020
— Yeah, Alsace I knew...
— Weimaraner — Weimar.

101
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,900
— Really!
— Yeah!

102
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
— Yeah.
— Ah!

103
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,600
All these little places that came together to form Germany.

104
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,760
Sausage dough...

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,120
Well, Dalmatia...

106
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,620
Sausage dough! [Laughs]

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Weirdly, it was a very short and fat region.

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Which is where the sausage dogs come from.

109
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,920
I always said that fox-hunting... instead of trying to ban it, just make them —

110
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,780
I think it was actually a Monster Raving Loony Party idea, but it works:

111
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,520
make them replace beagles with sausage dogs. That'll even it out.

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,720
Well, sausage dogs are hunting dogs, just for burrowing animals.

113
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Yeah, that's what I mean. A sausage dog chasing a fox...

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,080
Also, what's the proper name for a sausage dog?

115
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,900
Dachshund.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Dachshund! Of course it is. That'll be from the Dach region...

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,880
Yes!

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,020
It means 'sausage dough'.

119
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,500
Dalmatia's not actually in Germany, though.

120
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,020
It's the right area of Europe. Does anyone want to take a guess where that is now?

121
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,380
[Arnold Schwarzenegger voice]  Austria.

122
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,680
We're going a bit further east. We're also on the Adriatic Sea.

123
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,760
Is it Hungary?

124
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,660
Not on the Adriatic Sea, it's not.

125
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,560
— We've had Croatia and it's not that.
— Point! [DING]

126
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh really! Okay.

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,620
We've had Czech Republic, not Croatia.

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,160
Yeah. Absolutely right. So we are looking for some counts in northern Dalmatia.

129
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,040
They actually went extinct shortly afterwards, so it was a complete —

130
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,560
Extinct?! I'm sorry...

131
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,140
Were they Neanderthals?

132
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,780
They were shot and eaten for their meat by colonizers.

133
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,040
Are we talking about dogs?

134
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,920
No, we're talking about the counts. They went 'extinct in the direct male line in 1251'.

135
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,020
Because they didn't have any girls, basically, and they all married off, right?

136
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,900
Other way round, that they didn't have any sons.

137
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,240
— And girls don't matter in the West.
— Oh, right, that's what I meant, sorry.

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah. We're in the 13th century. It's declining just on the male line.

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,160
That's changed in the UK, in the last few years, just before the birth of Prince...

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,740
— Prince George.
— Thank you, I was about to call him Prince Wossname,

141
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,200
— Nice.
— Which is possibly treason.

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,980
Prince George.

143
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,080
Thing is, that is kings and queens of the country sorted until...

144
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,140
After our lifetime.

145
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,680
Yeah, the 22nd century.

146
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
— Yes.
— Wow.

147
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,600
Sort that out. That's what you call longevity. That's what you call a permanent institution.

148
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,240
We've got — I don't know if it will be Charles or not, I've heard different...

149
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,000
And then you've got... obviously you've got William, and then you've got him.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,220
So it's all blokes for the rest of our life now.

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Yeah. Unless we get a gun and — no, sorry.

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,660
[Laughter]
That's actually...

153
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,820
It's going to be a sausage-heavy monarchy, everybody.
[Laughter]

154
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,620
It has been, throughout history, a fairly...

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Yeah, default setting there.

156
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,960
So I'm looking through, and there is just an enormous amount of genealogy,

157
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,800
and names, and intrigue in the court here.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,300
Does anyone want to take a guess at some proper sort of Bavarian names that could be in this?

159
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,080
Hans!

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,040
No Hans, strangely enough.

161
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
— That's weird. That's probably why they died out.
— They were all maimed!

162
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Wahey!
[Laughter]

163
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,400
Does that mean they were Hans-free?

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,720
[Groans]
Yes!

165
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,420
— Point!
— Thank you, thank you...

166
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,020
— No, no, I can't give you a point, it's not a fact.
— Biscuits!

167
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,360
I've just realized that whenever I hit that button, I do this kind of — thing with my lips, like...

168
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
[Slaps button]
I'm not sure why!

169
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,860
Can we just get a freeze-frame of that now, of you going:

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
Ludwig!

171
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,260
Yeah, Ludwig's a good shout, actually.

172
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,220
Nope.

173
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,860
— Arnold.
— John!

174
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,060
Arnold is exactly right. Point! [DING]

175
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
— Ah!
— Arnold!

176
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,300
The very first one: Arnold, Count of Dießen married to Gisela of Schweinfurt.

177
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,800
Nice.

178
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,020
Pigfurt?

179
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,140
— Pretty much.
— Yes.

180
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,000
If anyone wants to take what the 'Furt' in that is... 'Schwein' is definitely 'swine'.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,060
Is it 'river'?

182
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,820
Not quite. You're very close.

183
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,700
Ford.

184
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,100
Ford. Point over there. [DING]

185
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,260
— 'Pig crossing'.
— Literally 'swine ford'.

186
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,500
It's where you put the pigs through the river.

187
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,940
I love it. There's a German footballer called Schweinsteiger. I always loved that: 'Pig-farmer'.

188
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,920
I love it when you do translate. My wife does that a little bit, you know, of translating foreign footballers' names.

189
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,320
'Huh huh! Pig farmer.'

190
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,020
And as soon as you've got that in your head... 'Pig farmer.'

191
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,640
'He's playing surprisingly well considering he's been up since dawn.'

192
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,520
They don't milk pigs, do they? So he doesn't need to be up at dawn.

193
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
No, we've missed the obvious one. We've missed 'Otto'.

194
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,220
Of course!

195
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
There's one of those. There's also... Poppo.

196
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,880
— Nice!
— Cool!

197
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,380
He sounds like a children's clown.

198
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,380
Poppo the Second, Margrave of Carniola.

199
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,880
— Yes! Yes!
— Ohhhh!

200
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,740
Carniola!

201
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,640
And thrice yes, please.

202
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,280
And if he doesn't introduce himself like that every time, there is something wrong.

203
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,220
Probably doesn't introduce himself very much at all any more.

204
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Well... if he didn't at the time.

205
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,820
'I am Margrave of Cariola.'

206
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,820
'I would like some petrol.'

207
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,320
I mean, we're talking about someone who died more than 900 years ago.

208
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,560
'I would like some hay.'

209
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,380
'I am Margrave of Cariola. Twix please!'

210
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,640
I've just got this idea of motorway service stations on medieval hay tracks now.

211
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,320
Well, there would have been things like that. There would have been coaching... staging places.

212
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah, it would have been a coaching inn.

213
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,660
But I'm just having the idea that you pull off this slip road on this hay track,

214
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,040
and there's this utterly uninterested person

215
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,220
trying to flog you fish and chips that have been sat there for ten hours.

216
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
'You cannot get a frankfurter from these people.'

217
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
'For look at the prices they charge!'

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,020
'I shall go over to ye Manor of Ginster...'

219
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,960
'It is not warm. It is cold. These things should not be eaten in such a fashion!'

220
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
'But there be tax if we warm them.'

221
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,800
'But there be tax if we warm them, sir!'

222
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,220
'Yes, I know! I set the taxes!'

223
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,940
'Fine, fine. I shall eat it cold anyway. I am only on my way somewhere else.'

224
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,220
'I shall heat it on my horse's exhaust.'

225
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,900
[Laughter]
Ohhh.

226
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,760
I just realized that essentially, that pasty tax thing is like a medieval tax.

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
It's the kind of thing you'd expect King John to say in a Robin Hood story.

228
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,580
Yes. A kids' Robin Hood story, of course, that doesn't involve death,

229
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,180
but one that does involve taxing pasties.

230
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,040
Yeah.

231
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,000
Just a thought: 'I wouldst have to pull over at a, at a staging-place; I have soiled my —'

232
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Sorry, you're dropping into Wogan again here.

233
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
I can't help it!

234
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,820
'I have soiled my breeches and I must take a quick call.'

235
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,180
'These privies are cleaned twice a day. Please tell Management if you find a problem.'

236
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,740
There's a little analog clock on the wall, going round,

237
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
saying 'Minutes since last...'

238
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
They've got one of those grabby machines!

239
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,860
— Just on a string...
— Yeah.

240
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,980
'You could never find a favour from these things!'

241
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,180
No, it's just a peasant strung up by the feet.

242
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,160
[Laughter]

243
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,140
And you've only got so much rope to lower them down.

244
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,460
— 'I have a cunning plan!'
— 'Get that one! Get that one!'

245
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
'His grip is not strong enough. They are rigged! They are rigged!'

246
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,500
'He has had some disease as a child!'

247
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,580
The bears are just massively weighted...

248
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,740
No, they're actual bears.

249
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
'I do not even want this!'

250
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,220
I think we're riffing a Maid Marion and Her Merry Men sketch here.

251
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,320
— Right, okay. At the end of the show, Gary, congratulations, you win this one.

252
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,360
YEEES!

253
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,580
Oh, I'd forgotten that.

254
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,840
I'd forgotten he does that every time, doesn't he.

255
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,420
You have won:

256
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,320
Two hours racing around the coast, desperately trying to collect clams with a famous ballerina...

257
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,300
in Darcy Bussell's Mussel Hustle.

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So enjoy that!

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
That's been Matt Gray.

260
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,580
That's been Gary Brannan.

261
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,740
That's been Chris Joel.

262
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,180
I've been Tom Scott, and we'll see you next time!

263
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,740
And that was our show!

264
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,260
If you liked it, leave us a comment, or better yet, share it around to your friends.

265
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,160
