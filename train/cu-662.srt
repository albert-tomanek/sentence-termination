00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,450
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,030
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,299
Now I have some rather shocking news for everyone.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,179
Apparently, countries are having disputes

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,780
over oil.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,520
I know!

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,709
I never thought it could happen, either.

8
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,169
But what’s even more surprising

9
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,870
is which two countries are letting

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,550
a little black gold come between them:

11
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,800
China and Vietnam.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,410
Which is a shame.

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,870
Vietnam and China have a long history.

14
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,960
Boyhood.

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,690
Always a difficult time

16
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,690
for young nations.

17
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,940
For two thousand years,

18
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,880
Vietnam and China fought like brothers—

19
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,810
with Vietnam coming under Chinese domination,

20
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,420
then fighting its way out,

21
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,020
only to be dominated again—

22
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,980
and so it cycled on and on.

23
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,970
In the 20th Century,

24
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,480
China came to the aid of its communist little brother in the Vietnam War.

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,780
helping North Vietnam defeat

26
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,560
the American imperialists.

27
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,660
But after the war,

28
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,500
China attacked Vietnam

29
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,440
and a bloody battle ensued,

30
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,000
with Vietnam emerging as the bitter winner.

31
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,420
Ten years later,

32
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,500
China and Vietnam became friends once again.

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,060
But now, Vietnam and China are facing off

34
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,060
once more.

35
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,700
This time,

36
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,850
over that well of black gold in the ocean,

37
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,429
the South China Sea.

38
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,639
The South China Sea.

39
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,159
Five trillion dollars a year in shipping

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,810
flows through these waters.

41
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,810
And they’re also home to

42
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,290
untapped natural resources,

43
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,429
like oil and natural gas.

44
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:21,679
Seven different countries have claims

45
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:23,810
to various parts of the South China Sea.

46
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,240
But not to worry,

47
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,810
because China has tried to simplify these
disputes

48
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,500
by claiming pretty much the whole thing

49
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,159
with its “Nine-Dash Line”.

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,789
Vietnam has recently made the bold move

51
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,590
to start drilling for oil and gas

52
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,409
in parts of this disputed territory.

53
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:39,549
The Vietnamese government divides

54
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,490
its coastal area into numbered blocks.

55
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,740
Kind of like Battleship.

56
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,569
But with oil rigs.

57
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,500
Which is probably not as fun of a game.

58
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,849
“Ohhhhh, You sunk my oil rig!

59
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,130
Causing an environmental disaster

60
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,710
that will wipe out all ocean life

61
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,300
within 500 nautical miles.”

62
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,959
Anyway, Vietnam wants to drill for oil

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,660
in blocks 118, 128, and 136.

64
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,799
This is a problem,

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,810
because China’s Nine-Dash Line passes through

66
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,590
or past these blocks,

67
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,349
meaning Vietnam wants to drill in disputed
territory.

68
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,959
And China is not exactly ready

69
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,260
to welcome them to the neighborhood.

70
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,680
“We hope the relevant country

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,200
can act on the basis of maintaining

72
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,900
regional peace and stability

73
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,310
and not do anything to

74
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,510
complicate the situation.”

75
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,489
Hey, Vietnam has watched The Sopranos.

76
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,540
It knows a veiled threat when it hears one.

77
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,770
And that’s why it’s getting the other
families together,

78
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,780
if you know what I mean.

79
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,150
Vietnam’s first ally is India.

80
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,980
India is one of China’s biggest economic
rivals in Asia.

81
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,909
And Vietnam just renewed an oil deal

82
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,810
with them last week.

83
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,329
Vietnam granted an Indian oil firm

84
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,090
a two-year extension to drill in Block 128.

85
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,969
And why is India doing it?

86
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:57,810
One official from that Indian oil firm told
Reuters,

87
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,060
“interest in the block was strategic

88
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,599
rather than commercial,

89
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,019
given that oil development there

90
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,299
was seen as high-risk

91
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,069
with only moderate potential.”

92
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,460
The official also said,

93
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,200
“Vietnam also wants us to be there

94
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,719
because of China’s interventions in the
South China Sea.”

95
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,099
That’s right,

96
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,579
India isn’t even hiding

97
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,590
that it was a political move.

98
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,590
For the Indian government,

99
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,049
it’s more about checking China

100
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,950
than checking for oil.

101
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,950
In fact,

102
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,799
India and Vietnam have been getting a lot
closer

103
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,609
over the past year.

104
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,840
India gave Vietnam a 500 million dollar loan

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,499
to buy defense equipment,

106
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,170
including naval ships and missiles.

107
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,920
They’re also helping Vietnam train

108
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,000
their fighter pilots and submarines.

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,319
India also promised to fund a Bollywood movie

110
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,519
where a maverick Vietnamese fighter pilot

111
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,549
struggles regain his confidence

112
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,590
after his friend is tragically killed

113
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,709
during a training dance number.

114
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,609
Anyway, Vietnam’s second drilling ally

115
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,969
is the United States—surprisingly.

116
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,030
Here at block 118,

117
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,939
there’s a natural gas field

118
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,220
called Blue Whale.

119
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,260
Because it’s big.

120
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
You know,

121
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,409
like a blue whale.

122
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,359
Very creative.

123
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,170
The natural gas there is worth about

124
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,599
four-and-a-half billion US dollars.

125
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,439
And who better to do a joint venture

126
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,379
with state-owned PetroVietnam

127
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,209
than the American company ExxonMobil,

128
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,300
which has such illustrious former CEO’s

129
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,260
as Rex Tillerson,

130
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,120
current US Secretary of State.

131
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,580
Which means it’s quite possible

132
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,270
the deal has the political backing

133
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,640
of the US government.

134
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,940
The planned natural gas drilling

135
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,910
will be within Vietnam’s exclusive economic
zone,

136
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,260
which extends 200 miles off its coast.

137
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,260
But wait!

138
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,230
China’s Nine-Dash Line overlaps

139
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,450
part of Block 118.

140
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,030
So as you can also imagine,

141
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,390
Vietnam and the US drilling close to the Nine-Dash
Line

142
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,980
is not making China very happy.

143
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,600
And speaking of US-Vietnam joint operations,

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,980
earlier this month,

145
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,540
Vietnam began joint military drills with the
US.

146
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,950
This has happened every year since 2010.

147
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,080
But this time,

148
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,920
it came just days after a US Destroyer

149
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,590
sailed through waters China and Vietnam both
claim.

150
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,390
And that was just a month after US President
Trump

151
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,860
met with Vietnamese Prime Minister…

152
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,580
uhh, Shelley,

153
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,750
how do you pronounce that?

154
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,450
Got it.

155
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,880
Prime Minister Phuc.

156
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,100
They signed some trade deals and stuff.

157
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,370
A few days later Phuc met with Vietnam’s
third ally:

158
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,360
Japan.

159
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,640
Oh man,

160
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,560
I hate it when you’re meeting another world
leader

161
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,500
and you’re wearing practically the same
outfit.

162
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,990
Awkward!

163
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,250
But I guess it turned out to be more of a
compliment,

164
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,230
since Japan committed to 900 million dollars

165
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,700
in aid to Vietnam…

166
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,290
...and then the two countries held,

167
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,290
you guessed it,

168
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,060
a joint military drill.

169
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,120
And then there’s block 136.

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,770
Unlike the other blocks I mentioned,

171
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,290
this block falls entirely within China’s
Nine Dash Line—

172
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,380
so Vietnam and China both claim the whole
thing.

173
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,470
Well, the BBC just learned that

174
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,220
a Vietnamese company has been quietly drilling
there

175
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,180
since last month.

176
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,100
The Chinese regime has apparently

177
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,310
also leased out the same territory

178
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,630
to a Hong Kong company,

179
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,631
where two of the directors also happen to
be

180
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:13,960
senior members of the Chinese Communist Party.

181
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,070
Vietnam had avoided drilling there

182
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,910
for years to avoid upsetting China,

183
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,440
but apparently now Vietnam no longer cares
and is doing it anyway.

184
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,000
The Chinese regime has not reacted graciously.

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,830
China and Vietnam were planning on celebrating

186
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,680
their camaraderie with some joint military
drills last month.

187
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,060
Wait again?

188
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,510
When did joint military drills become

189
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,940
the vow renewals of international relations?

190
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,240
But after Vietnam met with India...

191
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,670
and the US...

192
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,160
and Japan...

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,820
and drilled for oil in territory that China
claims, well,

194
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,530
China decided it didn’t want to hang out
anymore.

195
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,990
But besides being generally un-neighborly,

196
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,820
China is probably not going to take any serious
action.

197
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,270
That’s because China is pushing for its
One Belt,

198
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,300
One Road global domination initiative.

199
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,770
They want to make economic alliances

200
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,770
all around the world,

201
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,150
particularly in Southeast Asia.

202
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,210
And if China starts ramming Vietnamese boats...again...

203
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,470
it might make other countries

204
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,270
not want to participate in One Belt One Road.

205
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,450
So China is holding back.

206
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,310
Also, the Chinese leadership is holding

207
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,610
an important Party Congress in November this
year,

208
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,020
and they don’t want some silly war to...

209
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,870
rock the boat.

210
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,430
Vietnam understands all this,

211
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,720
so it’s a good time for them

212
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,850
to start drilling for that black gold.

213
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,330
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

214
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,110

215
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,320

216
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,680
