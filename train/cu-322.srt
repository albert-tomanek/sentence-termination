1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,170
Another North Korean assassination plot?

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,170
L.O.L.!

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,060
Shanghai becomes a ghost town!

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,099
The ghosts are just there for the shopping.

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,669
And finally, does trade trump human rights?

7
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:18,140
I know just the guy to ask.This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,780
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,640
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,140
In our top story,

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,790
Chinese authorities apparently broke up

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,230
a North Korean assassination plot.

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,940
According to South Korean media sources,

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,010
several North Korean agents were apprehended

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,239
by Chinese police in Beijing.

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,579
They were allegedly part of a plot to assassinate

17
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,239
Kim Jong-un’s 22-year-old nephew,

18
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,110
Kim Han-sol.

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,140
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,460
had apparently ordered his bounty hunters

21
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,109
to bring him Han-sol...

22
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,449
and a cookie.

23
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,559
Sadly, they weren’t able to bring him back
that cookie, either.

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,969
Kim Han-sol is the son of Kim Jong-un’s
half-brother,

25
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,260
Kim Jong-nam,

26
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,949
who was assassinated in Malaysia

27
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,500
earlier this year by two women.

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,180
One of whom was wearing a shirt that said
L.O.L.

29
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,420
Beijing authorities were tipped off this time

30
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,420
because one of the North Korean agents

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,049
was wearing a similar shirt.

32
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,409
The Chinese regime has been sheltering

33
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,820
Kim Jong-un’s half-brother’s family—

34
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,640
including Han-sol—for years.

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,829
Some people believe it’s because

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,930
they wanted them to replace Kim Jong-un someday.

37
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,000
You see,

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,040
Kim Jong-nam was a market reform type communist.

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,299
Whereas Kim Jong-un is more of a

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,479
destabilize-all-of-Asia type communist.

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,479
But not everyone in China

42
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,369
is completely opposed to Kim’s North Korean
regime.

43
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:42,759
Apparently one of China’s biggest

44
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,859
state-owned investment groups

45
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,759
may have links to a cargo ship

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,640
that was doing illegal trading

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,380
between China and North Korea.

48
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,560
On the bright side though,

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,030
it seems like the Chinese regime

50
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,280
is repairing relations with the other member

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,759
of the Korean peninsula:

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,439
South Korea.

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,439
Earlier this year,

54
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,909
South Korea installed THAAD,

55
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,049
a US-made missile defense system.

56
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,079
The Chinese regime flipped out.

57
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,890
What’s the problem with a missile defense
system

58
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,910
protecting South Korea

59
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,269
from a North Korean nuclear strike?

60
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,569
Well, it could also theoretically be used
someday

61
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,599
against China.

62
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,330
The Chinese regime encouraged people t

63
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,400
o boycott South Korean products.

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,740
They even shut down some Korean businesses

65
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,600
operating inside China,

66
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,470
like this Lotte store in Jiangsu Province

67
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,819
that suddenly had “fire safety issues.”

68
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,319
But that still didn’t stop South Korea

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,850
from installing the missile defense system.

70
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,470
So eventually the Chinese regime

71
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,870
kind of backed down.

72
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,230
and now they’re agreeing to normalize relations
anyway.

73
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,010
It’s for the greater good

74
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,380
of denuclearizing North Korea, of course!

75
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,750
Not that China, or any other country,

76
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,310
might need to do much to achieve that.

77
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,980
North Korea might be accidentally denuclearizing
itself.

78
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,400
An estimated 200 North Koreans were killed

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,700
at a nuclear testing site in September

80
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,420
when a tunnel collapsed.

81
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,050
That’s according to a Japanese news broadcaster

82
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,819
with North Korean sources.

83
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,510
It’s still unconfirmed,

84
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,049
but experts say it’s possible the most recent
nuclear test

85
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,129
weakened the ground around the site.

86
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,500
In fact, according to this Washington Post
article,

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,330
after so many nuclear tests,

88
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,409
the mountain may just be exhausted.

89
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,120
Of course it’s exhausted.

90
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,810
I felt the same way after taking six standardized
tests

91
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,569
in a row in school.

92
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,209
They also accomplished practically nothing

93
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,799
and just left everybody frustrated.

94
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,420
So is this the end of North Korea’s nuclear
testing?

95
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,370
No, probably not.

96
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,810
But “Chinese scientists already have warned

97
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,700
that further nuclear tests could cause the
mountain

98
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,900
to collapse and release the radiation from
the blast.”

99
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,909
And that mountain is only 50 miles

100
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,599
from the Chinese border.

101
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,549
So a radiation leak is not the kind of North
Korean export

102
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,610
China is looking for.

103
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,610
In other news,

104
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,849
after the CCP’s 19th Party Congress last
week,

105
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,409
Chinese leader Xi Jinping rose to

106
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,569
even greater heights of power.

107
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,000
So what did he decide to do?

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,370
Why, make a trip to his arch rival Jiang Zemin’s
powerbase,

109
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,370
Shanghai.

110
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,820
There’s something called being a sore winner,
Xi.

111
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Shanghai is a big city.

112
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,590
And yet it was turned into a ghost town for
Xi’s trip.

113
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,090
The streets were practically empty.

114
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,500
Unless you count all the police.

115
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,110
Visiting Shanghai is symbolic for Xi Jinping.

116
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,600
Just being able to visit and dominate the
city like this

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,940
shows he’s killin’ it.

118
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
And by “it”

119
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,570
I mean the careers of all who oppose him.

120
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,020
Here he is with his crew visiting

121
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,860
the site of the first Party Congress.

122
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,870
I assume they’re doing the universal gesture

123
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,300
for “I just won.”

124
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,810
Trump had called Xi Jinping last week

125
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,190
to congratulate him—

126
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,990
and teach him about the raised fist thing.

127
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,430
Speaking of “trump”:

128
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,440
Over in Hong Kong,

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,490
imprisoned student activist and friend of
the show

130
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,230
Joshua Wong is out on bail.

131
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,070
And he’s warning the world:

132
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,520
Trade trumps human rights.

133
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,340
In an interview with the Associated Press,

134
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,639
Joshua Wong said,

135
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,319
"Business interests override human rights...

136
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,050
It unfortunately seems to be a common trend
in the world."

137
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,910
Well, trade may trump rights,

138
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,300
but you know what?

139
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,190
Trump trumps trade.

140
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,600
President Donald Trump will be making

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,840
his first state visit to China next week.

142
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,800
Trade will be a major topic of discussion,

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,229
especially as the White House beings a probe

144
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,830
into China’s unfair trade practices,

145
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,150
including stealing US intellectual property.

146
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,150
And finally,

147
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,259
the Chinese regime is pushing somehow

148
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,550
even more Internet censorship.

149
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,090
Apparently, people aren’t paying enough
attention

150
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,729
to heavily censored state-run media,

151
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:49,870
turning to the Internet instead.

152
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,630
And who knows where that information

153
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,800
is coming from!

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,940
On the Internet,

155
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,400
any random guy can just produce some videos

156
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,340
that slander the Chinese regime.

157
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,900
Now, new Chinese regulations

158
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,470
“will force news and information platforms

159
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,160
to conduct regular assessments

160
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,990
to prevent the spread of ‘illegal information.’”

161
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,620
What counts as illegal information?

162
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Don’t worry,

163
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,830
it’s left intentionally vague.

164
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,560
Speaking of Chinese censorship,

165
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,539
it may even be extending to America.

166
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,240
Facebook has removed the account

167
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,259
of Chinese billionaire dissident Guo Wengui.

168
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,140
“Facebook said Oct. 1

169
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,849
it had taken down a page associated with Guo

170
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,669
and stopped him from posting to his own account.”

171
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,639
It comes after Guo posted negative things

172
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,660
about China’s Anti-Corruption Czar

173
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,080
and Eeyore impersonator Wang Qishan.

174
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,330
Now I’m no particular fan of Guo Wengui.

175
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,449
But having Facebook arbitrarily remove his
page after

176
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,990
“[receiving] a report from a representative
of the Chinese government

177
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,330
about that account”

178
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,229
is maybe not a good sign of things to come
here in America.

179
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,919
I wonder if it had anything to do with Facebook
trying to get into China?

180
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,120
On a totally unrelated note,

181
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,819
here’s Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg

182
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,840
at a meeting on Monday with Xi Jinping.

183
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,880
He even put on adult clothes!

184
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
So what do you think?

185
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,500
And is the China Uncensored Facebook page
at risk?

186
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,509
I hope not,

187
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,210
because I post cool content there that

188
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,590
you don’t see here on the YouTube channel.

189
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,770
Thanks for watching.

190
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,460
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

191
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,640
see you next time.

192
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,060
I hope you’ve been watching these videos

193
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,210
at the end of my YouTube episodes.

194
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,690
Otherwise you won’t know about ChinaUncensored.tv.

195
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,550
Its our very own website.

196
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,550
And every Friday,

197
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,490
we upload full half hour episodes of the show
for free.

198
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,009
Check it out now!
