1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,710
The Chinese Communist Party gains more influence

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,710
Over Europe

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,950
But a new effort in the UK

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,590
is seeking to change that.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:18,370
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,750
Europe’s financial elite are in bed with
the Chinese Communist Party.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,960
The EU abandoned human rights to get a China
investment deal.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,970
But some in the British government are trying
to make sure the UK doesn’t make the same

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,339
mistake.\h

10
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:39,359
For more, I spoke with Benedict Rogers, the
Co-founder and Chief Executive of Hong Kong

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,289
Watch, and Deputy Chair of the Conservative
Party Human Rights Commission.

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,320
Benedict, as always, it's a pleasure having
you on.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Thank you.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,809
It's always a great pleasure to be with you.

15
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,899
It seems like every time we talk, there's
been another horrible thing that's happened

16
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,569
in Hong Kong.

17
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:01,260
Last week, the Hong Kong government arrested
more than 50 pro-democracy activists.

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,360
What do you think of the international response
to that?

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,610
I think the international response has not
been anything like what it should be in proportion

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,080
to the significance of these arrests.

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,440
This was essentially the final dismantling
of what existed as a democracy movement.

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,360
That's not to say the democracy movement won't
try to carry on.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:34,220
But in formal terms, it was the biggest mass
arrest in one swoop that there's ever been

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,670
in recent years.

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:44,060
And the international community's response
was some strong words, but very little else

26
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,040
and even those strong words were rather lost
in the midst of everything else going on.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,390
So I definitely want to see more action.

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,060
Well, definitely seems like the Communist
Party chose to make those arrests on a very

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,320
particular day, January 6th, almost as if
they knew the rest of the world would be distracted

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
by something else.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:14,030
Well, absolutely January the 6th, was a pretty
dark day for democracy, in terms of the arrest

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,749
of people in Hong Kong, in the morning, Hong
Kong time for the simple crime in [inverted

33
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:23,750
commas 00:00:01:40] of trying to carry out
an election.

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,790
And of course it ended with the very ugly
scenes in Washington, DC, a beacon of democracy

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,849
around the world as well.

36
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,500
So at whilst I wouldn't compare the two, and
I think America's democracy is strong and

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,730
Hong Kong's freedoms are being dismantled,
so it would be wrong to compare them.

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,469
But nevertheless, they both have happened
on the same day.

39
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,459
And that was a very alarming.

40
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,889
You worked on the UK Conservative Party Human
Rights Commission Report on China, which is

41
00:02:54,889 --> 00:03:00,019
called The Darkness Deepens, very cheerful
by the way.

42
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:07,050
The report calls out the mendacity, brutality,
inhumanity, insecurity in criminality of the

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,230
Chinese Communist Party.

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,450
You don't mince words there, do you?

45
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:21,060
We don't, but it's a report that is based
on hours and hours of testimonial evidence

46
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,200
that was presented to the Conservative Party
Human Rights Commission in hearings throughout

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,969
much of last year, and pages and pages of
written evidence.

48
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:37,040
And that evidence was submitted by a wide
range of sources, all essentially saying the

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,489
same thing.

50
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,019
I think what's significant about this report
is that, there are other reports that highlight

51
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:54,680
particular issues, the Uighurs, the situation
in Hong Kong, Tibet and so on.

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,400
There's very few reports that I've come across
that put the whole picture together and show

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:09,469
that the CCP, is not only committing a very
likely genocide against the Uighurs and dismantling

54
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:16,230
democracy in Hong Kong, it is across the board,
it is Christians, it's following Gong practitioners,

55
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,140
its civil society, activists, lawyers, bloggers,
et cetera.

56
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:26,750
It's an 88 page report with a long list of
tragedies.

57
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,979
And it follows, of course, the report that
the commission published in 2016, which was

58
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:36,669
titled The Darkest Moment.

59
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,090
And the reason for that title at that time,
was that one of the people who gave evidence

60
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:48,180
then said that the situation in 2016 was the
darkest moment since the Tiananmen massacre.

61
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,319
With Hindsight that title was perhaps a bit
premature and hence The Darkness Deepens.

62
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,030
I don't know if that's funny or tragic?

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,450
Yeah.

64
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:06,710
Well, it's very tragic in reality, but you
have to keep a sense of humor in very dark

65
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,710
times.

66
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,991
And we found ourselves as a commission, faced
with that linguistic challenge, what title

67
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,240
did we give this?

68
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,759
If we titled it the darkest moment four years
ago?

69
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,190
Well, so then what's the next one going to
be called if it gets worse?

70
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,990
I think we'll have to come to that when we
get to it.

71
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,500
But any suggestions there, let me know.

72
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,340
Just a stream of swears.

73
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,659
Well, okay, so hopefully won't get to that
point.

74
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:37,639
So what actions does the reports suggest the
UK take against the Chinese Communist Party's

75
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,610
human rights abuses?

76
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:50,060
Well, it calls first of all for a comprehensive
and coordinated thorough review of UK-China

77
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,960
policy across government departments.

78
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,560
So not just the Foreign Office, but across
relevant government departments.

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,090
And for a total reset and recalibration of
that relationship.

80
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:11,060
It calls for targeted sanctions, which have
not yet been applied, it urges Britain to

81
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:19,830
work with our allies to lead the establishment
of a coalition of the free world to act as

82
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,280
much as possible together.

83
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,270
That shouldn't mean the lowest common denominator,
countries should be as robust as they possibly

84
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,270
can be.

85
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,750
But there is a need for the democratic world
to unite and coordinate much more than they

86
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:41,100
have been because essentially, we need to
form a united front to counter the CCP's united

87
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
front.

88
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,800
I like the sound of that.

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,280
I know recently, some UK Members of Parliament
have suggested a genocide amendment to the

90
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,569
UK trade bill.

91
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:51,889
What is that?

92
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:52,949
Yes.

93
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:59,870
So that is an amendment that was pioneered
in the House of Lords by people like Lord

94
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,439
Alton and quite amazing range of members of
the House of Lords, former cabinet ministers,

95
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,759
the former head of the Royal Air Force, the
former head of our intelligence services,

96
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,439
former Supreme Court judges, and whole range
of other really distinguished figures.

97
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,389
And it now goes to the Commons next week.

98
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:29,560
And what the amendment tries to do is two
things, firstly, to create a mechanism whereby

99
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,580
people who believe there was a case of genocide,
and this applies not simply in the case of

100
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,340
China, but genocide anywhere, wherever it
happens, can come to the High Court of England

101
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,680
and Wales and ask the High Court to make a
preliminary determination as to whether the

102
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,719
evidence does suggest genocide or not.

103
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:56,870
And the consequences of that, if the high
court does conclude that it's genocide, under

104
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:07,340
this amendment the government will be required
not to enter into a bilateral trade deal with

105
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,330
the states that are found to be committing
genocide.

106
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,270
So if a trade deal is already in place, that
should be revoked, and if it isn't in place,

107
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,289
steps towards one should be stopped.

108
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,379
That's the effect of it.

109
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:31,680
And it was designed to answer a very simple
problem, which is that for decades now, this

110
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,709
isn't always the position of other governments.

111
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:39,510
But the British government's position has
always been, it's not for governments to determine

112
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,930
whether something has genocide, it's for the
courts.

113
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:49,079
That's a perfectly logical theoretical position
to have, but the problem with it is the International

114
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:56,530
Court mechanisms are very unsatisfactory,
and particularly in the case of China, you're

115
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,200
never going to get a referral.

116
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,930
So this is an amendment designed to get out
of that vicious circle.

117
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,079
Well, you certainly phrase that in a very
polite way.

118
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,080
But so it sounds pretty straight forward.

119
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,170
Don't trade with countries that commit genocide.

120
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,880
But it seems like the UK government is not
happy about it.

121
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,980
So if the genocide amendment passes, would
the UK government actually apply that to China?

122
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, that's the big question.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,700
If it passes and becomes law, and if then
a case is brought to the High Court of England

124
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,380
and Wales in regard to the Uighurs, for example.

125
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,620
And if the High Court concludes that what's
happening to the Uighurs is genocide, then

126
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:52,470
under the law, the UK would not be able to
negotiate a trade deal with China in those

127
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,470
circumstances.

128
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,830
Now, realistically, there's going to be quite
a long timeframe to complete all those steps.

129
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,420
But nevertheless, if it passes, it would send
a very important message.

130
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,949
And it would be law that people can go to
the court, see if the court decides it's genocide.

131
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,930
And if it does, the government must abide
by the requirements of that amendment.

132
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:20,820
So, speaking of trade, the EU has recently
announced a major investment deal with China.

133
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,650
How would this deal affect human rights in
China?

134
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,780
The EU's deal is one of the most appalling
deals that I've seen.

135
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,730
And what was so striking about it was the
timing of it.

136
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,410
Firstly, it came a few days after the European
Parliament itself, one of the EU's main institutions

137
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:50,050
had passed a resolution calling for targeted
sanctions, calling for access to the camps

138
00:10:50,050 --> 00:11:00,850
in Xinjiang and very importantly calling for
any investment deal to have particular standards

139
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,329
around labor rights.

140
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:10,199
And just a few days later, the European Commission
and the member states completely ignored the

141
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:16,360
European Parliament and went ahead with this
deal that has no safeguards on human rights.

142
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,850
It has maybe a few vague promises by the CCP
to move towards signing various international

143
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,230
agreements, but we all know what to think
of the CCP is word.

144
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,910
We can't ever take the word for anything other
than essentially an untruth.

145
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:47,920
And coming just a short time before the transition
in the United States as well, it sends a pretty

146
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,420
bad signal to the new administration in the
U.S. I think most people agree, it's a bad

147
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,959
deal in itself, and it was very bad timing.

148
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:04,680
And I hope that the European Parliament and
other member states will reconsider it before

149
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,990
it's too late.

150
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,610
Is it too late to do something about the EU-China
investment deal?

151
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,820
Well, it has been signed.

152
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:19,550
So in that sense, probably is too late, but
I think there were steps that EU could take.

153
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:28,550
I said when the 53 were arrested in Hong Kong,
that in response to that, the EU should immediately

154
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,600
revoke and reconsider the deal.

155
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,710
Unfortunately, they didn't listen to me.

156
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:41,589
But I think we need to keep up the pressure
on the EU itself and on member states to take

157
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,779
action going forward.

158
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:49,230
If they can't revoke the deal, then at least
they need to balance it with other measures,

159
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,290
including the application of targeted Magnitsky
sanctions.

160
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,370
You're a part of two upcoming events about
human rights in China that people can join

161
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,370
online.

162
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,910
Can you tell us about those?

163
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,910
Yeah.

164
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:11,040
So the first, later today on the 13th of January,
is the launch of the Conservative Party Human

165
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,370
Rights Commission Report, The Darkness Deepens.

166
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:22,810
And that's an online event, I've tweeted about
it, there's an event invitation out there

167
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,870
people can register.

168
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:31,100
And at that event, we will have some very
amazing speakers, Iain Duncan Smith, who is

169
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,540
the former leader of the British Conservative
Party, but also the co-chair of IPAC, the

170
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,140
Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, we'll
be speaking at it.

171
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:50,440
So will Nathan Law, the highest-profile exiles,
Hong Kong activist, Rahima Mahmut, who's a

172
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,850
very high-profile Uyghurs campaigner, Simon
Cheng, who you may recall was a British consulate

173
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:05,920
employee in Hong Kong, who ended up in jail
in China and suffering some horrific torture

174
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
there.

175
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:15,600
And Dr. Teng Biao, a pre-eminent Mainland
Chinese exiled lawyer and an activist.

176
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,569
And I'll say a few words as well, so that's
the lineup at that event.

177
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:28,860
And then tomorrow, Thursday, the 14th of January,
the Macdonald–Laurier Institute, think tank

178
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:38,230
in Canada together with Hong Kong Watch, IPAC
and a number of others, has a big online conference

179
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,290
on human rights in China as a whole.

180
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:49,310
And with a number of politicians and prominent
activists speaking at that and looking at

181
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,449
what are the ways forward to addressing human
rights in China.

182
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,070
I'll definitely put links to those events
below, and I hope everyone watching definitely

183
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,630
checks that out.

184
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,639
