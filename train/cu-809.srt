1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,430
It ain’t easy being green

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,290
Or a Hong Kong Protester

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,680
It’s a match made in…

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,600
Well it doesn’t exactly look like Heaven.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,620
Pepe the Frog.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,820
A Nazi symbol of alt-right hate?

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,609
Or an internet troll gone too far?

8
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,199
In America, Pepe is a polarizing frog.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,079
But in Hong Kong, Pepe means something completely
different.

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,840
It’s a symbol of fighting for freedom against
totalitarianism.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,470
That’s at least how Hong Kong protesters
have used Pepe.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,180
Far from supporting Nazis,

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,020
they’re using it in their fight against

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,410
what they're calling “Chinazis”—

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,830
the Chinese Communist Party

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,080
On September 30,

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,070
Hong Kong protesters took a break from the
tear gas

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,020
with a peaceful demonstration called Pepe’s
Way.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,220
Hong Kong protesters love Pepe.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,600
They see him as one of them.

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,490
“Fight for freedom!

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,010
Stand with Hong Kong!”

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,650
Obviously this was before the Hong Kong government
outlawed masks.

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,020
Pepe’s Way is a human chain,

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,079
well human and frog chain,

26
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,130
stretching for more than 2 miles.

27
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,729
“What does Pepe mean to you?”

28
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:13,729
“Unity.

29
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,789
It means all the Hong Kong people

30
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,990
united together to fight for freedom.

31
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,549
This is very symbolic character for Hong Kong
people”

32
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,920
“So what does Pepe mean to you?”

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
“Liberty.

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,280
The courage to speak.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,729
You stand against the oppression,

36
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,540
then you be the true Hong Kong local in here.”

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,639
Pepe’s Way is a reference to the Baltic
Way.

38
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,490
That was when two million people joined hands

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,990
to form a human chain across the three Baltic
states —

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,259
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

41
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,509
They were calling for independence from the
Soviet Union.

42
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,150
Hong Kong protesters have been doing

43
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,190
human chains inspired by the Baltic Way since
August.

44
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,280
But this one has a cuddly twist.

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,659
As long as you don’t get hung up by the
alt-right neo-nazi thing.

46
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,340
Pepe the Frog is a common sight in these protests.

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,420
As common as…

48
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,420
Chanting.

49
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,430
“Fight for Freedom!”

50
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,180
“Stand with Hong Kong!”

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,360
Singing.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,920
And police brutality.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,890
I can only imagine that's what happened to
this Pepe.

54
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,239
Actually, it’s a reference to the young
female protester

55
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,970
who police shot in the eye with a beanbag
round.

56
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,629
Pepe has become such a symbol of these protests,

57
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,890
there’s even a Hong Kong Pepe themed sticker
pack for Whatsapp.

58
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,670
There are Pepes representing all the different
Hong Kong protesters;

59
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,480
all the different...whatevers;

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,250
and there’s even the definitely unlicensed
Pepe the Pikachu

61
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,230
and Pepe the Squirtle.

62
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,010
And it may be because of the extreme

63
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,950
police brutality protesters have faced,

64
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,980
that humor has become their greatest weapon.

65
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,000
And no one’s been arrested for laughing.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
Yet.

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,700
With a government that’s increasingly unaccountable
to the people,

68
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,439
art and humor have become some of the few
avenues left

69
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,500
for people to express their discontent.

70
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,690
“Is it difficult to find humor when everything
is so

71
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,290
serious and dark in Hong Kong right now?”

72
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,120
“Yes, sure, it’s very hard to find humor.

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,819
Yesterday we witness many many things that
make us sad,

74
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,360
but we need to have a little bit of humor
in the hard days

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,480
so we can have a long run and lead to victory.”

76
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,379
“Well the humor comes from sarcastic, like
black humor.

77
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:58,879
To us, its not fun but we try to make it so
we can be light hearted,

78
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,780
we can come out and we can tease each other,

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,780
like have you got one eye,

80
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,480
how many gas have you inhaled today,

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,799
it’s more like trying to hold on to our
tears.”

82
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,459
So in Hong Kong,

83
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,030
Pepe is a symbol of unity, liberty,

84
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,139
and the black humor protesters use

85
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,370
to make fun of their authoritarian government.

86
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,789
It’s something that brings protesters together.

87
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,400
And that’s, of course,

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,080
why Beijing is terrified.

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,110
At the end of the day,

90
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,940
authoritarian regimes love to be laughed at.

91
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,500
And perhaps no one gets the joke quite as
much,

92
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,880
as everyone’s friend, Pepe.
