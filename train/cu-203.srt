1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,830
James Bond villains have some pretty frightening
technology.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,570
And the Chinese regime is a quick learner.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,490
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,940
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,840
You know, when I hear the Chinese regime is
working on plans for a supersonic submarine,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,590
mining the moon,

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,449
or developing hypersonic nuclear missiles,

9
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,150
I can't help but wonder,

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,309
maybe the Chinese military has been spending
a little too much time watching James Bond

11
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,340
movies.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,840
And then it hit me.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,620
Of course they have!

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,829
The new James Bond movie Spectre is one of
the few foreign films allowed in China this

15
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:43,870
year.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,820
On opening weekend alone, it raked in 48 million
dollars.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,180
So it makes sense the Communist Party is learning
from a franchise with a proven track record.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,430
So here are 8 James Bond Villain Technologies
Used by China.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,289
Number 8: Space Lasers

20
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,360
The cornerstone of any evil mastermind's plan
for world domination surely involves space

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
lasers.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:21,790
Like in or Die Another Day.

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,680
But what you might not know is that China
is building its own space laser!

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,829
It's the "largest ever space project."

25
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,979
The satellite will use massive solar panels
to gather solar radiation and convert it into

26
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,810
lasers to be shot down at Earth.

27
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,259
But it's totally not a weapon.

28
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,390
It's a "space solar power system."

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,610
You see China has a bit of a pollution problem,

30
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,280
and this alternative energy source is clearly
the most efficient solution!

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,270
Did I mention it's not a weapon?

32
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,159
Number 7: Space Station

33
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,659
Who could forget that magic moment when James
Bond tried to be Star Wars?

34
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,479
Moonraker has that Gravity movie beat hands
down.

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,800
This is the secret space base of the movie's
villain Hugo Drax,

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,360
who wants to wipe out life on Earth.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,560
China's pollution is already doing a fairly
good job of that,

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,120
so of course a space station is in order.

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,080
Meet China's Tiangong-1 Space Lab,

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,300
launched in 2011.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,739
China doesn't participate in the International
Space Station.

42
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:32,480
It has its own version.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,790
And it will launch new ones in 2016 and 2022.

44
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,709
Obviously, this has nothing to do with vying
for control of space.

45
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,330
It's just for scientific purposes.

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,890
Number 6: Intellectual Property Warfare

47
00:02:47,890 --> 00:03:01,540
Remember James Bond's View to a Kill?

48
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,090
Christopher Walken's character is the result
of a genetic experiment by Nazis.

49
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,920
And boy, does he have a real microchip on
his shoulder

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
"I propose to end the domination of Silicon
Valley,

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
and leave us in control of that market."

52
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,450
He wants to literally flood Silicon Valley
to eliminate competition for his microchip

53
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,510
company.

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,370
Now the Chinese regime basically has the same
plan.

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,379
Only instead of literally flooding Silicon
Valley,

56
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,299
they're just figuratively flooding the market--with
cheap knockoffs of Western technology.

57
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,310
According to the chairman and CEO of BLACKOPS
Partners Corporation, Casey Fleming,

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,659
intellectual property theft from China costs
the US 5 trillion dollars every year.

59
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,900
And James Bond was written by a man named
Ian Fleming.

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,750
Coincidence?

61
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,560
Yes.

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,250
Number 5: Tanks in the shape of monsters

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,480
Normal tanks might be fine for a boring old
army like America's.

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,239
But when you want to terrify the likes of
James Bond,

65
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,939
you need something with a little more flare.

66
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:06,939
In case you couldn't tell,

67
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,720
that was a dragon tank.

68
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
China wants to take it a step further,

69
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,510
and build a giant spider tank.

70
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,669
And it will look like this.

71
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,359
Number 4: Claiming Islands in the Middle of
the Ocean

72
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,090
Take a look at the secret island base occupied
by the villain from Skyfall.

73
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,490
Look familiar?

74
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,229
Tiny island in the middle of the ocean?

75
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,210
Used as a secret military base?

76
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,530
Well China is building its own islands in
the South China Sea-

77
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,130
and using them as military bases

78
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,600
I mean, uh,

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,259
for totally peaceful purposes only.

80
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,979
Number 3: Satellite Killer

81
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,110
Once again lets go into space.

82
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,250
In You Only Live Twice,

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,699
the main villain, Dr. Evil,

84
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,940
I mean Blofeld,

85
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,289
has found a unique way to take out spacecraft.

86
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:18,910
Well, China's got anti-satellite weapons,
too.

87
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,380
According to U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General
Jay Raymond,

88
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,380
"Every satellite in every orbit will be able
to be held at risk" by China's anti-satellite

89
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,860
abilities.

90
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,940
Now China wouldn't do it exactly like the
movie.

91
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,350
They have anti-satellite missiles.

92
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,449
They tested the first one last year.

93
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,440
Number 2: Underground Bases

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,080
Check out this underground base from You Only
Live Twice.

95
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,430
And guess what?!

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:56,580
It's full of ninjas.

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,660
Well China has scores of underground military
bases,

98
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,139
reinforced and almost impossible to destroy.

99
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,330
And its soldiers totally know kung fu.

100
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,550
Which is kinda like ninjitsu...?

101
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,729
Though apparently,

102
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:15,479
Chinese soldiers are no longer going to do
kung fu.

103
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,479
From now on,

104
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,259
they'll just shoot people with guns!

105
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,319
And Number 1: Surveillance of Everyone

106
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,960
If you've watched the latest James Bond movie,

107
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,370
Moriarty is back!

108
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,590
I mean, Spectre is back.

109
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,380
And this time, it wants global leaders to
share intelligence data so it can spy on the

110
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,699
world's population.

111
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,770
"Do not let them tell you we need less surveillance.

112
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,009
We need more.

113
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:47,009
Much more."

114
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,410
And guess who else is into massive surveillance
of its citizens?

115
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,410
Yep.

116
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,479
China.

117
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,759
And foreign companies even helped them do
it.

118
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,819
And let's just say it might not all be for
fighting terrorism.

119
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,780
Anyway, those are just a few things the Chinese
regime has done that they surely learned from

120
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,720
watching James Bond movies.

121
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
What do you think?

124
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,639
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell.

125
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,610
See you next time.
