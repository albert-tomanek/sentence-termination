1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:02,290
The US Navy warns

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,640
China could invade Taiwan soon.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,139
And the Chinese Communist Party wants the
US

4
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,139
To be afraid.

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,059
Very afraid.

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,349
Welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,990
I’m Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,010
There’s been a lot of attention on Taiwan
recently.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,430
And not because of its delicious pineapples.

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,710
Ok, some of the attention has been because
of its delicious pineapples.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,719
But there’s more and more concern over whether
the Chinese Communist Party will try to take

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,640
Taiwan by force.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,110
That’s why the Taiwan Strait, the body of
water that separates Taiwan from China, has

16
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,620
been called a powder keg that could set off
a world war.

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,839
I know what you’re thinking.

18
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,480
Yet another light, uplifting China Uncensored
episode.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,140
And it gets better.

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,150
Earlier this year, a US Admiral warned that
China could invade Taiwan in the next six

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,640
years.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,230
That was Admiral Philip Davidson, the commander
of the US Indo-Pacific Command.

23
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,860
He made that assessment back in March and
then...retired from the Navy.

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,490
Good timing.

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,270
The new commander of the Indo-Pacific Command
is also concerned about Taiwan.

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,580
He says that China’s threat to Taiwan is
“closer to us than most think.”

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,880
And that a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan is the
biggest threat in the Pacific.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,340
And a bigger threat than North Korea or Russia.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:50,230
Look, there’s a reason that I started China
Uncensored, and not North Korea UnJuched,

30
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,100
or Russia UnPutined.

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,350
And that reason is...I don’t want to get
poisoned.

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,421
Anyway, the point is that it’s good news
that the US military is concerned about the

33
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,170
Chinese regime’s threat to Taiwan.

34
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,040
Now the question is, what are we going to
do about it?

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,989
The answer is: Absolutely nothing.

36
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,930
We don’t want to get involved at all!

37
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,900
Because, according to my favorite state-run
media, the Global Times, the US will lose

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,230
a war with China over Taiwan...island.

39
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, at first glance, this seems like a pretty
standard Global Times article.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,700
It blames the US and its Taiwan Relations
Act for giving birth to “Taiwan’s renegade

41
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,540
secessionists.”

42
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,489
It calls Congress’s support of Taiwan corrupt.

43
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:46,180
And it compares Taiwan’s situation to the
Confederacy during the American Civil War.

44
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,780
Just a reminder that Taiwan is a self-governing
country that was never controlled by the People’s

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,799
Republic of China at any point in history.

46
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:59,790
So, yeah, totally the same thing as the Confederacy
during the American Civil War.

47
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,231
But what does the Global Times article say
that the US should do, if it doesn’t want

48
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,940
to fight over Taiwan?

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,989
Tell Taiwan to accept “one country, two
systems” rule under the Chinese Communist

50
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:13,989
Party.

51
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,969
I mean, it worked out so well for Hong Kong.

52
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:23,450
And if that doesn’t work, the US president
could just rescind the Taiwan Relations Act...which

53
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,349
he can’t do because it’s a US law, and
only Congress can change laws.

54
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,629
But if Congress gets in the way, then the
US president should just order the US government

55
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,489
to not get involved in a China-Taiwan conflict.

56
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,819
And why would the US do this, again?

57
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:48,189
Well, it’s because China has a decisive
advantage in a fight with the US: casualty

58
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,189
tolerance.

59
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:54,019
Meaning, that to get what it wants, the Chinese
Communist Party is way more willing to let

60
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,790
its own people die than the US is.

61
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,069
Here’s the kicker, though.

62
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:05,130
The whole point of this article is this sentence:
“Taiwan’s fate poses no existential threat

63
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:12,249
to the US, and the US should not fall into
the trap of paying for their hubris with American

64
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:13,249
blood.”

65
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:19,841
They’re saying, Taiwan’s not important,
so it’s definitely not worth shedding American

66
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:24,660
blood over, so we should encourage them to
“reunify” with an authoritarian regime

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,760
that they were never a part of in the first
place.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,700
What a great idea!

69
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,250
Like I said, it sounds like a standard Global
Times article.

70
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,370
But it turns out, it wasn’t written by a
Global Times editor.

71
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:45,050
It was written by a retired Marine Corps infantry
officer who now serves as a US civil servant

72
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,990
in the Pentagon.

73
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:54,090
Wait, is the Pentagon ok with its employees
writing opinion articles in a Chinese propaganda

74
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,150
outlet that’s been designated a foreign
mission by the US government?

75
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:06,060
Well, apparently the author didn’t ask for
approval before publishing this piece.

76
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,980
Which means he could be facing disciplinary
action.

77
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,890
Now, I don’t know why this author chose
to write this article for a Chinese propaganda

78
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,290
outlet.

79
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,130
Maybe he really thinks he’s preventing war
between China and the US.

80
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,310
Regardless, for the Global Times, this is
a propaganda jackpot.

81
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,770
I’ll tell you more after the break.

82
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,290
Welcome back.

83
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,990
This Global Times article is a perfect example
of the Chinese Communist Party’s political

84
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,650
warfare.

85
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,330
As Professor Kerry Gershaneck says, political
warfare is the Communist Party’s plan to

86
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,170
win without fighting.

87
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,420
Part of political warfare is media warfare.

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,250
That “involves using public opinion as a
weapon by propagandizing through various forms

89
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,420
of media in order to weaken the adversary’s
‘will to fight.’”

90
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:04,000
Here’s an example: This China Daily article
warns that Taiwan should abandon its independence

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,350
stance to avoid war.

92
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,840
The Communist Party might call it Taiwan’s
independence stance.

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,450
Normal people would call it acknowledging
reality.

94
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,860
Unlike Chinese state-run media, which has
to call Taiwan’s presidential elections

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,730
the Taiwan regional leadership elections.

96
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,530
Because they can’t admit that Taiwan is
in fact already independent.

97
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,140
But the point is, the Communist Party is using
media warfare to intimidate Taiwan.

98
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,080
And that’s what they’re doing to the US,
too.

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,190
Their message is, Taiwan isn’t worth fighting
for, so we should encourage them to give in

100
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,700
to the Chinese Communist Party.

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,690
What’s interesting is that the Communist
Party’s media warfare messaging is showing

102
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,250
up in American media outlets, too.

103
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,340
More after the break.

104
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,670
Welcome back

105
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:01,520
Messages from the Communist Party’s media
warfare are showing up in US media outlets.

106
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,870
Like in this article, which calls a war over
Taiwan foolish and costly for the US.

107
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,320
It says the best case scenario is that the
US will “suffer egregious losses in ships,

108
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,970
aircraft, and troops.”

109
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:22,650
While in a worst-case scenario, American cities
are turned into nuclear wastelands, killing

110
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,590
millions.

111
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,280
And all over an issue that doesn’t directly
affect our national security.

112
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,120
That is bullpucky.

113
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Excuse my French.

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,380
I’ve talked before on the show about why
Taiwan is an important national security issue

115
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,590
for the US, and especially US allies in Asia.

116
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,420
Including Taiwan’s strategic position in
the first island chain.

117
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,060
And the fact that Taiwan manufactures the
most advanced semiconductors in the world.

118
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,300
And how losing Taiwan would put US security
in the Pacific at a huge risk.

119
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,610
Oh yeah, plus the moral issue that we shouldn’t
just hand over a democratic country of 24

120
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,150
million people to an authoritarian regime
that’s committing genocide.

121
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,920
When people talk about appeasing the Chinese
Communist Party by letting them take Taiwan,

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,890
it’s like they assume that the Party is
going to stop with Taiwan.

123
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,450
No, the Party never stops.

124
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,550
There are other examples of the Party’s
media warfare messaging popping up in US media.

125
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,690
Like this New York Times opinion article that
calls President Biden’s Taiwan policy reckless.

126
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,419
Because it’s increasing the risk of world
war.

127
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,969
Yeah, that sounds bad.

128
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:46,180
But the article conflates showing more support
for Taiwan with trying to establish official

129
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,870
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, something
the Biden administration is definitely not

130
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,649
doing right now.

131
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:58,970
And it assumes the reason we’ve been able
to avoid war over Taiwan for 40 years is because

132
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,970
everyone just pretends that Taiwan is not
officially a country.

133
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,790
That’s wrong.

134
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,160
The reason we’ve been able to avoid war
for 40 years is because the Chinese Communist

135
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,120
Party’s military isn’t able to invade
Taiwan yet.

136
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,290
But the message here is that we shouldn’t
do anything to anger China, because that could

137
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,759
lead to war.

138
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,370
It’s straight out of the media warfare playbook!

139
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,709
So what’s the point of this media warfare
messaging?

140
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:34,000
It’s not going to intimidate the Pentagon,
but it still could have a huge effect.

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,130
First, it plants the idea in US media that
the US shouldn’t support Taiwan, because

142
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,080
that might anger China, which could lead to
war.

143
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,800
That leads to more and more articles about
how the US shouldn’t support Taiwan.

144
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,639
And that influences US business and political
elites to also say that the US shouldn’t

145
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,100
support Taiwan, because that might anger China,
which could lead to war.

146
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,329
That especially works for those elites who
have business interests in China.

147
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:09,689
Which is...all of them.

148
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:15,480
It’s like the Chinese Communist Party is...winning
the war without fighting.

149
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,449
And this could also affect US policy, too.

150
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,920
Support for Taiwan is a popular, bipartisan
issue among US officials.

151
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,120
But most Americans don’t know much about
Taiwan, or why it’s important.

152
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,029
So this type of media warfare can be used
to demoralize average Americans.

153
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:37,759
If you turn Americans against the idea of
fighting for Taiwan, then that puts even more

154
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,189
pressure on US politicians to stop supporting
Taiwan.

155
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:47,769
Look, no one wants to see an actual boots-on-the-ground
war with China.

156
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:53,059
But the way to avoid war is not to appease
the Chinese Communist Party.

157
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:57,410
We should know by now that appeasement doesn’t
work.

158
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:03,900
The way to avoid war is deterrence: not letting
it get to that point in the first place.

159
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,310
And there are many ways the US can deter a
war with China over Taiwan...which I can talk

160
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,330
about in another episode.

161
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,730
See?

162
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,730
This was uplifting.

163
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,740
I’m ending it on a note of hope!

164
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,600
And this episode is sponsored by Surfshark.

165
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,320
Whenever you go online, you should be using
a VPN like Surfshark to protect your identity.

166
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,709
Surfshark’s VPN encryption helps make sure
no one steals your private data.

167
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,120
Ahem, Chinese military.

168
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,610
And Surfshark also has a great new feature
called Surfshark Search.

169
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,939
It’s like using Incognito Mode in your browser,
but even more incognito.

170
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,430
Surfshark Search doesn’t collect or store
any of your data.

171
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,999
And search results won’t be connected to
your browsing history.

172
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:54,040
That’s especially important if you’re
using a browser like, say Opera, which is

173
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,980
now owned by a Chinese company!

174
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,189
And with one Surfshark account, you can connect
as many devices as you want.

175
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:04,160
Try it out with a 30-day money back guarantee.

176
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,119
And Surfshark has a special discount for China
Uncensored fans.

177
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:14,550
Go to surfshark.com/uncensored and use the
code UNCENSORED to get our special deal.

178
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,399
It lets you save 83% off a 2-year plan.

180
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,040
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

181
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:35,500
See you next time.
