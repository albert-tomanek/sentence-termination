1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,139
on this episode of China uncensored

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,999
China doesn't declare war

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,520
hi welcome to China uncensored

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm your host Chris Chappell

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,180
remember that passive aggressive friend of
yours back in high school

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,619
the one who always was nice to you in person

7
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:22,850
but then you found out later

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,609
they were talking some serious smack behind
your back?

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,539
-because you're really pretty -thank you

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,539
that's China

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,399
only instead of talking smack

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,600
china is waging an actual military war with
you

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,049
behind your back

14
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:41,260
unless you're one of the 50 cent trolls watching
this from china

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,229
in which case congratulations you're winning

16
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:46,370
the point is since the late nineties

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,789
most American mainstream media and politicians
have been like

18
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,629
Oh China shiny high-speed trains and

19
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,869
Oh china please make all my cheap stuff

20
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:59,569
more recently it's been like hey come on

21
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,209
stop hacking us that's not nice

22
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:05,670
but seriously can you hurry up and make my
new iphone?

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,420
it's like at some level we know it's an unhealthy
relationship

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,719
and yet we do it anyway

25
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,240
the weird thing about hanging out with Regina
was that I could hate her

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,509
and at the same time I still wanted her to
like me

27
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,920
long before the first Chinese hack was reported
in the media

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,270
china has been in an all-out war with the
United States

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,390
US government intelligence has known about
this for a long time

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,749
but the average American has no idea

31
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,439
because China never declared war

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,679
And China hasn't fired a single bullet

33
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:40,950
nonetheless the communist party of china is
engaged

34
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,200
in a full-scale multi-billion dollar war with
the United States

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,299
and it threatens every American worker and
taxpayer

36
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:54,179
this war is called hybrid warfare

37
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,509
this US army white paper from last year states

38
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,920
that people's liberation army colonel Qiao
Liang

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,469
has already laid out a vision for how China
will attack the United States

40
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,369
through military and non-military tactics

41
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,319
the first rule of unrestricted warfare, he
says

42
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,340
is that there are no rules.

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,769
with nothing forbidden.

44
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,670
no rules?

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,430
nothing forbidden?

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,700
it's like, you think you're playing football
but then

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,420
let the games begin

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,760
so to learn more about this I recently sat
down

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,349
with cyber espionage expert and investigative
journalist

50
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:33,629
joshua philipp

51
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,349
he told me how the Communist Party's hybrid
warfare works

52
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:39,900
and their systematic plan for making the US

53
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,150
more and more vulnerable.

54
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,360
and what's more it's happening right under
our noses

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
what do you think the endgame is of all of
this?

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,830
yeah, so the end game for the chinese communist
party

57
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,930
its programs for economic theft are not isolated

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,299
they're part of what the US military would
call hybrid warfare

59
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,689
And in fact there was a recent report from
US Special Operations Command

60
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:09,000
saying China is waging hybrid warfare in the
United States

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,090
hybrid warfare is a way of fighting war against
another country

62
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,019
without using troops on troops combat

63
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,819
and so that includes economic theft

64
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,189
financial warfare

65
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:20,739
propaganda warfare

66
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:21,849
drug warfare

67
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,709
smuggling warfare

68
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,299
basically every kind of warfare you can think
of

69
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,549
that doesn't involve, you know,

70
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,930
troops killing each other on a battlefield

71
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,230
this is a form of war meant to achieve what
war would achieve

72
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,860
without firing bullets

73
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,620
so with this hybrid warfare could the Communist
party of China try to,

74
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,480
say, target the U.S. power grid and shut it
down?

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,989
Uh, they have.

76
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:49,569
they have unfortunately.

77
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,689
there are many people in the defense community

78
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,040
who believe that the Chinese Communist Party
was behind

79
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,349
the 2003 shutdown of the New York City electrical
grid

80
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,390
referred to as the blackout

81
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,890
the Chinese Communist Party and Russia

82
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,000
and several other countries are actively involved
in attacking

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,640
what we call critical infrastructure

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,730
this is our roads, our power grid, our financial
system..

85
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,290
it's basically all of the different systems
within a country

86
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,640
that allow the country to function

87
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,980
you see? these are key targets in the event
of war

88
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,700
because these are the things you could hit
that would disable

89
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,010
the war fighting ability

90
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,630
you see, you destabilize the country to the
extent

91
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,220
that they're no longer capable of waging war
against you

92
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,970
i think the issue here is it's very easy for
me

93
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:51,570
to imagine a terrorist with an ak-47 blowing
something up

94
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,580
but you know talking about hacking the internet

95
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,100
it's a world that people don't have like,
physical..

96
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,110
they can't come to grips with it in a very
real way

97
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,110
right

98
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,450
this is the unfortunate nature of the modern
world in general

99
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,020
the form of war changed during the Cold War

100
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,670
that was when war went from being, you know,
fighting on the surface

101
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,010
to fighting beneath the wires

102
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,930
it's when spies became the main force

103
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,790
you know in the militaries

104
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,140
and the Internet enabled that to another level

105
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,540
because then you have spies who can work on
the internet

106
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,910
and not just happened to infiltrate buildings
and so on

107
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,460
the majority of modern warfare is being fought
through unconventional means

108
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,900
as far back as 2007

109
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,340
the US military was saying China's waging
full-scale force-on-force warfare

110
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,650
against us in cyberspace

111
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:56,010
so what is being done to prevent this?

112
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,590
unfortunately very little

113
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,820
Why?

114
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,770
okay so my sources tell me and it's not just
my sources

115
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,990
but a lot of other people

116
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,950
the United States is overly focused on terrorism

117
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,960
plain and simple

118
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,000
we're putting all of our attention on terrorism

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,020
And the Chinese Communist Party has been running
rampant

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,470
until I'd say until very recently

121
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,040
So while the war on terror was happening

122
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,720
that essentially left China unchecked

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,350
the communist party of china unchecked

124
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,871
to develop this program

125
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:35,030
they're costing us trillions of dollars and
actually making this country less safe

126
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,190
that's right unfortunately

127
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,340
not only that but also the Chinese Communist
Party

128
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,090
you know even provides weapons to these organizations

129
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,900
if you look at a lot of the countries that
have terrorists problems

130
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,410
I mean a lot of the weapons come from China

131
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,500
you know it's like the Chinese Communist Party's
keeping us busy with one hand

132
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,270
and then stealing - stealing from our pockets
with the other hand

133
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,690
the implications of this are really terrifying
actually

134
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,840
and so this is something that as a country

135
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,690
I believe we need to start taking more seriously

136
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,340
this is just the tip of the iceberg

137
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,130
in fact the Chinese Communist Party has developed

138
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,680
a complex and very profitable system for stealing
American technology

139
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,140
and then using it against us in its quest
to be a world superpower

140
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,620
and it's costing american taxpayers and businesses

141
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,280
trillions of dollars a year

142
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,660
if you'd like me to talk more with Joshua
Philipp about this in a future episode

143
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,840

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,850
see you next time
