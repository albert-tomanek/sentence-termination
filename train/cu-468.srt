1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,400
Criticizing China...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,400
On a US TV Show?!

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,860
That’s not okay.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,270
CBS has self-censored

5
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,040
because of China.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,270
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,380
Shocking news!

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,380
Actually, no.

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,380
It’s pretty typical—

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,820
a giant US corporation self-censoring

12
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,589
because of business interests in China.

13
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,320
This time it’s CBS.

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,369
CBS All Access is a streaming app like Netflix

15
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,320
that lets you watch your favorite CBS shows
on demand.

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,160
There are even some CBS shows

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,720
that are only broadcast on the app,

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,190
like Star Trek Discovery,

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,720
and The Good Fight.

20
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,290
But it turns out CBS All Access

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,940
isn’t quite “all access” after all.

22
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,140
On the May 2nd episode of The Good Fight,

23
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,190
basically a legal drama,

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,980
this flashed on the screen for 8 seconds.

25
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,710
Because this happened right after a conversation

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,740
about censorship on the show,

27
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,790
many viewers thought it was a joke.

28
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,370
But no, it was not a joke.

29
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,820
There was an entire section of the episode

30
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,390
that was actually censored.

31
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,390
What was so controversial that CBS execs

32
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,990
felt they had to force The Good Fight producers

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,060
to put up that embarrassing and slightly confusing
text?

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,360
Could it be, perhaps,

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,250
this scene featuring a Uighur woman talking
about

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,670
the Chinese regime’s human rights abuses?

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,500
“One million of us are being confined in
what

38
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,770
the Chinese term ‘reeducation camps.’”

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,670
“And what does ‘reeducation’ refer to?”

40
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,800
“Changing our religious beliefs.

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,820
We are ordered to sing hymns praising the
Community Party,

42
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,550
and write self-criticism essays.”

43
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,200
Wow, that’s pretty sensitive!

44
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,180
But that’s not the part that was censored.

45
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,220
See, then she started talking about Chumhum—

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,450
which is The Good Fight’s stand-in for Google.

47
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,330
“I tried to warn others.

48
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,900
I used Chumhum to announce that authorities

49
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,960
were coming to arrest dissidents,

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,920
religious activists.

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,270
But Chumhum was cooperating with the Chinese
government.”

52
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,330
But that wasn’t the part that was censored,
either.

53
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,140
It turns out, I can’t show you the part
that was censored.

54
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,649
Because it’s so politically sensitive

55
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,890
that there doesn’t seem to be a version
of it anywhere online.

56
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,280
See, the Good Fight often has short,

57
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,359
animated songs in the middle of episodes.

58
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,310
And these shorts cover loads of controversial
topics.

59
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,239
For instance, Pepe the Frog.

60
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,280
“And then tada, a cartoon nazi frog.”

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,769
They even had one about impeaching President
Trump.

62
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,420
“Your tiny hands will scratch and claw,

63
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,040
but nobody’s above the law.”

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,959
Now CBS had no problem with that stuff.

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,110
But the animated short in this episode went
too far.

66
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,819
Here’s the lead up to it.

67
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,290
And again, they’re talking about Chumhum,

68
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,840
which is basically the in-show version of
Google.

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,659
“It’s an exploratory program.

70
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,640
It's a customized version of our search engine

71
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,299
that we're developing for China.”

72
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:01,280
“Wait, customized?

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,670
As in it allows China to censor content?!”

74
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,900
“We don't like to call it ‘censoring.’

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,680
It just obeys the laws of the land.”

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,579
“So you did manipulate your algorithm?”

77
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,349
“It’s the Chinese market.

78
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,409
You need to toe the line

79
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:18,749
or you get frozen out of the market.”

80
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:21,349
And *that’s* where the censorship happens.

81
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:23,019
So what was so sensitive?

82
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,919
Well, according to the songwriter, John Coulton,

83
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,129
the animated short had a song that mentioned

84
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:30,219
some of the *specific* things

85
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,209
the Chinese regime is censoring:

86
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,249
“Falun Gong, a spiritual movement

87
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:36,609
that is repressed by the Chinese government;

88
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:37,609
Tiananmen Square,

89
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:39,670
a reference to the violent crackdown

90
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,739
on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989;

91
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,499
[and] Winnie-the-Pooh

92
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:46,329
to whom China’s president, Xi Jinping,

93
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,760
is often compared.”

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,579
So I guess CBS is saying that you can show
Pepe the Frog,

95
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,340
but you can’t show Winnie the Pooh.

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,859
I think I have a solution for that: Pepe-the-Pooh.

97
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:56,859
You’re welcome.

98
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:02,199
The censored animated short also apparently
described

99
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,879
“the way that media companies censor content,

100
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,150
with animations of movie scenes being snipped
out of film strips.”

101
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,430
And it criticizes Western companies

102
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,500
for self-censoring in China out of greed.

103
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,269
In fact, the song ended with the line,

104
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,250
“I hope this song is banned in China.”

105
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,959
Is that ironic?

106
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,069
Not really.

107
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,919
It would be if it had been banned in China.

108
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,300
But no, it’s a tragedy,

109
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,780
because CBS banned it in America.

110
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,120
CBS All Access,

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,970
which from now on I’m going to call CBS
Some Access, said,

112
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,389
“We had concerns with some subject matter

113
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,590
in the episode’s animated short.

114
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,970
This is the creative solution

115
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,620
that we agreed upon with the producers.”

116
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,620
Apparently the producers threatened to quit,

117
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,590
but agreed to stay on if they could run

118
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,030
“CBS has censored this content.”

119
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,580
The Good Fight is a spin off of an older CBS
show

120
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,199
called The Good Wife.

121
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,810
That show had been banned in China,

122
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,160
because it showed a Chinese dissident

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,139
being tortured in China.

124
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,790
Clearly “CBS Some Access” learned its
lesson!

125
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,340
Or maybe it’s just because a few years ago,

126
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,419
CBS signed a major streaming deal in China.

127
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,069
And as The Good Fight puts it,

128
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,770
“It’s the Chinese market.

129
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,830
You need to toe the line

130
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,930
or you get frozen out of the market.”

131
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,460
Now, while this may be shocking,

132
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,560
it isn’t really new.

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,449
As the censored animated short presumably
points out,

134
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,500
Hollywood has been censoring their content

135
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,129
to get into the Chinese market for years.

136
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,759
What’s different about this case is that

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,379
the public actually found out about it—

138
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,479
because the show producers drew attention
to it.

139
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,240
Is CBS going to suffer any blowback

140
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,789
for their decision to censor The Good Fight?

141
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,110
If they don’t,

142
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,360
it will just encourage media companies

143
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,300
to keep doing this in the future.

144
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,860
I’d also like to point out that it would
be a real shame

145
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,289
if someone leaked that censored short on the
Internet,

146
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,979
where it could go viral.

147
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:57,979
By the way,

148
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,250
CBS’s reaction is also why you won’t see
China Uncensored

149
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,349
on any of the major American TV networks.

150
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:05,450
And on that note,

151
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,139
may I remind you that China Uncensored

152
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,449
only exists because of support from viewers
like you

153
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,879
on the crowd-funding website Patreon?

154
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,169
For as little as a dollar per episode,

155
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,289
not only will you help keep China Uncensored
alive,

156
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,139
not only will you get some cool perks

157
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:24,340
which you can find out about on pateron.com/chinauncensored,

158
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,539
as a way of saying thanks,

159
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,789
I’ll answer your questions on the show.

160
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,230
Today’s question comes from...

161
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,310
Joel Neatrour,

162
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,479
“Hey Chris: how will China reconcile its
suppression / oppression

163
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,979
of Chinese Uyghurs diplomatically with Saudi
Arabia and Iran?

164
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,880
Surely that is, or will become,

165
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,710
a bone of contention in the budding relationship

166
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,169
between the CCP and key players in the Middle
East.”

167
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:51,599
That’s a question a lot of people have been
asking.

168
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,990
The Chinese Communist Party is brutally oppressing

169
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,389
the mostly Muslim ethnic Uighur population
in China’s Xinjiang.

170
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,550
Including most likely killing them for their
organs.

171
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,419
But there’s been hardly any complaints

172
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,789
from any of the predominantly Muslim Middle
Eastern countries.

173
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:07,789
Why?

174
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,250
Well, I can’t say for sure.

175
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,139
But China has been investing heavily in the
region.

176
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,540
After a recent 28 billion dollar deal with
China,

177
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,979
the Saudi Crown Prince did bring up the Uighurs,
saying

178
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,139
“China has the right to carry out anti-terrorism

179
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,449
and de-extremisation work for its national
security.”

180
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,639
In fact so far,

181
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
only Turkey has brought up the plight of the
Uighurs.

182
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,419
And barely, at that.

183
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,419
So I really have to wonder

184
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,780
if China’s treatment of Muslims in China

185
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,560
really is that big of a concern

186
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,840
for countries in the Middle East.

187
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,389
Thanks for your question Joel.

188
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,259

197
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,370

on the China Unscripted Podcast!
