00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,409
Hello and welcome to this special episode
of China Uncensored.

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:05,110
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,050
And I'm your producer, Matt Gnaizda.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,559
Chris, Have you ever wondered what the future
will be like?

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,789
We live in the future, Matt.
No, I mean the future. With hoverboards.

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:22,970
“He’s on a hoverboard!”
Actually, hoverboards have already been invented.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,680
This is a real video from last year of Tony
Hawk riding a hoverboard made by the company

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,460
Hendo. But the downside is that it only works
on a special copper-plated surface.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,570
And not, say, on water.
Not unless you've got power! But if you've

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,100
watched the 1989 movie Back to the Future
Part II—and surely you have—you know what

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,289
the real future looks like.
"We're descending toward Hill Valley, California

12
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:59,829
at 4:29pm on Wednesday, October 21st, 2015."
"2015? You mean we're in the future!?"

13
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,640
Wow. We are living in the future.
Yep. And that's why today we're going to look

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,030
at the top 10 things Back to the Future Part
II got right.

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,430
Number 10: TV screens everywhere
Given that this is what a brand new Magnavox

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:21,369
TV looked like in 1985, it's amazing that
Back to the Future was so on the spot with

17
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,490
this.
“Channels 18, 24, 63…”

18
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,619
Giant flat-panel TVs. Hundreds of channels.
Even a wide-screen aspect ratio. Wow.

19
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:38,640
Number 9: 80s Nostalgia
So Marty McFly goes into the Cafe 80s. And

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
in 2015, the 80s are back. People love the
80s.

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,229
Well, the 80s did produce some of the greatest
hosts on YouTube.

22
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,719
Yeah, anyway, once again we have jeans jackets.
Puffy vests. Goofy sweaters. Thanks, Katy

23
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,350
Perry.
“Last Friday night”

24
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,979
Number 8: Restaurants without waiters
Did you notice that there are no waiters in

25
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,320
the Cafe 80s?
Yea, McFly orders a Pepsi from a TV screen.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,530
And today we actually have that in a lot of
restaurants. Like Chili’s—they have those

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,099
table-top tablets.
It would be more fun to make President Reagan

28
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,800
bring you a drinkm though.
Yeah, but then you have to interact with other

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,300
humans. Which kind of defeats the whole purpose.
Number 7: Hands-free video games

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,769
You know that part where the kids say:
"You mean you have to use your hands?"

31
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:33,790
"That's like a baby's toy!"
Well, now we actually have things like the

32
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,980
Xbox Kinect and the Wii.
Yeah, only babies use their hands for stuff.

33
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,970
Number 6: Machines you talk to
“Hydrate level four, please.”

34
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,239
"Hey Siri, do you like to talk with me?"
"I'd rather not say, Matt."

35
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:03,519
Number 5: Wearable technology
Wow, that looks surprisingly like Oculus Rift.

36
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,019
But you know what makes this really accurate?
People paying more attention to their technology

37
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:13,629
than their loved ones around the table.
Wait, what? Did you say something?

38
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:19,540
Number 4
“Wait a minute. Cubs win World Series—against

39
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:26,040
Miami?”
Amazingly, it is actually possible for the

40
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,750
Cubs to win the World Series this year.
For the first time in a century.

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,129
But...the movie got the dates wrong. So as
of this recording, we still don't know whether

42
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,150
the Cubs will win.
But you know what they did get right? There's

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,709
a team from Miami.
Yeah, Florida didn't even have a baseball

44
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,470
team until two years after this movie was
made. And they weren't called the "Miami"

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,299
Marlins until 2011.
Number 3: Surf Vietnam

46
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,709
You might have missed it the first time, but
Doc and McFly are actually standing in front

47
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:03,569
of an advertisement that says "Surf Vietnam."
In 1989, Vietnam was not exactly a place where

48
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:11,719
you'd want to go on vacation.
But now, well...Surf City.

49
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,870
Number 2: Drone Reporters
Chris, remember when you used to be a reporter?

50
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,419
Yes, I was replaced by a drone.
Well in 2015, a lot of people are using flying

51
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:26,150
drones like this to take pictures and footage.
And even though it's technically against FAA

52
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,190
regulations for media companies do it, it's
being done anyway.

53
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,940
Well the most accurate part here is that human
reporters are being replaced by machines.

54
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,949
And Number 1
Hey, what’s Doc Brown looking through?

55
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:45,669
Why, it sure looks like an iPhone to me.
Boom.

56
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,930
Considering this movie was made almost 30
years ago, they actually got a lot of things

57
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,220
right.
But you know, they didn't get everything right.

58
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,630
And that's why you should check out our other
video, "10 Things Back to the Future Part

59
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,930
II Got Wrong."

60
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,030
Back to the Future predicted the future traveling
30 years ahead from 1985. So your prediction

61
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,470
for 2045?
Everyone in the world will be able to speak Chinese.

62
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,800
Totally.
