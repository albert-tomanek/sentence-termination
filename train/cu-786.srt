00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,110
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,340
Trade War, huh!

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,340
Good God.

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,780
What is it good for?

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,620
Well it’s actually complicated…

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,100
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,780
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,720
My favorite topic—

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,720
War!

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,590
It makes great headlines and is good for views.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,320
Except when it’s a trade war.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,630
Then, eyes kind of start to gloss over.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,880
Even mine.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,340
But—what’s happening right now

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,160
between the United States and China

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,750
is actually super interesting.

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,890
Because President Donald Trump has done something

18
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,460
truly unusual for a US president—

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,960
at least when it comes to China.

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,690
He’s kept a campaign promise.

21
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,790
Here he is two years ago

22
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,960
at the 2016 Republican National Convention.

23
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,300
Our horrible trade agreements with China and
many others,

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,440
will be totally renegotiated…

25
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,040
We are going to enforce all trade violations,

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,960
against any country that cheats.

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,740
And here he is last week.

28
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:14,540
"China has been taking advantage of the United
States

29
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,540
for many years.

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,789
Really, if you look at it since the start
of the World Trade Organization

31
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:28,700
and they have really done a number in this
country.”

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Weird.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,040
It’s the same message.

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,259
And over the past year,

35
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,200
it seems Trump has actually been taking the
Chinese government to task.

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,020
On trade issues, at least.

37
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,859
In August 2017, he launched two probes

38
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,409
into unfair trade practices

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,259
by China and other countries

40
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:48,609
in the steel and aluminum industries.

41
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,770
Then in January this year,

42
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,840
he imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing
machines.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,639
Which is basically a tariff on China,

44
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:58,079
since China makes so many of them.

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,270
And then in March, President Trump followed
through

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,880
with tariffs on steel and aluminum.

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,090
And some began to worry about a trade war.

48
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,860
The Chinese Communist Party certainly wasn’t
happy.

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,260
“...we will not hesitate to immediately
make

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,150
a fierce counter strike.

51
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,720
We are not ruling out any options for retaliation.”

52
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,040
Are...hugs an option?

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,670
Because I’m ready to export!

54
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,739
Wait...What’s that Shelley?

55
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,380
China has a 25% tariff on hug imports!

56
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,170
Forget that.

57
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,980
So the question is, as in any war…

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,359
are we all going to die?!

59
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,659
Doesn’t China own tons of US debt?!

60
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,900
There’s almost a 400 billion dollar trade
deficit,

61
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,260
stocks have been up and down,

62
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,430
and China makes most of the world’s umbrellas.

63
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,430
If it rains in New York,

64
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,050
am I going to get wet?!

65
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,050
Yes.

66
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,319
We will all get a little wet.

67
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,519
Here’s what happened next.

68
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,390
The Chinese government put their own tariffs

69
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,790
on $3 billion dollars worth of US imports.

70
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,930
Trump responded by threatening more tariffs

71
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,040
on another $50 billion in Chinese goods.

72
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,049
Then China did the same.

73
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:09,519
And now Trump has called for the biggest tariffs
yet—

74
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,090
on $100 billion dollars worth of Chinese imports.

75
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,620
And then Xi Jinping said that when Trump’s
momma

76
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,359
sits around the house,

77
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,800
she sits around the house.

78
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,769
And then Trump released a diss track called

79
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,909
“No More Chocolate Cake for You.”

80
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:25,909
The point is,

81
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,130
a lot of what’s going on right now is trash
talk.

82
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,959
Both sides are trying to raise the stakes

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,709
to see who backs down first.

84
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,129
But should the US put tariffs on Chinese goods?

85
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,939
Well, that’s something the US Commerce Department

86
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,879
had actually recommended back in February.

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,219
So Trump imposed those tariffs.

88
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,230
And then a miracle happened:

89
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,750
Democrats agreed with Trump.

90
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,599
Like Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer.

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,099
“I don’t agree with President Trump on
a whole lot,

92
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,950
but today, I want to give him a big pat on
the back.

93
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:05,329
He is doing the right thing when it comes
to China.”

94
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,150
Even Senator Elizabeth Warren supports the
tariffs.

95
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,739
“And, I have to say, when President Trump

96
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,639
says he’s putting tariffs on the table,

97
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,170
I think tariffs are one part

98
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,569
of reworking our trade policy overall.”

99
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,530
And perhaps most surprising of all,

100
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,020
“fake news” CNN is willing to give tariffs
a shot.

101
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,500
“Let’s be honest,

102
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,870
on one big fundamental point,

103
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,090
Donald Trump is right.

104
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,960
China is a trade cheat.”

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
How heartwarming.

106
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,180
No matter how deep our political divisions,

107
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,370
we can still be united by the fact that

108
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,630
the Chinese Communist Party is a dirty cheater.

109
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,360
That doesn’t mean the tariffs are perfect

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,570
or have everyone’s support.

111
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,840
The Chinese Communist Party may be cheating,

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,919
but imposing tariffs is only a partial solution

113
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,530
to some of the bigger trade problems.

114
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,880
And in the short term,

115
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,680
tariffs make things more expensive,

116
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,940
so that could also hurt US consumers.

117
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,930
That being said, the Chinese Communist Party

118
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,970
has refused to play by the rules

119
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,139
of the World Trade Organization—

120
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,840
so tariffs may be the best available option.

121
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,090
Tariffs are like ordering a salad at McDonald’s.

122
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,150
It’s not what you really want,

123
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,990
but it’s a less unhealthy option than everything
else.

124
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,860
China joined the World Trade Organization
in 2001,

125
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,949
thanks partly to lobbying by former presidents

126
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,620
Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

127
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,530
They wanted to give US businesses

128
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,509
access to the China market.

129
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:29,940
And in particular,

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,270
President Clinton pitched the idea that

131
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,610
if China’s economy opens up,

132
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,139
it would force the government to make political
reforms.

133
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:38,250
Well, that definitely worked.

134
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,380
Or not.

135
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,720
And while US businesses have gotten access

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,180
to the Chinese market,

137
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,560
many of them are getting their intellectual
property

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,220
stolen by their Chinese joint venture partners.

139
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,330
And according to this report

140
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,840
from the United States Trade Representative…

141
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,380
when it comes to exports,

142
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,150
the Chinese government has been subsidizing
local manufacturers,

143
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,150
like steel and aluminum factories—

144
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,110
and that’s allowed it to dump goods on the
US market

145
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,120
at unfairly low prices.

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,629
Chinese leaders have repeatedly failed to
follow through

147
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,409
with commitments to facilitate free trade...

148
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,770
...and the Chinese Communist Party has been

149
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,330
increasingly creating an unfair environment
for foreign companies.

150
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,030
The problem is, when China entered the WTO,

151
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,320
the Chinese Communist Party knew that Western
companies

152
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,229
were desperate to access over a billion potential
customers in China.

153
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,919
So desperate, that the Party could cheat and
get away with it.

154
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,020
It’s like when you’re the only kid your
neighborhood with a Nintendo Switch.

155
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,320
They’re coming over to play no matter how
much of a jerk you are.

156
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,090
If a trade war does start,

157
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,930
it might hurt the US in the short term.

158
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,860
For example, US consumers would face rising
prices.

159
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,250
But in a trade war, the country that’s a
net exporter

160
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,240
has the most to lose.

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,760
And that’s China.

162
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,090
As the New York Times says,

163
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,500
“Exports account for a big share of Chinese
economic growth.

164
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,729
Because the United States buys so much from
China,

165
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,050
Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese
manufacturers.”

166
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,960
The Chinese Communist Party depends on a stable
economy

167
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,870
to justify its rule,

168
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,530
and the economy is already struggling with
bad debt,

169
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,650
capital flight, and corruption,

170
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,440
just to name a few of the problems.

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,550
So if there was a trade war,

172
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,120
China would be hurt more than the US.

173
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,039
But will there be a trade war?

174
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,080
That’s not clear yet.

175
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,090
Like I said earlier,

176
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,689
right now it’s still mostly trash talk.

177
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,479
And trash talk is, of course,

178
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,250
Trump’s original superpower.

179
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,860
Which has confused the heck out of Chinese
leaders.

180
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,520
According to this article,top-level Chinese
officials

181
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,800
are desperately asking American experts

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,860
whether Trump is serious or just bluffing.

183
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,210
Well, maybe those Chinese officials

184
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,659
need to watch China Uncensored.

185
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,860
Because we predicted this last year,

186
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,930
right after Trump took office.

187
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,770
Click the link below to check out our episode

188
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,419
“Who would win a US-China Trade War?”

189
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,259
But it’s not just Trump’s trash talk

190
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:09,129
that’s throwing Chinese officials for a
loop.

191
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,969
Last week Trump suggested that maybe

192
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,540
America should consider rejoining the TPP
trade deal—

193
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,490
which he had rejected last year as a bad deal.

194
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,300
But it is good as a way to put pressure on
China.

195
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,240
And there are signs that the Chinese Communist
Party

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
could be caving to the pressure.

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,840
Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently made a
speech

198
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,740
pledging to open up the Chinese economy and
cut tariffs.

199
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,900
Although Xi’s speech was also pretty similar

200
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,270
to one he made last year, so it’s unclear

201
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,070
whether it means the Chinese Communist Party

202
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,940
will actually make any changes.

203
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,070
It could just be more talk.

204
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,510
Of course China’s foreign ministry wants
you to know

205
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,320
that if there are changes,

206
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,550
pressure has nothing to do with it.

207
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,550


208
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,150
"I can definitely tell you that China’s
announcement

209
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,940
of the significant initiatives on further
opening up

210
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,750
is not related to the current economic and
trade conflicts

211
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,100
between China and the United States.”

212
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,560
Absolutely not.

213
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,070
It’s probably because Donald Trump and Xi
Jinping

214
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,680
are such great friends.

215
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,850
Like Pooh Bear and Tigger.

216
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,570
I know they said Obama was Tigger.

217
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,530
But really, Trump is the right color.

218
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,950
So what do you think of Trump’s tariffs
on China

219
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,670
and the possibility of a trade war?

221
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,710
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

222
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,270
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

223
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,580
see you next time.

224
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,220
For years,

225
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,630
Western business have put up with

226
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,960
a lot of sketchy things

227
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,940
in order to gain access to the China market.

228
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,030
That includes never advertising with, say,

229
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,410
YouTubers critical of the Chinese Communist
Party.

230
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,870
That’s why China Uncensored relies on financial
support

231
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,730
from viewers like you.
