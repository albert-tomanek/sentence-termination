1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:03,639
For China to repress Uighurs

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,270
And build illegal military bases in the South
China Sea

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,760
It takes technology.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,620
And American satellite companies are helping.

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,120
This is China Uncensored,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,740
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,720
Boy, was I depressed a few weeks ago

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,199
when I found out Microsoft

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,720
has been working with Chinese military universities

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,199
to create artificial intelligence technology

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,980
that the Chinese regime may be using to repress
its citizens.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,229
Then I found out Google was doing pretty much
the same thing.

13
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,799
And I was like, okay,

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,289
now I’m really depressed.

15
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,479
And then the episode I made about that

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,480
was demonetized by YouTube,

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,280
which is owned by Google.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,119
And that was when I hit rock bottom.

19
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,789
At least that’s what I thought.

20
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,789
But it turns out,

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,530
I had discovered a rock bottomless pit.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,920
Because guess what?

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,089
It gets so much worse.

24
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,780
Have you ever taken the time to think about

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,329
how Chinese authorities communicate

26
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,200
with their military and police about things
like,

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,159
who to repress next?

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,700
Let’s be honest,

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,950
you’re not thinking about

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,570
how Chinese authorities communicate.

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,049
You’re probably spending more time wondering
about

32
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,299
if you should get fries on the side with that
burger.

33
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,299
Let me help you,

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,950
the answer is: Get a side of pizza.

35
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,450
Then get fries on top of *that.*

36
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,340
But to operate a system of mass surveillance,

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,670
with AI facial recognition and real time GPS
mapping,

38
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,130
that requires transmitting a lot of data.

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,940
And the best way to transmit data

40
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,799
to and from remote locations is a satellite.

41
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,319
But when it comes to satellite technology,

42
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,520
Chinese satellites are way behind.

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,159
See, the China Academy of Space Technology
satellite

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,229
can only achieve speeds of 20 gigabytes per
second.

45
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,350
But an American-made SSL satellite

46
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,189
can transmit 220 gigabytes a second.

47
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,201
And a Boeing satellite can reach 260 gigabytes
a second.

48
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,590
USA number one!

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,450
And China’s complex surveillance systems

50
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,280
just need those faster speeds!

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,110
And the solution is simple.

52
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,239
They just use the Americans satellites.

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,560
But, you say, is that even legal?

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,760
Well, it’s *not* legal for US companies

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,220
to sell satellites to China.

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,530
But here’s the thing: American satellite
companies

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,160
like Boeing and SSL love money.

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,959
And China has a lot of money.

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,730
And when lots of money is involved,

60
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,159
there’s always a loophole.

61
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,460
And this Wall Street Journal report uncovered
it.

62
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,319
It shows the horrifying way China exploits
US satellites

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,840
to strengthen its police and military power.

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,360
You know those fake islands China

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,530
built in the South China Sea?

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,640
The ones that now have military bases

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,610
and missile launchers on them?

68
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,310
They’re getting internet thanks to

69
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,459
a fleet of US made satellites.

70
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,330
The mass surveillance driving a brutal crackdown

71
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,290
of ethnic Uighurs Muslims in China’s Xinjiang?

72
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,850
Thanks to more US satellites.

73
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,250
Even the broadcast of state-run media propaganda

74
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,810
is being carried on US made satellites.

75
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,260
In fact, a new satellite being built by Boeing

76
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,349
could even help the Chinese regime

77
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:33,680
replace the US made GPS system.

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,379
And it could also improve the People’s Liberation
Army’s

79
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,470
missile guidance systems.

80
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,470
Now again,

81
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,000
that seems like it should be totally against
the law

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,470
for US companies to sell satellites to China

83
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,620
for all that stuff, right?

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,690
And again, it is.

85
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,280
But that’s where the loophole comes in.

86
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,650
Once the satellite is in space,

87
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,590
there are no regulations on how

88
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,590
the bandwidth of that satellite is used.

89
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,040
And that “has allowed China to essentially

90
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,739
rent the capacity of U.S.-built satellites

91
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,940
it wouldn’t be allowed to buy.”

92
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,819
Why own, when you can rent?

93
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,680
Especially when owning is illegal.

94
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,379
Don’t worry, because all of the companies

95
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,230
mentioned in the Wall Street Journal Article—

96
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,030
Boeing, SSL, and the Carlyle Group—

97
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,100
said they absolutely comply with all US laws.

98
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,580
And they do.

99
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,790
Technically.

100
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,890
See China doesn’t own the satellites.

101
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,720
They just own a big share in the company

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,670
that owns the satellites.

103
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,770
And then China rents bandwidth from those
satellites.

104
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,120
Here’s how it works.

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,340
There’s a company called Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co.,

106
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,700
aka AsiaSat.

107
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,290
It’s based in Hong Kong.

108
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,110
And Hong Kong isn’t China.

109
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,110
Well it is,

110
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,580
but apparently not the part of China

111
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,750
that’s affected by US export controls.

112
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,380
That was clever!

113
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,940
So the Hong Kong company, AsiaSat,

114
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,110
buys satellites from a US company,

115
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,480
like Boeing or SSL.

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,720
Now that order has to be approved by the US
government

117
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,970
to make sure no one’s violating US laws
on satellite export.

118
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,700
And to help the US government understand

119
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,720
how everything is totally legit,

120
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,110
the Carlyle Group,

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,140
one of the US’s biggest private equity firms,

122
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,000
that owns a big chunk of AsiaSat—

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,470
they send a compliance report to the US government.

124
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,660
And the US government reads that report and
says,

125
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,180
“oh, AsiaSat is a *Hong Kong* company.

126
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,220
That’s ok!”

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,090
And they approve the deal.

128
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,820
But here’s the twist.

129
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,430
Another big chunk of AsiaSat is owned by the
CITIC Group.

130
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,820
Which is owned by the Chinese government.

131
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Is that a problem?

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,800
Well, I’m sure if it was,

133
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,940
the managing director of the Carlyle Group,

134
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,660
who also happens to be the Chairman of AsiaSat,

135
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,510
would have said something to the US government

136
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,520
to blow up that incredibly lucrative deal.

137
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,100
So Chinese state-owned CITIC

138
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,270
then goes on to sell bandwidth

139
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,410
from those American made satellites to Chinese
entities.

140
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,820
For example, state-run propaganda broadcasters,

141
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,740
soldiers in the South China Sea, or police
in Xinjiang.

142
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,920
Now obviously, Boeing or SSL,

143
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,110
even AsiaSat claim they never specifically
intended

144
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,300
for their technology to be used by China’s

145
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,820
Ministry of Public Security and the police.

146
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,490
Which I believe.

147
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,830
Even though China’s Ministry of Public Security

148
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,370
has specifically said that’s how they were
using it.

149
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,340
I mean, how could these poor US companies

150
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,660
and AsiaSat executives know that a major owner
of AsiaSat

151
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,710
was a conglomerate owned by the Chinese government,

152
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,260
that had specifically bragged about how

153
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,840
“AsiaSat’s satellites helped ensure communications
for authorities

154
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,950
as they quelled anti government protests and
riots

155
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,300
in Tibet and in Xinjiang.”?

156
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,440
And how could they know that their data feeds,

157
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,400
which provide internet coverage to the South
China Sea,

158
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,390
would be used to provide internet coverage
to...

159
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,480
the South China Sea?

160
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,100
Where China is building all those military
bases.

161
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,120
Look, that stuff’s complicated.

162
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,060
It’s not like rocket science.

163
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,570
A spokesperson for the Carlyle Group

164
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,910
told the Wall Street Journal that

165
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,530
“AsiaSat, because of privacy issues,

166
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,440
doesn’t monitor or regulate the content
that flows through it,”

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,660
so obviously there’s no way anyone at AsiaSat

168
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,360
could have known what the Chinese military
was up to.

169
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,490
Of course AsiaSat does draw the line somewhere.

170
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,490
For instance,

171
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,460
all that stuff I mentioned about the Chinese
military and police—

172
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,970
that’s okay.

173
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,530
But AsiaSat did drop Radio Free Asia and Voice
of America.

174
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,910
I mean, those are funded by the US government

175
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,540
and broadcast sensitive news into China

176
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,610
that the Chinese Communist Party would much
rather

177
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,000
Chinese people don’t know about.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,950
Clearly the greater of two evils.

179
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,210
And none of this is new.

180
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,010
It’s has been going on for years.

181
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,010
And actually,

182
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,560
the US government *has* known about it.

183
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,210
Previous administrations just thought the
profits

184
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,040
would help American satellite companies

185
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,320
reinvest in development.

186
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,340
Or give the US insight into China’s space
capabilities.

187
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,570
Or that China would use these US satellites

188
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,000
for benign purposes—

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,040
such as broadcasting sports.

190
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,210
Yes, sports.

191
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,350
Like target practice.

192
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,670
More people in the US government

193
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,860
really need to watch China Uncensored.

194
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,390
But seriously, according to Boeing,

195
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,240
“The State and Commerce departments

196
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,390
over four administrations—

197
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,180
and most recently in 2017—

198
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,389
have reviewed and approved export licenses

199
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,879
for the AsiaSat satellite constellation

200
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:42,240
to provide commercial bandwidth services

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,610
to the Asia region, including China.”

202
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,510
4 administrations?!

203
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,510
Thanks Obama.

204
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,510
And Trump.

205
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,510
And Bush.

206
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,510
And Clinton.

207
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,220
Wow, I never thought I’d be able to use
them all

208
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,259
in the same sentence in that way before.

209
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,100
But again, the problem is that the government

210
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,490
only regulates satellite exports,

211
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,149
not satellite bandwidth usage.

212
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,220
And that’s the loophole

213
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,029
that’s allowed the Chinese Communist Party

214
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,920
to use the best American technology

215
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,360
to repress the Chinese people.

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,310
There might be some hope though.

217
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,760
When the Wall Street Journal reached out

218
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,769
to the Commerce Department for comment,

219
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,050
a spokesman said it “regularly updates its
regulations

220
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,600
to counter evolving national security threats,”

221
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,850
and it considered human rights part of that.

222
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,970
And the State Department said,

223
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,290
it “strongly urges companies to implement

224
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,639
stringent safeguards to ensure that their
commercial activities

225
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,519
do not contribute to China’s human-rights
abuses.”

226
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,550
So maybe this loophole will close.

227
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,439
Especially if you write to your representatives

228
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,350
and tell them what you think.

229
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,589
But at the end of the day,

230
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,340
the fundamental problem isn’t that

231
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,839
there’s not enough government regulation.

232
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,660
It’s that private companies,

233
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,129
like Microsoft, Google, Boeing, Carlyle Group,
and SSL,

234
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,089
put profit above human rights.

235
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,089
At least Boeing,

236
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,930
in response to questions from the Wall Street
Journal,

237
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,819
“said it has put on hold

238
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,509
its latest satellite deal involving China,

239
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,629
the one that would bolster the Chinese rival
to GPS.”

240
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,420
So what do you think?

241
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,040
Are you depressed too?

242
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,200
I recommend french fry covered pizza.

243
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,339
But you know what always cheers me up?

244
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:20,399
Answering a question from

245
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,460
a member of the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army!

246
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,959
Those are fans of the show who support it

247
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,629
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

248
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,779
Largezo asks,

249
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,569
“If the US and PRC went to war

250
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:33,529
would you guys run out of jokes?”

251
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,510
Well, as much as I’d hate for war to happen,

252
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,240
if anything I think it would just give me

253
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,819
more types of jokes to make.

254
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,630
I mean, that’s pretty much infinite references
to Fallout.

255
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,020
Yeah, the Daily Show did pretty well for itself

256
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,970
during the Iraq War.

257
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,439
Comedy is just tragedy plus time.

258
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:52,060
And jokes about poop.

259
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,420
Or a man getting hit in the groin by a football.

260
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,199
Just the boing and homer laughing

261
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,620
Man, that gets me everytime.

262
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,160
So yeah, lots to look forward to.

263
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,920
Thanks for you question, Largezo.

264
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,310

268
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,420
Hey, I’m not complaining.
