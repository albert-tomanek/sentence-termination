1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,990
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,610
it was a real coup.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,640
For China!

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,200
Hi, welcome back,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,719
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,980
China and Zimbabwe.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,789
Couldn’t be closer.

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,110
Just look at Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe

9
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,790
and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,840
on his 2015 trip to Zimbabwe.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,610
Now there’s a close friendship.

12
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,640
That’s why Xi Jinping said,

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,820
China is Zimbabwe’s all-weather friend.

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,360
At least that’s what Mugabe told reporters.

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,750
He also famously said that

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,570
“We have turned east,

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,140
where the sun rises,

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,180
and given our backs to the West,

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,510
where the sun sets.”

20
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,520
Mugabe was even awarded

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,580
China’s Confucius Peace Prize.

22
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,800
Yeah, Mugabe’s a pretty popular guy.

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,329
They call him the Grand Old Man of African
politics.

24
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,120
Well, at least that’s what he calls himself.

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,579
He’s 93 years old—

26
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,579
been elected president

27
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,670
for nearly 40 years in a row,

28
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,040
can you imagine!

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,850
Oh, and the military,

30
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,059
they love him!

31
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,719
Why, just last week,

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,409
the Zimbabwe military swarmed the capitol,

33
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,200
and headed to the state-run broadcaster

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
to deliver this important message:

35
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,840
"Comrade R G Mugabe and his family

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,479
are safe and sound

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,700
and their security is guaranteed.”

38
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,020
Safe and sound,

39
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,610
you see that’s just...okay,

40
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,179
that sounds a lot like the military

41
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,490
just staged a coup.

42
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,429
Clearly, this caught everyone off guard.

43
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,909
“Rumblings of a coup that could oust Mugabe

44
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,240
began just 24 hours after the head of the
army,

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,310
General Constantino Chiwenga,

46
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,619
threatened military intervention

47
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,229
to end a purge of his allies

48
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,609
from Mugabe's government.

49
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,499
"When it comes to matters

50
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,479
of protecting our revolution

51
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,070
the military will not hesitate to step in."

52
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,099
Okay, maybe...

53
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,240
no one should have been caught off guard.

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
In fact, the situation is being compared

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,789
to what happened in China almost 40 years
ago,

56
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,259
the fall of the Gang of Four.

57
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,069
During the final days of Mao Zedong’s life
in 1976,

58
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,739
four high ranking leaders,

59
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,260
including Mao’s wife,

60
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,569
were viciously vying for power.

61
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,569
They wanted to replace

62
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,769
the grand old man of Chinese politics

63
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,549
when the old man died.

64
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:22,939
Ultimately they were all purged themselves
and executed.

65
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,260
And in Zimbabwe,

66
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,519
it’s believed Mugabe’s wife Grace

67
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,180
and three others have been purging opponents

68
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,629
to seize power after Mugabe dies.

69
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:33,930
But if the Zimbabwean military

70
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,640
thinks it can just waltz right in and seize
power,

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,989
they’ve got another think coming.

72
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:39,989
Remember,

73
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,840
China is Zimbabwe’s all weather friend.

74
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,510
At least, that’s what Mugabe said.

75
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,969
I’m sure China is throwing

76
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,269
all their weight and influence behind him.

77
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,620
I mean, the Chinese government awarded him

78
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,310
that Confucius Peace Prize after all.

79
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,370
What’s that Shelley?

80
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,829
Oh Mugabe rejected it

81
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,849
because it wasn’t from the Chinese government
at all?!

82
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:06,469
Well, umm...I’m sure the CCP still went
to bat for him.

83
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:10,120
“We hope the relevant parties in Zimbabwe

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,959
appropriately handle their internal matters."

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,959
Okay, they’ve thrown Mugabe under the bus.

86
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,579
And that was just an official statement.

87
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,160
Look at how my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,280
the Global Times is handling it.

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Why look,

90
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,150
the sun is shining after a storm.

91
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,989
“We have good reasons to believe

92
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,670
that as Zimbabwe enters the post-Mugabe era,

93
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,390
China will see an improved environment

94
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,890
to cooperate with the country.”

95
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,870
Mugabe, betrayed by the east,

96
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,959
where the sun rises.

97
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,109
The CCP hasn’t thrown Mugabe under the bus.

98
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,420
They threw him under a tank.

99
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,790
Although the Chinese Communist Party does
probably

100
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,530
like all the tanks on the streets of Zimbabwe.

101
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,239
They get a sense of nostalgia.

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,390
Yeah, that really looks like Zimbabwe

103
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,970
just had a military coup.

104
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,859
Now normally this is when conspiracy theorists
the world over

105
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,370
start talking about how the CIA was really
behind it.

106
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,230
But this time,

107
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,640
it may be a Chinese knockoff.

108
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,989
As the Guardian puts it,

109
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,060
“The world may just have witnessed

110
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,310
the first example of a covert coup d’etat

111
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,760
of the kind once favoured by the CIA and Britain’s
MI6,

112
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,540
but conceived and executed with the tacit
support

113
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,950
of the 21st century’s new global superpower.”

114
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,660
That superpower—China.

115
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,200
Yes, the Chinese regime

116
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,770
didn’t just throw Mugabe under a tank.

117
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,930
They dug a pit,

118
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,850
filled it with spikes and acid,

119
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,050
threw him in

120
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,460
and then drove over it with a tank.

121
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,030
You see, two weeks before this all went down,

122
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,690
that Zimbabwean general who threatened a coup,

123
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,590
and then eventually carried it out,

124
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,170
was in China.

125
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,610
According to an international relations specialist

126
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,470
at the University of Cape Town in South Africa,

127
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,310
“It should not be too surprising if [Chiwenga]

128
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,300
wanted to ensure political changes

129
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,330
would not anger China because of

130
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,040
the close ties between the countries.”

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,960
China and Zimbabwe go way back.

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,940
The Chinese Communist Party funded

133
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,390
Mugabe’s African nationalist/Maoist guerilla
fighters

134
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,290
in the 1970s.

135
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,990
And China was one of the first countries

136
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,740
to establish diplomatic ties after Zimbabwe

137
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,650
became independent in in 1980.

138
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,310
Since the West viewed Mugabe as a despot

139
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,680
whose bad economic policies and penchant for
violence

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,220
ruined one of Africa’s most promising states,

141
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,320
Mugabe has increasingly turned to China for
support.

142
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,630
The Chinese Communist Party isn’t bothered
by leaders

143
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,250
with a penchant for violence.

144
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,460
So despite Western sanctions,

145
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,620
China became, “Zimbabwe’s biggest source
of foreign currency

146
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,550
and top trading partner,

147
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,590
having invested in more than 128 projects
in the African country

148
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,830
between 2000 and 2012.”

149
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,950
China has also repeatedly blocked sanctions

150
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,460
on Zimbabwe and Mugabe.

151
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,540
In recent years,

152
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,920
China has given Zimbabwe over

153
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,290
1 billion dollars worth of low interest loans.

154
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,460
The Chinese yuan is even an official currency
in Zimbabwe.

155
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,500
But then some problems came up.

156
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,260
According to this research paper,

157
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,850
...the Chinese regime was supporting former
vice president

158
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,190
Emmerson Mnangagwa as Mugabe’s successor.

159
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,270
In fact, “he received ideological and military
training

160
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,980
in Beijing and Nanjing in the 1960s.”

161
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,260
Except he was purged by Mugabe’s wife.

162
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,690
On top of that, over the past year, Mugabe,

163
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,600
“declared a new raft of laws

164
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,360
which put the economic rights of Zimbabweans

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,420
above those of foreign investors,

166
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,850
including China.”

167
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,690
Could the Chinese regime

168
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,460
have been getting worried about its investments
there

169
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,700
and gave some level of support to a military
coup

170
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,920
that was backing Mnangagwa?

171
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,700
Now that Mugabe has officially resigned

172
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,520
and is no longer president for life,

173
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
I guess we’ll never know for sure.

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,340
Mgnangagwa, by the way,

175
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,240
is not a good guy, either.

176
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,160
His nickname is “The Crocodile.”

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,140
He’s a former head of Zimbabwe’s secret
police,

178
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,030
and is believed to have orchestrated a massacre

179
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,240
that killed 20,000 civilians.

180
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,260
And good news.

181
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,800
The Crocodile was sworn in today

182
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,630
as Zimbabwe’s interim president.

183
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,770
Meanwhile in China,

184
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,670
scholars from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences,

185
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,680
which has some very close ties to the Communist
Party,

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,040
have been wheeled out to talk about

187
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,690
how bad a job Mugabe had been doing,

188
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,760
saying “Zimbabwe was careening off a cliff,”

189
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,752
and hinting that the next leader of Zimbabwe

190
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,080
should open the country up.

191
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,890
But you know who’s been really upset

192
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,580
by this whole thing?

193
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,460
Venezuela.

194
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,920
Another country with lots of economic deals
with China

195
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,330
that are under threat because of corruption

196
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,060
and economic turmoil.

197
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,680
I wonder if they’re getting a little nervous?

198
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,890
So did China know of or give approval

199
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,760
for the Zimbabwe coup?

200
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,140
Or are they just using it to their advantage?

201
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
Let me know what you think

202
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,690
