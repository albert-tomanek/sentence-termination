00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:02,070
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,190
welcome to the South China Sea.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,200
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,630
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,780
Ah the South China Sea.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,130
It really brings up such nostalgic memories
for me.

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,530
Like when I took a Filipino fishing boat to
the Scarborough Shoal,

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,710
disputed waters China and the Philippines
have been fighting over

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,519
in the middle of the South China Sea.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,519
As far as I’m concerned,

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,320
this territorial dispute is over!

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,600
But just two weeks after we were there,

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,350
Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,979
banned fishing within the shoal's lagoon.

15
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,069
I’m sure that was just a coincidence

16
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:45,079
and had nothing to do with the fact that we
were there.

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,989
But it’s an odd move for the Philippines,

18
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:51,059
if you consider that a recent poll showed
that 84% of Filipinos

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,429
want to challenge China’s claim to that
area.

20
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,519
Aww, they call the South China Sea the West
Philippine Sea.

21
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,199
Not much chance of that name sticking

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,149
if things go the way they’ve been going,

23
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,149
by the way.

24
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,149
A year ago,

25
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,790
the Philippines might have been in a good
position

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,659
to exercise its claim to the region.

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,659
Last July,

28
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,490
the Philippines successfully got a UN tribunal

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,770
to rule against China’s claim.

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,990
But then this man became president of the
Philippines.

31
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,490
And he pushed for closer ties with China,

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,940
at the expense of ties with the United States.

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
And to do that,

34
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,409
he had to “set aside” his country’s
claims

35
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,679
to the South China Sea.

36
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,420
And now that Duterte has had a taste of working
with China,

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,950
he wants more.

38
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,979
You see,

39
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,149
the south of the Philippines has a problem

40
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,399
with kidnappings by Islamic extremists.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,860
And so Duterte has asked for China to help patrol

42
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,390
the international waters nearby to prevent
piracy.

43
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,990
These kidnappings are a real problem.

44
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,990
But traditionally,

45
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,950
the Philippines would reach out to the United
States

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,729
for help for this sort of thing.

47
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,770
But, oh but there’s been a sea change.

48
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,060
Or should I say, Xi change?

49
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,159
Don't do it, Duterte!

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,130
You're playing right into their hands!

51
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,739
So far, the whole world has freaked out

52
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,330
about the Chinese regime's aggressive expansion

53
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,510
in the South China Sea.

54
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,599
Now the Chinese Communist Party always says,

55
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,819
“hey, we’re building all those artificial
islands and stuff

56
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,390
for purely peaceful purposes.”

57
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,790
Which is really convincing.

58
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,170
But if the President of the Philippines asks
for Chinese protection

59
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,870
in the South China Sea,

60
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,810
that gives them a great excuse.

61
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,709
“Look, we’re helping keep sailors safe!

62
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,540
If anything there should be more Chinese military

63
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,069
and coast guard vessels in the South China
Sea.”

64
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,099
Duterte said he only asked China to patrol
international waters,

65
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,400
and not other countries' territorial waters.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,940
Oh, well in that case,

67
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,129
everything is totally fine.

68
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,129
But regardless,

69
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:55,549
Duterte's request makes China out to be the
hero.

70
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:58,720
And it legitimizes China’s claims to the
region.

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Maybe the Chinese regime

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,500
ought to start charging the rest of the surrounding
countries

73
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,230
“protection fees.”

74
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,430
Your weekly dues to us will give you all the
supplemental safety net

75
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,730
you'll ever need.

76
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,250
So what do you think of Duterte’s plea

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,660
for Chinese patrols off its coast?

78
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,720
Leave your comments below.

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,209
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

80

Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

81
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,950
