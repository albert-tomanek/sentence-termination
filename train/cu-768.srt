1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,090
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,410
the solution to being criticized

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,720
is to hang out with people worse than you!

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,820
That’s why I hang out with my producer Matt.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,720
(Matt, off screen): Hey!

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,580
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,500
Sorry, I’m just going through some old photos.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,600
I mean you probably saw their Facebook status.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,240
Malaysia just changed its relationship status
with America to

10
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:29,109
“it’s complicated.”

11
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,560
Never saw it coming.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,060
I mean,

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,340
look at at how great these two looked together!

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,860
In 2014, Obama became the first president
in nearly half a century

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,110
to visit Malaysia.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,740
That’s him and Malaysia’s Prime Minister,
Najib Razak.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,400
Najib let the US make surveillance flights
over the South China Sea

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,830
from Malaysian territory.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,900
Then the two of them spent Christmas Eve together

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,280
playing golf in Hawaii.

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,660
I mean, the countries have basically the same flag!

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,580
But then this guy came along and ruined everything.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,489
Now Najib is calling China “a true friend,”

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,010
and wants to take their relationship to “new heights.”

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,560
Najib is in China this week.

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,549
He’s already signed an agreement to buy

27
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,369
four Chinese naval vessels

28
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,840
for about 34 billion dollars.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,760
It’s Malaysia's first big defense deal with
China.

30
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,299
And frankly, a lot to spend on a first date.

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,399
More shocking,

32
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,009
Malaysia has “pledged with Beijing to

33
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:30,630
handle South China Sea disputes bilaterally.”

34
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,070
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.

35
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,600
The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brunei

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,869
have all been in long-standing territorial
disputes with China

37
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:41,070
over the South China Sea.

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,240
And Obama was the knight in shining armor,

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,289
with his mighty Pivot to Asia,

40
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,009
the hero who pledged to protect the little
guy

41
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,140
from the big red dragon.

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,880
But now,

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,529
says Prime Minister Najib,

44
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,049
one should not let “former colonial powers”

45
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,509
“lecture countries they once exploited

46
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:01,270
on how to conduct their own internal affairs.”

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Wow.

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,580
He sounds like...

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,320
"I will break up with America.

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
I would rather go to Russia and to China.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,140
First the Philippines,

52
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,150
now Malaysia.

53
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,820
It’s looking more like dominos.

54
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,880
No, the other Dominos.

55
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,450
Yeah, it looks good now,

56
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,890
but you’re gonna regret it later.

57
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,930
Because if the Philippines and now Malaysia

58
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,060
have decided to negotiate their disputes with
China bilaterally,

59
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,500
that weakens everyone’s ability to negotiate
as a bloc

60
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,920
with US muscle behind them.

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,590
So the real winner here is China.

62
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,700
Divide and conquer.

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,950
It’s the same strategy kids with divorced
parents use

64
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,130
to get more Christmas gifts.

65
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,650
Now I can’t say for sure why Malaysia or
the Philippines

66
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,830
have decided to go this route.

67
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,140
But...China is Malaysia’s biggest trading
partner.

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,620
The second biggest for the Philippines.

69
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,830
And, let’s be honest,

70
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,100
even in his awesome knight costume,

71
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
Obama hasn’t been able to accomplish much

72
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,720
when it comes to resolving the South China
Sea dispute.

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,690
But within just four months of taking office,

74
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,590
Philippines president Duterte seems to have
solved the problem...

75
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,620
at least for for Filipino fishermen.

76
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,630
Maybe Najib sees that and thinks,

77
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,630
if you give a little,

78
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,630
you’ll get a little.

79
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,720
All you have to do is give up your territorial
claims.

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Now you might think,

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,650
this route the Philippines and now Malaysia
are taking

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,430
seems a bit like giving up ownership of your
house

83
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,160
in exchange for the privilege of renting it.

84
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,650
It sounds like a lousy deal.

85
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,150
But there could also be another reason for
their

86
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,350
cozying up with China.

87
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,400
Remember how the US criticized Duterte’s
extra-judicial killings

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,080
in his war on drugs?

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,710
And then reneged on selling assault rifles
to The Philippines?

90
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,210
And then Dutere was all like...

91
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,590
"Mister Obama, you can go to hell."

92
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,290
Well, a similar thing back in July—

93
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,620
when the US sort of accused Malaysia’s prime
minister

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,940
of stealing money from his own country.

95
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,740
Long story short,

96
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,870
three-and-a-half billion dollars went missing

97
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,440
from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.

98
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,220
The US filed lawsuits to seize some of the
assets

99
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,320
the money bought.

100
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,210
The investigation is still ongoing

101
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,390
and Prime Minister Najib has not been formally
charged with anything.

102
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,910
But it did kind of put a strain US-Malaysia
relations.

103
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,600
So...China!

104
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,170
The Chinese regime won’t criticize you

105
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,870
for extrajudicial killings or corruption.

106
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,010
Obviously.

107
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,370
So if that’s your thing,

108
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,870
well,

109
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,700
I can see why you’d want to ditch the red-white-and-blue
knight

110
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,440
for the red dragon.

111
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,940
So what do you think about Malaysia's new
ties with China?

112
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,370
Leave your comments below.

113
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,240
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

115
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
