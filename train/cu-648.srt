1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,760
The US funded Chinese virus research

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,319
That may have led to the coronavirus pandemic

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:16,090
What did Dr. Fauci know?

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:30,920
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,640
Well, I don’t often say this, but Chinese
state-run media is right.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,530
For over a year, they’ve been trying to
pin the blame for the coronavirus pandemic

7
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,220
on the US.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,500
And it turns out, they could be right—at
least in this one sense.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,649
I’m sure by now you’ve heard of the Wuhan
lab leak theory.

10
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:59,149
The idea is, the coronavirus, or what I call
the CCP Virus, leaked from the Wuhan Institute

11
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,690
of Virology accidentally.

12
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:07,289
A number of people outside of polite society—including
me—have been talking about this theory for

13
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:08,909
over a year.

14
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,139
But it’s now become credible in mainstream
media.

15
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:18,789
And it turns out, the US was at least partially
funding experiments in the lab the coronavirus

16
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,909
may have leaked from.

17
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,280
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, the NIAID, which is part of the

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,389
National Institutes of Health, the NIH, was
giving research grants that were used by the

19
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:37,389
Wuhan Institute of Virology to study bat coronaviruses.

20
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:42,590
Some of that funding was also used to create
coronaviruses that were more contagious to

21
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,590
humans.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,479
That’s called gain of function research.

23
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,149
Virologists say it helps them study diseases,
to prevent future outbreaks.

24
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,450
But so far, it has not prevented future outbreaks.

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:03,239
Also, the Wuhan Institute of Virology had
known safety problems as recently as 2018.

26
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,759
We did a full episode on the lab leak theory
earlier this week so you should definitely

27
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,600
check it out for some background.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:16,820
Dr. Fauci is the director of the NIAID, which
gave the grants to the non-profit EcoHealth

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,320
Alliance, which worked with the Wuhan Institute
of Virology.

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,690
But Dr. Fauci, as you may remember, repeatedly
dismissed the idea the coronavirus came from

31
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,780
a lab.

32
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,080
He especially shut down the idea that the
virus was artificially manipulated.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, now that all this is coming out, he’s
somewhat changed his tune.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,610
How interesting.

35
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,910
And after initially denying funding gain-of-function
research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

36
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,480
Fauci is now defending cooperation with the
Chinese lab.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,480
He said it would have been a “dereliction
of duty” NOT to work with China on coronavirus

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
research.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,290
That’s a headline that might age poorly.

40
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:06,710
Fauci now admits there was modest funding
of the Wuhan lab, but not for gain of function

41
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,710
research.

42
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:14,380
Again, gain of function means taking an existing
virus and making it more contagious or deadly.

43
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,700
So Fauci says they were NOT funding this kind
of research in China.

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:26,000
However, the description of some of the research
grants given to the Wuhan lab say researchers

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,440
would use techniques like “reverse genetics”...

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,310
And “infectious clone technology.”

47
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,340
These are techniques used for gain of function
research.

48
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,300
So I’m not entirely sure what Dr. Fauci
means by the word ”not”.

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,540
And here’s a fun fact: The US government
had banned funding this kind of research in

50
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,480
2014.

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,610
But there were special exemptions—if the
directors of the NIH and NIAID, for example

52
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,400
Dr. Fauci, signed off on them.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,180
The NIH ended up lifting the ban on gain-of-function
research in 2017.

54
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:16,060
And yet Dr. Fauci, as the man in charge of
the US coronavirus response, never once questioned

55
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,189
if a Chinese lab working on making coronaviruses
more contagious could have been the origin

56
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,169
of the coronavirus pandemic?

57
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,840
Here’s another thing to consider.

58
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,860
The coronavirus research being done at the
Wuhan Institute of Virology was being done

59
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,779
by Dr. Shi Zhengli She’s been called China’s
Bat Woman for her work on bat coronaviruses.

60
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:43,990
She had collaborated with a microbiologist
at the University of North Carolina.

61
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:52,749
So...maybe...from now on, the US should reconsider
funding research and training doctors for

62
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:58,400
an authoritarian regime with a history of
poor quality standards and massive coverups.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,529
Just a thought.

64
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:06,340
This week however, the Senate passed an Amendment
from Senator Rand Paul banning gain of function

65
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,830
funding to China.

66
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,030
It’s not yet clear if that will become law.

67
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,030
(

68
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,560
What is clear now is that, a couple months
ago, the Biden Administration had shut down

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,680
an investigation into the Covid Lab leak theory.

70
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,389
More on that after the break.

71
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:25,800
Welcome back.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,610
The lab leak theory is really having a moment
this week.

73
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,370
It also came out this week the Biden Administration
shut down a Trump era investigation into the

74
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,370
Covid Lab leak theory.

75
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,500
CNN quoted anonymous sources that said the
project was shut down because “questions

76
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,620
were raised about the legitimacy of the findings.”

77
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,830
And CNN also cited other anonymous sources
who defended the quality of the work.

78
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,599
And then the State Department denied that
the project had been shut down at all because

79
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,930
it was in fact completed.

80
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,839
So we don’t really know what happened there.

81
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,979
What we do know is now the lab leak theory
is suddenly the popular kid at school.

82
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:12,029
And President Biden has asked the US intelligence
community “to redouble their efforts to

83
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:17,689
collect and analyze information that could
bring us closer to a definitive conclusion”

84
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,309
of the origins of the virus.

85
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,659
And to report back in 90 days.

86
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:27,039
Speaking of US intelligence, the Senate has
just unanimously passed a bill requiring the

87
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,180
Director of National Intelligence to declassify
"any and all information relating to potential

88
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,490
links between the Wuhan Institute of Virology
and the origin of the coronavirus disease."

89
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,900
So in 90 days, we might know more.

90
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,610
Or maybe we won’t.

91
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,779
But the media is having a really difficult
time dealing with this story.

92
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,710
For months, they dismissed the coronavirus
lab leak theory.

93
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,419
They said it had been debunked.

94
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,229
It was a foolish conspiracy theory from Trump.

95
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:00,199
One which Fauci crushed.

96
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,830
(Oh Fauci.

97
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,069
Here’s a tweet from the New York Times from
this February.

98
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:11,780
The Wuhan lab has been the focus of unfounded
conspiracy theories promoted by the Trump

99
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,179
administration about the pandemic’s origins.

100
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:19,330
(
Well, now they have to do some major backpedaling.

101
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,529
This has been a hard time for experts, fact
checkers, and the Science.

102
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,719
Politifact just retracted its Wuhan lab theory
fact check.

103
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,650
But not to worry.

104
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,629
The media figured out how to cover up their
mistakes—with a little mental gymnastics.

105
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:42,469
You see, it wasn’t their fault they failed
to look into this story.

106
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,919
It was Trump’s fault!

107
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,759
This piece in the Washington Post

108
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,199
says the mainstream media “overcorrected”
because the information came from Trump.

109
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,680
That’s a fancy way of saying: We were wrong,
but don’t want to take responsibility.

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,770
And here’s CNN.

111
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,610
(“I do think it's important to remember
that part of the issue when this was first

112
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,449
being reported on and discussed was a few
months after the pandemic had begun, was that

113
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:13,610
then President Trump and Mike Pompeo, the
Secretary of State, both suggested they had

114
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,530
seen evidence that this was formed in a lab,
and they also suggested it was not released

115
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,819
on purpose but they refused to release the
evidence showing what it was.”

116
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,389
You mean you couldn’t do your own research?!

117
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,270
I was talking about this over a year ago!

118
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,270
)

119
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,399
And believe me, I don’t have the resources
of CNN.

120
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,900
Especially since YouTube was demonetizing
or straight up deleting our episodes talking

121
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,200
about the coronavirus lab leak theory.

Seriously, we need your help.

130
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,670
So, Dr. Fauci is probably not the most popular
person in the US right now.

131
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,030
But I’m afraid he’s also not popular in
China.

132
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,550
Because Chinese state-run media is also targeting
him.

133
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:26,500
“Chinese state media has lashed out at Fauci,
saying he has joined an ‘opinion war against

134
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
China.’”

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,260
...after saying he wasn’t convinced Covid
happened naturally.

136
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:37,280
My favorite Chinese state-run media, the Global
Times, called him a degenerate US elite.

137
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,810
Now before you agree with the Global Times,
it's because “He is fanning a huge lie against

138
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,810
China.”

139
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:50,080
Another Global Times article says there should
be a probe into a US biolab for the coronavirus

140
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
origin.

141
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,970
I can tell Xi Jinping where to stick that
probe.

142
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,880
The call for an investigation into Fort Detrick
was also echoed by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson

143
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
Zhao Lijian.

144
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,220
Who also accused the US of scapegoating China.

145
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,420
It’s nice to know that no matter what happens,
the Chinese Communist Party will always blame

146
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,420
America.

147
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,320
But Chinese state-run media aren’t just
attacking US officials.

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,400
They’re also accusing the US media of lying.

149
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,750
The Wall Street Journal reported that staff
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology got sick

150
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,070
and went to the hospital right before the
coronavirus outbreak.

151
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,870
The head of the Wuhan Institute of Virology
told the Global Times it was a complete lie.

152
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,350
Unfortunately for the Chinese Communist Party,
this “lie” might end up being contagious.

153
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,710
And a sweeping new bill to counter China has
been introduced in the US House of Representatives.

154
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,630
It was introduced by Congressman Gregory Meeks
, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign

155
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,770
Affairs Committee.

156
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,450
It’s called the Ensuring American Global
Leadership and Engagement Act.

157
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,920
Otherwise known as The EAGLE Act!

158
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,620
The bill covers a range of issues—investment
to promote U.S. manufacturing and trade, working

159
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,730
with US allies and partners, re-engagement
in international organizations, and calling

160
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,980
China’s treatment of Uyghurs “genocide.”

161
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,630
Meeks is working with Republicans on the House’s
Foreign Affairs Committee to make the EAGLE

162
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,310
Act happen.

163
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,620
I love when China brings Americans together.

164
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,700
More on that next week on our other show,
America Uncovered.

165
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,100
But there’s some bad news for the Chinese
Communist Party.

166
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,800
Countries around the world are starting to
realize how much of a threat it is.

167
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,900
New Zealand’s Foreign Minister is warning
a storm could be coming unless it diversifies

168
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,800
its trade away from China.

169
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,760
Australia is reviewing the Chinese ownership
of a major Australian port that just so happens

170
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,000
to be near a US military outpost.

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,850
Lithuania pulled out of the 17+1, an economic
bloc China created to challenge the EU.

172
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,160
And Taiwan’s foreign minister is warning
China is preparing for war.

173
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,230
Of course, if you’ve seen this week’s
episode of the China Unscripted Podcast, you’d

174
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,220
know the war for Taiwan has already begun.

175
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,030
I’ll put a link to that in the description
below.

176
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,920
And now it’s time to answer a question from
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

177
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,370
fans who support us and our efforts to expose
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party

178
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,290
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

179
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:33,280
Mats Mathisen asks, “Hi Chris Does Apple
handing over access to Chinese customer data

180
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,340
to the CCP have any effect on customer data
outside China?

181
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,520
Should we be worried?

182
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,990
Boy, I’m certainly worried.

183
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,630
So a recent New York Times investigation discovered
that Apple has let a Chinese state-owned company

184
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,890
hold Apple’s Chinese customers' data.

185
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,950
Basically the Chinese government can get access
to any of that.

186
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,960
And that’s just one of many concessions
Apple made to the Chinese Communist Party

187
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,340
in order to do business there.

188
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:09,540
Apple also proactively blocks apps from its
App Store in China might anger Chinese authorities.

189
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,040
To be clear, that means Apple takes the initiative
to block apps, the Communist Party doesn’t

190
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,700
even have to ask.

191
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,360
A lot of Apple’s supply chain is in China.

192
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,430
So is a lot of its retail.

193
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:31,150
Last year Apple made more than $40 billion
dollars in China, almost 15% of total sales.

194
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,400
In other words, Apple is willing to do just
about anything the CCP says.

195
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,070
And that’s what concerns me.

196
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:44,570
I doubt Apple would be stupid enough to give
American user data, located outside of China,

197
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,880
to the Communist Party.

198
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:52,030
But what happens when our data starts flowing
through China, through undersea cables and

199
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,030
whatnot?

200
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:59,420
“China now accounts for 23% of cross-border
data flows, nearly twice the share of the

201
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,530
U.S.”

202
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,470
And that’s growing.

203
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,290
Because of Big Tech greed, we could find ourselves
in a world where the Chinese Communist Party

204
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,970
has more and more access and control over
our information.

205
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,030
Thanks for your question and your support,
Mats.

206
