1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,270
Once a British Colony

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,670
Hong Kong may have developed...

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,930
But now it’s ruled by A Communist Dictatorship!

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,330
See how people in Hong Kong celebrate

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,800
their Un-Independence Day

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,960
Welcome to China Uncensored I'm your host
Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,490
Coming to you from Hong Kong.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,770
This episode is sponsored by Surfshark...

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,949
because if you’re going to be protesting
an authoritarian government,

10
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,130
you’re going to want a reliable VPN to hide
your identity.

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,000
I’m here at the beautiful Victoria park
on this lovely summer day.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,510
July 1 is a special time for Hong Long.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,290
It's the city’s unindependence day,

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,960
when people celebrate the 1997 transition

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,899
from British colonial rule to communist dictatorship.

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,059
There were marching bands,

17
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,300
Crowds cheering

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,480
And of course, delicious barbequed...

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,899
whatever that is.

20
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,949
I probably don’t want to know.

21
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:57,110
The celebrations began before dawn,

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,640
when all these happy people gathered for

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,560
the annual flag raising ceremony.

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,500
That’s when the Hong Kong government,

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,350
including the unelected Chief Executive,

26
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,360
raises both the Hong Kong flag,

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,900
and the People’s Republic of China flag.

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,730
To show how happy everyone is,

29
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,220
to have been handed over from the UK...

30
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,180
and reunited with the motherland.

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,720
I’m sure they’re all smiling under those
masks.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,850
Of course with so many people ready to demonstrate

33
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,800
their love for the motherland,

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,480
the Hong Kong government decided to deploy

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,640
5,000 riot police.

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,960
And layer after layer of barricades.

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,170
Barricades taller than a man.

38
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,729
Which meant that Hong Kong Chief Executive
Carrie Lam

39
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,850
had to travel to the ceremony...

40
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,420
in a boat.

41
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,520
But because of the really bad weather,

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,140
and definitely not for any other reason,

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,079
the ceremony had to be held inside.

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,400
Fortunately, the people had their own flag
raising ceremony

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,680
outside government offices.

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,610
Only this was the flag they raised.

47
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,340
And the real Hong Kong flag was raised at
half mast.

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,280
People were so moved, they were in tears.

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,420
At least this one guy was.

50
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,170
Ok that might be because of the pepper spray.

51
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,200
But that didn’t stop the afternoon

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,980
Un-Independence Day celebrations!

53
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,950
Half a million people marched through the
streets.

54
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,410
Happy to show their true feelings about Hong
Kong’s leadership.

55
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,380
“When you think of your chief executive,
Carrie Lam,

56
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,010
what’s the first word that comes to mind?”

57
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,010
“Selfish.”

58
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,010
“Arrogant.”

59
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,010
“Out of touch.”

60
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,010
“B-----.”

61
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,220
“I would say f--- her. Hahahaha.”

62
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,430
Yes, the people of Hong Kong can’t get enough
of

63
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,480
their post-colonial government.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
So much so,

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,340
that they broke into government headquarters.

66
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,340
And showed both Hong Kong and Beijing what
they really thought.

67
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,160
But they still remembered to pay for their
drinks.

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,340
These celebrating Hongkongers

69
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,810
left the legislature around midnight.

70
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,840
But police decided the party had gone on long
enough.

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,220
And after a long night, finally,

72
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,769
people were able to go home and get some sleep.

73
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,710
And then Chief Executive Carrie Lam

74
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,200
held a press conference.

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
In the police headquarters.

76
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,989
At 4 am.

77
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,769
Yes, 4 am.

78
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,920
Proving again why she’s so beloved.

79
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,129
And so the people of Hong Kong have a message

80
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,360
for Carrie Lam and the Chinese communist party.

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,120
We will not go quietly into the night,

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,440
we will not vanish without a fight

83
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,629
we're going to live on

84
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:25,250
we're going to survive!

85
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,769
Today we protest our unindependence day!

86
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,460
And this episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,130
People in Hong Kong know it’s important
to protect your identity.

88
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,569
That’s why so many people here use VPNs
like Surfshark

89
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,269
when they go online.

90
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,140
You should be using a VPN, too—

91
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,340
whether you’re protesting communist China,

92
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,180
or simply going online in a public place

93
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,819
anywhere in the world.

94
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,460

96

Like your banking info,

97
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,000
or the websites you visit.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,580
And if you’re in a country that doesn’t
allow you

99
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,390
to access the entire Internet...

100
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,019
...you can use Surfshark’s NoBorders™
mode to get around it.

101
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,680
