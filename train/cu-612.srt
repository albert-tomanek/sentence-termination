1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,650
China’s military is growing by “any means”

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,959
according to a new Pentagon report.

3
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:09,509
China is trying to read children's minds

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,740
And Uighurs are very happy.

5
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:17,360
Welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,680
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,250
A new Pentagon Report released Tuesday

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,210
warns that the Chinese military

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,279
is using “any means necessary”

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,130
to transform into a deadly, superior fighting
force.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,300
And it has its sights set on Taiwan.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,340
In fact, the report says conquering Taiwan

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,530
“has served as the primary driver

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,620
for China’s military modernization.”

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,780
Which might be why a top Chinese general

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,960
recently said on the People’s Liberation
Army’s

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,270
official English-language website,

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,460
“If someone tries to split Taiwan from China,

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,010
the Chinese military will do whatever it takes

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,780
to safeguard national reunification,

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,170
national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

22
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,050
China’s military budget has been expanding
every year.

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,059
The Defense Intelligence Agency estimates
in 2018,

24
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,829
total military-related spending will top $200
billion.

25
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:12,399
That’s three times what it was in 2002.

26
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:15,590
And while that is still dwarfed by the US,

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,170
which in 2018 spent $700 billion,

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,170
the report notes that

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,090
“China has not had to invest

30
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,960
in costly R&D of new technologies

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,289
to the same degree as the United States.”

32
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,329
In other words,

33
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,420
America spent the money on research and development,

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,499
and then China stole it.

35
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:35,729
“Domestic laws forced foreign partners

36
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,920
of Chinese-based joint ventures

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,010
to release their technology in exchange

38
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,200
for entry into China's lucrative market,

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,740
and China has used other means

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,020
to secure needed technology and expertise.”

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,259
And now that China is basically caught up,

42
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,479
it’s developing new weapons.

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,119
Defense Intelligence Agency director

44
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,209
Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley writes that

45
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,710
“[China is] on the verge of fielding

46
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,189
some of the most modern weapon systems in
the world.

47
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,380
In some areas,

48
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,439
it already leads the world.”

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
For example,

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,860
China has developed the world’s first road-mobile,

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,780
anti-ship ballistic missile system.

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,080
Those are specifically designed

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,640
to attack enemy aircraft carriers,

54
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,580
which would make US defense of Taiwan

55
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,360
that much more difficult.

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,350
The moon.

57
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,810
Man has walked on the moon,

58
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,810
driven on on the moon,

59
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,270
hit a golf ball on the moon.

60
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,820
What else is there to do?

61
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,760
Well, apparently this.

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,070
“China has released photographs of seeds

63
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,680
planted by its lunar probe

64
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,800
sprouting on the far side of the moon surface.

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
The cotton seed sprouts

66
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,810
are the first biological matter to grow on
the moon.”

67
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,260
Now growing something on the moon is a big
deal.

68
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,300
That’s because if anyone wants to go to
Mars,

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,200
being able to grow Moon sprouts is the first
step

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,740
towards growing Mars potatoes in human poop.

71
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,820
The moon lander was also

72
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,310
“carrying...yeast and fruit fly eggs.”

73
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,680
Well I know that will work.

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,290
Once fruit flies start hatching you can never
get rid of them.

75
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,040
Why do we even want fruit flies on the moon?

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,310
Next thing you know they’re going to start

77
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,210
filling the moon up with other pests

78
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:16,090
like mosquitos, spiders, and pandas.

79
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,090
And it all started with some cotton seeds.

80
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,010
What’s that, Shelley?

81
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,920
The plants are dead?

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Yes!

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,000
No moon pandas!

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,570
In other surely not sinister scientific developments,

85
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,820
China has started scanning children’s brains

86
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,750
with experimental technology!

87
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,990
The brain scanning headbands,

88
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,090
“were used in a recent trial with 10,000
school children

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,970
aged between 10 and 17 in China.

90
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,970
Over 21 days,

91
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,110
students wore the headsets during class

92
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,890
and teachers could monitor their average attention
levels

93
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,240
using an app.”

94
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,770
I know, hard to imagine Chinese students

95
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,570
might have a hard time focusing

96
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,980
when they’re reading about Xi Jinping Thought
for A New Era.

97
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,260
Maybe they’ll be able to focus better on
classes

98
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,520
about the links between electromagnetic waves
and brain cancer.

99
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,560
But I know you’re worried about how soon
it will be

100
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,700
before American schools can enjoy

101
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,450
these child brain scans as well.

102
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,340
Well, no need to worry,

103
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,870
because they were designed by

104
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,090
the Massachusetts based BrainCo,

105
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,870
so hopefully we’ll have them in America

106
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,370
as soon as the China trials are done.

107
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,370


108
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,870
“When students use the focus one,

109
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,999
teachers can immediately tell when their students

110
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:30,460
are in a low attention state or high attention
state.”

111
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,970
This is not the future we were promised!

112
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,370
We were promised pink hoverboards.

113
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,379
Yet another vaccine scandal in China!

114
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:42,009
More than 100 children received expired polio
vaccines.

115
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,639
They were between 3 months and 4 years old.

116
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,520
This is terrible news.

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,819
Unless you’re an anti-vaxxer.

118
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,520
An unexpected side effect of these expired
vaccines

119
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,050
was violent protests over the weekend.

120
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,930
I guess parents were a little tired of Communist
Party negligence

121
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,090
putting their children’s lives at risk.

122
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,180
Sure, bad vaccines are used all the time in
China.

123
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,650
But as state-run media said after

124
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,770
the last vaccine scandal a few months ago,

125
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,150
Chinese vaccines are perfectly safe.

126
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,610
Hey, you know those vocational training centers
in Xinjiang?

127
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,300
The ones that are holding a million or more
Uighurs?

128
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,180
The ones that hostile foreign forces,

129
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,169
like journalists,

130
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,919
call “concentration camps”?

131
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,080
Couldn’t be further from the truth.

132
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,469
Why, a Reuters reporter was given an official
tour of one!

133
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:35,469
And this is what he saw.

134
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,800
Some of the chaperons said to me,

135
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,460
‘look, we're doing such a good job here,

136
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,789
that you in the West should really be learning
from us.’”

137
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:45,539
If you’re happy and you know it clap your
hands

138
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,620
I mean they said they were happy,

139
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,620
they knew it,

140
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,290
and they clapped their hands!

141
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,680
So please ignore any reports you may hear

142
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,199
about the vocational training camps actually

143
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,819
being used for cultural and ethnic genocide

144
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,629
with torture worse than death.

145
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:01,789
And finally,

146
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,030
this piece of calligraphy has been

147
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,939
a part of Chinese sacred territory

148
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,599
since ancient times.

149
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,150
1,200 years to be exact.

150
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,630
It’s a famous piece by

151
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,090
the greatest calligrapher in Chinese history,

152
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,370
Yan Zhenqing.

153
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,379
It’s called Requiem to My Nephew.

154
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,319
It belongs to Taiwan’s National Palace Museum.

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,870
But that’s not why the Communist Party is
so upset.

156
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,090
They’re upset because Taiwan lent it to
a Japanese museum,

157
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,789
and they hate Japan because,

158
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:33,080
you know...the Rape of Nanking in 1938.

159
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,639
Seriously.

160
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,639
According to the BBC,

161
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,000
the story is trending on the Chinese internet.

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,349
And people are furious.

163
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,650
One Weibo user said,

164
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,219
“Has Taiwan forgotten what Japan did to
us?

165
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,180
Do they know what the Nanjing massacre is?”

166
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,150
Now Taiwan’s history with Japan

167
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,580
is pretty different from the Mainland.

168
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,499
Taiwan was under Japanese occupation for even
longer—

169
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,750
from 1895 until 1945.

170
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,870
But in Taiwan,

171
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,440
Japanese occupiers were a little less rapey,

172
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,370
and a lot more build-y.

173
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,599
Anyway, the reaction in China,

174
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:09,889
or at least the reaction that’s been

175
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,039
allowed to stay on social media,

176
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:14,029
has been that Taiwan is crazy

177
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,870
and China needs to retake Taiwan.

178
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,219
Which fits in very nicely

179
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:22,180
with a recent speech Chinese leader Xi Jinping
gave.

180
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,189
Those are this weeks China headlines.

181
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,189
What do you think?

182
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,229
Leave your comments below.

183
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,960
And before you go, now is the time I answer
a question

184
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,050
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

185
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,900
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

186
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,199
Rodney Hall asks,

187
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,960
“Is it ever difficult to do China Uncensored
as comedy

188
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,710
when you know better than most that the CCP

189
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,069
holds China through mass murder,

190
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,069
mass torture,

191
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,309
and mass repression?

192
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:48,080
I would think that making jokes about a regime

193
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
that cuts its people up

194
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,719
and sells their pieces for cash

195
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:54,289
would make you want to cry, every day.”

196
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,990
Hey, you don’t know what happens after the
camera turns off.

197
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,520
It’s a river of sorrow up in here.

198
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,860
That’s why I grew the beard.

199
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,370
To catch all of the tears that were dripping
on the desk.

200
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,569
But yeah, most of the things we cover on this
show are very serious.

201
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,669
And it’s all having a very big impact on
people’s lives

202
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,370
whether they’re in the US,

203
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,721
China or anywhere else in the world.

204
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:17,990
But no one likes to hear depressing news all
the time.

205
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,930
But in the immortal words of Mary Poppins,

206
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,719
a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go
down.

207
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,289
And not just for the viewers.

208
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,139
The humor helps all of us on the China Uncensored
team

209
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,680
write about this stuff without having to take
Zoloft.

210
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680


211
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Now Matt, Shelley,

212
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,610
and I all feel very passionately about China.

213
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,280
So how do we manage to make jokes?

214
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,440
Simple.

215
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,599
We built Sarcasti-bot 3000 to write them for
us.

216
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,720
He’s quite the...joker.

217
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,540
Joker?

218
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,320
I hardly knew her.

219
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,140
Ha.

220
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,040
Ha ha.

221
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,980
Ha.

222
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,420
We...can’t shut him down.

223
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,980
Thanks for your question.

224
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,860
