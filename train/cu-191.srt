1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,260
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,920
Emails, sche-mails.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,149
Wait, that doesn’t sound right.

4
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:11,880
Why be a Christian, when you can be a Communist!

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,740
And finally, maybe caving to China over Taiwan

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,480
was not such a good idea.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,340
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,960
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,210
You know, when I heard about the Hillary Clinton
email scandal,

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,699
I was saddened—

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,710
because it had nothing to do with China.

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,640
Oh, if only it had been China that hacked
her emails,

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,960
not Russia!

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,100
Well good news, America!

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,829
It’s possible China may have also

17
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,520
hacked Hillary Clinton’s emails.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,540
According to two sources who spoke to

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,170
the conservative news website The Daily Caller,

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,820
a Chinese company inserted code on her server

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,420
that forwarded copies of Clinton’s emails

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,040
to China in real time.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,290
And the Intelligence Community Inspector General

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,720
apparently warned of the problem,

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,739
but the FBI failed to act.

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,740
But on the plus side,

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,710
it gave Trump the chance to talk about CHINA,

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,380
Crooked Hillary, and the Tainted FBI all in
a single tweet.

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,909
It’s like Trump getting a McFlurry,

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,429
with Oreos, and a cherry on top.

31
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,499
The FBI has denied Trump’s tweet,

32
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,360
but hasn’t made any statements regarding
the Daily Caller report.

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,469
Of course, a spokesman for Clinton has denied

34
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,990
the server was hacked from China.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,329
All we know for certain is from this DOJ report.

36
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,740
It says that former FBI Director James Comey

37
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,499
originally said it was “reasonably likely”

38
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,520
that hostitle actors gained access

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
to Clinton’s private email server,

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,289
but later changed it to “possible.”

41
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,259
The FBI also claimed that although it was
possible,

42
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,179
they did not find conclusive evidence of it.

43
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,209
So...no proof from the FBI,

44
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,469
just two anonymous sources

45
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,489
talking to a conservative media outlet.

46
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,709
Not exactly a solid indictment.

47
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:03,670
But it sure makes a clickable headline for
China Uncensored.

48
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,340
In other news, following trends can be dangerous.

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,690
Don’t give in to peer pressure—

50
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,040
just because all your friends are doing something

51
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,910
like, taking Holy Communion

52
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,880
—kids these days are doing that—

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,600
don’t just blindly join in.

54
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,080
Christianity is not for everyone.

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,680
But communism is!

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
It will be required.

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,490
At least that’s the message the Chinese
Communist Party

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,700
is giving to Christians in China.

59
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,660
They’ve been forcing house Christians to
sign statements

60
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,300
saying they renounce their beliefs.

61
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,410
This is a standard one, republished by VOA.

62
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,170
The statement says, among other things,

63
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,630
“I had limited understanding of Christianity.

64
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,270
Taking on Christianity as my belief

65
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,050
is also blindly following the trend.

66
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,340
Now I have a more comprehensive understanding

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,370
of religion and religious beliefs.

68
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,370
After further studying Christianity,

69
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,880
I have a clearer understanding of my spiritual
needs.

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,410
I announce that I will not participate

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,280
in Christian religious activities

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,980
from now on and I will no longer believe in
Christianity.”

73
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,120
Christians have never been treated well in
China.

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,790
First you have to belong to a church

75
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,490
approved of by the Communist Party—

76
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,410
or your belief in Christianity is illegal.

77
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,100
There are tens of millions of “house Christians”

78
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
who belong to underground churches

79
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,060
or illegal Bible study groups.

80
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,380
But the Communist Party’s persecution of
Christians

81
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,560
has gotten pretty extreme in recent years.

82
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,960
Like tearing down crosses…

83
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,040
which sometimes randomly catch fire,

84
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,860
whoops, how did that happen?

85
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,990
Or telling people to replace

86
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,520
pictures of Jesus with pictures of Xi Jinping.

87
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,820
Look, if Nero couldn’t stop the Christians,

88
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,710
the Communist Party sure isn’t going to
be able.

89
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,960
Then again, maybe in its own way, the Communist
Party

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,810
will embrace some parts of Christianity.

91
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,680
If only to keep its soldiers upright.

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,200
President Trump has finished trade talks with
Mexico

93
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
and apparently, no more NAFTA.

94
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,930
But obviously the bigger question on everyone’s
mind

95
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,740
is what does this mean for the ongoing trade
war with China.

96
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,350
And experts say Trump’s success means China

97
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,530
will be in a more defensive position moving
forward.

98
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,009
According to some experts in the financial
services company ING Group,

99
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,469
“It strengthens the US position to play
hard-ball with China.”

100
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,009
Here’s what Trump’s National Economic
Council Director

101
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,419
Larry Kudlow had to say.

102
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,430
Our deal with Mexico shows that free trade,

103
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,569
fair trade can be done.

104
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:32,569
That a pro-growth trade deal can be made.”

105
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,289
“I think in this global game of world trade
politics

106
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,490
I think China is now on the defensive because

107
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,510
they see the US is getting some momentum and
I think that's great.”

108
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,740
And here’s what President Trump had to say.

109
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,090
“They want to talk,

110
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,090
and it's just not the right time to talk right
now,

111
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,550
to be honest, with China.

112
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,090
It's been—it's too one-sided for too many
years,

113
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,940
for too many decades, and so it's not the
right time to talk.”

114
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,340
Of course, that’s not the feeling in Beijing.

115
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,780
Two former top Chinese officials told the
South China Morning Post

116
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,050
that China will win the trade war.

117
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,520
And you can always trust top Chinese officials.

118
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,710
Speaking of good ideas by top Chinese officials:

119
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,680
The One Child Policy.

120
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,830
For decades, the law was that most couples

121
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,139
could only have one child—

122
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,830
or face stiff penalties or forced abortions.

123
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,599
The idea was to keep China’s population
from growing too quickly.

124
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,159
But eventually, Chinese officials realized,
oops,

125
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:33,009
the current population is getting old,

126
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,530
and we didn’t make enough young people.

127
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,759
So a few years ago,

128
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,460
they changed it to a Two Child Policy.

129
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,530
But even that wasn’t enough

130
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,599
to fix China’s demographics problem.

131
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,780
So now, for the first time in decades,

132
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,169
Chinese people may be allowed to have multiple
children,

133
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,360
and hopefully less forced abortions.

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,129
There’s a draft reform law to China’s
Civil Code

135
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,930
would end the two child limit.

136
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,159
But don’t think that obsessive top-down

137
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,770
family planning controls are over!

138
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,310
One Chinese think tank has even proposed a
plan

139
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,560
to force couples who don’t make enough children
to pay extra taxes.

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,919
China’s first homemade aircraft carrier
has hit the water.

141
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,330
And despite being made in China, it didn’t
sink.

142
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,650
It’s part of the Chinese regimes attempts

143
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,930
to project military power around the world.

144
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,449
But it’s not just limited to the world.

145
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:30,050
The Chinese Communist Party also has its sights
set on space.

146
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,460
China has launched a record number of satellites
this year.

147
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,650
The two most recent launches were part of
“the Beidou system,

148
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,849
China’s answer to the US GPS precision timing
and navigation system.”

149
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,809
China wants to rival the United States in
GPS technology.

150
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:48,559
But it's also part of a much larger campaign
of space warfare,

151
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:53,280
that seeks to place the Chinese regime as
the dominant space power.

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,819
And finally, you know how all those airlines
have been

153
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,180
caving to Chinese demands to stop labeling
Taiwan

154
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,770
as a separate country in their drop-down menus?

155
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,720
I mean, I get it.

156
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,869
Taiwan is small,

157
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,119
and Mainland China might have

158
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,089
the world’s biggest market for airlines

159
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,870
just a few years from now.

160
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,150
Well, guess what?

161
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,210
Caving to the Chinese regime’s demands

162
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,039
is not working out.

163
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,219
Surprise, surprise, the Chinese government

164
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,460
is giving big subsides to Chinese airlines.

165
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,210
And US airlines are finding it quote,

166
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,800
difficult to make a profit.

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,869
Truly, I am shocked.

168
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:30,400
Although one airline found has a clever workaround

169
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,020
to deal with the Communist Party’s demands
to include

170
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,180
Taiwan as part of China.

171
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,789
On the United Airlines website,

172
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,240
there’s a page that allows you set your
location

173
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,849
“for currency-slash-payment purposes”.

174
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,529
And they list a bunch of countries.

175
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:48,879
China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong are listed separately,

176
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,669
but based on their currency,

177
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,330
not their country-slash-region status.

178
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,129
Taiwan’s foreign ministry thanked United
for its flexibility.

179
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,309
I mean, even though Taiwan is definitely

180
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,740
part of the People’s Republic of China,
the Communist Party

181
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,499
can’t deny that Taiwan has its own currency,
right?

182
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:06,180
What’s that, Shelley?

183
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,169
Nope, they’re still upset.

184
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,639
Apparently, my favorite state-run media The
Global Times

185
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,180
wrote this article called “United Airlines,

186
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,809
Don’t Think About Outsmarting China.”

187
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:19,990
It accuses United of “attempting to fool
Chinese”

188
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,159
and “playing word games.”

189
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,199
Right.

190
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,560
Because it’s not like the entire “One
China” policy

191
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,669
is some kind of giant word game that the Chinese
Communist Party

192
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:31,370
wants the rest of the world to play.

193
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,789
And now it’s that time when we answer questions
from fans

194
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,250
who support China Uncensored on the crowd
funding website patreon.

195
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,810
Weesh asks,

196
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,900
How did you guys come up with

197
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,080
the “wacky Chris plus straight man Shelley”
personas?

198
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,750
Did that happen organically or by design?

199
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,770
What are you talking about?

200
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,740
Shelley is almost impossible to deal with—

201
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,310
she’s a total diva who says the wildest
things.

202
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,000
Whereas I am the rock of this show.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,630
What’s that Shelley?

204
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,630
No.

205
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,540
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

206
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,350
Everything I just said was completely true.

207
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,370
Stop rolling your eyes at me!

208
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,480
I can hear it!

209
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,230
Thanks for you question, Weesh.

210
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,600
And remember, YouTube is constantly demonetizing
us—

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,780
taking away ads temporarily or permanently

212
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,700
across tons of our videos.

213
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,160
That’s because we talk about “controversial
topics”

214
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,550
that don’t fit into their well manicured
“community guidelines.”

215
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,100
So we rely in support from you, the viewers.

216
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,600
If you can, support us by contributing to
the show on Patreon.

217
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,580
I know I pitch this every episode, but seriously,

218
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,560
you are what keeps the lights on.

219
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,260
If you want to learn more, I’ve put the
link below.

220
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,910
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

221
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,950
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

222
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,940
See you next time.

223
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
Want to learn more about China?

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,360
Then check out our new podcast, China Unscripted!

225
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,180
Matt, Shelley and I sit down with China experts

226
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,190
to talk about some of the most critical China
news out there.

227
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,280
Trust me, it’s way more entertaining than
it sounds.

228
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,700
Look for the China Unscripted Podcast on iTunes,

229
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,630
Stitcher, and Spotify,

230
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,300
as well as on YouTube.
