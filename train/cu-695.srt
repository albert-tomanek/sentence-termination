1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,520
Australia, the land down under.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,140
So far under, it’s starting to stink.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,740
The name’s Chappell.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,240
Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,120
People call me “Agent.”

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,560
They also call me in when no one else will
do the job.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,190
But business these days was slower than a
hibernating koala.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,800
And that’s when she walked in.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,090
You’re not very tall.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,240
I try to be.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,950
You’ve got a case.

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,760
Someone’s making trouble down in Chinatown.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,989
Would you call it, big trouble?Wrong genre.

14
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:37,989
Try again.

15
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,210
Sorry, angel, I don’t see why that’s any
of my business.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,660
Because you uncensor stuff.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,200
That’s what you do.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,430
What’s with the car?

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,829
In case anyone wants to go for a spin.

20
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,910
Just don’t drive too fast.

21
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,030
Speeding was the least of my worries.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,199
This new case smelled like trouble with a
capital T.

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,489
I just hope Australia won't be the land

24
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:02,610
where I’m buried six feet under.

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,030
Chris, what are you doing?

26
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,070
You’re just staring at me.

27
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,830
Australia was founded by a bunch of criminals.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,570
Today, they’re called politicians.

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,100
I got word about John Hugh,

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,369
a former politician who was a founding member

31
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,659
of something called the Australian Values
Alliance.

32
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,789
If someone was ruffling up the feathers of
the local Chinese,

33
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,859
that’s a good place to start.

34
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,770
So, you're one of those racist Australians
who hate Chinese people.

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,399
Well I'm Chinese myself so how can I be racist
against Chinese?

36
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,399
He had a point.

37
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,390
And he also had a pretty good idea who was
really behind

38
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,469
this Chinatown chop suey.

39
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:52,180
The Chinese Consulate in Sydney plays a large
role,

40
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,759
so called managing the local Chinese communities
here.

41
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,481
So how do Chinese Australians feel about this
influence

42
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:04,939
the Communist party's trying to have?

43
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,550
Well, most people keep silent,

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,530
and they may have to obey and accept the kind
of influence,

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,010
because if you stand up,

46
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,790
actively campaign against them,

47
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,739
you probably don't get a visa to visit China.

48
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:26,739
Then you are separated

49
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:27,739
from your other family members and friends.

50
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,739
And perhaps they have properties in China
or business interests.

51
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,810
What do you think you could be done to tackle

52
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,860
Chinese Communist Party infiltration in Australia?

53
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,620
First of all, don't fear of the authorities,

54
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,780
because they cannot really control this country.

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,700
We are not under China control.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,060
Not yet.

57
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,060
Not yet.

58
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,260
And hope will never.

59
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,650
We are not part of Chinese territory here.

60
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:05,930
Secondly, is to expose their tactics,

61
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,049
what they do to you, to the general public,

62
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:17,769
and let other people be aware those tactics
they use

63
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:21,739
to try to scare you off or win you over.

64
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,500
So, don't be silent.

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,739
Don't be silent.

66
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,739
That's right.

67
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,100
I should have known it was my old nemesis,

68
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,840
the Chinese Communist Party.

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,989
This whole situation had their dirty red fingerprints
all over it.

70
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,870
But I needed more on what they were doing
in Chinatown,

71
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,280
and how.

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
Time to rattle some cages.

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,320
Shelley, I want you to call the Chinese embassy.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,220
Make ’em sweat.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,740
Stay away from the United Front!

76
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,340
Sorry, I don’t speak Australian.

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,680
Someone didn’t want me getting any closer.

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,910
It’s not the first time I’ve gotten a
kick out of a case.

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,390
But I was about to find out I wasn’t the
only one

80
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,120
with a boot on my neck.

81
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,800
Great, now no one will want to talk to me.

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,600
I thought you were trying to quit

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm down to two packs a day.

84
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,220
I’ve tried the Chinese embassy multiple
times.

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,800
I don’t think they want to talk to you.

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Yeah?

87
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,060
Sounds like they’d get along with my ex
wife.

88
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,560
You don’t have an ex wife.

89
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,300
Don’t remind me…

90
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,160
When you hit rock bottom,

91
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,540
you can’t get any lower.

92
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,460
Not until you bring out the jackhammer.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
Trying to solve this mystery was like looking
up the nostrils

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,580
of a sleeping wombat.

95
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,720
Pitch black and twice as smelly.

96
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
I decided to get out and clear my head.

97
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,340
This must be the place.

98
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,760
Who are you?

99
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,920
My name is Shen An.

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,210
I've been in Australia almost 30 years.

101
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,370
Shen An was in deep with the Chinese Australian
community.

102
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,900
He had information for me about the United
Front

103
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,780
and their shady partner,

104
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,780
the Australian Council for the Promotion

105
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,470
of the Peaceful Reunification of China.

106
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,560
What is the United Front Work Department?

107
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,020
The peaceful reunification of China

108
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,310
that control by United Front of China.

109
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,830
That organization in Sydney, in Australia,
is their agent.

110
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,880
Then through this agent control a couple hundred
so-called

111
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,460
Chinese community organizations in Sydney.

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,220
And it's all tied to the United Front?

113
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,200
Yeah, all under the control.

114
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,420
I call Australia the disaster area

115
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,360
of this sort of influence from Chinese CCP.

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,700
Can you give me some examples

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,820
of how they operate?

118
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,080
Easy...

119
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,240
First, they, Chinese government they control

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,200
most of Chinese media in Australia...

121
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,330
by using money to corrupt most of the media.

122
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,430
Not only Chinese media.

123
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,170
You mean English language media?

124
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah, that's right.

125
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,530
Not only Chinese,

126
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,070
English language media as well,

127
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,070
but the situation getting worse and worse.

128
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,660
How does the communist party manipulate

129
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
the Chinese Australian community?

130
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,700
Through their so-called "community leaders."

131
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,620
I can say 99% of those community leaders,

132
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,320
they are manipulated by.

133
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,820
99%?

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,580
99.

135
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,160
Almost like 100%.

136
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,690
How are critical voices silenced?

137
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,690
For example, John Hugh was denied to entry
China.

138
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,690
That's one of the way they do that.

139
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,690
You're not allowed to go back to the country
you born.

140
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,690
You're not allowed to meet your friends or
relatives in China.

141
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,500
Also, they try to isolate you people in Chinese
community.

142
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,300
They try to ruin your names.

143
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,130
They turn you into the enemy.

144
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,130
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,480
Turn you to the enemy.

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,990
For example, we against the Chinese communist
regime,

147
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,570
but now lots of Chinese, obviously Chinese
in Australia.

148
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,560
They look at you like you are against our
government,

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,650
our party.

150
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,470
Do ordinary Chinese Australians know what's
happening?

151
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:12,910
Not too many ordinary Chinese.

152
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,690
What does this mean for Australia?

153
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,270
Well, communist party in my eyes in my mind

154
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,070
is the evil in the world, in human history.

155
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,760
It's the monster.

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,260
It can only bring disaster to human society.

157
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,770
I can tell you my experience, personal experience.

158
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,669
We suffered.

159
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,399
I know the Chinese communist party's nature.

160
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,680
Their nature is to control

161
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,959
and never give up their power to the people.

162
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,250
That's the so called communist party.

163
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,329
Things were spinning out of control

164
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,319
faster than a Tasmanian devil.

165
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,970
But I wasn’t any closer to rumbling the
United Front.

166
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,020
And that’s when I got the feeling someone
was following me.

167
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,520
You know, you’re not a very good private
dick.

168
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,240
No, but I am a good public one.

169
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,280
Hello?

170
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,260
What?!

171
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,220
Shelley, we’ve got a break.

172
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,560
Some kookaburra’s got proof this goes right
to the top!

173
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,440
I am the son of the Red Revolution.

174
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,660
Zhang Xiaogang.

175
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,140
Brainwashed by the Communists in China,

176
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,380
he fled to Australia, where he tried his hand
at

177
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,200
the dirtiest business of all—

178
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
politics.

179
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,420
You're talking about ideological education

180
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,129
to brainwash the next generation.

181
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:51,660
Brainwash every- yeah, every worker in the
company,

182
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,200
or government office, or school.

183
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,160
So, I don't like this, so I complained.

184
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,660
And so, my colleagues say,

185
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,660
"You should be quiet."

186
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,430
Because, if you speak out, maybe get in trouble.

187
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,510
Zhang got in trouble, all right.

188
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,490
He got involved in the pro-democracy movement
in China.

189
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
And when he came to Australia,

190
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,769
the Chinese Communist Party followed.

191
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,009
An Australian political party, the Unity Party,

192
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,589
asked Zhang to run in a local election.

193
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,500
But then the leader, Peter Wong,

194
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,490
got a call from the Chinese consulate.

195
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,360
Peter Wong said, "Consulate asked me why

196
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,760
you put pro-democracy movement activist as
your candidate?"

197
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,589
"If you do so,

198
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,339
we will ask Chinese community to vote against
you."

199
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,800
So Peter Wong said,

200
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,730
"Maybe you can make a deal,

201
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,449
say you quit from the pro-democracy movement

202
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,990
and ask Consulate to give you a visa,

203
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,399
go back to China."

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,180
I said, "No, I can't do that."

205
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,900
You said no?

206
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,540
I said, "No, I can't do that."

207
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,660
I don't want to do any deal with the Chinese
Consulate.

208
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,200
I still want to fight for democracy, for human
rights.

209
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,180
So the Chinese Consulate was essentially trying
to

210
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,779
undermine Australian democracy?

211
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,360
Yeah.

212
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,000
Everywhere.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,320
What are some other ways they pressured

214
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,120
the Chinese-Australian community?

215
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,699
The fear if they do anything,

216
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:21,139
or say something wrong...

217
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:27,199
then they deny you a visa to back to China...

218
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,399
In most of the Chinese member,

219
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,410
China community to have a relative in China
-

220
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,440
maybe their parents,

221
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,029
maybe their brothers, sisters-

222
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,279
and they feel you have no chance to go back

223
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,560
to see your relative.

224
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,050
There's a great pain, you know?

225
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,749
So the Communist Party basically holds Chinese
Australians’ families

226
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,470
inside of China as hostages.

227
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,870
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,769
So what can the Chinese-Australian community
do in response to this?

229
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:02,360
Well, I think most members of the Chinese
community-

230
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,620
Majority, don't really feel this is a problem...

231
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,290
Most of them actually, thinking about making
money.

232
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,220
They don't want to make trouble with the Communist
party.

233
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,610
I really need the Australian society

234
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,949
to understand the Communist regime,

235
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,009
what they are.

236
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,720
Many people think, "Oh, come on, China is
good.

237
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,040
The economy booming,

238
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,209
look's nice and organized."

239
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,949
But, the double-faced.

240
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,089
When they need you or doing business there's
a face.

241
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,519
But, when they're trying to control you, a
different face.

242
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,009
I had a bitter taste in my mouth.

243
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,390
Like I’d eaten a bucket of vegemite.

244
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,459
The Communist Party had its clapper claws
everywhere.

245
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,810
No place was safe.

246
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,420
No one can be trusted.

247
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,560
How can you fight something like that?

248
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,940
Thanks doll.

249
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,709
Almost got me in the pipes.

250
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:24,920
Forget it Chris.

251
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,760
It’s Chinatown.

252
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,680
And that’s when it hit me.

253
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,580
In a world where the Chinese Communist Party

254
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,600
makes everyone into an enemy,

255
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,880
you’ve got to find someone to watch your
back.

256
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,740
Here, this one’s on me.

257
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,619
Shelley, I think this is the beginning of
a beautiful friendship.

258
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,960
We’ve known each other for ten years.
