1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,920
The people of Hong Kong

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,040
celebrate the police!

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,160
Because that’s what they’re told to do.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,520
Remember Hong Kong—the city that\h
used to be at least somewhat free,\h\h

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,800
until the Chinese Communist Party\h
pushed through a National Security Law?

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
“Critics say [the law] effectively curtails\h
protest and freedom of speech—China\h\h

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,520
has said it will return stability.”

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,080
I say, why not both? If the\h
people keep their heads down\h\h

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,600
and their mouths shut, everything will be stable.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
And it’s about time the younger generation\h
learned how to behave like *this.*

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,520
China passed the Hong Kong\h
National Security Law on June 30,\h\h

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,360
2020. It was the Chinese Communist Party’s\h
solution to more than a year of protests.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,360
The law gives tremendous leeway for authorities\h
to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong.\h\h

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
They can arbitrarily arrest anyone\h
using the National Security Law.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,080
A lot of people have been concerned, because\h
“The law is a vague catchall, creating broadly\h\h

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,320
worded crimes that could land people in jail\h
for playing a song or uttering a slogan.”

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Yeah, it’s too vague. And that’s why\h
Hong Kong authorities are putting extra\h\h

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,000
care into making sure the law can be properly\h
explained to the city’s impressionable youth.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,120
“Let’s learn about National Security.”

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,640
That’s clever. If you make it into a cartoon,\h
it’s much easier to get kids to pay attention.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
“The National Security Law,\h\h

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,240
a national law, has been listed in Annex\h
III to the Basic Law according to Article\h\h

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,360
18 of the Basic Law and applied by way\h
of promulgation in the Hong Kong SAR.”

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,960
Wow, nevermind about getting kids to pay\h
attention. It’s like Hong Kong authorities\h\h

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,920
watched The Garfield Show , and asked themselves:\h
“Yes, but can we make a cartoon even worse?”

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,320
So yeah, the National Security cartoon\h
got cancelled after the pilot episode.\h\h

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,320
But there are still plenty of ways for Hong Kong\h
authorities to “educate” the next generation.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,360
In fact, since February this year, the school\h
curriculum across Hong Kong adjusted to ingrain\h\h

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,800
the 4 criminalized acts: secession, subversion,\h
terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces.

31
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,200
And on April 15th, Hong Kong celebrated its very\h
first annual National Security Education Day!\h

32
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,000
National Security Education Day was\h
introduced to Mainland China back in 2015.\h

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,720
And now that Hong Kong has its own National\h
Security Law, they can celebrate, too.

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,680
At Hong Kong’s Police College,\h
“groups of elementary school-aged\h\h

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,240
children could enjoy a kind of\h
riot-police-theme-park experience.”

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Complete with all your favorite rides!

37
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
Like: Hostile Foreign Forces of the Carribean.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,840
Pepper Spray Mountain.

39
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
And It’s a Small World That’s Belonged\h
to China Since Ancient Times...After All.

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,000
OK, they didn’t actually have rides. But you\h
*could* take a photo with your favorite mascot,\h\h

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,880
the hero who solved the Hong Kong protests.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
And what kind of theme park would\h
be complete without a parade?

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
Including your friendly\h
neighborhood goose-stepping police!

44
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,080
Hearts and minds, people. Hearts and minds...

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,200
is where they stab you with their bayonets.

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,840
And authorities also put on\h
this cute anti-terrorism drill.

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,160
Where police open fire without\h
warning, and shoot everybody.

48
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,920
And for a more hands-on experience, they\h
also let the kids play with hand grenades.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
And rocket launchers.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,800
It’s the kind of healthy nationalist\h
education all parents want for their children.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,080
Play with guns! Shoot your friends!

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,680
Don’t play with subversive figurines, kids.

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
Play with the official police ones.

54
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,960
Ah, memories.

55
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Sweet, stinging memories.

56
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,760
The future of Hong Kong is in good hands.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,240
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army—fans\h\h

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
who support the show through the\h
crowd funding website Patreon.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
Greig Fawcett asks:
“Why can’t the west bring down the great\h\h

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,440
firewall and what could the CCP do in response?\h
Is the west too concerned about the big internet\h\h

61
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,640
cables linking the world would be tampered\h
with by China, which would be a catastrophe?”

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,120
Good question, Greig. The West could bring\h
down the Great Firewall in just a few months—if\h\h

63
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,720
America’s big tech companies got behind it. The\h
problem isn’t the internet cables. It’s that\h\h

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,120
companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, and Apple\h
are all trying to get a share of the China market.\h\h

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,480
Ultimately, they’re all going to be screwed\h
by the CCP, but they just don’t know it yet.

66
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Instead, these companies could build tools that\h
help people in China and other dictatorships to\h\h

67
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,120
subvert government firewalls. It would be\h
impossible to stop. People around the world\h\h

68
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,480
would love these tech companies for promoting\h
freedom, instead of hating them for censoring\h\h

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,560
speech in free countries. And they’d\h
make a lot more money that way, too.

70
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
If only they’d listen to my advice.

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
Instead of, you know, selling their\h
products to the Chinese police.

72
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Thanks for your question, Greig.

73
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,600

perks, like me answering questions on the show.

75
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.\h
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
