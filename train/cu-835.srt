1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,060
20 years ago…

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,790
the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,419
turned these people

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:08,109
into so-called “enemies of the state”.

5
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,020
And this is how they did it.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,830
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,390
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,099
You know, life can be tough for China’s
communist leaders.

9
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,539
When things are too happy and peaceful for
your citizens,

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,960
they may start to question whether they really
need

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
your extremely authoritarian leadership anymore.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,870
And that’s why it’s important to remind
them:

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,210
“You need us,

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,900
because we’re at war with a dangerous enemy!”

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,030
Sure, today that enemy is the landlords,

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,160
and tomorrow the enemy will be

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,100
the people protesting the landlords,

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,850
but that doesn’t matter.

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,510
The important thing is:

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,559
There's an enemy.

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,340
It’s like the Chinese Communist Party

22
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,960
is constantly playing Mortal Kombat,

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
but they always win

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,350
because their opponents are actually The Sims.

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,899
Believe me, it’s not pretty.

26
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,749
And this is the story of how 20 years ago,

27
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:06,330
the Communist Party manufactured a new enemy:

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,810
Falun Gong.

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,710
Just look at these people practicing Falun
Gong!

30
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,500
Training to violently overthrow the leadership
by...

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,820
closing their eyes and standing there!

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,000
Are they just going to keep standing there?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,540
Yep. That’s what Falun Gong does.

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,900
They stand there.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,100
Then they sit there.

36
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,820
So boring.

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,000
And by boring, I mean DANGEROUS!

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,150
Because this week marks the 20th anniversary

39
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,350
of how the Chinese Communist Party

40
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,840
turned Falun Gong practitioners into so-called

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,790
“enemies of the state.”

42
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,620
This is the event they used:

43
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,800
On April 25, 1999,

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,200
ten thousand Falun Gong practitioners appeared
in Beijing,

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
at the central government compound called
Zhongnanhai.

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,250
Think of Zhongnanhai as the White House

47
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,009
plus the US Capitol,

48
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,609
except that the public is never allowed inside.

49
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,719
The Chinese Communist Party later claimed
t

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,430
hat Falun Gong practitioners “besieged”
Zhongnanhai,

51
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,909
which is why they had no choice

52
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,840
but to launch a nationwide crackdown

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,540
on this “dangerous enemy.”

54
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,599
But actually,

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,510
they had already been planning the crackdown
for years.

56
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,430
There were definitely people,

57
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,440
high level officials in the public security
apparatus in China

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,379
that were getting nervous about Falun Gong,

59
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,030
simply because of its sheer size.

60
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,989
Falun Gong was first publicly taught by Li
Hongzhi in 1992.

61
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,440
Falun Gong has exercises like Tai Chi or yoga,

62
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,820
and it also has meditation and a spiritual
aspect.

63
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,880
Falun Gong became super popular.

64
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,590
By 1999, the Chinese government estimated

65
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,900
there were 70 to 100 million people practicing
Falun Gong.

66
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,800
That’s more people than there were

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
members of the Chinese Communist Party.

68
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,400
I started practicing Falun Gong in 1996...

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,740
in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun.

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,760
Every morning on the university's sports field,

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,280
there were thousands of people

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,180
practicing different qigong exercises.

73
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,900
The biggest group was Falun Gong.

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,520
The vice chancellor of my university

75
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,380
and many professors were also practicing Falun
Gong.

76
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,960
They would do the Falun Gong exercises with
us every morning.

77
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,909
In the early ’90s, the Chinese government

78
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,510
invited Falun Gong’s founder Li Hongzhi

79
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,790
to join a number of government-sponsored events.

80
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,950
Here he is speaking at the Ministry of Public
Security.

81
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,010
And here’s an article in the People’s
Public Security Daily

82
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,150
that praises Li for his contributions “in
promoting

83
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,660
the traditional crime-fighting virtues of
the Chinese people.”

84
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,189
Which....sounds less like he’s teaching
a meditation practice,

85
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,190
and more like he’s teaching people how to
be Batman.

86
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,660
But the point is, official state-run media
were promoting Falun Gong.

87
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,540
If you took a walk in the park this morning,

88
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,409
you can see that the recent hard work

89
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,140
the government has put into public health
activities

90
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,829
has not been wasted.

91
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,099
Every morning from 5 to 6 am

92
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,579
the city's green grass, parks, and public
squares

93
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,650
become a morning exercise heaven.

94
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,780
I’m not sure what I find more shocking.

95
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,920
State run media praising Falun Gong,

96
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,300
or the fact that these people were getting
up at

97
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,220
5am every morning to exercise!

98
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,670
But for a long time in China,

99
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,160
it was really common to see

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,080
people in parks practicing qigong.

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,280
Qigong includes Tai-chi, Falun Gong,

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,660
and hundreds of other practices

103
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,630
you’re probably never heard of.

104
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,770
Because it was a form of qigong,

105
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,640
it really slipped through the cracks

106
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,790
of the Communist Party's already

107
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,730
fairly strict controls over religion,

108
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,140
and was able to spread throughout China,

109
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,950
and also controls in civil society.

110
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,310
By 1996,

111
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,770
there were already millions of people

112
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,640
practicing Falun Gong.

113
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,380
And some Chinese officials started to get
nervous.

114
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,550
So the authorities did what they do best.

115
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,370
They suppressed stuff.

116
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,480
They banned the Falun Gong books.

117
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,260
They tapped a few phone lines.

118
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,580
Raided some homes.

119
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,960
Sent spies to the outdoor practice sites.

120
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,100
You know, the usual.

121
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,060
The goal was to gradually undermine Falun
Gong.

122
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,420
The government's official policy was that people were

123
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,480
allowed to freely practice qigong and other physical exercises.

124
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,740
So under this circumstance,

125
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,580
why were public security bureaus in different
areas

126
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,800
targeting Falun Gong?

127
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,480
Why were the books banned?

128
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,860
You could already feel a faint atmosphere
of suppression.

129
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,070
But things were about to get much worse.

130
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,720
On April 23, 1999,

131
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,650
Chinese authorities beat up and arrested

132
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,560
45 Falun Gong practitioners in the city of
Tianjin.

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,150
Local authorities said if other practitioners
wanted to get them freed,

134
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,120
they’d need to go to Beijing to appeal to
the central government.

135
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,870
What those authorities didn’t count on was,

136
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,550
on April 25, 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners

137
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,810
would actually take them up on that,

138
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,820
heading to the National Appeals Office near
Zhongnanhai.

139
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,140
Frank Shi was one of them.

140
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,980
We all felt that more than 40 Falun Gong practitioners

141
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,440
being beaten and arrested in Tianjin was very
relevant to us.

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,020
If we didn't take a stand,

143
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:39,020
it was very likely that the same thing would
eventually happen to us.

144
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,280
Probably not even Falun Gong practitioners

145
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,030
realized how many people would come that morning.

146
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,670
But with tens of millions of people practicing,

147
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,550
one person decided to go appeal,

148
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,200
and that guy tells his cousin,

149
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,670
and he tells his friend,

150
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,260
and pretty soon there were 10,000 people.

151
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,960
And even that was only about one in every

152
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,480
100 Falun Gong practitioners in Beijing.

153
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,300
If you think about it like that,

154
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,880
if they really wanted to “besiege” Zhongnanhai,

155
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,840
you’d think they could have gotten

156
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,970
at least a hundred thousand people to show
up.

157
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,240
But only 10,000 people showed and they...

158
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,450
stood there.

159
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,490
And they also...

160
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,760
sat there.

161
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,700
I would term what happened on April 25th,

162
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
around Zhongnanhai,

163
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,370
more of like a sit-in or an appeal than necessarily
a protest.

164
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,900
If you look at the imagery and the video footage

165
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,170
and talk to people who were there,

166
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,220
there weren't loud slogans being shouted,

167
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,381
there wasn't any kind of a protest march or
anything like that,

168
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,200
that you would think about a protest,

169
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,250
that usually we see protests and demonstrations

170
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,380
that are a little more vocal include.

171
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,820
Instead, you saw people basically lining up
quietly,

172
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,490
a lot of them were sitting,

173
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,490
some were standing,

174
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,660
some were doing the Falun Gong meditation,

175
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
some were sitting and reading.

176
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,560
It was a pretty quiet type of sit in appeal.

177
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,030
There were police on the street.

178
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,330
They seemed very relaxed.

179
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,420
There wasn't much for them to do.

180
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,460
The practitioners were very orderly.

181
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,700
They even left space on the sidewalk.

182
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,240
They didn't hold up traffic or cause any disturbances,

183
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,600
so the police didn't have much to do.

184
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,260
The Falun Gong practitioners had three main
requests.

185
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,980
One: Release the Tianjin practitioners.

186
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,500
Two: Allow the Falun Gong books to be published
again.

187
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,050
And three: Let people practice Falun Gong

188
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,930
without police harassment.

189
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,150
All the requests that the people

190
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,580
were making were related specifically to Falun
Gong

191
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,740
and having the freedom to practice Falun Gong...

192
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,979
There were no demands whatsoever

193
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,870
that related to the Party's role in power
more broadly.

194
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,979
That morning, Premier Zhu Rongji came out
of Zhongnanhai

195
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,880
and spoke to the Falun Gong practitioners
in person.

196
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Zhu was one of the top officials in the whole
country.

197
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,570
And Frank Shi was one of three practitioners

198
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,250
who got the chance to meet with him.

199
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,310
According to Shi,

200
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,720
Zhu Rongji thought the situation had already
been resolved.

201
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,840
As he was walking he said,

202
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,040
"Haven't I already written a comment on your
situation?"

203
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,620
When we heard this, we were very surprised.

204
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,860
We had never heard of this.

205
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,480
This shows that at the time,

206
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,380
Premier Zhu's comments had been withheld

207
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,940
by another faction within the government.

208
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,660
See, while Premier Zhu Rongji was trying to
resolve the situation,

209
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,000
others at the highest levels of the Chinese
Communist Party

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,600
were working on escalating it.

211
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,220
At the time, we believed in and had confidence
in the government.

212
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,780
We hoped the government could solve the issues
that we raised.

213
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,000
Most of us thought that the central government,

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,480
the high-level government officials,

215
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,360
just didn't understand the actual situation
with Falun Gong.

216
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,900
We thought it was just one or two lower-level

217
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,780
government departments that were treating Falun Gong like this.

218
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,450
But it wasn’t just some misunderstanding.

219
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,580
It turns out—surprise!—

220
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,040
that asking the Chinese government

221
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,140
to follow Article 35 of its own constitution

222
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,200
was way too much to expect.

223
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,150
That’s because Falun Gong had unknowingly
made

224
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,990
an enemy at the very top of the Chinese Communist
Party—

225
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,180
the chief toady himself, Jiang Zemin.

226
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,020
He saw the way in which people were able to
mobilize,

227
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,860
even peacefully,

228
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,660
to line up in Beijing on behalf of Falun Gong,

229
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,030
and that really freaked him out.

230
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,170
I think that showed him a level of loyalty

231
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,670
that Falun Gong practitioners had,

232
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,080
that he might have already been aware of,

233
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,330
and a little jealous of the kind of reputation

234
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,490
that Falun Gong's founder had,

235
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,240
and the way in which people really believed,

236
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,650
genuinely believed his teachings,

237
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,990
in a way that people did not believe Communist
Party teachings,

238
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,630
or repeat Jiang Zemin's own

239
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,570
or whatever Communist Party slogans were at
the time.

240
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,070
See, unbeknownst to Frank Shi,

241
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,970
or any of the other practitioners who were
there,

242
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,990
that peaceful appeal at Zhongnanhai

243
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,870
had been manipulated by other

244
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,210
higher ranking members of the Communist Party

245
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,780
from the very beginning.

246
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,950
Police had ordered the practitioners to line
up

247
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,600
along the two sides of Zhongnanhai.

248
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,660
They would later use this footage to claim

249
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,230
Falun Gong practitioners had surrounded the
government—

250
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,250
that Falun Gong was a “dangerous enemy”

251
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,340
that wants to overthrow the Communist Party.

252
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,320
Presumably by...doing this at 5 am.

253
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,560
Of course the practitioners had to listen
to the police's orders.

254
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,880
You stand where the police tell you to stand.

255
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:47,920
So they led a group of practitioners to the
gates of Zhongnanhai,

256
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,040
as if practitioners were "surrounding Zhongnanhai."

257
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,660
But the Appeals Office was actually in the
opposite direction,

258
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,860
on the north side.

259
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,520
So from this it looks like a group of people

260
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,260
completely knew about this matter

261
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:15,280
and arranged for practitioners to stand in
front of Zhongnanhai.

262
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,290
The Chinese government and the propaganda
apparatus

263
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,850
like to frame it as an effort to surround
the government,

264
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,540
to be anti-government,

265
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,191
and to try to overthrow the Communist Party

266
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:28,020
or challenge their authority on power.

267
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,600
If we were "besieging" Zhongnanhai,

268
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,060
[Zhu Rongji] wouldn't have come out to meet
us.

269
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,630
But Jiang Zemin was controlling the narrative.

270
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,770
Shortly after,

271
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,510
he wrote a letter to the Central Committee

272
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,270
of the Chinese Communist Party.

273
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,460
He said, “Today’s event is worth our reflection.

274
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,540
All of sudden, more than 10,000 people

275
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,720
surrounded the gate of the center of the nation’s
authority...

276
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,950
Can’t we, the communists

277
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,440
with our belief in Marxism, Materialism, and
Atheism,

278
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,720
win over that suit of stuff aired by Falun
Gong?”

279
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,640
Yeah! How dare people have another belief!

280
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,980
They must be trying to overthrow us!

281
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,710
Finish them!

282
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,800
Jiang Zemin followed that with another letter
in June 1999,

283
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,470
calling for the creation of a special task
force

284
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,770
for the sole purpose

285
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,540
“to break and wipe out Falun Gong.”

286
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,440
This is the top party leader.

287
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Even though we know that there

288
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,029
were other people high up in the party,

289
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:25,380
including the premier at the time,

290
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,870
that disagreed with Jiang on this point, again,

291
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,279
once he made that decision

292
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,330
the apparatus just started running,

293
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,110
and there was really not much to stop

294
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,650
this all-out assault on Falun Gong.

295
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,220
So what began as a peaceful appeal,

296
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,240
was manipulated and used by Jiang Zemin

297
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,990
and other Chinese authorities as an excuse

298
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,570
to justify a nationwide crackdown.

299
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,110
In July 1999,

300
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,110
the Communist Party outright banned Falun
Gong.

301
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,930
They launched a nationwide anti-Falun Gong
propaganda campaign,

302
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,990
and began rounding up millions of practitioners,

303
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,980
detaining them in labor camps, and torturing
them.

304
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,970
After meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji on April
25,

305
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,870
Frank Shi was monitored by his university
and the police.

306
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,280
Someone accessed his dang’an,

307
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,420
a political file that’s kept on every Chinese
citizen.

308
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,190
His Falun Gong books disappeared from his
computer.

309
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,360
Even rough drafts of his research papers

310
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,460
were taken from the trash

311
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,190
and used as evidence against him.

312
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,600
After the official crackdown started,

313
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,480
he was arrested and tortured.

314
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,190
Eventually he fled to the United States.

315
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,450
Ultimately, Falun Gong wasn’t targeted

316
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,839
because of that appeal in April 1999.

317
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,710
But the government propaganda blaming Falun
Gong

318
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,980
was even repeated over and over by Western
media.

319
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,280
Like this CNN article from 2002:

320
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,840
“Falun Gong's tight organization was seen
on April 25, 1999,

321
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,780
when about 10,000 Falun Gong members besieged

322
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,850
the government compound in Zhongnanhai, Beijing.”

323
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,430
Good job, CNN—

324
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,490
getting your words straight from Chinese state-run
media.

325
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,570
So the narrative became that Falun Gong

326
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,690
was somehow asking to be persecuted.

327
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,650
But even without the april 25 appeal,

328
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,420
Chinese authorities would have probably figured
out some excuse.

329
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,340
They’re creative like that.

330
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,560
Whether or not we went to petition the government,

331
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,960
sooner or later they would have persecuted
Falun Gong.

332
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,200
Before April 25,

333
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:37,760
they were already looking for excuses to target
the practice.

334
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,420
And in the 20 years since,

335
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,300
the Chinese Communist Party is not just persecuting
Falun Gong.

336
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,260
They're persecuting the Tibetans.

337
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,280
They're persecuting the Uighurs.

338
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,840
The Tibetans never went to petition,

339
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,120
but they were persecuted.

340
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,860
Uighurs never went to petition,

341
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,820
but millions have been put in concentration
camps.

342
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:14,620
Other religious groups in China, like Christians,

343
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,760
are also being persecuted.

344
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,780
So regardless of whether there was an April
25 appeal,

345
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,780
the Chinese Communist Party would have persecuted
all religions.

346
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:34,520
This is an innate part of their type of belief
in atheism,

347
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:40,660
and in the evil nature of the Communist Party.

348
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,140
There are millions of kind hearted Chinese
people

349
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,120
who have been persecuted.

350
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,300
They haven't done anything illegal.

351
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,200
The Communist Party is quite evil.

352
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,680
They actually just want to persecute everyone.

353
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Yeah, if you’re Tibetan, or Uighur, or Christian,
or Falun Gong:

354
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,960
Don’t take it personally!

355
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,180
It wasn’t something you did!

356
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,280
The Party just wants to persecute everyone.

357
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,790
Even Chinese officials can’t escape these
days.

358
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,690
Yes, more than a million Party members

359
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,520
have been purged since 2015.

360
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,300
In communist China,

361
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,150
everyone is eventually equal...ly persecuted.

362
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,120
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

363
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,670
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

364
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,880
See you next time.
