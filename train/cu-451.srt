1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,100
Taiwan: a beautiful country full of amazing experiences

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,120
This tiny island nation is home to a thriving economy and Britch culture

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,360
But there's one thing Taiwan has that's unlike anything else in the world

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,400
Wait 7-eleven, you told me you were taking me to an authentic Taiwan experience

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,900
7-eleven is an authentic Taiwan experience. It's not like anything else in the u.s

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,320
You're not gonna be able to try watery hotdogs here. You have to try new things.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,960
You know, I don't like trying new things.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,240
I promise it'll be fun.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,200
That's what you said about the South China Sea

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,460
That was fun.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,020
It was.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,060
All right, let's go

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,640
Shopping time

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,100
To make this more fun slash terrifying we decided to pick out items for each other to try.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,280
Oh man, this is going to be great

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,100
All right, Shelly what have you done to me this time?

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,040
Okay, we're gonna start with a little aperitif of

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,460
juice milks

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,960
Juice milks.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,480
Yes, they're actually

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,740
famous in

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,680
Taiwan for having watermelon milk and papaya milk.

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,320
Must be hard to milk a watermelon.

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah, I mean it is milk

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,820
They just want to make sure you understand

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,100
It's it's cow's milk.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,540
It's an interesting smell

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,620
Yeah, it's like somebody's stuck a piece of watermelon.

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,080
Thoughts? You like it?

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,340
I'm sure it does a body good.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,940
Papaya milk.

32
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,220
Actually really like this one!

33
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,700
Okay, this one is like the famous one, papaya milk.

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,890
All right. Well after having

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,140
juice and juice now, we'll try actual juice, multi juice.

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,300
Juice milk, and I'm not sure what kind of juice

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,180
Very citrusy smell

38
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,810
Swallow

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Doesn't count if you don't swallow the food

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,200
It's like a jolly rancher... milk.

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,180
We're off to a good start.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,600
So 7-elevens in taiwan have a bunch of like bits and bobs floating around

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,180
So is that the technical term?

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,760
I think so. I really scalded myself getting these so I just wanted you to know and I worked

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,700
hard to get them.

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,600
Thank you very much, and I don't want to put that in my mouth

47
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,260
Yeah, well, we have some hot dog, now that we've cut them open this filled with it's filled with something.

48
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,060
I think this is the

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,300
traditional Taiwan delicacy chicken testicles.

50
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,680
That's not a chicken testicle

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,200
No?

52
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,360
I've eaten chicken testicles. And that's not...

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,600
Shelly there's so much. I don't know about your past

54
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Good crunch

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,940
Exactly where I was mean, it's time like a like a hot dog. All right

56
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,459
Chicken testicle

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
It's not a chicken testicle.

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,560
It is chicken though

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,620
And finally

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,380
Mango shrimp.

61
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,220
Is that...?

62
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,040
cheese?

63
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,460
Actually, you're allergic to mango right? I should maybe make sure it's not mango before I kill you a mistake

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,700
Good news is it's definitely not mango

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,460
Tastes like shrimp with little hard poppy balls of something

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,680
What have I done?

67
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,460
Fish eggs.

68
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,200
Fish eggs... and cheese.

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't know why I took another bite.

70
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,380
Let's move on

71
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,400
So what fresh horror is this?

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,760
You know crispy dried squid mouth.

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,980
Squids have beaks. They don't have mouths.

74
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,900
All right, so it's crispy dried squid beak.

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,180
These actually are the beak.

76
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,640
Yes, what part of this don't you understand?

77
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,880
This is an actual squids mouth.

78
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Did you think it was like lying on the package?

79
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I thought it might have been a mistrans-

80
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
It's the only snack that bites back

81
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,920
It's like an Eldritch Horror in your mouth.

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,080
Hail Cthulhu.

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,060
Stop eating them, Shelley.

84
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,280
What? They're good!

85
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,520
So, what's this?

86
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,880
Well since you thought squid mouths were so funny, how about some spicy chicken gizzards?

87
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,300
Love chicken gizzard.

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,060
You do?

89
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,880
Yeah

90
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,540
I see you're not eating them.

91
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,340
Crunchy right

92
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,740
You're right that's a little crunchy.

93
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,580
Good, right?

94
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Feel like I trolled myself.

95
00:05:53,300 --> 00:06:00,420
So Chris, I know that was a little weird a little maybe you want some like classic American Oreos, ah

96
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,819
Looks like they've done

97
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,710
something with Oreos

98
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,710
All right. Sounds good

99
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,499
It's a good way to make an Oreo

100
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,259
Hey

101
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,259
Still tastes like the chicken gizzards

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Perhaps a Ritz cracker

103
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,660
This looks disgusting.

104
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,280
No

105
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,600
Processed cheese is good in any country.

106
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,340
It's the cheese is weird and like overly salty and the crackers.

107
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,420
This is the best tasting thing we've had.

108
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,060
That's terrible

109
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Give me the chicken gizzards

110
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,360
All right, I think it's time for a food break and we need to wash it down with some

111
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,600
asparagus juice.

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,680
It doesn't smell like what it smells like after you've eaten it, asparagus.

113
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,220
It's its own unique smell, I've never smelled this before.

114
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,820
It smells like corn

115
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,000
No, there's a hint of asparagus there. All right

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,780
And garlic.

117
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,180
That's pretty damn good. Yeah, I would I would buy this if they sold a what

118
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,900
What is this?

119
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,120
It's refreshing it's sweet...

120
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
And also sour. Why is it sour?

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
It's like it's got vinegar in it. I don't know what's going on. I'm so confused.

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,840
I feel a rash forming

123
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm starting to regret this but these are chicken flavored Cheetos.

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,100
Well, they certainly surpassed the look of Cheetos

125
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,780
Okay, why are these sweet?

126
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't taste the sweet.

127
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,600
My gosh, there's too many weird flavors in my stomach right now.

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,500
I feel horrible

129
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,000
How you holding up, Shelly?

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,780
My stomach hurts.

131
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,420
Mine, too

132
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,900
But good news is the great flavor of coconut and corn has finally been married together

133
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,840
This treat...

134
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,200
Covered in a fine white powder. How is it? Ooh...

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,220
It's salty.

136
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,640
So I was expecting it to be sweet, but it is so salty.

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,740
This is very unsettling

138
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,440
Mmm, you know, if you come to Taiwan?

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,300
Maybe don't go to 7 Eleven.

140
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,260
They're potato chips

141
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,120
What's the trick?

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,755
They're salted egg potato chips.

143
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,500
I bet they're sweet

144
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,195
I don't taste any like salted egg in essence.

145
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,020
Hmm too bad, you know

146
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,600
Not really, but I'm keep eating this for some reason.

147
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,420
Once you have one, you can't stop it just one. That's a slogan

148
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,160
Just opening the bag

149
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,040
I was overwhelmed by shrimp smell.

150
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,260
You really got to bring your A game here, Chris. Shrimp fries, really?

151
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,040
I didn't know they look like fries so, you know, it's

152
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,980
fries on the bag.

153
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,420
Also I grew up eating these. If you're trying to gross me out with shrimp fries...

154
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,540
I just ended up trolling myself in this episode.

155
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,560
I mean this feels like a nice palate cleanser after like the corn coconut

156
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,320
wafer roll.

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,220
Actually, I agree

158
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,260
Hmm. I feel like I could eat all kinds of things more. Oh

159
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,120
Good

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,640
What's next?

161
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
This is a German style smoked sausage.

162
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,680
When I got it I didn't realize there'd be so many things on it.

163
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,540
So I mean, it looks like it's

164
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,460
fresh hotdog bun

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,720
but it just has been sitting in the bag for God knows how long.

166
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,400
I - there's like ketchup on it and mayonnaise or something and I

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,360
didn't see that.

168
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,580
Oh my god, wait, wait wait, we have to show this because it's like look how small that is.

169
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,460
Hey, Shelly.

170
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,500
It's what you do with it. It's not the size

171
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,360
Well...

172
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
It's so good, yum.

173
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
After you

174
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,500
Oh, oh

175
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,960
Wow. Oh, wow. It really is the worst

176
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,460
It's just the worst the old ketchup and mayonnaise.

177
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Think I won.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,980
Good Lord

179
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,660
This is harder than going for three days to the South China Sea.

180
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,460
I was less nauseous on the open ocean.

181
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,380
You're getting this right you're getting this

182
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Excellent now I win

183
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,480
Let's send us home. I got us a cheesecake.

184
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,900
I'm pretty sure it's not a cheesecake. It's a cheese,

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,760
space, cake. It literally looks like there's a piece of cheese on top of that

186
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,900
You sound like you've been through

187
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,820
an ordeal Shelley.

188
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,660
So moist.

189
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,640
I hate that word.

190
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,460
Moist

191
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,560
Cheese space cake. Oh my god. There really is a piece of cheese on top. Yep

192
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,329
Yeah, it's cheesecake

193
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Sweet little salty

194
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,820
That's fighting everything else I put in my stomach over the past half hour.

195
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,520
Well, we survived.

196
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,800
We did. Well, we don't know. We you know poison sometimes takes up 24 hours you set in

197
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,860
So if you're in Taiwan

198
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,520
Be sure to visit a 7-eleven. They actually have many delicious things

199
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:20,120
I mean, we literally tried to choose the worst things to troll each other. So we now regret that deeply yeah, yeah

200
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,120
As long as you just like stick to one thing

201
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,940
You'll probably be okay, but Shelley, well, I was in 7/11

202
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,800
I did see one thing that you can only get in a

203
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,060
Taiwanese 7-eleven. If you can't get in the US then I think you will like hold out your hands and close your eyes

204
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,500
Keep them closed. There you go.

205
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,640
Sailor Moon!

206
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,940
For when you're fighting evil by moonlight, uh-huh winning love by daylight. There we go

207
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
Nine-year-old. We would have been a static

208
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,640
What about current?

209
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,800
Yeah, pretty happy. Collect them all

210
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,280
All right, I am obviously

211
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,420
Tuxedo Mask. So I'll take that.

212
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,780
No, Shelly, that's not...

213
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
This is what she thinks of me

214
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,400
Well, thanks for tuning in to this special episode of China Uncensored.

215
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,740
Again, I'm Chris Chappell.

216
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,600
I'm Shelly Zhang.

217
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,140
See you in Taiwan

218
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,360
We're gonna go be sick now
