1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,379
Did their faces go all like that as they went
over the top?

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,379
No, that’s sustained.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,379
You’ll get that if you get sustained Gs.

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,379
This is…

5
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,080
It’s more a sort of “ga-dumf” feeling.

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,929
‘Cos when you jump and hit the floor, briefly,
your feet are getting a few Gs.

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,790
But it’s so brief that it doesn’t matter.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,290
I’ve got a friend
who’s a massive rollercoaster fan

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,030
and I went with her to a…

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,040
Thorpe Park, if we’re allowed to name check,

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,500
and before each ride she’d be like, right,

12
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,330
this has maximum G of this,
and this many flips, and the other,

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,610
but then the whole ride is just me sitting
there counting them going

14
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,350
“yes, that works out,
ooh yep, that’s there”.

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,600
And so it turns into somewhere between
rollercoaster riding and accounting,

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,170
which is kind of fun.

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,150
Tell you what, that’d be a job to get into,
accounting on a rollercoaster.

18
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,450
Well, no, you just design the rollercoaster
so it’s basically the pound after Brexit.

19
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,270
And it’s just… no, there’s the drop!

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,090
Satire!

21
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,079
That exists, it’s the first drop on the
Pepsi Max Big One.

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,360
I was going for Oblivion at Alton Towers.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,890
You could have a whole theme park!

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,340
“You want to go on the tulip ride again?”

26
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,129
“Yeah, let’s do it.”
