1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,139
Shocking scenes in China

2
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:05,230
Uighurs shackled and blindfolded

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,140
Taken by train to who knows where

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,990
China calls them “vocational training centers”

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,480
Human rights watchers say “concentration
camps”

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,420
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,130
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,130
Drone footage has emerged

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,839
from China’s Xinjiang region showing this:

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,640
A train transport of prisoners.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,769
Police escort inmates,

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,090
who have shaved heads,

13
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,620
and are handcuffed and blindfolded.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,430
The video was posted on the YouTube channel
War on Fear.

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,239
It says the footage shows the quote unquote

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,020
“long-term suppression of human rights and
fundamental freedoms

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,149
by the Chinese government in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.”

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,930
Xinjiang is where the UN says the Chinese
regime

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,590
has locked up over 1 million Uighurs,

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,899
a mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live there.

21
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,640
The Chinese Communist Party says the detention
facilities in Xinjiang

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,350
are actually "vocational training centers"

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,770
helping to stamp out extremism and to equip
people with new job skills.

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,780
See, they’re schools, definitely not prisons.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,009
“They are affected by religious extremism.

26
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:21,060
Our purpose is to get rid of their extremist
thoughts.”

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,549
Just like in a normal job training center.

28
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,630
And all part of the Chinese Communist Party’s
plan

29
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,369
to lift people out of poverty.

30
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,670
But human rights groups—

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,899
and Western leaders—

32
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,260
say these training centers are closer to concentration
camps.

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,380
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,159
China's treatment of Uighurs

35
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,329
the "stain of the century,"

36
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:46,060
and that China is "home to one of the worst
human rights crises of our time."

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,899
Speaking in New York on Sunday,

38
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,840
ahead of the United Nations General Assembly
meeting this week,

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,330
Pompeo said Beijing's campaign in Xinjiang

40
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,960
isn’t about fighting “terrorism” but
“erasing” its citizens.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,869
"And further on the subject of terrorism,

42
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,049
I want to make clear that China's repressive
campaign in Xinjiang

43
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,440
is not about terrorism it's about China's
attempt

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,320
to erase its own citizens of Muslim faith
and culture

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,940
and we call on all countries to resist

46
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,160
China's demands to repatriate Uighurs.”

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,500
The newly-released drone footage

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,100
appears to have been shot in August of *2018*

49
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,110
at a train station near the city of Korla,
in Xinjiang.

50
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,370
Ironically, by a DJI drone made in China.

51
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,070
When the camera zooms in,

52
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,600
you can see the prisoners, sitting on the
ground,

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,490
surrounded by police—shackled and blindfolded.

54
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,500
Again, just like in a normal job training
center.

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,350
Next the prisoners are escorted off the lot

56
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,590
and towards waiting buses.

57
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,500
The video then cuts out and then...

58
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,630
who knows where the prisoners ended up?

59
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,730
Maybe it’s Shanghai Disneyland!

60
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,690
Or possibly a detention center.

61
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,940
Come to think of it, yeah, it’s probably
a detention center.

62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,710
Where the prisoners will be lifted out of
poverty.

63
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,430
Nathan Ruser is a researcher

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,030
with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute

65
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,070
who verified the video.

66
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,210
He believes prisoners were taken from the
Kashgar Detention Center...

67
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,360
to the much bigger facilities in Korla.

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,240
The red squares are full-fledged prisons.

69
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,390
Hard-time facilities like these

70
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,540
he says, are ones “where those sentenced

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,520
live out years of pre-trial detention

72
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,610
and then far longer in their prison sentences.”

73
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,100
In verifying the footage, Ruser used clues
in the video—

74
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,830
landmarks and sun position—

75
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,110
to zero in on when and where it was shot.

76
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,500
Clues like the orientation map and the scale
bar info...

77
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,200
then Google Earth, and bingo...

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,340
the train station west of Korla in south-east
Xinjiang.

79
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,180
And prisoners were probably bussed

80
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,690
to one the 150 or so detention centers across
Xinjiang.

81
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,760
They’ve been built at a lightning pace to
handle

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,270
more than a million people who’ve been detained

83
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,670
since the Uighur crackdown sped up a couple
years ago.

84
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,930
Here’s a glimpse inside one of the less
restrictive facilities,

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,900
where inmates eagerly learn about Core Socialist
Values...

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,310
which include “democracy,” “rule of
law,”

87
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,850
and—most importantly—“freedom.”

88
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,380
I know that sounds like a joke,

89
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,890
but those are the actual Core Socialist Values.

90
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,420
But these places aren’t so bad—

91
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,040
say Chinese authorities.

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,590
What about *this* Uighur detention facility—

93
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,900
where you can see there’s pingpong

94
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
dancing

95
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,910
and basketball?

96
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,840
Turns out, that’s a video shared by the
editor-in-chief

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,490
of my favorite Chinese state-run media, The
Global Times.

98
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,870
And according to Ruser, it’s pure propaganda.

99
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,280
“The basketball 'courts' are merely mats

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
and there for propaganda purposes,’

101
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,010
he says, pointing to mats lifting off the
ground

102
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,230
and to satellite imagery showing the courts

103
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,000
normally located at a nearby school.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
After the Chinese Communist Party

105
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,190
could no longer deny the existence of these
detention camps,

106
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,860
they started taking foreign journalists on
supervised tours.

107
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,450
Here’s a BBC investigative report published
in June:

108
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,460
“Is it your choice to be here?”

109
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,460
“Yes.

110
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,710
I had weak awareness of the law.

111
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,100
I was influenced by extremism and terrorism.

112
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,660
A policeman in my village told me

113
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:23,960
to get enrolled in school and transform my
thoughts.”

114
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,910
Yes, that’s a totally normal thing to say
about

115
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,910
enrolling in a *vocational* training school.

116
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,570
Of course, the newly surfaced drone video
undercuts the narrative

117
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,560
that people are in these centers out of their
own free will.

118
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,750
“If they don’t want to come, then what
happens?”

119
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,530
“We’ve never encountered that before.

120
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,300
But we’d proactively guide them.”

121
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,260
“But isn’t a place where people have to
come,

122
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,290
obey the rules,

123
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,110
stay until you allow them to leave,

124
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,110
sound more like a prison?

125
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,810
Even if it’s a prison in which you can do
some art?”

126
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,810
“Prison?

127
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,060
Is there a prison where you can paint?

128
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,430
I don’t know what you mean by prison.

129
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,660
Our place is indeed a training center.”

130
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,630
This woman spent a year in a detention facility—

131
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,520
mostly in one of the tougher camps—

132
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,490
for the dastardly crime of having WhatsApp
installed on her phone.

133
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,910
“They put cuffs on my legs for a week.

134
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,880
There were times when we were beaten.

135
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,420
Once I was struck with an electric baton.”

136
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,350
Meanwhile, Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister
Marise Payne

137
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,530
has viewed the prisoner transport video

138
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,220
and she told News dot com that she finds it
“deeply disturbing.”

139
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,530
She also said that “We have consistently

140
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,320
called for China to cease the arbitrary detention
of Uighurs

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,900
and other Muslim groups.

142
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,170
We have raised these concerns—

143
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,100
and we will continue to raise them—

144
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,640
both bilaterally and in relevant international
meetings.”

145
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,270
International meetings like the United Nations
General Assembly

146
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,630
taking place this week in New York,

147
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,430
where President Donald Trump spoke at

148
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,980
the United Nations Event on Religious Freedom.

149
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,110
“As we speak, Jews, Christians, Muslims,

150
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,630
Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Yazidis,

151
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,010
and many other people of faith are being jailed,

152
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,030
sanctioned, tortured and even murdered,

153
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,870
often at the hands of their own government

154
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:24,760
simply for expressing their deeply-held religious
beliefs.”

155
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,210
But it should come as no surprise

156
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,370
that China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman

157
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,290
said the US has "slandered China's policy
toward Xinjiang

158
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,790
and grossly interfered in China's internal
affairs."

159
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,410
And this all comes as China releases its annual
white paper

160
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,760
about how great human rights are in China.

161
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,430
Other Chinese state-run media quickly picked
up the white paper.

162
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,310
"The government says people's rights

163
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,630
have been improved since 1949

164
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,760
when the New China was founded."

165
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,090
But wait, how can they say human rights in
China have improved,

166
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,550
when they’re locking up Uighurs and brainwashing
them?

167
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,550
Easy!

168
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,490
They just change the definition of human rights.

169
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,669
See, in the United States,

170
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,669
the Declaration of Independence proclaims
that human rights

171
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,010
are not granted by governments, but by God—

172
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,490
and they include the right to life, liberty,

173
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,430
and the pursuit of happiness.

174
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,970
In Communist China, though,

175
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,270
the Communist Party is God—

176
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,760
and it has endowed its people with none of
those things.

177
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,490
But here are the “human rights” they do
claim to offer:

178
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,900
“An array of achievements,

179
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,830
among them the right to food,

180
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,370
the elimination of absolute poverty,

181
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,000
improved living standards,

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,490
safe drinking water,

183
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,229
improved housing conditions,

184
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,150
more convenient public transport,

185
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,700
and better public health.”

186
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,790
I mean, what could possibly be a more important
human right

187
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,210
than “more convenient public transport”?

188
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,490
Certainly not freedom of belief.

189
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,110
“We aim to change their religious extremist
thoughts,

190
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,300
so they can find work after graduation.”

191
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,440
“We would call that brainwashing.”

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,930
“We’re not completely changing their thoughts.

193
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:09,710
We only remove the extremist elements.”

194
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,850
Although this year, the Chinese Communist
Party

195
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,710
has decided to emphasize a new human right:

196
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,600
Living a happy life.

197
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,030
But how do you measure happiness?

198
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:29,110
Let’s ask the Uighurs at this vocational
training school.

199
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,430
And if *that* doesn’t make people happy,

200
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,420
you can always do this to them.

201
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,360
So what do you think about the detention of
Uighurs in Xinjiang?

202
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,940
Leave your comments below.

203
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,480
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

204
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,500
a fan who supports China Uncensored

205
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
through the crowdfunding website, Patreon.

206
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,250
Alan Sandler asks:

207
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,130
“Please give me a definition of Wuumaw.

208
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,130
Love your program.”

209
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,130
Thanks.

210
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,300
I love my program, too.

211
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,100
So Wu Mao means 50 cents.

212
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,450
Technically, 5 ten cents.

213
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,130
It refers to people on the internet

214
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,170
who are allegedly paid 50 Chinese cents

215
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,950
each time they post a pro-Beijing comment

216
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,770
on websites, underneath videos, etc.

217
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,580
This is called China’s Wu Mao Dang,

218
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,320
a.k.a. 50-Cent Party,

219
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,890
or 50-Cent Army.

220
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,890
The term is almost a decade old.

221
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,020
You might see some of these kind of comments
below this video—

222
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,370
although you can’t necessarily tell

223
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,790
whether that particular person was paid,

224
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,200
or whether he’s actually just supporting
the communist party for free.

225
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,510
At any rate,

226
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,150
when I started this fundraising campaign on
Patreon in 2015,

227
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,870
I decided to call my supporters the “China
Uncensored 50-Cent Army”

228
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,240
as a nod to that.

229
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,950
Good question, Alan.

230
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,050
And thanks to the support of my “China Uncensored
50-Cent Army”—

231
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,710
the people who contribute a dollar or more
per episode—

232
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,800
we can pay our staff,

233
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,490
buy the right equipment,

234
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,310
travel to places like Hong Kong,

235
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,310
and keep this show going.

236
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,230
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

237
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,180
See you next time.
