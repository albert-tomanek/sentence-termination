1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,560
Some people in China are\h
being given fake vaccines.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:15,920
And fake Chinese vaccines could\h
even be spreading around the world.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,480
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,920
For a year, the world has been\h
suffering from the CCP virus—the\h\h

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,160
coronavirus that spread because of the Chinese\h
Communist Party’s initial lies and cover up.\h

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,720
And now, the CCP will save the world by\h
exporting vaccines for the virus it spread.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,600
Just like it saved the world by keeping\h
the coronavirus within its borders,\h\h

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,920
which was an actual propaganda line Chinese\h
state-run media used back in February 2020.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,280
And then when that stopped being true,\h\h

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,560
the Chinese Communist Party saved\h
the world by exporting face masks.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,360
Of course that also kind of backfired.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,320
So now they’ve moved on to exporting vaccines.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
I just pray to Mao those exported\h
vaccines are safe and effective.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,560
Because a substantial number of the vaccine\h
doses being given out in China are fake.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,360
And I don’t mean fake, like\h
only effective half the time,\h\h

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,120
like the official Chinese\h
vaccine being used now in Brazil.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
That’s not fake. That’s standard.\h
Standard made-in-China quality.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,200
No, by “fake,” I mean like how inside China,\h
“Fake vaccines had been made using saline\h\h

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,840
to attract government subsidies for\h
clinics offering emergency vaccinations.”

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,240
Recently, more than 80 people were arrested in\h
a vaccine bust. They were part of a gang that\h\h

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,840
made 3 million dollars from selling\h
water as COVID-19 vaccine shots.\h

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,160
Authorities said the leader and his associates\h\h

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,080
had sold nearly 60,000 syringes\h
with fake vaccines across China.

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,480
In a related case, another scammer shipped\h
600 doses of fake vaccine internationally\h\h

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,040
via Hong Kong, for a profit of 140,000 dollars.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,320
In other cases, counterfeit vaccines were being\h
sold at inflated prices in Chinese hospitals.

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,160
And “other criminals also conducted\h
inoculation programmes of their own\h\h

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,840
and had ‘village doctors’ vaccinate people\h
with fake jabs in their homes and cars.”

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,160
My advice: If a guy dressed like a doctor pulls\h
up in a van and offers to stick a needle in you,\h\h

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,920
walk away. In fact, run away.\h

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,840
Now obviously the Chinese\h
Communist Party is concerned.\h\h

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
Not because fake vaccines mean\h
more people could die from Covid.\h\h

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
If the CCP actually cared about human life,\h
they’d stop killing people for their organs.

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,080
No, the CCP is concerned because,\h
as state-run media puts it,\h\h

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,880
these fake vaccines being sent overseas\h
tarnishes the image of the country.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
And tarnishing the image of\h
the country is Beijing’s job!

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
Last month, the Supreme People's\h
Procuratorate—which is like China’s\h\h

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,880
attorney general—announced it would take action.\h

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,720
It said it would deepen its crackdown\h
on fake vaccine manufacturing—and\h\h

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,360
that there were more than 21 cases\h
of major vaccine fraud across China.\h

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,120
Which is to say, if the top level of the\h
Chinese government is getting involved,\h\h

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,960
fake vaccines could be a much more widespread\h
issue than state-run media will admit.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,040
Here’s another perspective: The\h
cofounder of one Chinese NGO said\h\h

44
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,520
“the focus on criminal activity was a distraction\h
from the genuine threat to people’s health from\h\h

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,120
shoddy, out-of-date, and incorrectly\h
handled vaccines from legitimate sources.”

46
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,240
Great. So... you can’t trust the\h
legitimate sources of the vaccine, either.

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
Sadly, there’s nothing new about fake\h
and low-quality vaccines in China.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,000
This article from five years ago talks\h
about how Chinese authorities pledged\h\h

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,680
to crack down on the black market sale of\h
vaccines for meningitis and rabies. That\h\h

50
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,080
was after a case was made public involving\h
nearly $90 million worth of illegal vaccines\h\h

51
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,200
that were suspected of being\h
sold in dozens of provinces.

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,960
And that crackdown definitely happened, and\h
solved the fake vaccine problem forever.

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,320
Obviously, fake products are\h
sold all the time in China.

54
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
From silly things like knockoff Nike sandals,

55
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,280
and problematic KFC...

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
to more serious products like\h
fake alcohol—which can kill you,

57
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,720
and fake baby formula—which can kill your baby.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,400
So fake vaccines are just another\h
item in a long list of fake products.

59
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,360
Why are fake products so common in China?\h
Well, criminals are going to be criminals. But\h\h

60
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
it’s hard to really crack down on them when the\h
government is also run by a bunch of criminals.\h\h

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,240
Because sometimes criminals collude with each\h
other. The Chinese government might pass a\h\h

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,480
bunch of regulations, but the system is so deeply\h
corrupt that enforcement is close to impossible.\h\h

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,640
And a lot of times when the government announces\h
a big crackdown, it’s only for political reasons.

64
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
They want to look like the good guy—and\h\h

65
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
get Western media to write glowing articles\h
about how China is saving the world.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,280
Meanwhile, Chinese state-run media\h
are doing whatever they can to\h\h

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
discredit Covid vaccines that aren’t from China.

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
As the Global Times says, the US “can\h
either continue to blame and malign China,\h\h

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,840
or join it to help develop and distribute\h
life-saving vaccines around the world.”

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,040
I’m going to give that a hard pass.

71
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,120
Interestingly, Chinese state-run media started\h
on this kick of trying to discredit other\h\h

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
countries’ vaccines after that study came\h
out saying that the Chinese Sinovac vaccine\h\h

73
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,240
was only 50 percent effective.

74
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,200
I’m sure that’s just a coincidence.

75
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,560
But will China’s vaccine propaganda\h
succeed? Well, a recent poll in Taiwan\h\h

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,640
showed that only 1.3 percent of the population\h
would be willing to get a Chinese Covid vaccine.

77
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,520
And now that you’ve watched\h
this episode, you know why.

78
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,360
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from you,\h\h

79
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
a viewer who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Barton Blackorby asks: “Hey Chris, I saw that\h
the CCP is broadcasting their propaganda even\h\h

81
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,320
in Times Square!”—and here’s a link with a\h
photo—“How much have they infiltrated our media?”

82
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,720
Good question, Barton. The answer is complicated.\h
An ad in Times Square probably doesn’t accomplish\h\h

83
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,720
much, aside from wasting Chinese taxpayer money.\h
I’d hardly call that infiltrating our media.

84
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,040
The main ways the CCP infiltrates Western\h
media is by pressuring them to self-censor.\h\h

85
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,320
Take NBC, which has a multi-billion dollar\h
deal to broadcast the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\h\h

86
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,360
It’s a big risk for them to do too\h
much critical reporting on China.

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,720
Or take the Washington Post\h
and the New York Times.\h\h

88
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Until recently, they both took money in exchange\h
for having Chinese propaganda inserts like this.

89
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,040
But more importantly, the billionaire owners\h
of those companies have substantial business\h\h

90
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,840
interests tied to China. Easier\h
to self-censor than anger the CCP.

91
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,280
Having been in the news business for a long\h
time, I can tell you that for every story\h\h

92
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,640
you hear about, a dozen equally important\h
stories get left on the editing room floor,\h\h

93
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,240
as they say. The CCP knows it’s hard to\h
get media to directly publish propaganda,\h\h

94
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,880
but it’s easy to get them to simply\h
ignore certain critical stories.

95
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,000
That being said, the media in the\h
US aren’t monolithic. There are\h\h

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,720
some smaller media that are going a\h
great job covering China. And even from\h\h

97
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,160
big media like the New York Times, you can get\h
individual reporters with good China stories.

98
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,400
But my point is, if there were\h
no influence from the CCP,\h\h

99
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,560
American media as a whole would treat China\h
much more like we treated the Soviet Union—a\h\h

100
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,600
serious threat, instead of an ally\h
we should be getting vaccines from.

101
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
