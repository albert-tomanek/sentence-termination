1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,240
There’s something in the water

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,440
Lurking

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,320
And it’s becoming a global threat

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,600
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,880
Behold, the greatest threat to\h
world peace—Chinese fishermen.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,600
That may sound like a joke, but the Chinese\h
Communist Party is using the country’s fishermen\h\h

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,800
for some truly sinister purposes. And the US is\h
now sending its Coast Guard to deal with it.\h

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,200
But first, did you know YouTube has been\h
secretly unsubscribing people from the show?\h\h

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,320
Make sure you’re still subscribed. Hit\h
that like button because it’s a big help\h\h

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,200

fight censorship with as little as a\h\h

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,880
dollar an episode, over on the\h
crowd funding website patreon.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,880
So you might be wondering, how are Chinese\h
fishermen such a global threat? Well,\h\h

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,520
the Chinese Communist Party is great at\h
weaponizing any part of Chinese society.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,960
One Chinese fisherman doesn’t seem like\h
much of a threat. But when you have a\h\h

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,600
fleet of thousands invading disputed waters,\h
then you’re talking about something different.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,160
In just the first 6 months of 2020, more than 2500\h\h

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,720
Chinese fishing boats were expelled\h
from Japanese territorial waters.

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
And it’s not just Japan.\h

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,120
It’s happened in the Philippines.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,160
And with Pacific Island nations\h
like Fiji, Kiribati, and Palau.\h

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,600
In fact, according to this report by the\h
British Overseas Development Institute,

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,040
China’s deep-water fishing fleet is “5–8\h
times larger than previous estimates”.

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
It's made up of about 12,000 ships\h\h

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,360
that fish in other countries’ waters. And\h
according to this Foreign Policy article...

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,880
China’s fishing fleet is only one in the world\h
that “has a geopolitical mission, taking over\h\h

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,400
weaker countries’ waters and expanding\h
Beijing’s maritime territorial ambitions.”

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,840
It’s not just about asserting China’s rather broad\h
territorial claims of the entire South China Sea.\h

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,720
These Chinese fishing fleets plunder the\h
waters to feed China's massive population,\h\h

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,200
while leaving very little for anyone else.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,880
And this has a huge environmental impact as well.\h\h

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,920
That’s one of the reasons countries\h
around the world were so concerned\h\h

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,200
when these Chinese fishing fleets spent a\h
month surrounding the Galapagos Islands.\h

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,680
In fact, China’s fishing fleet “is\h
regularly implicated in overfishing,\h\h

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,200
targeting of endangered shark species,\h
illegal intrusion of jurisdiction,\h\h

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
false licensing and catch\h
documentation, and forced labour.”

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,880
Why aren’t other countries doing something\h
about it? Well, because they risk the wrath of\h\h

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,360
the Chinese military. These fishing fleets are\h
actually part of the Chinese Communist Party’s\h\h

38
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,920
military force at sea. It’s what’s called\h
the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,640
These maritime militia ships are typically\h
civilian ships, often with crews of fishermen.

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
But like any civilian-owned company in China,\h\h

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
these fishing crews have to answer to the\h
Chinese Communist Party when called upon.

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,560
I did a full episode about these guys called\h
China’s Hidden Navy: The Maritime Militia.\h

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,320
 When called upon, the maritime\h
militia can make aggressive moves,\h\h

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,640
like surrounding disputed waters,\h
or bumping or ramming other ships.\h

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,440
And sometimes, these fishing vessels are\h
also shadowed by China’s coast guard. So\h\h

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,080
when hundreds of “civilian” fishing boats\h
enter your country’s territorial waters,\h\h

47
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
are you going to risk a confrontation\h
with the Chinese military?

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
Recently, China passed the Coast Guard Law.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,240
According to the Lawfare blog, the law allows\h
the Chinese Coast Guard to “‘use all necessary\h\h

50
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,840
measures including weapons’ when China’s\h
‘national sovereignty, sovereign rights,\h\h

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,920
and jurisdiction are being illegally infringed by\h
foreign organizations and individuals at sea.’”

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,960
The US State Department criticized\h
it, saying “Language in the law,\h\h

53
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,000
including text allowing the Coast Guard\h
to destroy other countries’ economic\h\h

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,920
structures and to use force in defending\h
China’s maritime claims in disputed areas,\h\h

55
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,480
strongly implies this law could be used to\h
intimidate the PRC’s maritime neighbors.”

56
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,800
And so the US is doing something about it.\h\h

57
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,400
And that means the US Coast Guard is being\h
deployed very far from home. More after the break.

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Welcome back. Unless you didn’t see\h
an ad because YouTube demonetized us.\h\h

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,440
That’s why we need your support on Patreon.

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,640
In early December, a US coast guard vessel\h\h

61
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,560
was sailing in the waters of Palau. That’s\h
about 6,600 miles from the US coast.

62
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
Ok, that’s really stretching\h
the definition of *Coast* Guard.\h\h

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,240
But the US sent its Coast Guard there for a\h
reason: to bust Chinese ships for illegal fishing.

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
It’s part of a coordinated US effort\h
to counter China’s fishing fleets.\h

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,880
In 2019,\h\h

66
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,640
a US Coast Guard ship even conducted a Freedom\h
of Navigation operation in the Taiwan Strait.

67
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,320
This began with the 2018 Trump\h
Administration’s National Defense Strategy.\h\h

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,240
According to a Senior Policy Analyst at the Rand\h
Corporation, “The biggest transition has been\h\h

69
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,640
the Coast Guard’s more overt signaling about its\h
role in the great power competition with China.”

70
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,720
The US Coast Guard is technically under\h
the Department of Homeland Security.\h\h

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,080
But it’s been working with\h
the Pentagon more and more.\h

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,000
“U.S. government data show Coast Guard vessels\h
spent 326 days in support of the Department of\h\h

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Defense in 2019, compared with an average of just\h
50 to 100 days over the previous five years.”

74
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,640
“All of the 2019 deployments\h
were in the Indo-Pacific.”

75
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Part of the Coast Guard’s work in the Indo-Pacific\h
is fairly mundane. Working with other countries,\h\h

76
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,360
repairing ships, training crews,\h
and replacing navigational buoys.\h

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
But it’s clear the ultimate\h
aim is to counter China.\h

78
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,040
“The Coast Guard is investing more\h
than $19 billion in at least eight\h\h

79
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,320
national-security cutters, 25 offshore-patrol\h
cutters, and 58 fast-response cutters.”

80
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,200
“[These ships] are able to travel farther and\h
faster in worse conditions. They are armed\h\h

81
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,840
with a naval gun system and heavy machine guns,\h
and have decks on which helicopters can land.”

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,840
That sounds like they might be used for\h
a little more than search and rescue.\h

83
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,960
And now it’s time to answer a question\h
from a fan who supports China Uncensored\h\h

84
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,440
Jacob Anthony asks, “Hey Chris can you do a\h
segment over the current state of Falun Gong?\h\h

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
I haven’t heard anything about it in a while.”

87
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,160
Good question. In general, they are still\h
persecuted, still having their organs harvested.\h\h

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,680
Although if you saw our recent podcast with\h
David Matas, who helped expose forced organ\h\h

89
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,920
harvesting in China, that might be changing.\h
Not because the Chinese regime is slowing down,\h\h

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:00,720
but because they might have just killed all\h
the eligible Falun Gong organ “donors.” That’s\h\h

91
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,760
a big reason why Uyghurs are the new Falun\h
Gong—at least in terms of organ harvesting.

92
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:14,720
But here’s an interesting update. This is Peng\h
Bo. He was the deputy director of the 610 Office.\h\h

93
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,960
That’s the Gestapo-like secret police that’s\h
spearheaded the persecution of Falun Gong.\h

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, he’s the latest target of Xi\h
Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign.

95
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,480
For those of you who don’t know, Xi\h
Jinping’s anti corruption campaign\h\h

96
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,960
is really targeted at his political rivals,\h
mostly tied to former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin.\h\h

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,920
Jiang was the one who launched\h
the genocide of Falun Gong.\h

98
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:50,640
And Xi Jinping really seems to have it in for the\h
610 office. Six former directors have been sacked.\h\h

99
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,400
Zhou Yongkang, the highest ranking of\h
them, was sentenced to life in prison.

100
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,800
Does that make up for the fact the\h
Falun Gong organ bank has been depleted?\h\h

101
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,680
Not really. In fact, this isn’t exactly\h
justice. Peng Bo should be arrested for\h\h

102
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,000
crimes against humanity. But the CCP won’t\h
ever admit to any of their crimes. So it’s\h\h

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,800
always some charge of corruption or something\h
unrelated to the actual crimes committed.

104
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,880
But there’s your update Jacob.

105
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:35,840
And thank you for watching. Once again\h
I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
