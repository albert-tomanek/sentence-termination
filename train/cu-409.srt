1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,990
is it Korean War II?

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,910
No, of course not.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,620
The first Korean war technically never ended.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,140
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,150
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,390
North Korea is trolling China.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,310
Maybe even more than I do.

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,599
North Korea, a.k.a. the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea,

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,599
a.k.a.

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:27,939
The True Korea

12
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,710
just launched a test of 4 missiles—

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,410
three of which landed within 200 miles

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,000
of the Japanese coast.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,920
Shooting missiles into the water!

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,570
That’s cause for celebration!

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,570
And believe me,

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,650
you don’t want to be the guy that breaks
off a hug

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,760
prematurely with Kim Jong Un.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,900
The North Korean missile launch

21
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,500
was designed to be as provocative as possible.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,900
It comes as the US and South Korea

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,620
engage in annual military drills,

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,780
known as Foal Eagle.

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,920
A foal is a young horse.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,370
You know, foal eagle.

27
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,440
Previous drills were named Puppy Toucan,

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,410
Porcupette Swan,

29
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,680
and of course, Goose Gosling.

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,750
Kim Jong-un,

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,680
North Korean leader and winner of his fraternity's

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,100
most outstanding brother award,

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,820
said earlier this year that he was in

34
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,370
“the final state in preparations”

35
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,870
for the first test of an intercontinental
missile

36
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,520
that could strike the US.

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,380
Not on Donald Trump’s watch!

38
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,720
But it’s also a sign that for China,

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,980
North Korean relations are going south.

40
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,620
First, it comes during the not-to-be-politically-overshadowed

41
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,640
National People’s Congress.

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,500
It’s one of the biggest political events
of the year,

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,620
as you can see from these extremely engaged
delegates.

44
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,720
Hostess for the event are literally jumping
for joy!

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,600
It’s an annual tradition.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
I mean, what young woman wouldn’t be excited

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,820
to serve tea to an old horny toad?

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,860
But there’s another unintended consequence

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,640
of North Korea’s missile test

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
that has the Chinese regime up in arms.

51
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,020
"We should quickly finish the deployment of THAAD

52
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,640
and acquire a defense system against North Korea's

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,459
nuclear missiles."

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,180
Yes, THAAD!

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,880
China hates THAAD.

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,780
No, THAAD isn't the name of Xi Jinping's

57
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
least favorite fraternity brother.

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,580
THAAD stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense,

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,040
a missile defense system the United States

60
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,220
wants to build in South Korea.

61
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,840
What's that Shelley?

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,300
I see.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,440
As of now,

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,610
it's a missile defense system that the US is

65
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,910
already building in South Korea.

66
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,110
Now you would think,

67
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,420
North Korea has promised to turn Seoul

68
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,160
into a sea of flames,

69
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,400
why would China be upset about South Korea

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,550
having a missile defense system?

71
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,060
Is it because it would be a provocative act

72
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,200
that might further escalate tensions

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,240
on the Korean Peninsula?

74
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,710
Well, partly.

75
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,319
But having a US-built missile defense and
radar system

76
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,330
so close to China

77
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,709
might really cramp the Chinese regime's style—

78
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,240
if they ever decide to launch missiles anywhere.

79
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,560
And so they’ve been doing everything they
can

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,160
to get South Korea to back down.

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,560
I mean, not that China is worried or anything.

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,320
As my favorite state-run media says,

83
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,540
the Chinese military could always blind or
destroy THAAD

84
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,100
if it had to.

85
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,070
Yes, peaceful means are always preferred.

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,050
Otherwise we will crush you.

87
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,800
But what if we could crush you...peacefully?

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,480
You see, China is South Korea’s biggest
trading partner.

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,600
A quarter of all Korean exports go to China,

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,769
almost double the United States.

91
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:56,000
So China could put a lot of economic pressure
on South Korea

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,040
if it starts doing things the Chinese regime
doesn’t like.

93
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,019
Not that they would, of course.

94
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,000
That’s just silly.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,690
I mean,

96
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,010
just let one of the drones from China’s
Foreign Ministry

97
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,700
reassure you!

98
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,880
"We welcome foreign companies,

99
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,340
including South Korean companies,

100
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,860
to invest and operate in China.”

101
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,740
See, nothing to worry about.

102
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,500
“At the same time,

103
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,480
these companies must operate in accordance

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,060
with the law and compliance."

105
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,180
Oh no, never mind, they’re in trouble.

106
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,440
One in particular is in a Lotte trouble.

107
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,490
THAAD is going to be constructed on a golf
course

108
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,020
in the country’s southeast

109
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,880
owned by South Korean mega conglomerate, Lotte.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,360
When I was in South Korea last year,

111
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,020
I saw the Lotte name everywhere.

112
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,760
It’s involved in candy manufacturing,

113
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,460
fast food, retail, heavy chemicals,

114
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,620
IT, construction, entertainment,

115
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,490
and hotels, to name a few.

116
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,720
And the Chinese regime has been striking hard

117
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,949
at its operations in China

118
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:00,370
to retaliate against Lotte.

119
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,500
First, my favorite state run media,

120
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,740
the Global Times made a threat:

121
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,850
“Since China cannot change Lotte’s decision,

122
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,509
Chinese society is also firmly determined

123
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,120
to let Lotte pay the price for its support

124
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,380
of the deployment of THAAD.”

125
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,521
Now, nearly two dozen Lotte retail stores
in China

126
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:20,820
have been shut down.

127
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,580
And Lotte isn’t alone.

128
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,020
The Chinese regime knows how to wage economic
warfare

129
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,669
to get what it wants.

130
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,220
“We saw on Friday some of those shares,

131
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,800
including Hotel Shilla,

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,430
which gets 70% of its duty free sales from
Chinese tourists,

133
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,440
tumbled more than 10%.

134
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,500
So it's a pretty significant impact,

135
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,000
especially for the parts of the South Korean
economy

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,100
catered to Chinese tourists.”

137
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,820
So the Chinese regime is restricting tourism.

138
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,110
And launching cyberattacks.

139
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,199
Over in Japan,

140
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,199
an increasingly aggressive North Korea

141
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,430
has not gone unnoticed either.

142
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,260
"This launch has clearly indicated

143
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,680
that North Korea poses a new level of threat."

144
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
And that new level of threat

145
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,920
is part of the reason why Japan

146
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,289
has also been considering building a THAAD
system

147
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,880
in Japan.

148
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,340
And the Chinese regime would love to see a

149
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,949
better defended and more

150
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,950
militarily active Japan.

151
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,740
So North Korea’s repeated missile and nuclear tests,

152
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,150
and China’s inability to rein them in,

153
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,630
are ruining the Chinese regime’s ability

154
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,639
to apply pressure on its neighbors.

155
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,860
Just a few weeks ago,

156
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,020
China announced it would stop buying coal
from North Korea

157
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,140
til the end of the year.

158
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,400
Coal exports are considered a lifeline to
North Korea,

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,660
one of the key things propping up the regime.

160
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,530
90% of North Korean trade comes from China,

161
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,020
and coal is its biggest export.

162
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,600
But as these most recent missile tests show,

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,979
that didn’t stop North Korea’s aggression.

164
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,690
It’s strange, you know.

165
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,960
North Korea and China used to be like...

166
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,990
well, Mao Zedong said they were

167
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,880
“as close as lips and teeth.”

168
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,970
But now it seems like someone might have bitten
their lip.

169
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,900
Who’s to blame?

170
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,300
Well, the old horny toad.

171
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,370
Former leader Jiang Zemin fully supported
North Korea.

172
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,720
And Jiang’s toadie, Zhou Yongkang,

173
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,070
continued to maintain the close relationship.

174
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,670
And he was even there for both Daddy Kim and
Baby Kim.

175
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,270
But with China’s factional power struggle,

176
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,539
Jiang Zemin and Zhou Yongkang are on their
way out,

177
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,500
and Xi Jinping is taking charge.

178
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,280
That’s changing China’s relationship with
North Korea.

179
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,420
But sadly,

180
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,300
Xi can’t just put the genie back in the
bottle.

181
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,110
So what do you think of the Chinese regime

182
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,289
pressuring South Korea to reject

183
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:53,150
its new missile defense system?

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,690
Leave your comments below.

185
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,280
And speaking of economic pressure,

186
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,700
consider supporting China Uncensored on Patreon.

187
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,479
Viewer support is what makes this show possible.

188
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,669
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

189
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,040
See you next time.

190
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,650
Mark Twain once said,

191
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,410
“Clothes make the man.

192
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,669
Naked people have little or no influence

193
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:17,920
on society.”

194
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,260
That’s why I always wear a suit.

195
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Always.

196
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
But I didn’t always use to have such great
taste in threads.

197
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,020
Until I met Monsieur Brunold.

198
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,440
Hello, Chris!

199
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,379
With 10 years of experience,

200
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,489
Monsieur Brunold selects only the finest materials

201
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,709
for his bespoke suits,

202
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,339
made at his own factory in Europe.

203
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:44,410
The perfect fit for the perfect suit

204
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,020
for the active man,

205
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,279
whether you’re skiing, mountain climbing…

206
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,500
Or Uncensoring China.

207
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,220
So if you would like to look as good as my
friend Chris here,

208
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,380
come visit our Manhattan location.

209
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,189
And the best part is,

210
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,449
he won’t just make you look good,

211
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,519
he’ll teach you everything you need to know

212
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,520
about how to dress.

213
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,800
And as a special bonus to China Uncensored fans,

214
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,769
we’ll include a free custom shirt

215
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:10,140
with the purchase of a custom suit.

216
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,080
So if you want to stand up to the forces of
evil

217
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,600
while looking really good,

218
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,749
come visit Monsieur Brunold next time you’re
in New York.

219
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:18,160
Details are below.
