00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,830
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,800
I will not sanction these sanctions.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,590
China defends good buddy Pakistan

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,270
from mean old Trump.

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,720
And who else but a Chinese human rights lawyer

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,060
would be guilty of subverting state power?

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,520
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,520
Welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,200
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,280
On Wednesday, a huge typhoon struck southern China,

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,200
including Hong Kong and Macau.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,840
Ten people were killed.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,420
Hong Kong authorities did their best

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,580
to make sure their residents were safe,

15
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,059
telling them not to go outside and...

16
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,059
exercise?!

17
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,090
Or go swimming?!

18
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,090
What are you doing?!

19
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,039
Get out of the water!!

20
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,639
The nearby gambling hub of Macau

21
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:46,199
fared less well than Hong Kong.

22
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:47,199
Streets were flooded,

23
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,449
and a lot of buildings lost power.

24
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,440
Fortunately, that meant the casinos

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,670
had to shut down,

26
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,020
saving thousands of gamblers

27
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,829
from losing a ton of money.

28
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,209
We’re going to talk more about

29
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:00,039
Hong Kong and Macau later in the show.

30
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,059
But in the meantime,

31
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,629
the Chinese Communist Party wants you

32
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,530
to know how they feel.

33
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,440
That’s why they invented the phrase,

34
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,380
“hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.”

35
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,380
So the rest of the world

36
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,960
would better understand when they’ve said

37
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,590
or done something they weren’t supposed
to.

38
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,430
According to one Chinese blogger,

39
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,750
state-run People’s Daily,

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,270
“has used the phrase in reference

41
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,550
to 19 different countries and organizations,

42
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,910
ranging from the United States

43
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,200
to the Nobel Committee

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,230
and to NATO.”

45
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,510
What’s that, Shelley?

46
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,040
That was back in 2008?

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,510
Well, who knows how many more countries and
organizations

48
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,890
have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people
since then.

49
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,600
And you should be very concerned

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,850
about the feelings of the Chinese people.

51
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,850
Why just this week,

52
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,130
a professor at the University of Sydney

53
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,210
found that out the hard way.

54
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,200
He dared to make a bold statement

55
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,500
that China has no right to disputed territory

56
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,420
that both China and India claim.

57
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,390
OK, it wasn’t so much of a statement.

58
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,300
It was more like he showed a map.

59
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,340
And it wasn’t so much a map

60
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,030
of the disputed territory per se,

61
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,960
it was a world map.

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,610
And it wasn’t his world map.

63
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,469
It was just the first one that shows up

64
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:12,519
when you Google “world map,”

65
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,519
and he put it on a PowerPoint slide.

66
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,290
And it wasn’t for a geography class or anything.

67
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,400
It was just for an IT class.

68
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,139
And it was 18 months ago.

69
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,660
But if you zoom way, way in,

70
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,209
you can see that the blurry borders

71
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:28,739
show India’s claim,

72
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,719
not China’s.

73
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,140
So Chinese students in his class

74
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,849
began denouncing him on WeChat,

75
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,010
and it became a big thing because,

76
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,010
you know,

77
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,120
he hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.

78
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
So this week

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,810
he was forced to publicly apologize.

80
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,629
I wonder if students suspected him

81
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,950
of using an anti-China map

82
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,959
because his name is Khimji Vaghjiani

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,920
and he looks like this.

84
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,080
Nah.

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,110
Moving on.

86
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,900
With so much focus on feelings,

87
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,909
it’s no wonder that most of the

88
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:00,459
China news this week involved

89
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,689
the Chinese regime telling the rest of the
world

90
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:05,239
how it felt about something else.

91
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,239
For instance:

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,629
the US putting sanctions on Chinese companies

93
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,219
and individuals supporting Kim Jong-Un’s

94
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,450
fantasyland paradise.

95
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,450
China was not happy about

96
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,840
what it called the US’s “mistake.”

97
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,819
“What the United States has done

98
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,109
is not helpful to the resolution

99
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,819
of the issue and is not beneficial

100
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,680
to mutual trust and cooperation

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,609
between China and the United States

102
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:28,900
on this matter.

103
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,189
We ask the United States

104
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,809
to immediately stop its mistake.”

105
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:36,209
The sanctions are the second round since June.

106
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:37,319
They target Chinese companies

107
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,200
that work with North Korea,

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
including three that imported its coal,

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,999
and another one that helped finance

110
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,680
its ballistic missiles program.

111
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,080
And speaking of North Korea’s

112
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,999
ballistic missiles program,

113
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,959
China was not happy about the latest

114
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,510
US-South Korea military drills.

115
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,010
You know, the ones where they prepare

116
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,680
for Kim Jong-un following through

117
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,569
on his threats to nuke South Korea

118
00:03:58,569 --> 00:03:59,579
and the US.

119
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,319
“We think that South Korea and the United
States

120
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,010
holding joint drills is not beneficial

121
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,099
to easing current tensions nor the efforts

122
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,269
by all sides to promote talks."

123
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,849
That’s a bit of an overreaction.

124
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,959
Considering they were the least aggressive—

125
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,000
and quite possibly lamest—

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,410
joint military drills ever.

127
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,410
They were just sitting around

128
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,250
simulating drills on computers

129
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,140
at the Korea Battle Simulation Center.

130
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,250
Meanwhile, in Virginia on Monday,

131
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,760
President Trump outlined his new Middle East
Strategy.

132
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,290
And then he dropped this bomb.

133
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,690
A figurative bomb.

134
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,320
Probably need to be clear about that.

135
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,890
“We can no longer be silent about

136
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,610
Pakistan's safe havens for terrorist organizations,

137
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,920
the Taliban,

138
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,480
and other groups that pose a threat

139
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,250
to the region and beyond.”

140
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,220
Hmm, I wonder if this hurt the feelings

141
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
of Pakistan’s biggest ally and trading partner,

142
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
China.

143
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Let’s check in again

144
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,440
with the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

145
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,020
“Pakistan is on the front line

146
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,770
in the struggle against terrorism.

147
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,010
It has actively made efforts

148
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,220
and great sacrifices

149
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,280
to combat terrorism for years

150
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,980
and has made important contributions

151
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,670
to safeguarding regional

152
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,040
and global peace and stability.”

153
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,580
I’m sure India might disagree,

154
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,610
but China and India aren’t exactly seeing

155
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,330
eye to eye right now—

156
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,090
considering their most recent bilateral meeting

157
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,580
included border soldiers

158
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,960
throwing rocks at each other.

159
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
To be clear,

160
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,590
that’s the same dispute that we talked about
last week,

161
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,160
but now there’s video!

162
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,330
So as you can see,

163
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,040
they are definitely throwing rocks at each
other...

164
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,110
or playing capture the flag.

165
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,290
Really, it could be either one.

166
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,860
But feelings were probably hurt on both sides.

167
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,220
And speaking of feelings,

168
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,290
have you been wondering how the Chinese regime

169
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,080
feels about the US State Department’s

170
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,720
latest International Religious Freedom Report?

171
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,040
It slammed China with harsh language,

172
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,880
calling China one of 7 countries

173
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,640
“of particular concern”.

174
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,140
Other countries include North Korea and Iran.

175
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,110
Well, China is back with some harsh words
for the US.

176
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,120
“Everyone has seen that the facts

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,820
prove the United States is not totally perfect.”

178
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,230
She was referring to what happened

179
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,510
in Charlottesville,

180
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,270
Because a handful of idiots shouting

181
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,270
“Jews will not replace us”

182
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,440
and ruining tiki torches for everyone

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,200
is exactly equivalent to the ruling Chinese
regime

184
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,410
killing tens of thousands of religious believers

185
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,410
and then selling their organs

186
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,010
on the black market.

187
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,100
The point is,

188
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,210
China has great religious freedom.

189
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,930
“The Chinese government fully respects

190
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,150
and protects people’s religious freedom

191
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,920
according to the law.

192
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,150
People from all ethnic groups and regions

193
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,900
fully possess religious freedom

194
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,850
according to the law.”

195
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,510
Speaking of rule of law in China,

196
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,990
a prominent human rights lawyer

197
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,780
just confessed on state-run television

198
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,580
to subverting state power.

199
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,000
I fully realize that my actions of inciting subversion of state power and overthrowing

200
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,900
the socialist system violate the law and constitute crimes.

201
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,140
In the past,

202
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,100
Jiang Tianyong had accused the Chinese regime

203
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,850
of torturing another prominent human rights
lawyer.

204
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,660
It was a brave thing to do.

205
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,240
Like a lamb calling out a wolf

206
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,630
for eating other lambs.

207
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,730
He also defended blind human rights activist

208
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,700
Chen Guangcheng and Falun Gong practitioners.

209
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,460
This guy had some real guts, is what I’m
saying.

210
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,760
But then he was secretly detained

211
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,600
and probably tortured for 10 months.

212
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
And now he’s a reformed man!

213
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,920
This week, he clarified on state-run media

214
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,380
that all the things he said about the Chinese
regime

215
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,670
torturing that other human rights lawyer

216
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,160
were just lies—

217
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,740
and he made them up to curry favor

218
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,450
with foreign media.

219
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,320
You see, he was deceived

220
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,121
after being indoctrinated by the

221
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:46,650
“bourgeois Western constitutional system.”

222
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,610
Those were words he spoke during the trial

223
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,450
that were totally not scripted at all.

224
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,080
He deeply regrets his actions.

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,320
So who else do you think is guilty

226
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,180
of so-called “hurting the feelings of the
Chinese people”?
