1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,740
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we’re playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,880
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello!

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,420
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,500
It--

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,840
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,240
Bienvenue, YouTube!

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,420
Ah, très bien!

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,640
In front of me I’ve got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can’t see it.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,460
Every fact they get right is
a point and a ding,

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,120
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers, which is...

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,340
And today we are talking about Atomic Annie.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,280
Oh! Is it a terrible way to teach people how
to do resuscitation?

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,000
“Now children, after the bombs fall,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,140
“you may find that the person you’re resuscitating
has bad breath.”

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,250
Am I guessing it’s not an Atomic Ruj…
res…?

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,920
Put your teeth in, try it one more time.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,480
Resusci Anne.

19
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,489
No, it’s not.

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,489
Who is a real person.

21
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,610
- What?
- Who is?

22
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,760
Resusci Anne.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,640
You know the thing you use when you’re doing
resuscitation practice, the face.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,810
Oh, so you can walk down the street,
“oh, I recognise you from… oh.”.

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,710
Well. Let us cast our minds back to 18th,
no, I think it must be 19th Century Paris.

26
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,140
Or early 20th Century Paris, whatever…

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,640
Pick a decade, any decade!

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,649
Who noticed she had that weird click when you
pressed her chest, and what were they doing?

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,570
You know she was a dead body
pulled out the Seine, right?

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,500
No, no!

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,520
Yeah, the Resusci Annie is based on an unidentified
corpse that was pulled out of the Seine

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,380
and they cast the face.

33
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,880
This is where it gets grim, the person who
did the autopsy… something like the…

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,950
Yeah, because before that it was bucket of
f***ing laughs!

35
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,090
No, this is just a Thursday night in Paris
so far.

36
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,280
They pulled the body out and whoever was doing
the autopsy thought she was so beautiful,

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,460
they made a cast of her face and that is the
face that is used on the Resusci Anne dolls.

38
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,079
I’m not giving you any points because it’s
not even remotely related to the subject,

39
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,069
but you are entirely right.

40
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,389
By a process of elimination we know what it
isn’t, though, eh, Sherlock?

41
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:04,460
It’s like someone came along and went,
“Now that’s a fit corpse.”

42
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah!

43
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,140
No. No.

44
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,800
My God, when you put it that way, yes, yes…

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,260
It again raises the question
of the clicking noise.

46
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,290
You are absolutely right.

47
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,160
A young woman whose death mask because a fixture
on the walls of artist’s homes.

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Urgh.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,450
Yeah. Don’t do that.

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,739
Is it in the testing sites?

51
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,299
Is it the fridge that Indiana Jones went in?

52
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,400
No, that’s Atomic Smeg which raises more
questions, yet again.

53
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,360
It is certainly military hardware, but you’re
not close enough to get a point here.

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,450
Is it when they tried to power a plane with
a nuclear reactor in the 50s?

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,450
Ooh, no.

56
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,450
Damn it!

57
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,720
- Oh s***! Really?
- What was that, I haven’t got…?

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,110
It was when atomic power was The Way of The Future
and Would Harm No One!

59
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,910
Erm, did you not see what we just did, guys?

60
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,830
Anyway, they were building nuclear reactors
down to, I presume, like the size of this stage

61
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,689
and they put in a, well, it must have been
a B29, because it was a prop…

62
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,760
It was a B36 according to this.

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,520
I’m sorry, it must have been a B36.

64
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,020
Cut that.

65
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
Anyway, they made a nuclear powered aeroplane,

66
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,299
and I don’t think it worked ’cos they’ve
stopped doing it.

67
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:10,750
Ain’t that an episode of Thunderbirds?

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,090
They never actually connected the engines
to the propeller.

69
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,659
Now that’s where they went wrong.

70
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,659
That would be why it didn’t work!

71
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,909
That would be why it didn’t work, I’m
not a scientist, but I--

72
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,829
“I've turned both bits on, it’s not going
anywhere!”

73
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,720
Some dude stood in the middle of the plane
going, “Huh, huh?”

74
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,820
Have a go…

75
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,879
“Oh no, metric and imperial!”

76
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,409
If there’s one thing that too much
science fiction has taught me,

77
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,599
it's that going like that immediately results
in a load of sparks

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,470
and you’re going, “Argh”!

79
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,660
Yes, but it might have taken off!

80
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,180
Yes, but you’re fine after it!
You’ve saved something.

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
No.

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,160
We've not got off the blocks! This is the
longest we’ve ever been stuck with nowhere.

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,780
Is it a Blondie album?

84
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,330
Oh f***.

85
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,959
It’s an atomic something
and it’s ground-based ordinance here.

86
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,959
Cannon!

87
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,870
Point. You are absolutely right.

88
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,450
Ground-based ordinance. Cannon…

89
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,450
Trebuchet…

90
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,480
Atomic trebuchet! Bloody hell, you could!

91
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,359
Are you firing atomic things, or is this just
a massive atomic powered structure?

92
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,849
It’s an atomic powered thing that fires…
Atomic Kitten.

93
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:17,790
That would go for… miles? I don’t know.

94
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,340
But only when the tide is high.

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
Atomic Kitten songs…

96
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,080
’Cos if you’re going to fire at it something,
it’ll make a hole again.

97
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,440
And cause an eternal flame.

98
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,040
Chris, Chris, it’s okay, it’s okay.

99
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,540
It's Okay is another... Atomic...

100
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,400
I can’t believe that’s the third time
I’ve done the walk out.

101
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,140
So the atomic cannon, then?

102
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes, an atomic cannon developed about when?

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
50s.

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Tuesday!

105
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Wednesday, in the 50s.

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,900
Yes, have a point, early 1950s, I’m giving
Matt the point there.

107
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,350
At the beginning of the Cold War.

108
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,440
Well, of course it was 50s if it was atomic.

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,160
They developed for three years, the idea being

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,110
to make a cannon
that would fire a small nuclear device.

111
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,240
That’s ballsy.

112
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,720
How did they get it around?

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,460
Train!

114
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,360
How big was this thing?

115
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,400
Very.

116
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,180
Train. Very.

117
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,360
Ding. Quicker…

118
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,940
Correction. Two trains!

119
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,740
Bigger!

120
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,600
I’m giving you a point for big, and I’m
giving you a point for two.

121
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,540
It was two tractors, but it required two extra-long
fire trucks to move the thing.

122
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
- Okay.
- Ooh.

123
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,000
It is an 84 tonne gun.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,650
Did it need to be that big?

125
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,710
Yes! If you’re firing atomic weapons,

126
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,330
you want it far enough away that
the blast wave doesn’t get you,

127
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,280
which means it needs to be a-big,
as previously mentioned.

128
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,240
Yes, you are absolutely right.
What was its effective firing range?

129
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,640
Far!

130
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,720
Somewhere in three digits of miles.
Price is Right rules!

131
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Six.

132
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Miles?

133
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,970
I haven’t specified a unit.

134
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,190
I will say 200 miles, Price is Right, go…

135
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,910
Six miles.

136
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,910
A furlong.

137
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,560
That’s not very far.

138
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,030
It might have been a failure, it came out
the top and just went “plunk”.

139
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,290
Which is not great for an atomic device, but
no, about 20 miles, so have a point.

140
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,650
And they did actually fire this.
Where did they fire this?

141
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,650
In the desert.

142
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,710
I’ll give you a point for the desert, the
Nevada test site.

143
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,960
Yes, that one that you can still go to, weirdly,
on a day trip.

144
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,420
It’s a bit far.

145
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,880
They do…

146
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,740
Not from here, unless you’re going by nuclear
cannon, obviously.

147
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,580
Did Bach ever write an atomic canon?

148
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,140
Did what? Oh, for God’s sake.

149
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,560
That’s a hell of an organ.

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,690
That’s right, it’s the classical music
gags, everybody!

151
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,880
The test was successful, they made 20 of the
cannons. They cost...

152
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
What, 20?

153
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,750
What were they planning on doing in the
50s with 20 cannons?!

154
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,490
Shooting the Russians, remember?

155
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,490
Miles away!

156
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,170
No, no in all fairness…

157
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,420
Have a point.

158
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,250
How big is the land gap
between the US and Russia?

159
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,030
Drive to an empty bit of Alaska and shell
an empty bit of Russia and just go pfft!

160
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,720
Can I just use three words:

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,560
moral f***ing victory!

162
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,510
What you’ve invented there, Gary, is a really
bad intercontinental ballistic missile.

163
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,760
Well this is, isn’t it, basically?

164
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,870
Yes, but it wasn’t just Europe and Russia
it was deployed to,

165
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,720
where else would they have sent it to?

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,710
Did they send it to Korea to s*** them up?

167
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,360
Yes they did. What were some of the problems
with this?

168
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,700
Didn’t work.

169
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,440
It did work.

170
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,690
It got all leaves in it.

171
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,500
Everything that was carrying it went backwards
faster than the thing went forwards.

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,810
When they got there it wasn’t really all
that useful, why not?

173
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,170
Because the Russians had invented an atomic
super cannon.

174
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,170
Yes, it’s called an
intercontinental ballistic missile.

175
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,140
As we scientists call it.

176
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,810
Yes, you’re absolutely right, better things
had been invented.

177
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,110
So, while they still had it and it was still
a prestige weapon

178
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,240
they didn’t ever actually fire it.

179
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,500
In the end they realised they could just make
atomic shells for what?

180
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,460
Beaches.

181
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,620
Any artillery piece in the inventory.

182
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,030
Exactly right. They didn’t need the cannon,

183
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,030
they could just build a bigger regular cannon
and put a nuclear shell in it.

184
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,880
There was something else here called
the Davy Crockett weapon system.

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,372
This was an attempt to put a nuclear device
in another bit of weaponry,

186
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,760
what might this have been?

187
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
A firework!

188
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,960
Oh, we’re not back to wedging things in
cats, are we?

189
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
A sword!

190
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,280
“Drive me closer! I want to hit them with
my nuclear sword!”

191
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,730
How would that even work?

192
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,690
You perch it on the end like…

193
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,589
The Davy Crockett weapon system!

194
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:35,589
Musket!

195
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,589
Bullets.

196
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:39,899
You know what you’re closer,
it was a recoilless rifle.

197
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,060
So essentially a rocket launcher with
a nuclear bomb on the end of it.

198
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,800
And it didn’t have any recoil?

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,399
Recoilless rifle essentially means
the back end is open,

200
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,420
so you’re basically putting a hollow tube up
and the exhaust gases come out the back.

201
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,760
A hollow tuba?

202
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,700
They’re all hollow. That’s how they work.
If they weren't hollow, you'd just...

203
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Oh, yeah!

204
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,440
Solid tuba!

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,019
Do you want to do the gesture?
We’ve all done it once.

206
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,600
Come on, get in on this.

207
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,300
What were some of the problems with this,

208
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,240
with a shoulder mounted rocket
launcher nuclear weapon?

209
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
You had to carry the ammunition!

210
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,459
And it’s right next to your head.

211
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,660
That didn’t have the range to get you out
of blast distance.

212
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,560
And that’s the big one, yes.

213
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,629
Who the f*** is going to fire it?!

214
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:33,259
“So this is fine, yeah?” “Yeah.”

215
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,950
“It’s glowing, you know that don’t you?”
“Yes, yes, it’s all cool.”

216
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,330
“If this hits that guy am I dead as well?”

217
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,080
“Yeah.” “Fuck you.”

218
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,670
Just drop it. Just drop it!

219
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,269
In fact, far worse, he dies instantly, you
get a slow lingering death.

220
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,900
Yes. That’s the other problem.

221
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,200
Instantly lethal within 150 metres of where
it hits,

222
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,510
fatal dose within a quarter mile of landing.

223
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,510
Just drop it.

224
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,069
Just leg it!

225
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:59,899
Also, what couldn’t you do to the bomb after
you fired it?

226
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,899
Pick it up.

227
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,899
Hug it.

228
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:02,899
Juggle it.

229
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,899
Use it again.

230
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,940
Paint a watercolour.

231
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,800
I said “fired”, not landed.

232
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,060
It’s not like you’re going to abort it,
it explodes with a nuclear bomb…

233
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,240
If it’s going to get you anyway,
it’s going to get you sooner if you abort it.

234
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,250
There wasn’t an abort option,
that was the problem.

235
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,779
No, it’s a nuclear bomb!
You’ve already fired it!

236
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,000
But that’s not what sets off a nuclear bomb.

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
- Yes.
- That’s true that.

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,629
You fire it or you drop it or whatever, and
then the timer sets it off.

239
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,009
Because nuclear bombs have
accidentally fallen out, haven't they,

240
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,870
and gone off but not exploded,

241
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,889
because there’s one.. is there one off the
coast of Spain, or something like that?

242
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,550
Oh, don’t look up “list of nuclear accidents”
on Wikipedia.

243
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,589
Yeah, it’s terrifying.

244
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:40,589
Seriously.

245
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,589
There’s certainly one off the waters of,
I think it’s Georgia in the US?

246
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:44,589
So yeah, have a point.

247
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:45,910
But you don’t want to turn the timer off,

248
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,790
because then you’ve given it to them and
they’re just going to throw it back to you.

249
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,790
In the post!

250
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,759
Oh that’s a good point.
Did you just say in the post?

251
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,009
Well, you just set the timer
a little bit longer!

252
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:56,070
You just wind it up!

253
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,680
You address it in a big box that looks like
a birthday cake. You put it in the mail.

254
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,399
Why would you have a box that looks like a
birthday cake?

255
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,319
Because that box that
looks like a birthday cake

256
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,970
is in a bigger box that looks like the kind
of box a birthday cake might come in.

257
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,629
Oh, that’s me told!

258
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,629
Inception boxing!

259
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,069
Are you a spy, and you haven’t told us?

260
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:16,040
Alright, and then you address it to

261
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,420
“Head of FBI, the Pentagon.
Happy birthday.”

262
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,339
and then like your mum always does on birthday
cards,

263
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,509
“Do not open until…”

264
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:25,060
And he’ll go, “Oh, for my birthday, it’s
in a few weeks.”

265
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,460
Puts it in the corner of his office,
opens it up, a cake!

266
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,660
Cuts into the cake,

267
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,210
and that’s when your timer goes off.

268
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,740
Don’t you get it so the bomb pops out of
the cake and goes, “Happy Birthday, Mr President…”

269
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,340
An atomic Marilyn Monroe!

270
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,720
Talk about a blonde bombshell.

271
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,000
Really? Really?

272
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,160
Yes, that’s your one for the season,
let 'em clap.

273
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
Tom, that’s a beautiful shot.

274
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,089
No, to be fair that was you bowling it
straight down the middle of the crease

275
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,760
and we’re just going, “oh, this is easy.”

276
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,740
You met it well. I'll give it…

277
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Ha, crease…

278
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,540
Meanwhile, in Britain.

279
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,500
There is a somewhat related
slightly ridiculous weapon project here.

280
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,020
Oh, as opposed to where we’ve been
perfectly sensible up to now.

281
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes, and it’s called Blue Peacock.

282
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,079
This was a British attempt to create a tactical
nuclear weapon.

283
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,760
They were going to put nuclear mines in Germany.

284
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,379
S***!

285
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,850
What’s the problem with burying something
like that, that's electronic...

286
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,759
- You don’t know where the f*** you’ve put it!
- You don’t know where it is.

287
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,269
That is one problem, yes.

288
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,209
One problem with that is that during the winter
it gets very cold,

289
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:40,850
the electronics don’t work.

290
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,160
How do you keep something like that underground
warm? What was the plan?

291
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,449
Thermos flask.

292
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,200
Sending sheep out to wee on it.

293
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,700
I’m never going camping with you, ever.

294
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,760
This only needed to last a week or so. So
how do you keep that warm for a week?

295
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,580
Oil fire.

296
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,800
Blankets.

297
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,480
No, it’s something that is going to generate
its own heat for a while.

298
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,640
A cat.

299
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,020
You are very close.

300
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh God.

301
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
Cows.

302
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,330
A bit big to bury there with a nuclear mine.

303
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,259
They buried animals with the things?

304
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,199
The plan was to bury a chicken.
So I’m going to give you the point.

305
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,300
F***ing hell!

306
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,992
Who goes, “okay, we’ve got this bomb,
this high tech nuclear thing…”

307
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:19,110
Yep, we need to keep it warm.

308
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,200
“What we need to is we put it
underground and we need to keep it warm,

309
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,420
“what do we need to put it on?

310
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
“Chickens!”

311
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:25,959
No, Jeff, Jeff,
we can come up with a better solution.

312
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:26,959
- “Chickens!”
- “Chickens.”

313
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,170
Hang on here, are we talking a box here with
a live chicken in it,

314
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,670
and an egg-sized nuclear weapon so that the
chicken just gives it this number

315
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,499
until the timer goes off.

316
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,149
That sounds like it would work.

317
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,790
Yeah, that was the plan,
it never actually happened.

318
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,319
Isn’t it a motion detection bomb and you’re
putting a chicken,

319
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:45,579
one of the flappiest animals….

320
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,560
It doesn’t detect itself.

321
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,779
So how do you set it off,
do you step on the chicken?

322
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:52,829
Well it’s a mine, right,
so you make your box,

323
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:53,829
you put your chicken in the box.

324
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:54,829
Oh, the chicken’s in the mine?

325
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:55,829
Yes.

326
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:57,870
You put your chicken in the box, you put your
pressure pad on top,

327
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,199
or whatever and then you put your…

328
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,029
Right so you’ve got this really, really
high tech thing

329
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,579
and then you put a chicken inside it,

330
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,550
because that’s what is going to make this
high-tech thing better!

331
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,050
Yes, because it will keep it at a working
temperature

332
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,699
without needing to plug anything into it or
keep it running.

333
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,980
I sometimes have problems starting my car
in the winter,

334
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,670
shall I put a f***ing chicken in the engine?

335
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,800
No, just get a normal chicken, the f***ing
ones are too distracted.

336
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,300
Can you imagine the--

337
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,360
Warm, cold, warm, cold, warm, cold.

338
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,740
NATO's retreated that-a-way, right.

339
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,700
You approach what is... you won’t even signpost
it as a minefield would you, like today.

340
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,780
You would
just probably see the field.

341
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,580
“Chicken farm.”

342
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,779
And suddenly…

343
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,500
“Free eggs, please come in…”.

344
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,900
In Russian.

345
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,400
It says it in English but with “in Russian”
in brackets underneath.

346
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,839
But you approach this mysteriously
newly dug field,

347
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,749
that has nothing on it apart from the sound
of clucking from beneath.

348
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,800
Well let’s face it, it works doubly then

349
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,500
because you f***ing wouldn’t follow them
over that field!

350
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,420
“What the s*** is going on here?”
You'd go back to...

351
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,550
“What is it?” “A field of ghost chickens...”

352
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,139
At which point, one of the chickens has pecked
his way out

353
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,240
and suddenly from beneath the soil,
a chicken’s head just pops out.

354
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,600
No, no, it’s got to do Night of the Living
Dead, it’s got to be the right wing.

355
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Ohh!

356
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,100
Suddenly irradiated chickens start popping
out of the ground all over,

357
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,720
and that’s before the bomb’s gone off!

358
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,740
Proposed, seconded, get ’em built…

359
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,749
Can I just say, Suddenly Irradiated Chicken
is the name of my new prog band,

360
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:25,999
for reals this time.

361
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,990
I like you have The Cluck from Below
like it’s a horror film.

362
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,990
The Cluck from Below!

363
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,550
“New from M. Night Showaddywaddy:
The Cluck from Below.”

364
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,550
Many animals were harmed in the making of
this movie.

365
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,980
So at the end of the show,
congratulations Matt, you win this week.

366
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,400
Woo! Yay.

367
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,139
Congratulations. You win a rope
that keeps out vultures

368
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,160
owned by the star of Gavin and Stacey and
the Late, Late Show.

369
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,980
It’s James Corden’s Condor Cordon.

370
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,730
So do enjoy that.

371
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,660
Until then we say thank you to Chris Joel,

372
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
to Gary Brannan,

373
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,160
to Matt Gray.

374
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,080
Bye, bye.

375
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,720
I’ve been Tom Scott,
we’ll see you next time.
