1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,520
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,010
Leaders of the 20 biggest economies

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,760
meet at the world’s most awkward lunch table.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,150
Got a pirate problem?

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,440
Try putting Chinese troops in Djibouti.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,820
And Chinese human rights lawyer

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,280
Liu Xiaobo just passed away.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,970
We, will not be making jokes about that...

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,460
This is China Uncensored.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,020
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,760
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,169
Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate

13
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:34,370
Liu Xiaobo passed away on Thursday.

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,929
The cause of death was subversive thoughts—

15
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,730
which then led to terminal liver cancer.

16
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,100
At least that’s what the Communist Party

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,620
would like you to think.

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,620
Actually,

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,539
he was serving an 11-year prison sentence,

20
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,070
where years of mistreatment

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,289
didn’t exactly do wonders for his health.

22
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,079
But rather than “Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo
Dies in Prison,”

23
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,850
the Chinese regime felt that

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,239
“Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo Dies in Hospital
Care

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,019
Granted by the Benevolent Party”

26
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,280
sounded like a better headline.

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,700
So when his health got so bad

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,479
it was clear he was going to die,

29
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,070
they released him on medical parole

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,659
to a hospital, where he got the best care,

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,740
while still guarded 24/7.

32
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,579
They even allowed foreign doctors to look
at him.

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,369
So I mean, no one’s going to blame

34
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,329
the Chinese Communist Party, right?

35
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:22,799
Look, state-run Global Times

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,070
lays it out so clearly,

37
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,260
“It’s Liu’s personal misfortune

38
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,940
to have been diagnosed with cancer,

39
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,270
but this has nothing to do

40
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,580
with his imprisonment.”

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,700
Riiight.

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,719
Just like it was also Liu’s personal misfortune

43
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,229
to have all those subversive thoughts

44
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,260
in the first place.

45
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,200
It’s a tragic situation all around,

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,329
but on the bright side,

47
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,420
at least Norway can sell salmon to China again.

48
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,520
That’s right,

49
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,340
after Liu got the Nobel,

50
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,380
the Chinese regime punished Norway

51
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,299
by no longer buying their salmon.

52
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,200
Even though Norway doesn’t decide

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,729
who gets Nobel Prizes.

54
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,329
You can’t make this stuff up.

55
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,140
Speaking of awkward international relations
with China...

56
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,380
maybe you can relate to this.

57
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,289
You’re in an intimate moment

58
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,050
with someone you care about,

59
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,399
and you...accidentally call them

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,489
by the wrong name.

61
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,790
Well, that’s what happened to the US

62
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,930
and China earlier this week.

63
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,650
Last weekend was the G20 Summit,

64
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,860
an annual meeting of the leaders

65
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,690
of the world’s 20 largest economies.

66
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,180
And while President Trump and Chinese leader
Xi Jinping

67
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,160
both happened to be there anyway,

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,020
why not hold bilateral US-China talks

69
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,080
on the side?

70
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,860
What could go wrong?

71
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,540
Apparently this: an official White House statement

72
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,560
released ahead of the meeting

73
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,620
accidentally called China

74
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,599
the “Republic of China”—

75
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,069
and not, as it should have been,

76
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,440
the “People’s Republic of China.”

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,799
Because “Republic of China”

78
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,330
actually means Taiwan.

79
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,210
You have to add “people’s”

80
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,850
to make it communist.

81
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,850
Awkward!

82
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,020
It’s ok though.

83
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,800
An apology was made,

84
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,830
and accepted.

85
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,880
I think these two will be just fine.

86
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Wait a minute,

87
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,810
what’s that Xi is putting on Trump’s back?

88
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,989
Speaking of being friendly with world leaders,

89
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,049
Russian President Vladimir Putin has become

90
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,470
the first non-Chinese leader

91
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,300
Chinese people weren’t allowed to criticize.

92
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,860
It couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy!

93
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
During the G20,

94
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,260
netizens in China discovered

95
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,330
they couldn’t even mention Putin’s name

96
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,420
without their posts being blocked.

97
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,349
Now, Putin and Björk have something in common:

98
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,840
They’re both blocked on Weibo,

99
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,510
China’s version of Twitter.

100
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,040
Also, they both appreciate

101
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,390
the grace and beauty of long-necked birds.

102
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,390
But you might think,

103
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,170
hey, censorship doesn’t affect China’s

104
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,540
savviest Internet users;

105
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,590
a lot of them just use VPN software

106
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,739
to jump over the firewall—

107
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,019
presumably to access the banned Icelandic

108
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:43,819
experimental electro-pop music

109
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,640
they’ve all been craving.

110
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,380
Well, that’s about to change.

111
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,269
The Chinese regime wants to stop people

112
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,120
from using VPNs.

113
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,019
Unless they’re government-approved VPNs.

114
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,980
Which kind of defeats the purpose.

115
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,560
Which would once and for all

116
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,530
make the Chinese Internet, really an Intranet.

117
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,640
The Chinese Internet blocks foreign social media

118
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,420
like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube,

119
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,160
as well as what the outside world calls

120
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,939
“facts.”

121
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,629
But people still get access using VPNs—

122
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,629
at least for now.

123
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:13,909
But don’t worry,

124
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,040
I have a feeling people will still be able

125
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,400
to fully enjoy their daily visits

126
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,410
to the English language Twitter account

127
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,840
of state-run People’s Daily.

128
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,720
A panda live stream!

129
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,500
Wow.

130
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,720
Give me more.

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,750
But if China doesn’t have your heart,

132
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,320
at least it has Djibouti.

133
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
China has just sent troops

134
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,210
to its first overseas military base.

135
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,479
It’s in Djibouti.

136
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,650
Don’t worry,

137
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,560
it’s for “anti-piracy” efforts.

138
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,850
Not this kind of piracy;

139
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,500
China doesn’t care about that.

140
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
They want to stop this kind of piracy.

141
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,210
This is absolutely not

142
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,820
a sinister communist plot

143
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,860
to invade Djibouti.

144
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,940
And those troops are lucky to be in Djibouti.

145
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,410
Because the Chinese Communist Party

146
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,800
is downsizing its People’s Liberation Army

147
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,370
to under a million troops.

148
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,740
Before the first round of layoffs

149
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,300
hit in 2015,

150
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
there were 2.3 million soldiers

151
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,410
in the People’s Liberation Army.

152
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,199
But I guess with even under a million,

153
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,820
there’s still enough troops to put in Djibouti.

154
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,800
I know, this video was fantastic.

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,400
You're welcome.

156
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
But it doesn't stop here.

157
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,040
You can watch this and two more segments on ChinaUncensored.tv

158
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,320
right now.

159
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,960
Yes, we're posting entire half-hour episodes to our website

160
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,260
