On this episode of China Uncensored, How the
cure for malaria almost wasn't.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:14,180
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell. So what do you think

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,919
of when you hear 'secret communist plot?'
My guess is it's probably not

4
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,140
'Nobel Prize winning cure for malaria.'

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,339
In fact maybe you didn't even know there was
a cure for malaria. Every year, the US invests

6
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:32,689
millions of dollars into providing a life
saving malaria drug called Artemisinin. The

7
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:37,899
thing is, despite the drug being discovered
in the 70s, the World Health Organization

8
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:46,160
didn't endorse it until 2000, and it wasn't
until 2006 that it became widely available.

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,050
So how is it possible that a cure for a disease
that killed nearly a million people a year

10
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,230
existed for 30 years but was never used?

11
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,190
Partly because most malaria victims are poor
children in Africa.

12
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,390
And partly because the cure was discovered
in communist China.

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,190
It began as a secret project started by Mao
Zedong in 1967—one that just earned the

14
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:18,100
formerly unheralded Chinese scientist Dr.
Tu Youyou the Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution.

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,210
It was the Vietnam War! War, huh, good God,
y'all, what is it good for?

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,700
Finding a cure for malaria, apparently.

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,390
Communist forces in North Vietnam who were
fighting the Americans were dying of malaria.

18
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,380
So they asked Mao Zedong to help them find
a cure. No problem! I mean, except for the

19
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,850
fact that in China, Cultural Revolution was
raging out of control, the education system

20
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,260
was shut down, and Western trained scientists
were being persecuted and sometimes killed.

21
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,410
But Mao still managed to wrangle up 500 scientists
to work on the malaria cure. It was called

22
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:01,210
Project 523. And fortunately, he didn't interfere
when some of the scientists looked to traditional

23
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,050
Chinese medicine for answers.

24
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,000
Dr. Tu discovered a two thousand year old
recipe for treating malaria involving an herb

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,980
called sweet wormwood. She refined that traditional
recipe into a usable drug, and then adopted

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,910
the Western method of doing clinical trials.
For human experiments, she tested it on herself

27
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,790
first to see if it was safe. Patients with
malaria were cleared of the disease in about

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,730
a day with no major side effects.

29
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,920
Meanwhile, the anti-malaria drug being developed
in the West was less effective. Because in

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,750
addition to treating malaria, it also caused
nightmares, paranoia, and may have driven

31
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,040
several Special Forces to go soldiers insane,
making them kill their wives.

32
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,780
So why didn't this traditional Chinese cure
become available? Maybe it was the fact that

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,430
Mao died and China spent decades in political
turmoil. Maybe it was that patent laws didn't

34
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,760
exist under communism and no big drug companies
could make money off it. Or maybe it was because

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,750
Dr. Tu was never elected to the prestigious
Chinese Academy of Sciences—because most

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,310
of those positions were filled by phony scientists,
many of whom held high government titles.

37
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,450
Whatever the reason, an effective cure for
malaria languished for decades...as, according

38
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,400
to UNICEF, malaria killed one child ever 30
seconds. Not in time to help North Vietnam,

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,300
obviously.

40
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,990
And even though the drug became widely available
in 2006, it wasn't until 2011 that Dr. Tu

41
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,780
got the first recognition for her role in
its discovery, when she won the Lasker prize

42
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,940
for medical research. And in October this
year, she won the Nobel Prize.

43
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,020
Wait a minute! I think, I'm learning…some
kind of lesson here. That maybe when the East

44
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:53,020
and West work together in harmony, instead
of attacking each other, it's like…things

45
00:03:53,020 --> 00:04:00,290
can be…good? Or something. No, I lost it.

46
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,480
But maybe you didn't! Did you learn a lesson?
If so, leave it in the comment section below.

47
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,569
And if you aren't, subscribe for more China
Uncensored. Once again I'm Chris Chappell,

48
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,069
see you next time.

49
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,759
Speaking of strange things that happen under
communism, the Soviet Union once built the

50
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,669
most powerful nuclear bomb ever...and now
Russia is putting it on display.

51
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,620
Check it out on Seeker Daily.

52
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,319
Now everyone knows that “Made in China”
and “quality” go hand in hand. The same

53
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,379
way that “one more drink” and “good
decisions do.”
