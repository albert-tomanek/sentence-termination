00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,520
Massive Protests in Hong Kong

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,080
Are making Carrie Lam Cry

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,640
Time to pack it in

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,110
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,740
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,380
Okay, I have a message to the tens of thousands
of protesters in Hong Kong

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,600
who are upset about Beijing destroying their
freedoms.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,740
You’ve gone too far!

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,820
You made poor Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie
Lam cry.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,220
“Some people say I'm betraying Hong Kong.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,020
How can I betray Hong Kong?

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,940
I was born and raised here.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,480
I was growing up here with all the Hong Kong
people.”

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,860
That poor woman is just trying her hardest
to make Beijing happy,

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,000
and you keep asking her to step down.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,620
Have you ever tried walking a mile in her
shoes, huh?

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,530
Well, so you know how it feels to cry,

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,670
she allowed Hong Kong police to shoot tear
gas at protestors.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,180
And if that doesn’t make you cry,

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,510
the pepper spray and rubber bullets will do
the job.

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,490
Hong Kong police have been kicking around
some other great ideas, too.

22
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,320
Wow, that’s some good leadership, Carrie
Lam!

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,690
Don’t feel too bad though,

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,130
because the Chinese Communist Party’s got
your back.

25
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,680
“China's central government will continue
its firm support

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,450
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
government

27
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,890
to push forward with its amendments of the
two extradition bills.”

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,450
Those extradition bills are the reason

29
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,430
a million people protested over the weekend.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,710
If they get passed,

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,560
Chinese authorities could, in some cases,

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,190
order Hong Kong authorities to arrest

33
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,800
and deport suspected criminals to mainland
China.

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,280
The Hong Kong Legislature was supposed to
debate the bill on Wednesday.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,680
But these pesky protesters got in the way.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,440
Look, those barricades are there for a reason!

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,190
To block off the protest area right outside
the legislature.

38
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,440
Well that plan clearly didn’t work.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,710
At least 20 people were injured

40
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,970
and the extradition bill debate has been delayed.

41
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,670
Carrie Lam is calling the protests organized
riots.

42
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,670
And July 1 will be the anniversary of the
1997

43
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,130
British handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese
Communist Party.

44
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,050
That’s just a couple weeks away,

45
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,130
so it’s possible these protests won’t
be ending anytime soon.

46
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,720
Now, in 2014, police also used tear gas on
protesters,

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
as well as some hefty violence.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,180
That resulted in a months long occupation
of downtown Hong Kong

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,680
and international condemnation.

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,099
So you’d think Hong Kong authorities would
have learned their lesson,

51
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:42,660
that maybe police brutality is not the way
to deal with these kinds of issues.

52
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,980
Protesters on the other hand have learned
from the 2014 Umbrella Movement.

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,040
Back then, they used umbrellas to block police
pepper spray.

54
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,349
They’re doing that again this time too.

55
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:54,349
Just with better branding:

56
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,950
There’s a promo for the new Spider Man:
Far From Home movie!

57
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,280
And for some reason,

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,490
I have a sudden urge to go to the 7-11 in
Hong Kong.

59
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,460
In fact, that’s just what I’ll do.

60
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,080
By the time this video comes out,

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,970
Matt and Shelley and I will have landed in
Hong Kong to do interviews,

62
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,430
live streaming, and umbrella shopping.

63
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,150
Assuming we aren’t illegally stopped at
the border.

64
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,760
But as for Carrie Lam and her crocodile tears,

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,620
all I can say is,

66
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,120
see you later alligator,

67
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,080
in a while crocodile.

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,860
So what do you think of the growing protest
movement in Hong Kong?

69
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,300
Leave your comments below.

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,670
And before I go...to Hong Kong,

71
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,980
it's time for me to answer a question

72
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,980
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent
Army—

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,989
the fans who support the show

74
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:38,110
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

75
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,690
Christopher Vaiuso asks,

76
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,980
“Why can't the US and other countries

77
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,629
just kick China out of the WTO?”

78
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:46,879
Now that’s a good question.

79
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,830
China has broken so many of its

80
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,290
World Trade Organization promises over the
years.

81
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,600
So why not kick China out?

82
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,310
Certainly, some in the Trump Administration
have suggested it.

83
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,470
The problem is,

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,950
the WTO doesn’t actually have a way to force
a member out.

85
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,610
In fact, no country has ever left the WTO,

86
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,500
let alone gotten expelled.

87
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,450
But according to the Wall Street Journal,

88
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,820
there is an article that can achieve the same
thing.

89
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,639
Using Article 23 might allow for amendments
to the WTO charter

90
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,500
that outright prohibits all the things China
is doing,

91
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,270
which would then force China out of the WTO.

92
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,710
The problem with that is the WTO usually requires

93
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,069
unanimous votes for doing something.

94
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,659
So China could just veto the whole thing.

95
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,849
But if that happens,

96
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:37,500
it is still possible if there’s a vote by
a supermajority of members.

97
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,219
So kicking China out of the WTO would be new
territory.

98
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,240
Possibly China’s sacred territory.

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,979
