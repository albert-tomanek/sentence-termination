1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,500
Hong Kong Police Threaten to Kill

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,130
Protesters are on the offensive

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,940
And a mocktail to die for

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,860
This is China Uncensored,

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,050
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,539
This week in Hong Kong.

7
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,730
In a move that is surely going to make everything
better,

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,230
Hong Kong police officers are warning

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,090
they might have to kill protesters.

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,440
Some police claim they feel so threatened
by protesters,

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,669
they would need to use deadly force to defend
themselves.

12
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,610
Those poor police officers!

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,120
If only the Hong Kong protesters

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,640
could understand what it feels like to be
threatened with violence!

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,420
But attacks like that are changing in Hong
Kong.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,820
Instead of protesters getting attacked in
one big group,

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,390
now people are just being followed and then
attacked individually.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,690
Sure it’s less efficient,

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,180
but it’s way more intimidating.

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,380
On Tuesday, Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker
Roy Kwong

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,879
was attacked by masked men who pulled him
out of his car.

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,539
This dashcam footage posted by RTHK shows
three men

23
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:09,060
kicking Kwong and then running off.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,389
Apparently a fourth man filmed the attack.

25
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,039
Which seems like a bad idea,

26
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,049
if you’re at all worried about getting caught.

27
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,889
Kwong was hospitalized with neck injuries.

28
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:21,369
Meanwhile a government spokesperson has said
that

29
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,560
“the police will follow up seriously

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,299
in order to bring those responsible to justice.”

31
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,460
Maybe look for the guy with the incriminating
video.

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,670
But that’s not all.

33
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,979
On the same day,

34
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,170
a reporter for the pro-democracy newspaper
Apple Daily

35
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,520
was attacked in a restaurant.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,689
Four men dressed like protesters punched and
kicked

37
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,659
the reporter and her sister,

38
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,110
while mentioning Jimmy Lai,

39
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,499
the owner of the paper.

40
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:48,539
So clearly, they knew who the reporter was.

41
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,420
Apple Daily is offering a reward

42
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,110
for information on the attackers.

43
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,070
But that’s not all.

44
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,259
Again on the same day, this woman,

45
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,880
a Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,079
was attacked by two men in black

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,969
shortly after she left a police station.

48
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,850
The masked men hit her several times with
a baton,

49
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,399
then jumped into a white car and got away.

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,710
Which again, does not sound like a random
attack.

51
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,820
Falun Gong practitioners haven’t really
been

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,290
involved in the Hong Kong protests.

53
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,210
But this attack shows that any people

54
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,780
who speak out against the Chinese Communist
Party

55
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,840
could now be in danger in Hong Kong.

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,470
You know, Falun Gong practitioners

57
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,790
have been dealt loads of violence over the
years

58
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,490
in mainland China.

59
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,090
I don’t think they’ve ever said they might
need to kill someone.

60
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,370
But there has been a lot of confusion

61
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,511
in the midst of these protests that have rocked
Hong Kong

62
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,440
for more than 100 days.

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,780
For instance, this video has gone viral recently.

64
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,570
It shows what appears to be police

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,740
kicking a man in a yellow shirt.

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,610
But Hong Kong police say it wasn’t a man,

67
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,520
it was a yellow object.

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,370
Wow, they’re taking this dehumanization
thing kind of literally.

69
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,370
Guys, you’re supposed to make your contempt
less obvious.

70
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,930
Otherwise, people might notice.

71
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,790
Amnesty International is now also

72
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,160
accusing Hong Kong police of brutality.

73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,850
“The evidence leaves little room for doubt—

74
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,170
in an apparent thirst for retaliation,

75
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,530
Hong Kong’s security forces have engaged

76
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,330
in a disturbing pattern of reckless and unlawful
tactics

77
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,730
against people during the protests.

78
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,400
This has included arbitrary arrests and retaliatory
violence

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,900
against arrested persons in custody,

80
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,850
some of which has amounted to torture.”

81
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,610
“From those experiences we can see

82
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,890
a common thread running through,

83
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,700
that the Hong Kong government is failing to
facilitate,

84
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,030
failing to allow its, allow peaceful assembly,

85
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,940
to allow critical political speech,

86
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,210
because of the concern that somehow

87
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,840
this would be violating the one country, two
systems principle

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,130
which is new.”

89
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,350
However, it can’t be denied that the protests,

90
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,760
which began peacefully,

91
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,510
have taken a violent turn.

92
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,750
Well, I mean they always were violent—

93
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,190
that is, the police and triads being violent.

94
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,410
But now, some of the protesters are getting
violent as well.

95
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,600
“Anger and tension on Hong Kong's streets

96
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,680
spilled into bloody violence on Saturday night.

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,550
In a video obtained by broadcaster TVB,

98
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,729
men who reportedly disagreed with Hong Kong's
protest movement

99
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:31,349
can be seen being savagely beaten by protesters.”

100
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,969
Protesters also targeted businesses

101
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:36,270
linked to mainland China at a mall in Sha
Tin,

102
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,889
as well as vandalizing the nearby subway station.

103
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,550
“This is the ticketing system for the MTR

104
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,599
its been completely trashed.

105
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:46,370
People have sprayed all over it,

106
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,409
they've smashed holes in it.”

107
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,830
Protesters started targeting the subway

108
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,340
after the MTR started shutting down stations
near protests

109
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,850
after being criticized by state-run media,

110
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,490
and police started beating passengers in subway
stations.

111
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,270
But now that protesters have also started

112
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,069
trashing subway stations...

113
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,009
at least the protesters and police have something
in common.

114
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,740
Protesters have also set various small fires
over the past week,

115
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,979
for instance outside a police station,

116
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,180
and near the Sha Tin mall.

117
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,479
Tensions are running high.

118
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,809
A group of protesters attacked this pro-Beijing
man,

119
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,009
before other protesters broke up the fight.

120
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,090
That’s why I think people just need to chill
out

121
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,710
with a nice mocktail.

122
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,520
Like this one from a Hong Kong diner

123
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,849
that’s offering a protest-inspired menu.

124
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,199
This is the “eye for an eye soda.”

125
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,169
It’s a reference to the young woman

126
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,069
who was shot in the eye by a police rubber
bullet.

127
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,620
Obviously the police had been very afraid

128
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,740
for their own safety when they shot her.

129
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,469
“The menu includes rice balls

130
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,529
named after the protesters' five demands,

131
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,240
like universal suffrage and an investigation

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,439
into whether police have used excessive force.

133
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,819
There's also a soup called "beaten raw pork"
-

134
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,840
a nod clashes that have turned violent.

135
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,960
If you want the set meal that'll be a "full
gear",

136
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,229
as in face masks, umbrellas,

137
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,439
and all the other ad hoc battle armour

138
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,949
worn by demonstrators.”

139
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,910
Wow, I hope “an investigation into whether
police

140
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,800
have used excessive force rice ball”

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,259
flows a little better in Cantonese.

142
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,900
But the Chinese Communist Party still hopes

143
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,099
it can drum up a little patriotism in Hong
Kong.

144
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,849
An upcoming Chinese propaganda film

145
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,710
called My people, My country

146
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,639
will celebrate the October 1 National Day
holiday.

147
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,919
And Hong Kong is a particular focus of the
story.

148
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,580
One of the seven stories in the movie

149
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,800
is about getting the Chinese flag raised in
Hong Kong

150
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:48,180
at the stroke of midnight on July 1, 1997.

151
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,639
I assume that it’s because if there’s
one second of delay,

152
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,930
the flagpole will blow up.

153
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,930
Otherwise,

154
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,650
why are they treating a flag raising like
MacGyver

155
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,659
disarming a bomb.

156
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,909
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you,

157
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:07,389
a fan who supports us through Patreon—

158
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,409
which I might remind you is critical to our
continued coverage,

159
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:15,139
since YouTube demonetizes most of our Hong
Kong episodes.

160
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,250
David Tower asks

161
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,289
“I just don't understand why people

162
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,460
still think China is a reliable trade partner.

163
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,529
It's obvious they are THE enemy of the USA

164
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,189
and many other countries.”

165
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:27,930
An interesting question David.

166
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,879
It kind of goes back to the original pusher

167
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,189
of China appeasement and engagement,

168
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,689
Henry Kissinger.

169
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:34,689
Now when President Nixon

170
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:37,099
secretly sent him to China in the 70’s,

171
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,370
the US was seeking a way to counter the Soviet
Union.

172
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,370
And at the time,

173
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,099
dragging China away from the Soviet sphere
of influence

174
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,120
seemed like a good idea.

175
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,029
And the belief was that if we engage with
China,

176
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,860
they’ll see how good our system is

177
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,419
and will shed their erroneous Communist ways.

178
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,900
Obviously, that did not happen.

179
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,270
But there was a whole generation of “experts”

180
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,449
trained in that line of thought.

181
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,580
And so the narrative continues.

182
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,599
The Chinese Communist Party will change

183
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,479
if there’s engagement and appeasement.

184
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,569
Over the past 2-3 years however,

185
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,539
that attitude has been changing.

186
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,719
China is now being called a strategic competitor.

187
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:19,210
Which is why standing up to the Chinese Communist
Party

188
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,199
is one of the few bipartisan issues

189
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,009
in the United States right now.

190
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,949
