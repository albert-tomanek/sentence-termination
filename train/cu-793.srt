00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,800
China's economy is seriously slowing down.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,580
And that is not good for America.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,950
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,740
China's economy is slowing down

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,080
more than ever before.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,930
Last year, China missed its official GDP growth
target.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,660
And many experts say China's economic growth
was probably even slower than that.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,720
This month, at the National People's Congress,

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,800
the government announced it's replacing its
GDP growth target with a target range:

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,589
which I guess is easier to hit-slash-fake.

13
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:40,979
But most importantly,

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,069
it's even lower than last year

15
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:46,829
meaning Chinese leaders are acknowledging
that things are getting worse.

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,639
But don't worry. They have a plan.

17
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:53,280
For more, I'm joined by China Uncensored producer
Matt Gnaizda.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,530
Thanks Chris.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,100
So first, how is the Chinese economy doing
right now?

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,279
Well, Chris, it's definitely slowing down.

21
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:04,619
But even the Central Government doesn't know
exactly by how much,

22
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,559
because city and provincial officials have
been making up local GDP growth figures for years.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,780
That seems like a problem.

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,079
Yeah. Plus, China is struggling with growing
debt,

25
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:18,499
lower commodities prices, real estate bubbles,
a shaky stock market,

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,340
and, you know, some other things.

27
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,270
But at the National People's Congress this
month,

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,590
a big focus was on manufacturing.

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,880
What did they say?

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,689
The Finance Minister said Chinese wages are
too high,

31
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,560
and workers have too many rights.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,770
Wow, spoken like a true communist.

33
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,200
Well, the Chinese government has a valid argument
to keep wages low.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,039
What's that?

35
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,479
The cost of labor in China has been rising
so much that a lot of companies are looking

36
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,390
to get their stuff made elsewhere.

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,859
"Long-term, I'm looking at possibly thinking
of production in another third world country."

38
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,869
So now Chinese leaders want to boost the economy
in the short-term

39
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:01,950
by keeping wages down so China's manufacturing
can stay competitive.

40
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,659
It's like, there's all that talk in the US
about China taking American jobs

41
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,280
and now even poorer countries are taking Chinese
jobs.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,870
That's the gist of it.

43
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,310
So is China's plan going to work?

44
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,239
It might. But it's like a game of Jenga.

45
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,650
Every move you make now could lead to a more
serious problem down the line.

46
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,409
Like for one, Chinese leaders already recognize
that in the long-term,

47
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,430
they really need to shift away from low-wage
manufacturing

48
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,150
and develop service and technology industries.

49
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,330
And for two?

50
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,870
For long-term growth,

51
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,349
China needs to increase domestic consumption.

52
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,340
And that can only happen if Chinese citizens
have more money to spend.

53
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,879
Hence the need for higher wages.

54
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,319
And frankly, Chinese domestic consumption
is what America has been hoping for

55
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,030
ever since President Clinton helped China
get into the World Trade Organization.

56
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,750
"This agreement is a good deal for America.

57
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Our products will gain better access to China's
market and every sector from agriculture to

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,290
telecommunications to automobiles."

59
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,340
Well, American companies are selling products
in China now.

60
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:11,599
True, but not nearly as much as they'd hoped.

61
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
Instead of America dominating the Chinese
market,

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
China has been dominating the US market

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,790
which CNN explains here.

64
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,260
"We were about equal in 1985,

65
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,280
and we have not risen nearly as much in terms
of the products we send to China."

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,269
Ok, so the plan hasn't worked so far

67
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,750
but eventually Chinese people will have the
spending money to buy US products, right?

68
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,379
Well, not if Chinese leaders keep workers'
wages low.

69
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,760
And by the time wages really do go up enough,

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,640
it may be too late for American companies.

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,420
Because China has spent the last couple decades
creating its own versions of US products

72
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,280
so it doesn't have to buy so much from America.

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,530
Like how the Chinese government banned Microsoft
Windows 8,

74
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,760
and replaced it with a homegrown knockoff,
NeoKylin.

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,709
Or how the Chinese government banned its agencies
from buying iPhones

76
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,290
and instead encouraged them to buy homegrown
phones like obvious knockoff Xiaomi.

77
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,150
Or how the Chinese military copied the design
of the Hummer,

78
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,069
and created their own Eastern Wind vehicle.

79
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,420
Hmm... it's like there's a pattern here.

80
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,610
There might be.

81
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,740
And the key is that with China's economic
slowdown,

82
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,800
the market for US products there may not get
as big as US companies hope.

83
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,000
So the promise of the US economy benefiting
from helping China grow is looking more and more

84
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,480
like this.

85
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,130
I just don't understand why we're not getting
any closer!

86
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,040
Thanks Matt.

87
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,700
And for an in-depth look at how China's manufacturing
slowdown has affected Chinese workers,

88
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,500
watch this video from our friends at the Financial
Times:

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,440
"Some Chinese firms are resorting to the unthinkable.

90
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,910
Importing workers."

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,110
So what do you think about China's economic
slowdown? Leave your comments below.

92
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,000
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.
