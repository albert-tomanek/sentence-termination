00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,960
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,200
is China still communist?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,640
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,349
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,030
China, as you know,

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,070
is run by the Chinese Communist Party—

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,070
or CCP.

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,250
And it has been since Mao Zedong’s revolution

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,910
nearly 70 years ago.

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,640
And nothing illustrates the success

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,060
of communism in China like...

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,539
the complete destruction of all things capitalist?

13
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,099
In 1949, Mao Zedong and the CCP

14
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,350
seized all the means of production,

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,980
taking over all the farmland,

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,940
and turning all private companies into

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,960
state-owned companies—

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,649
creating a communist paradise

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,580
where everyone was equal.

20
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,580
Equally miserable, sure...

21
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,800
but equal.

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,720
But China has undergone huge changes

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,520
since the days of collective farming and ration
coupons.

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,579
All that silly equality is long gone!

25
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,890
And everyone is happy!

26
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,620
Except the vast majority of people—

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,710
who still earn less than $10 a day.

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,559
But with the rise of China’s wealthy elite,

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,140
is China really even communist anymore?

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,360
It’s easy to look at the skyscrapers

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,070
in Shanghai and Guangzhou and say

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,890
“No, China’s capitalist now.

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,630
In most ways it’s just like Western countries.”

34
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,770
Well yes,

35
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,700
China no longer has a collectivist economy.

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700
Nowadays, some people are brutally poor,

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,340
and some people are crazy rich...

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,710
and some people are crazy and rich.

39
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,460
The Communist Party hopes we in the West see

40
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,420
China’s bright shiny cities and luxury hotels,

41
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,770
and forget that China is still controlled

42
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,090
by the Communist Party.

43
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,460
“Pay no attention to the red dragon

44
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,570
behind the curtain.”

45
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,570
Karl Marx,

46
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,680
who’s the founder of modern communist thought,

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,610
wrote a lot about the economics of communism.

48
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,479
His idea was that no individuals

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,090
should be allowed to own the means of production—

50
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,020
like factories or farmland.

51
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,439
Everything should be owned collectively

52
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,439
by the masses,

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,540
i.e. the Communist Party.

54
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,409
That’s why when Mao Zedong took over,

55
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,500
he made sure no one in China owned

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,590
a company or farm anymore.

57
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,680
I mean if they did,

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,440
the CCP would just kill them and take it.

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,760
So most businessmen and landlords were like,

60
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,040
“Here ya go!”

61
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,140
It’s called equality by mandatory consent.

62
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,220
But now, after four decades of economic reform,

63
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,420
97 percent of Chinese companies

64
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,260
are privately owned.

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,480
So in the sense of private ownership,

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,730
China isn’t really communist anymore.

67
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,750
I bet Chairman Mao is rolling over in his...

68
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,080
glass case.

69
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,629
Let me just take a moment to point out

70
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:39,300
how weird it is that they’ve kept a dead
guy

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,560
in a display box in the middle of Tiananmen
Square...

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
for 40 years.

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,300
Anyway, the CCP wants you see

74
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,180
all the private ownership and think

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,510
“China has reformed!”

76
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,010
But there are other aspects of communism

77
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,010
that the CCP would like you to please forget.

78
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,680
In particular,

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,300
how communism isn’t just about

80
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,920
how the economy works.

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,239
It’s about having a one-party system

82
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,170
that controls just about every aspect of society.

83
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,550
And that part has stuck around.

84
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,550
For example, the CCP controls workers

85
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,760
through the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions.

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,739
It’s goal is actually to make sure workers

87
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,330
don’t collectively bargain.

88
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,750
The CCP also controls

89
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,610
all citizens’ groups and associations.

90
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,209
For example, China’s feminist organization—

91
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,690
the All-China Women’s Federation—

92
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,090
is actually an organ of the CCP.

93
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,580
It’s used to make sure that women follow

94
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,299
the national population control plan,

95
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,849
such as by getting married younger,

96
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,670
and having the correct number of children.

97
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,069
Very feminist.

98
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:47,890
The CCP also controls the churches.

99
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,520
Want to be Christian in China?

100
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,799
Well, you do have a choice.

101
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,849
You can either belong to the state-run

102
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,810
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association,

103
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,610
or the state-run Protestant Three-Self Patriotic
Church.

104
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,590
Doesn’t that sound fun?

105
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,850
You can believe in Jesus if you want,

106
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,170
but you’d best remember who’s really in
charge.

107
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,730
The CCP also controls the entire education
system,

108
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,040
making sure that children learn to

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,340
hate the Japanese imperialists,

110
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,959
and love the Communist Party.

111
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,739
As one Shanghai history textbook official
said,

112
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,150
“History is still used as a political tool,

113
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,960
and at the high school level,

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,370
we still must follow the doctrine.”

115
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,310
The Great Famine that killed 40 million people?

116
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,310
Let’s just call it “The Great Oopsie Daisy.”

117
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,690
I’m just kidding.

118
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,730
It’s actually called “The Great Leap Forward.”

119
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,850
Seriously.

120
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,410
The CCP also monitors every one of

121
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,240
its nearly 1.4 billion citizens through

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,210
a massive security system—

123
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,910
which is called “Skynet.”

124
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,770
Yes, they actually call it Skynet.

125
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,180
It’s like they watched Terminator,

126
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,060
but somehow got the opposite takeaway

127
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,750
than everyone else.

128
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,970
China’s Skynet combines mobile phone GPS
tracking,

129
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,400
text message collection,

130
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,050
and 170 million security cameras

131
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,430
to make sure everyone is harmonious

132
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,570
and no one does anything illegal—

133
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,540
like criticize the CCP’s invasive security
system.

134
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,060
China also controls the media.

135
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,160
There’s obviously the state-run media,

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,110
like China Central Television.

137
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,660
China also allows privately owned media.

138
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,130
But what they can and can’t say

139
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,180
isn’t exactly free market;

140
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,690
it’s determined by CCP censors,

141
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,600
through an organization called SAPPRFT.

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,350
It’s even harder to say in Chinese.

143
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,580
But at least you can own

144
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,050
a private company in China.

145
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,740
That’s not communism, right?

146
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,440
Right, except it’s not a free market economy

147
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,730
like we have in the West, either.

148
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,800
Because while anyone can start a business,

149
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,440
not everyone can succeed.

150
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
For example,

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,300
if a company’s president makes friends

152
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,550
with the right communist officials,

153
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,610
red tape and roadblocks will magically disappear.

154
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,610
If he doesn’t,

155
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,630
he can be stopped by arbitrary regulations,

156
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,090
and his competitors will quickly out-compete
him.

157
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,920
That’s why all the big companies

158
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,590
have strong ties to the CCP.

159
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,990
Plus the CCP requires all companies

160
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,800
with more than 50 employees to have

161
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,110
a Communist Party Secretary on staff.

162
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,410
That person’s job is to monitor the company

163
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,690
and make sure it’s ideologically pure.

164
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,319
And by “pure,”

165
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,210
I mean the right kind of corrupt.

166
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,190
Even foreign companies operating in China

167
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,319
have to have a Party Secretary.

168
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,220
Just to make sure that free Happy Meal toy

169
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,900
doesn’t come with any free speech.

170
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,710
The CCP also controls China’s currency.

171
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,930
For decades, they’ve kept prices in China

172
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,660
artificially low so that Chinese exports

173
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,460
are cheaper than everyone else’s.

174
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,470
And that also has meant that foreign goods

175
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,440
are artificially expensive in China,

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,639
so it’s hard for foreign companies to compete.

177
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,139
That’s not a free market either.

178
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,789
And while 97 percent of companies

179
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,230
are privately owned,

180
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,849
the CCP still controls most of the biggest
industries,

181
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:06,389
like oil, banking, rail, and telecom.

182
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,190
Foreign companies wanting to do business in
China

183
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,259
can’t just set up shop.

184
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,449
They’re required to have a Chinese-owned

185
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,509
joint venture partner.

186
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:16,660
That partner gets to share the profits

187
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,360
and all their valuable intellectual property.

188
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,020
That is not something that normal countries
require...

189
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,900
because it’s ridiculously unfair.

190
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,770
In fact, besides moving toward a market economy,

191
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,669
China has made very few major political reforms

192
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,160
since the days of Mao Zedong.

193
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,440
Even though the current leader is called a
“president,”

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,580
he’s not elected.

195
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,580
The Communist Party

196
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,080
is above the law,

197
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,569
and controls China’s government and society

198
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,889
through the same kind of authoritarianism

199
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,440
the Communist Party has always held so dear.

200
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,380
The CCP also controls the court system,

201
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,490
so there’s no rule of law.

202
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,490
Unless you think China’s 99.9% conviction
rate

203
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,440
means it has really, really talented policemen.

204
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,060
There’s no freedom of speech, either.

205
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,139
Which is why you can’t watch this YouTube
video in China.

206
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:10,200
Except for you, buddy.

207
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,980
You think I don’t know about your illegal
VPN?

208
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,100
Just kidding, ok,

209
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,539
I don’t know about your illegal VPN.

210
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,320
But the Chinese Communist Party does.

211
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,199
So while China today barely resembles

212
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,289
the communist state of the 1950s and 60s

213
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,069
in terms of economic structure

214
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:29,170
and the number of McDonald’s,

215
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,319
it still retains almost

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
all the other aspects of communism—

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,250
like state control, censorship, mass surveillance...

218
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,990
and surveillance of mass.

219
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,200
So next time someone asks you

220
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,209
if China is communist,

221
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:44,010
you can tell them with confidence:

222
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,010
Yes...

223
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,730
-ish, sort of, mostly.

224
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,230
It’s complicated.

225

See you next time.

233
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,180
China Uncensored is...

234
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,970
a bit controversial.

235
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,330
When you criticize the CCP,

236
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,690
a lot of advertisers get scared.

237
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,190
That’s why China Uncensored is funded

238
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,610
mainly through contributions

239
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,180
