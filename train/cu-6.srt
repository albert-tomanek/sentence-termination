1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,690
On this episode of china uncensored,

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,460
the Chinese Communist party is not going to
like this interview.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,020
Hi welcome to china uncensored I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,690
I'm here in Australia.

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,680
The country slash continent has been reeling
from the revelation

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,340
that the Chinese communist party

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,340
has been influencing Australian politicians.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,300
But I sat down with New South Wales member
of parliament

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,530
for the Greens Party David Shoebridge—

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,590
a politician who’s not afraid to talk about
Beijing’s most sensitive issues.

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,430
Thank you for joining me today.

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,560
Are we doing this interview outside because
Green members

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,310
don't believe in indoor offices?

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,440
We have an office, but I always think it's
nice to get out in the park.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,640
Sydney, thankfully, is blessed with some beautiful
parks.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Definitely.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,930
Why don't you tell us a little bit about the
Greens,

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:51,970
just what you're about?

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,920
We're a party that's got four basic pillars
behind it,

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,260
which is ecological sustainability, social
justice,

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,470
grassroots democracy, and peace and nonviolence.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,640
How is the Chinese Communist Party infiltrating
Australian politics?

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,020
I think the biggest impact of the Chinese
government

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,630
and the concern about the regime in Australian
politics

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,240
is this insidious self-censorship that we
see from Australian

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,120
politicians scared to call out obvious human
rights abuses in China,

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,490
scared to support democracy movements in places
like Hong Kong,

28
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,750
scared to really openly challenge China on
some of those

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,620
appalling foreign relations decisions,

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,630
such as the ongoing occupation of Tibet.

31
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,190
It's that self-censorship that I think is
so, so deeply frustrating,

32
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,850
and it's all because they fear a backlash
from China,

33
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,610
a backlash on trade, or a backlash on our
economic relationship.

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,950
Australia has one of the largest and deepest
economic relationships

35
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,380
with anyone is with China.

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,650
We have a massive trade relationship with
China.

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,399
But China buys our coal, and our steel,

38
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,170
and our iron ore, and our agricultural exports,

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,019
and our education services

40
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,219
not because they think we're a bunch of nice
guys,

41
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:12,740
not because we're friends and we all

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,079
sit around and have a cup of tea together,

43
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,599
not because they can come over

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,930
and tickle our bellies and we'll do what they
want.

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,459
They buy our stuff because it's

46
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,189
some of the highest quality and best priced
products

47
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,909
and services anywhere in the world.

48
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:28,159
They'll continue to do that whether or not
we call China out

49
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,719
for its systemic human rights abuses or not.

50
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,980
I can't understand why otherwise intelligent
people

51
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,370
in positions of power don't get that.

52
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,969
And what can Australian politicians do to
resist this influence?

53
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:43,340
They could show a bit of courage, they could
grow a backbone,

54
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,049
and they could just stand up for human rights
abuses

55
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,340
wherever they're happening on the planet.

56
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,700
That would be a good start.

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,480
I think that's asking for a miracle.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,439
Well , you know, I don't think it's a miracle.

59
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,209
I think it should be the basic minimum standard
that citizens

60
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:57,659
across the world ask of their politicians.

61
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,439
So, for years, you've talked about

62
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,159
one of the party's most sensitive issues,

63
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,709
organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.

64
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,659
How are you still in office?

65
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:13,680
I've definitely had direct attacks from the
Chinese consulate

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
when I raise things in our state parliament.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,689
I find that remarkable.

68
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:23,180
I haven't had those direct attacks from any
other government,

69
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,450
even though I may raise sensitive issues about
U.S. foreign policy,

70
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,159
I may raise sensitive issues about Australia's
foreign policy,

71
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,309
and its engagement with other regimes.

72
00:03:33,309 --> 00:03:38,409
It was when I raised the concerns about the
way China

73
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,819
goes about forcibly organ harvesting,

74
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:45,099
that's the only time that I've had that direct
pushback.

75
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,279
In fact, a letter came from the consulate
to

76
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:51,559
basically every MP in the state parliament.

77
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:55,959
Can you give us a specific example of some
of that influence?

78
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,760
I have a private member's bill that would
prevent Australians

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,079
or anybody ordinarily resident here from going
overseas

80
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,329
and engaging in unethical organ harvesting.

81
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,049
Of course, I view unethical organ harvesting
as a deep moral issue.

82
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,629
Just for clarity, what do you mean by unethical
trade in organs?

83
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,130
Any trade that was for a commercial reason,

84
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,100
any trade where there was a degree of exploitation,

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,690
and of course any trade where there was a
lack of consent.

86
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,930
I'd put top of that list what we see in China,

87
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,100
where we know there are organs being provided

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,600
through their massive transplantation system.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,760
There are organs being provided, almost certainly,

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,750
from prisoners from conscience, and almost
certainly without consent.

91
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,220
Putting to one side the fact that China has
admitted that

92
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,980
they use the organs of executed prisoners.

93
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,280
If any Australian was to leave Australia

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,140
and engage in one of those trades in China,

95
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,470
or Egypt, or wherever,

96
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,280
that would be a very serious crime on the
statute books here.

97
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,020
If they returned, they would be found

98
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,500
ordinarily prosecuted for an offense

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,680
the equivalent of manslaughter.

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,720
What was the Communist Party's response to
that legislation?

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
Well, the consulate was less than chuffed.

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Were they?

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,280
It may surprise you.

104
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,410
We had a briefing that we put on in the New
South Wales parliament.

105
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,930
When I was walking in the corridors of the
parliament,

106
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,970
I had a number of colleagues from different
parties saying that they supported it,

107
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,160
and giving me their personal support.

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
We put a briefing on.

109
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,670
We had some human rights experts and some
medical experts

110
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,890
come in to do a briefing about the bill

111
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,960
and why we were presenting the bill.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,090
Meanwhile, we had a huge petition presented,

113
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,970
so there was strong public support for it.

114
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,500
We had more than a quarter of a million people

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,730
sign a petition in support of the bill,

116
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,310
so there was some political support for it
in the populace.

117
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,830
Individual MPs from different parties said
they supported it.

118
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,440
People generally don't like the idea of innocent
people being killed for their organs.

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,740
It's not a hard sell.

120
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,940
If you explain to people what the problem
is,

121
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,070
they clearly want us to do something about
it.

122
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,000
They expect their state and federal MPs to
do something about it.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,670
We put the briefing on, but the morning of
the briefing,

124
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,090
a letter was sent from the Chinese consulate
to each MP in the state parliament,

125
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,030
basically saying, "The briefing is a dangerous
attack on China,"

126
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:25,490
that my office had worked with this dangerous
grouping called Falun Gong,

127
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,320
that this was a direct attack on China,

128
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,240
and this kind of behavior in Australian parliaments
prejudiced

129
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,480
the ongoing commercial relationship with China.

130
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,500
An extraordinary intervention.

131
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,800
How successful was that letter?

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,370
It was bloody successful.

133
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,770
We didn't get a single MP from either of the
larger parties,

134
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,770
the Labor Party or the Coalition.

135
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,770
They all backed out.

136
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,450
They all backed out, even though we'd had
a series of RSVPs.

137
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,950
So the head of China's organ transplant system,
Dr. Huang Jiefu,

138
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:00,560
has said they've stopped using organs from
executed prisoners.

139
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,520
I plainly don't believe those statements that
come largely

140
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,510
from the central Beijing bureaucracy that
say

141
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,790
they're no longer using executed prisoners,

142
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,540
they're relying only on donors,

143
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,830
because when you look at the numbers

144
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,910
in that most recent Matas and Kilgour study,

145
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:27,520
the size of the transplant industry in China
is massive.

146
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,150
Their pool of donated organs, given that there's
no history

147
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,670
of donation and there are cultural barriers
to it in China,

148
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,560
their pool or organs is tiny.

149
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,710
And something has to explain the shortfall
between

150
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,940
the tiny number of organs that would come
through their infant-

151
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,750
Transplant system.

152
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,090
Transplant donation system, and the massive
scale of their

153
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,210
increasingly commercial transplant industry.

154
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,100
Clearly, on any view, that's being serviced

155
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,940
by amongst other things executed prisoners.

156
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,650
For the Chinese to be in denial of that, they
can say what they like,

157
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,100
but the numbers just don't stack up.

158
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Yeah.

159
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,110
I believe that report you mentioned, Bloody
Harvest,

160
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,230
puts the number at about 60 to 100,000 organ
transplants a year.

161
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:19,940
Yes, with a donation system that's providing
at best 10% of that.

162
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,940
So where's the shortfall coming from?

163
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,200
If Huang Jiefu can come out

164
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,639
and explain where the shortfall comes from,

165
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,060
I will believe him when he says that

166
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,620
it's not coming from executed prisoners.

167
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,399
Of course, Huang Jiefu has a history with
Australia.

168
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,409
That's one of the reasons why I think we have
an obligation

169
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,649
to challenge him on this.

170
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,690
He's been given an honorary doctorate from
our oldest

171
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,249
and most prestigious university, the University
of Sydney.

172
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,490
It's actually where I graduated.

173
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,839
I was going to ask.

174
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:47,940
You've done some digging into

175
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,310
Dr. Huang's relationship with the University
of Sydney.

176
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,199
Can you tell us a bit about that?

177
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:58,040
Huang Jiefu has been important from the eyes
of the University of Sydney

178
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,850
by establishing links with higher education
facilities

179
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,880
particularly in Beijing.

180
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,209
That then produces a large number of overseas
students

181
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,959
and commercial success for the University
of Sydney.

182
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:18,160
I would say primarily for that reason he was
being celebrated

183
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,819
and given an honorary doctorate,

184
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,779
to bolster the commercial interests of the
University of Sydney.

185
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,551
I found it remarkable that when

186
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,399
I raised concerns about his deeply unethical
history,

187
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,040
and he admits to transplanting hundreds if
not thousands of livers

188
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,000
from executed prisoners, he admits to that,

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,920
when I pointed out that that was a gross ethical
breach by any standards,

190
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
would be unlawful here,

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,970
the Sydney University administration and the
Senate simply ignored me.

192
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,879
For me, it was a clear case of them putting
narrow commercial interests

193
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,450
ahead of what I think should be

194
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,149
minimum ethical standards for our universities.

195
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,709
Didn't you sue them?

196
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:06,389
They were asked to release emails about this
relationship.

197
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:10,350
We have laws that are euphemistically called

198
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,019
“freedom of information” laws in Australia.

199
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,129
I think most Western democracies have them.

200
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:15,440
At least on paper.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,129
At least on paper.

202
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,240
We have the laws on paper.

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,910
I requested all of the communications that
went to the Senate,

204
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,970
and went to the university when they were
considering

205
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,970
granting him the honorary doctorate,

206
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,260
and what I got back was page, after page,
after page

207
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,839
of blanked-out documents,

208
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,079
because they didn't want to show the public
what they'd said

209
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,110
about him in recommending him.

210
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,670
It was entirely redacted.

211
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,350
I think we got one email that had gone to
all staff and students,

212
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,610
which we already had,

213
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,930
which largely led to our freedom of information
request.

214
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,420
All of the actual key documents,

215
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,600
the reasons they gave for giving this guy
an honorary doctorate,

216
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,180
all of that was blanked out.

217
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,250
You sued them to unredact that.

218
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,250
Yeah.

219
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,900
We had to take them to court to get them to
unredact it,

220
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,240
and we ended up getting a significant amount
of it unredacted.

221
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,410
And what it showed mainly was what they were
refusing to look at.

222
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,689
There was no information going to the Senate
or the decision-makers

223
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:17,309
about this man's history of engaging in illegal
and unethical organ transplants,

224
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,610
no mention of the fact that he'd engaged in
hundreds if not thousands

225
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,620
of liver transplants using the organs of executed
prisoners.

226
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,100
With none of that information going before
the Senate,

227
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,139
they just granted him the honorary doctorate.

228
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,390
It's like a rubber stamp.

229
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,709
To go back to the infiltration of Australian
society,

230
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,999
what can your average Australian do

231
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,709
in the face of Communist Party infiltration
into Australian society?

232
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,459
I think the first thing is it's a question
of perspective.

233
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,069
I don't pretend, and I don't think it's true,

234
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,209
that they've got some sort of tentacles that
go all through our society,

235
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,639
and they direct how our state and federal
governments operate.

236
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,690
It's not that, but they are willing to exercise
influence when

237
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,290
they feel like it's something that's seriously
challenging the regime.

238
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,250
They're very sensitive about organ harvesting.

239
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,450
They're very sensitive about Falun Gong.

240
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,369
You'll find almost no other MP actively running
those issues,

241
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:18,949
because they get monstered.

242
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:21,819
I think the best thing you can do, most Australians
could do,

243
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:25,240
is just spend more time with people from Chinese
heritage.

244
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,360
Get to know them.

245
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,869
Engage in those one-to-one citizen exchanges,

246
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:37,939
because the people of Chinese heritage and
descent

247
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:40,509
who have Australia as their home,

248
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,290
and we're super lucky to have them,

249
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,279
they cannot become, and I'd be deeply anxious
if they were to become,

250
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,540
the targets of what may become a racist backlash,

251
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,100
notionally targeted at the regime,

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,379
but the concern is it will end up being targeted
at

253
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,429
people of Chinese heritage living in Australia.

254
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:02,820
That would be deeply unfair.

255
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,519
That actually makes a lot of sense.

256
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,779
Are you sure you're a politician?

257
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,069
I take the view that there are so few people
in politics

258
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:15,059
who actually are willing to say it like it
is.

259
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,399
They're always trying to hedge their bets.

260
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,130
You know, “What would regime A think about
it?

261
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,350
What would this little sectional interest

262
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,379
in the community think about it?”

263
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,779
I think people want politicians, I hope,

264
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,579
to be trying to actually say the truth,

265
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:30,360
not trying to doublespeak.

266
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,860
The Chinese Communist Party often accuses
critics

267
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,889
of racism or intolerance to silence them.

268
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,089
How can we raise legitimate concerns about
the Party’s actions

269
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,649
and not be racist?

270
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:45,829
Well, I think you've just got to be extremely
careful to distinguish

271
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,829
between the actions of a government and the
actions

272
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,029
and the intents of a nation's people...

273
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:56,569
In my mind, the Chinese people need to be
an ally with us in this.

274
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,850
They suffer far more from the authoritarian
nature of their government

275
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,850
than we do.

276
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,610
I get a cranky letter.

277
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,449
They suffer from a regime

278
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:08,179
that is willing to jail them if they speak
their mind,

279
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,259
or wish to exercise a faith

280
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,259
that that organization doesn't agree with.

281
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,259
Or remove their organs.

282
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,369
Or remove their organs, kill them and remove
their organs.

283
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:24,300
In Australia, which has a very, very ugly
history of racism,

284
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,740
and a big part of that racism has been directed
against

285
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,249
people of Chinese descent, people of Asian
descent, Asian heritage,

286
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:37,129
I think it is very hard to have that discussion
and to work out

287
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,670
where to draw the boundaries.

288
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,240
I think we need to acknowledge that.

289
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,970
A lot of sensitivities there.

290
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,810
And quite rightly sensitivities.

291
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,279
In fact, the former Prime Minister John Howard,

292
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,420
as recently as 20 years ago,

293
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,480
was toying with an actively racist immigration
policy again.

294
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,149
That is very raw and real in Australia,

295
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,339
and that means when you're engaging

296
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,980
in a critique of the Chinese government,

297
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,610
you have to make it abundantly clear that
we're standing

298
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,339
in solidarity with the Chinese people, both
there and here.

299
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,379
When you bring up sensitive issues like organ
harvesting,

300
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,389
are you ever concerned that this might cost
you votes?

301
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:19,639
I actually don't think that speaking up

302
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:22,300
for human rights costs you votes.

303
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,929
We're a party that has a fundamental belief

304
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:29,079
in core human rights and social justice issues.

305
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:33,699
If we're not willing to speak up about this,
then who would?

306
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,019
I actually think the great bulk of people,
whether it's Australia,

307
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,769
or the United States, or wherever, they actually
want politicians

308
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,559
to I think stand up and challenge power when
power is behaving badly.

309
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,810
They want them to tell the truth.

310
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,739
Basically, they want them to tell the truth
simply.

311
00:15:52,739 --> 00:15:54,999
And I understand you take a lot of your constituents

312
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,089
out for hikes in the bush.

313
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,089
Yeah.

314
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,429
We have a very successful Greens bushwalking
club.

315
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:03,740
The only problem with it, sometimes it's too
popular,

316
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,250
and we have too many people out on our walks.

317
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,610
I feel like a bit of a sheepdog trying to
keep

318
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,670
40 or 50 people on track for a bushwalk,

319
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,559
but we're blessed in Australia, particularly
in Sydney.

320
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,249
We're surrounded by national parks, amazing
places,

321
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:20,989
easily accessible within a day.

322
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:23,759
For me, that's one of the reasons I'm in politics,

323
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,899
to protect and celebrate those natural parts
of the world.

324
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:28,899
That's great.

325
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,480
Maybe next time I'm in Australia,

326
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,239
we can do another interview in the bush.

327
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,819
Yeah, let's go to the Blue Mountains.

328
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:36,180
We can do the Grand Canyon, one of my favorite
walks.

329
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
Sounds great.

330
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,369
Thank you very much for joining me today.

331
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:38,860
No problem.

332
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,360
My pleasure.

333
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Always good to speak.

334
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,660
