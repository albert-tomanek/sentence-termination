00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,720
A Chinese warship

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,120
Is tracked by Japan and Taiwan

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Is a new alliance forming?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,400
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,160
This episode has been sponsored\h
by Surfshark—because you should\h\h

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,760
be protecting your identity whenever you\h
go online by using a VPN like Surfshark.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,800
The Chinese Communist Party is engaged\h
in territorial disputes with basically\h\h

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,960
all of its neighbors. The\h
problem for China is, sometimes,\h\h

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,720
when you bully people too much, they\h
eventually start to team up. Against you.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,040
And that may be what’s\h
happening with Taiwan and Japan.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
It seems like Taiwan and Japan\h
teamed up to track a Chinese warship.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,080
Both sides are being pretty quiet\h
about it, but here’s what we know.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,320
According to a Japanese Defense Ministry\h
announcement, a Chinese warship, the Binzhou,\h\h

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,000
was caught in the East China Sea. That’s where\h
China and Japan have a territorial dispute\h\h

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
over some uninhabited islands. It sailed\h
through what's called the Miyako Strait.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,440
The Binzhou sailed through the narrow\h
waters between Taiwan and Japan’s\h\h

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,760
Westernmost inhabited island, Yonaguni.\h
That’s only 70 miles from Taiwan’s coast.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,120
Three Japanese ships tracked it. But on\h
May 1, this satellite image was released.\h\h

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,800
It shows that a Taiwanese warship was\h
also there, tracking the Chinese ship.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,840
“Taipei’s Apple Daily described it as\h
the first joint surveillance operation\h\h

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
between Taiwan and Japan.”

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,160
However, Taiwan’s defense ministry didn’t\h
confirm that. It just said they track any\h\h

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,520
Chinese warship sailing through designated\h
areas. And remember, it was close to Taiwan.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,880
A Taiwan defense official said, the\h
Binzhou’s “crew was likely on a training and\h\h

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,480
intelligence-gathering mission,” and “‘did not\h
pose a serious threat’ to Taiwan’s security.’”

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,200
I mean, not a serious threat, other than\h
the fact China has promised to conquer\h\h

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
Taiwan. Which is what all China’s training\h
and intelligence-gathering missions are for.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,760
And China’s People’s Liberation\h
Army didn’t stop there.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
While the Binzhou warship was sailing between\h
Taiwan and Japan, five Chinese fighter jets\h\h

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,160
flew into Taiwan’s air defense identification\h
zone—this time between Taiwan and the Philippines.

31
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,280
“According to Taipei's Defense Ministry,\h\h

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,200
a Chinese Y-8 anti-submarine warfare\h
aircraft crossed the Bashi Channel.”

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,760
The Bashi Channel the Chinese aircraft flew over,\h
and the Miyako Strait the Binzhou sailed through,\h\h

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
are both very important strategic locations.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,040
They’re among the few waterways the Chinese\h
military has of exiting the first island chain.\h\h

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,040
They can be used to give or cut off access\h
between the South China Sea and the Pacific.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,120
In other words, these are territorial\h
waters the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
must take in order to secure a grip on the\h
region. So the Communist Party is being\h\h

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,560
very clear about its long-term goals. Which are\h
obviously concerning to both Japan and Taiwan.

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
And while the two countries don’t\h
have official diplomatic relations,\h\h

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,040
there are signs that ties are warming.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
Yes, despite Japan having\h
occupied Taiwan for 50 years,\h\h

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,800
they can still be friends. And\h
for that, you can thank China.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,880
your identity. Everything you do online is being\h

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,280

And in many cases, by the government.

48
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,320
And if you’re in an\h
authoritarian country like China\h\h

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,080
this kind of tracking can put you at\h
risk of surveillance and even arrest.
