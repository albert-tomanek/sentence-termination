00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,120
Exploding manhole covers

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
Show how China’s construction\h
just doesn’t hold up.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Chinese New Year is around the corner.\h
Do you know where your firecrackers are?\h\h

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,840
Remember to keep them away from children.

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,520
Wait, I thought manhole covers were supposed to\h
weigh like 250 pounds each. A single firecracker\h\h

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,160
blew five manhole covers into the air? I don’t\h
think those manhole covers were up to code.

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,920
And that’s not the only manhole cover\h
related explosion coming out of China.\h\h

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,480
A few months earlier, in a\h
different city, this happened.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
According to Newsweek, “The explosion is\h
believed to have been caused when the boy’s\h\h

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,480
live firecracker ignited\h
flammable gases underground.”

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Wait, why were there FLAMMABLE GASES UNDERGROUND?!

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,360
And isn’t the whole point of having heavy iron\h
manhole covers to prevent them from being moved?

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
Fortunately, the kid was ok.\h

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
But if you think these are isolated incidents,\h
you’ve never been to the real China.

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,920
These are what are known as tofu-dreg\h
projects. Tofu-dreg is a slang term in\h\h

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,800
China used to describe poor quality construction.\h

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Yes, shoddy construction is so common in\h
China, there’s a special phrase for it.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,120
The phrase was coined in 1998 by former Premier\h
Zhu Rongji when he visited the Yangtze River\h\h

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,720
and described the flood\h
dykes there as being flimsy\h\h

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,240
like the crumbly bits left\h
over after you make tofu.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,240
Under the Chinese Communist Party, the\h
culture of corruption seeps into everything.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,880
When it comes to construction, corruption\h
can happen at any stage—design,\h\h

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,840
planning, procuring materials, and building.\h
People cut costs to skim money at each level,\h\h

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,360
they ignore safety rules, and\h
they even bribe inspectors.

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
And then you get things like\h
this: You can peel off the\h\h

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,840
“concrete” of this bridge with your\h
bare hands. Don’t light a firecracker.

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,960
Now I’m not saying *all* Chinese construction\h\h

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,720
is like this. But in mainland\h
China, it’s shockingly common.

30
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,280
Last year, a poorly built hotel that had\h
been converted into a quarantine center\h\h

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
collapsed, killing more than two dozen people.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
People were outraged. So why\h
doesn’t the government just step\h\h

33
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,200
in and fix the problem? Because they’re in on it!

34
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,400
“Local governments... have massive incentives\h
to promote rapid and unfettered growth,\h\h

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,560
and often turn a blind eye to construction\h
standards. For one, local governments rely on\h\h

36
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,720
the revenues arising from construction, including\h
land sales and transfer fees... For another,\h\h

37
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,680
local officials are promoted based on\h
the growth rates of their jurisdictions.”

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,240
Construction companies under China’s corrupt\h
communist system cut corners at nearly every\h\h

39
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,040
step of the process. And local officials don’t\h
seem to care. In fact, they often get a cut of\h\h

40
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,840
the extra profits. As long as the buildings get\h
built and look ok, they’re doing a bang-up job.

41
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,800
Just don’t bang on the walls.

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
Or get them wet.

43
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,120
And you’ll get a kick out of this. One guy did.\h\h

44
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:20,160
Within the next minute, 215 guardrail posts\h
fell into the water across nearly half a mile.

45
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,640
It’s like playing dominoes, except you could die.\h

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
I also recommend you don’t live\h
in an area that has typhoons,\h\h

47
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,280
so...half of China’s east coast. I really hope\h
this blows the lid off of Chinese corruption.

48
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,840
Otherwise the issue could\h
just fall through the cracks.

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,320
And this kind of thing happens everywhere,\h
even in residential apartments.

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,840
Have fun trying to tell your boss you can’t come\h
into work today because THE STAIRS FELL OFF!

51
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Basically it’s exactly what happened in\h
The Money Pit, only instead of one house,\h\h

52
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
it’s the entire country.\h

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
With all the Chinese Communist Party’s\h
propaganda about their fancy skyscrapers...

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,840
and high speed trains...

55
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,960
...there are a lot of problems under the surface.

56
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,840
Just last summer, the Shanghai Tower (Corner\h
Box), China’s tallest building, had a huge water\h\h

57
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,960
leak that reached from the 60th floor down to the\h
9th floor, ruining furniture and office supplies.

58
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
I’ll take a rain check on that one.

59
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,760
Now tofu-dreg projects are kind of a\h
sensitive topic for Chinese leader Xi Jinping,\h\h

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,160
who claims to be implementing\h
nationwide anti-corruption measures.\h\h

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
The truth is, he’s not actually stopping\h
corruption. And he definitely doesn’t want\h\h

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,840
to hear your feedback either. Like if you tell him\h
the Three Gorges Dam is cracking under pressure.

63
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,680
“Beijing recently admitted the wall\h
has ‘leaked, moved and distorted.’”

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
But only because it was already obvious.

65
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
We can only hope that there will\h
finally be an end to the tofu-dreg\h\h

66
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,120
projects soon—or at some point the dam is really\h
going to burst for the Chinese Communist Party.

67
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
And the whole thing could blow up in their face.

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a viewer who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

69
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,960
Jason says: “Hey Chris, video idea: Short\h
video on how the CCP effects everyone's life.\h

70
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Whenever I try to educate people about the\h
CCP,\h some people just don't care because\h\h

71
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,440
they think China is so far away how could\h
it ever have an impact on their life.”

72
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,640
Well, Jason, this whole video was\h
about how the culture of corruption\h\h

73
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,920
affects the lives of regular people in mainland\h
China. People there actually have to live and\h\h

74
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,320
work in these poorly made buildings, and\h
there’s very little they can do about it.

75
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,920
This kind of tofu-dreg construction also happens\h
in countries that are part of China’s Belt and\h\h

76
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,320
Road initiative—or really anywhere that\h
uses Chinese construction and materials.

77
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,200
If you want good quality Chinese\h
construction...go to Taiwan.

78
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,880
Thanks, Jason.

79
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,440

82
