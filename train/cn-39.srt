1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,660
playing Citation Needed. Joining me in the studio today, he reads books, you know it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,700
Hello!

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,240
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,980
Good evening...!

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,020
And the bounciest man on the internet, Matt Gray!

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,980
Hello YouTube...

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,000
In front of me, I have an article from Wikipedia, and these folks can't see it. All...

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,060
Matt!

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,080
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING].

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,380
And theres a special prize for particularly good answers which is...

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,840
So undignified.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,400
Today's article is Thomas Trueblood.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,000
That's a fine Victorian name, I'm thinking...

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,060
Uh, you're right. Yes...

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,460
Born...I'll give you a point for that.

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:36,960
Thank you! [DING]

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,400
Born 1856.

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,780
Was he an engineer?

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,180
No...not at all, quite the opposite, in fact.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,800
A demolitions expert!

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, not literally the opposite.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,980
Was he going around mills, letting the steam out?

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,580
Fly free, water vapour! Begone from your...

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,800
Thomas Trueblood. So...Victorian not-an-engineer...

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,860
Yeah...he's very much in the liberal arts.

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,000
Author.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Uh, no. Not really. More to do with, um, spoken word than the written word.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,000
Was he president of the British Shouting Association?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Oh...you're not close enough for a point...but you're in the right area.

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,200
American Oratorial Society.

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,420
I will give you the point there. [DING] He's a Professor of Oratory and Elocution.

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,200
And somehow I said that really, really, eloquently, because...

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,900
-- Oratory and elocution.
-- Elocution, darling(!)

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,940
Yes...

36
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,300
Um, Trueblood gave dramatic readings around the world.

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,460
He did a performance of Hamlet.

38
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,940
What might have been special about that?

39
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,980
All he did was rent out some pork products

40
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,460
Ham-let. Jesus(!)

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,560
I want it back, sithee...

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Oh sorry, elocution. I would like that back when you're finished with it.

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,020
First radio performance of Hamlet?

44
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,860
Little bit early for that, sadly. We're...1908.

45
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,960
First slapstick performance of Hamlet?

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,700
Chuckle Brothers' Hamlet.

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,960
To me, to you...

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,500
Do we have to explain the Chuckle Brothers to the rest of the internet?

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,760
-- No.
-- They can Google it...it's fine.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,020
Don't Google it!

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,760
Yeah, do!

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
Don't!

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,380
It was simply a one-man, abridged production.

54
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,400
Was it just really short?

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,080
I quote here, "It is his plan to keep the principal scenes of the play, narrating the unimportant parts."

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Like it!

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,880
He literally just skipped the boring bits.

58
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,620
"Hamlet, the highlights."

59
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,200
Yup!

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,900
I could do that...I could do that kind of Shakespeare!

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
"Everybody dies."

62
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,060
"Hamlet."

63
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,800
"Everybody dies..."

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
"Romeo and Juliet."

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,620
Yeah.

66
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,000
The most notable thing in this article is just titled...

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
"The Jam Handy incident."

68
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,280
Who is Jam Handy?

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, that is literally the question I would like to ask you.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,260
Because it's a name!

71
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,000
I assume it's some precursor to the Hamburglar.

72
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,100
I'm for your delicious conserves!

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,320
"You can't stop me, Trueblood. Why...I don't know why you run a conserve business...

74
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,240
"but you see where I'm driving at..."

75
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,200
"You see where we're going with this..."

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,000
Did he savagely put down Jam Handy in a debate?

77
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,360
Ooh, yes. Sure.

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,020
Was this a scandal because Jam Handy was of the upper class and Trueblood was of the middle class?

79
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,220
Well, you wouldn't want to fight him...

80
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,720
'cause Jam Handy's damn handy!

81
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,200
It's a wonderful plot...

82
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
but no it's not.

83
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Jam Handy was a freshman student,

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,100
17 years old.

85
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,040
Henry Jamison Handy,

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,200
hence Jam Handy.

87
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,480
Yeah, if I had that kind of a name, I think I'd go with Jam Handy as well, so yeah.

88
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
He got a bronze in the 1904 Olympics.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,020
Was that the Olympics where they had to stop the marathon, because the bloke drove a car and won it?

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,020
Um, give me a moment...

91
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,800
There was one of those Olympics where the marathon was called off

92
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,920
'cause some bloke blatantly ran the first hundred yards, got in a car, drove it

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,140
That's much more common in the Tour de France in the early years as well.

94
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,640
Yeah.

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,480
Gary...

96
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,320
No way!

97
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,660
Nice!

98
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,160
Really?

99
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,860
Smooth!

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,060
1904 Summer Olympics,  Frederick Lorz rode the rest of the way

101
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,080
in a car, to retrieve his clothes, after dropping out after nine miles.

102
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,060
So he dropped out at nine miles, rode the rest of the way,

103
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,360
then the car broke down at mile 19, and he just started jogging again!

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
To be fair, Lorz went on to win the Boston marathon, but the actual winner

105
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,060
was a Brit called Thomas Hicks

106
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,880
who was a Brit running for the US.

107
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,900
But he had been...

108
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,120
doped, it would be in modern terms.

109
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,320
He was supported by his trainers when he crossed the finish...

110
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,700
What had they given him?

111
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,420
Brandy!

112
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,240
Yes! [DING]

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,420
Spot on with brandy. Have the point. What had they mixed it with?

114
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,280
Beans!

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,000
Cocaine!

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,240
Ketamine!

117
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,060
Margarine!

118
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Rat poison.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,940
Bollocks!

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,260
-- What?!
-- Harsh!

121
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,180
Strychnine sulfate.

122
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,960
Right...

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,500
Poisoned you in just the right way, if done in just the right amount?

124
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,340
Yup!

125
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,540
He possibly would have died in the stadium, had he not been treated by several doctors.

126
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,200
Why did you say brandy?

127
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,440
Because it just seems to be...
it's just the standard pick-me-up.

128
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,040
Again, 'cause I do cycling and follow cycling...

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
Early days of the Tour de France...

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,520
Stop, have a brandy, crack back on!

131
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,600
It's traditional sort of mind, brain, and nerve tonic. You know...

132
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,040
It gets worse. 'Cause we had Frederick Lorz, rode some of the way in a car...

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Thomas Hicks, technically won,
but doped by modern terms

134
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,020
Felix Carvajal -- I might've mispronounced that --
is a Cuban postman.

135
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,960
Arrived at the last minute, ran in his street clothes. What kind of slowed him down?

136
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,660
His bag full of post.

137
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,920
And his hat.

138
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,160
Getting attacked by every dog on the way.

139
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Yes.

141
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,400
Getting it off all the ladies on the way.

142
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,020
Oh hang on, yeah.

143
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah.

144
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,080
He just picked up a sarnie on the way?

145
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,560
Not quite a sarnie...

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,740
Tackled a cow!

147
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,580
Had a bite.

148
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,240
No, not quite. It was a vegetable, rather than an animal

149
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,280
Potato?

150
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,780
He stood in a marrow?

151
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,000
Just clomped along with it on his foot!

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,620
"I've been attacked by a squash!"

153
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,000
"How am I meant to run in these marrowy clogs?!"

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,340
What do I need this for?

155
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,040
I mean the clogs are the main problem there, really.

156
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,280
I mean, I know technically the Dutch marathon team do use them, but...

157
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,980
Can you imagine...

158
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,040
the best thing about the English language...

159
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,180
nowhere else in the world is anyone going to yell today...

160
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,800
"How do I win in these marrowy clogs?"

161
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,940
Marrowy Clogs actually came fifth.

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Right now, we need to smash cut to somewhere in the Netherlands.

163
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,960
"How do I run in these marrowy clogs?!"

164
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,460
"No one else say that today..."

165
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,960
No, he stopped off to have some apples that he took from an orchard.

166
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,360
Why did those actually slow him down a little bit?

167
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,480
Arsenic poisoning?

168
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,380
Uh...why arsenic?

169
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,520
There's...in apple seeds is that arsenic?

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,480
-- Cyanide.
-- Cyanide! Sorry, wrong thing, right idea.

171
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,420
Were they a lot of crab apples?

172
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,540
Did they give him...like a dodgy tummy?

173
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,800
Um, they did give him a dodgy tummy.

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,480
They were just rotten.

175
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,380
Oh, you idiots.

176
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,300
Well that wasn't very bright...

177
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,580
You would know if you picked up a rotten apple!

178
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,380
He had to lie down and take a nap!

179
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,620
And here's the thing...

180
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,160
this is why you say 1904...this is possibly why it stuck in your head,

181
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,260
because there were so many things...

182
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,420
despite that, he finished fourth!

183
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,260
How?!

184
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,660
So someone's had a nap, the other guy got in the car...

185
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,140
So presumably he actually finished second because the first two cheated...

186
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,960
Well, uh, no. The guy who...

187
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,680
Doping wasn't technically an offense at that point.

188
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,180
Oh, okay.

189
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,100
There wasn't synthetic drugs there, they'd given him an incredibly dangerous cocktail

190
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,820
and no one had thought to put that in the rules.

191
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,140
Is this all the same race?

192
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,220
This is all the same race!

193
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,940
This is the 1904 Olympic marathon.

194
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,540
Now you said, "Was he chased by dogs?"

195
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,460
The postman wasn't...

196
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,380
one of the other runners was!

197
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,600
Nearly a mile off course.

198
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,860
Um, one of the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics.

199
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,780
Uh, Len Tau was chased a mile off course by aggressive dogs.

200
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,180
You've got a dog Benny Hill,

201
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,600
you've got a man cheating in a car,

202
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,220
you've got a bloke on brandy,

203
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,260
another guy who's had a nap.

204
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,820
And they weren't even part of the Olympics!

205
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,020
The Africans running the marathon, they just...

206
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,700
they were students from South Africa who'd been brought over as part of an exhibit on the Boer War

207
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,280
that was next to the Olympics!

208
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Had they just thought "We'll have a go."

209
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,180
"We'll have a go!"

210
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,480
"It's only 26 miles."

211
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,060
Why...why has this not been serialized for television?!

212
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,440
Guys, I think we found the format...

213
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Yes!

214
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,560
Um, a long time ago, folks, we were talking about Jam Handy.

215
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,420
Oh, we were!

216
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,540
Oh, what was he about again?

217
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,680
Refresh my memory.

218
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,020
He got a bronze in the 1904 Olympics in swimming.

219
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,160
But what we're actually talking about is what he did to Thomas Trueblood.

220
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,760
Did he heckle him in a particularly hilarious fashion?

221
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,480
Um, not in person.

222
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,300
Started a scandal about him.

223
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,980
Ooh, yeah, surely.

224
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,460
Yes, have a point. [DING]

225
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,040
-- Yay!
-- Yes.

226
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,680
"Once mispronounced something...
if you know what I mean."

227
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm going to give you another point, because it really is [DING] "if you know what I mean".

228
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,300
Trueblood was teaching, and I'm going to quote here,

229
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,420
"The delivery of short extracts from masterpieces of oratory".

230
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,780
Which was from a scene from a play,

231
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,880
in which a man kneels in front of a woman, pleading for her hand.

232
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,220
Okay?

233
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,820
Nothing particularly off-colour about that.

234
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,700
Unfortunately, Handy then wrote an article for a newspaper.

235
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,500
Does anyone want to guess what he actually said was going on there?

236
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,580
Oh! Some kind of dirty filth?

237
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,620
That was not fit for the stage.

238
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,780
Yeah, you can have a point there. [DING]

239
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,020
He said that students at Ann Arbor were taking lessons in lovemaking.

240
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,200
A lesson in Victorian lovemaking would be: man is knelt in that fashion,

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,700
lights go off,

242
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,400
someone goes ouch, lights come back on,

243
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,320
she's got a baby.

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,960
That's basically how it works in those days, I think. That's accurate.

245
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,220
It's how it works now, isn't it?

246
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,780
That article did the 1900s equivalent of going viral, because...

247
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,060
Sold three copies!

248
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,120
Yeah, well every...the local newspaper picked it up, then the national newspaper picked it up,

249
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,700
and all of a sudden, Trueblood is sitting there,

250
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,340
in his superior's office
with all these cuttings around him going

251
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,940
"I didn't do this!"

252
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,560
I quote here, from the Chicago Tribune...

253
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,460
"Trueblood has nearly worn out his trousers at the knees."

254
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,080
You've got to pay your way through college somehow...

255
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,780
We've all been there, eh, fellows?

256
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,600
Um, what did Handy...

257
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,120
Um, Handy went on to do many things,

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
um, he went on to be athletic.

259
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,980
What was his main job?

260
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,760
Parachutist.

261
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,560
Public Relations.

262
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,620
Aww...

263
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,700
There's this lovely picture here of the last...

264
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,900
you know the vanity card, the last thing you see, when the logo comes up, and the...

265
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,400
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah

266
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,160
"A Jam Handy picture."

267
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800
At the end of the show, uh...

268
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
Oh! It's over! Thank God it's over!

269
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,720
Congratulations, Chris! You win this week.

270
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
Yay!

271
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,080
You win a miniature library,

272
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,320
to be inserted rectally

273
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,660
from which you can shoot the President of the United States.

274
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,800
It's a "Texas Book Suppository".

275
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,220
I was with you... I was against you...
It's just about come back...

276
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,980
Thank you very much to Chris Joel.

277
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,720
Thank you very much.

278
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,780
To Gary Brannan.

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
To Matt Gray.

280
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,580
Buh bye!

281
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,760
That's been the Technical Difficulties,

282
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,400
I've been Tom Scott,

283
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,360
and we'll see you next time!

284
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
