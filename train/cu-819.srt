1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,160
Chinese people beware!

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,840
Foreign Spies and Hostile Forces are out there

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
And only the Party can protect you

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,200
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,760
It’s almost time to celebrate the 100 year\h
anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,240
And you know what that means! It’s time to\h
crack down on sinister, hostile foreign forces.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,400
You see, there’s a problem with today’s youth\h
in China. They don’t love the Communist Party\h\h

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,840
enough. In fact, some even are enamoured with\h
the West, and its false promises of freedom.

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,480
That’s why at the end of last year,\h\h

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,840
Chinese leader Xi Jinping started a\h
new campaign to boost youth patriotism.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,200
And in the lead up to the CCP’s 100-year\h
anniversary, people are being asked to\h\h

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,760
monitor each other and whether they’re\h
making harmful comments on history.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,440
Which is basically anything\h
that’s not the Party line.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,840
And now, China is implementing\h
new counter espionage regulations.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,640
These regulations target what the Communist\h
Party calls foreign spies and hostile forces. And\h\h

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,440
anyone who might associate with\h
them. Well this sounds fun.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,280
State-run Xinhua interviewed a senior official at\h
the Ministry of State Security. He said, “Overseas\h\h

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,400
espionage and intelligence agencies and hostile\h
forces have intensified infiltration into China.”

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,800
And they’re “stealing secrets in\h
various ways and in more fields,\h\h

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,840
which poses a serious threat to China's\h
national security and interests.”

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
Oh, I see what’s happening here.\h\h

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,720
This is that thing where the Chinese Communist\h
Party criticizes “hostile foreign forces”\h\h

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,160
for things that the Communist Party\h
is actually doing to other countries.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,360
But it’s not like these are\h
vague, overarching regulations.\h\h

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,960
They’re very limited in scope. The\h
regulations only apply to “agencies,\h\h

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,600
groups, enterprises and institutions\h
and other social organizations”.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
So....every possible organization then.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,360
Is your Beijing stand-up comedy club being\h
infiltrated by hostile foreign forces?

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,960
No, seriously, because Beijing is monitoring\h
comedy shows for prohibited content.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
Prohibited content like jokes.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,560
Anyway, the Ministry of State\h
Security says these “agencies, groups,\h\h

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,600
enterprises and institutions and other\h
social organizations” will be responsible\h\h

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,920
for “arranging their working staff to sign\h
letters of commitment before taking up posts,\h\h

34
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,080
reporting their activities related to national\h
security, giving education to personnel ahead of\h\h

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,960
their departures abroad, and interviewing\h
personnel after their return to China.”

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,840
Great! Everyone gets a debriefing\h
if they’ve talked to foreigners.\h\h

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,400
And it kind of sounds like that might\h
include universities and private businesses.

38
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,320
Also, the way it’s set up sounds\h
like if one person gets in trouble,\h\h

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,960
the entire organization gets in trouble.\h\h

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,800
So you’ll want to be as overbearing as possible\h
in how you implement these new regulations.

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,000
According to a Chinese national security expert\h
interviewed by state-run Global Times, “Cases of\h\h

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,480
Chinese people working in various industries who\h
were wooed by money or intimidated to engage in\h\h

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,400
espionage activities and became pawns of\h
foreign spy intelligence agencies are numerous.”

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,640
Yeah, that’s exactly what Chinese\h
intelligence agencies do to Americans.

45
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,880
Anyway, this is part of a broader push\h
to warn Chinese people about the dangers\h\h

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,560
of foreign spies. Global Times recently published\h\h

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,520
this helpful graph to help educate the\h
masses about the risk of foreigners.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,640
They may target University students

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,800
or young active internet users

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
using money, friendship, or beauty.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,560
That’s right young active\h
internet users. Beware my beauty.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,360
Malcolm Davis , of the Australian Strategic\h
Policy Institute, says “[Beijing] is wanting\h\h

53
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,200
to bring commercial companies, universities,\h
media and think tanks even more under government\h\h

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,480
control to monitor and report the activities\h
of Western entities operating in China,\h\h

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,520
so this makes it more challenging for Western\h
companies to do business than it already is.”

56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,840
Even more challenging? Here’s an idea:\h\h

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
MAYBE WESTERN COMPANIES SHOULD\h
STOP DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA!

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Crazy, I know.

59
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,120
Obviously, it’s very vague what the Communist\h
Party means when it talks about spying.\h\h

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,880
The Global Times gives an example of a\h
20 year old Chinese journalism student\h\h

61
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
who worked for “a mainstream\h
Western media outlet”.

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
The student “engaged with more than 20 hostile\h
foreign groups and more than a dozen officials\h\h

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,360
of a Western country”, providing evidence\h
“that could be used to stigmatize China”.

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
So it sounds like this student\h
journalist was...doing journalism.\h\h

65
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Journalism that damaged China’s national\h
security. He was arrested in 2019.

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,840
If you ask me, the Party doesn’t\h
want Chinese people interacting\h\h

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,640
with Westerners and maybe hearing things\h
that might make them question the Party.

68
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,360
Which is why the main goal of these regulations\h
is not actually to stop foreign spies—but\h\h

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,560
to give the CCP even more access\h
to spy on Chinese citizens.

70
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Listen to this, “The regulation also gives\h
national security organs access to buildings,\h\h

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,640
internal materials, electronical media kits”—yes,\h\h

72
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,440
electronical—“facilities, or computers and\h
information systems of the companies involved.”

73
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,040
Of course that also applies\h
to Western companies in China.\h\h

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,520
So in a way, the CCP is bringing together\h
Chinese people and Western companies by\h\h

75
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,640
giving the shared experience...of being\h
spied on by Chinese authorities. Beautiful.

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,880
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,680
fans who support us on the\h
crowd funding website Patreon.

78
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
Nick S asks, “Is Hong Kong still worth visiting?\h\h

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
It's a shame I only found out in the\h
last year or so how awesome this city is.\h\h

80
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,880
Once international travel opens up I'd like\h
to see it before it's changed completely…”

81
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,000
Now that’s a great question. I love Hong Kong. One\h
of my favorite places I’ve ever visited. You know,\h\h

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,480
despite it being the only\h
place I’ve been teargassed.

83
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,240
Beautiful city, great people, great food and\h
culture. However, the National Security Law\h\h

84
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,360
is an absolute beast. Technically it applies to\h
everyone on the planet. So if you’ve been involved\h\h

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,800
in criticizing the Chinese Communist Party\h
anywhere in the world, and you go to Hong Kong,\h\h

86
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,160
you could get in trouble with authorities.\h
Now they said that would never happen.

87
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,480
But if you watch China\h
Uncensored on a regular basis,\h\h

88
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,640
you know not to trust anything\h
the Chinese Communist Party says.

89
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
The sad fact is that Hong Kong is now pretty much\h\h

90
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,680
just another Chinese city. Currently the\h
US State Department warns Americans should,\h\h

91
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,040
“Reconsider travel to the PRC’s Hong Kong\h
Special Administrative Region (SAR) due to\h\h

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,320
both arbitrary enforcement of local laws\h
and COVID-19-related travel restrictions.”

93
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,440
And they specifically cite the dangers of the\h
National Security Law that I just talked about.\h

94
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,400
So Nick, it’s still possible to go to Hong Kong.\h
But it’s a lot more risky than it used to be.\h\h

95
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,080
You should basically treat it like\h
you’re going to mainland China.

96
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,640
Thanks for your question Nick, and thanks for\h
joining the China Uncensored 50 cent army!

97
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,640

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,360
