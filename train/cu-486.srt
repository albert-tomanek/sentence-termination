1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,270
Trump declares a national emergency.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,240
It’s been dubbed the ‘Huawei ban’.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,880
What does this mean for security?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,600
And how will this affect Huawei’s global
ambitions?

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,949
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:22,289
Last week, US President Donald Trump signed
an Executive Order

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,109
saying no way to Huawei.

9
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,550
Well technically, it doesn't actually say
that.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,220
What it does say is "Executive Order on Securing

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,570
the Information and Communications Technology

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,160
and Services Supply Chain."

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,899
But a title like that is totally un-tweetable.

14
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:40,239
So everyone's just calling it the 'Huawei
ban.'

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,660
To be fair, Trump's executive order doesn't
actually name Huawei.

16
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,719
But everyone knows who he’s talking about.

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,829
It’s like that time in college when the
dining hall

18
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,640
took away all the waffle makers

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,810
because somebody kept breaking in at 2am

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,359
and stealing waffles.

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,390
Dave.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,489
Anyway, Huawei is the world’s largest provider
of networking gear

23
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:03,880
and the world’s number two smartphone vendor,

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,640
behind Samsung.

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,340
For years, congressional committees, the FBI,
the NSA,

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,920
and others have flagged close ties between
Huawei

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,220
and the Chinese Communist Party.

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,700
Last year, the US government banned...

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,720
the US government...

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,940
from using equipment made by Huawei

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,000
and the other big Chinese telecom company,
ZTE.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,840
That was over security concerns.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,260
But the new executive order took that ban
a big step further.

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,050
First, Trump declared a "national emergency."

35
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,050
And before you think,

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,610
“Here Trump goes again,

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,580
declaring another national emergency,”

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,710
it’s actually pretty common.

39
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,610
Obama declared 13 national emergencies.

40
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,690
George W. Bush declared 14,

41
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,170
and Clinton also declared 14.

42
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,660
So really, there are a lot more national emergencies

43
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,310
for President Trump to declare before his
term is up.

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,640
He’s probably got a list.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,910
Anyway, here’s how Trump’s current national
emergency works.

46
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,350
The Executive Order itself stops the use of
IT goods and services

47
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,430
from all companies subject to “foreign adversaries”

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,020
that pose “unacceptable risks” to national
security.

49
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,930
Then, the Commerce Department effectively
labeled Huawei

50
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,370
as belonging to one of those “foreign adversaries”—

51
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,370
i.e.

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,370
China—

53
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,410
by putting Huawei and 72 of its affiliates

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,200
on the Commerce Department’s “Entity List.”

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,000
The Entity List is a trade blacklist.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,490
Anyone on it is barred from buying

57
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,810
parts and components from US companies

58
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,510
without getting the US government’s approval
first.

59
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,760
And that approval is no easy thing.

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,620
That's because the ban has a so-called

61
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,000
"policy of presumption of denial."

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,660
Meaning, it's a no unless there's a really,

63
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,120
really good reason to say yes.

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
And \h"the U.S.

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Government has determined that there is

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,250
reasonable cause to believe that Huawei

67
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,190
has been involved in activities contrary to
the national security

68
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,630
or foreign policy interests of the United
States."

69
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,300
So I'm guessing Huawei purchases are generally
going to be a “no.”

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,810
"All the witnesses could you please raise
your hand

71
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,570
if you'd use products or services from Huawei
or ZTE?

72
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,630
None of you would.

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,130
You obviously lead intelligence services,

74
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,150
so that's something of a biased question.

75
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,380
Raise your hand if you would recommend that

76
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,400
private American citizens use Huawei

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,470
or ZTE products or services?

78
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,880
None of you again are raising your hand.

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,959
Thank you for that."

80
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,910
Senator Cotton raises an important point.

81
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,220
Or I assume he did because I was distracted

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,640
by the way that he kept mispronouncing Huawei.

83
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,560
It’s Huawei, with an H, people.

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,930
It’s not Wah-Wei.

85
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,760
Stop saying it like that!

86
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,920
Ahem.

87
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,140
Now if you're wondering what

88
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,290
the heads of US intelligence services know
about Huawei

89
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,610
that the average person does not,

90
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,630
here's FBI Director Christopher Wray.

91
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,620
“It provides the capacity to maliciously
modify or steal information,

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,569
and it provides the capacity to conduct undetected
espionage.”

93
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,459
Simply put, officials are worried that Huawei

94
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,430
will help the Chinese regime spy on the US

95
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,000
or attack America’s cyber infrastructure.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,690
How might Huawei do that specifically?

97
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,880
One way is “that companies like Huawei

98
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,329
might sell products compromised by ‘back
doors’

99
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,069
that allow Chinese government hackers

100
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,210
access to data or surveillance."

101
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,210
Although frankly,

102
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,500
I’m more concerned that if we put all our
technology

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,590
in the hands of equipment made in China,

104
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,680
one day it will simply stop working.

105
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,290
And when we try to reach customer service,

106
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,840
we keep getting redirected to the Chinese
consulate.

107
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,110
And they don’t even have our package!

108
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,069
Now, back in 2011 and 2012,

109
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,960
Vodaphone did find hidden backdoors in Huawei
equipment.

110
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,979
And there have been other reports of Huawei
backdoors.

111
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,740
But it’s not clear whether Huawei

112
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,879
purposefully included these backdoors,

113
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,129
or whether they were accidental security flaws

114
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,680
resulting from bad design.

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,689
Either way is bad.

116
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,270
So is there smoking gun evidence that Huawei

117
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,939
is putting back doors into its technology,

118
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,629
designed to allow it to spy on users?

119
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:06,629
No.

120
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,850
But there’s plenty of reason to believe

121
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,229
they would be motivated to.

122
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,669
Like Huawei's uncomfortably close links

123
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:16,419
to the armed wing of the Chinese Communist
Party—

124
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,409
the People's Liberation Army.

125
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,360
"Huawei is the PLA.

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,669
And if the senior executives of Huawei don't
like me saying that,

127
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,310
then bring it.

128
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,229
You are—and I would love to have discovery
on this one—

129
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,050
you are the People's Liberation Army."

130
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,150
I know what you’re thinking.

131
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,589
Steve Bannon, he’s probably just trying
to rile people up

132
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,199
by mispronouncing Wah-Wey

133
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,910
and mentioning the PLA.

134
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,190
It turns out, no.

135
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,050
Bannon just doesn’t know how to pronounce
Huawei, either.

136
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,919
Also, the founder and CEO of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei,

137
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,569
was an engineer with the People's Liberation
Army.

138
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,990
And last year for the 40th anniversary of
China’s

139
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,090
so-called “reform and opening-up,”

140
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,520
Ren Zhengfei was hailed one of 100 “excellent
private entrepreneurs”

141
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,740
who “firmly safeguard the leadership of
the Chinese Communist party.”

142
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,249
So much for being a totally independent private
company.

143
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:14,809
But the Trump administration’s moves have
already hamstrung Huawei.

144
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:19,169
For now, the Commerce Department’s Entity
List has had the biggest effect.

145
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,940
That’s the one that prevents US companies
from selling to Huawei.

146
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,089
According to Bloomberg,

147
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,219
top US tech companies have already begun to
cut off

148
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:31,279
the supply of microchips and other technology
to Huawei.

149
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,369
Chinese state-run media has gone on the defensive,

150
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:35,069
saying the Huawei ban is nothing

151
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,199
and we’ll be totally fine without chips
from American suppliers,

152
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,780
and really, who wants Made in America chips
anyway?

153
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,210
Huawei's chip arm HiSilicon said last Friday

154
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,740
it's been prepared for the scenario

155
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,240
that it could be banned from purchasing U.S.
chips and technology.

156
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,009
HiSilicon says it's been "vigorously investing

157
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,090
in self-developed technologies,

158
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,919
and is able to ensure a steady supply of most
products

159
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,240
to make sure Huawei will be able to continue
serving its customers."

160
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,379
Or, as HiSilicon president said in a letter
cited by Straits Times,

161
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,139
“now is the time for ‘all the spare tyres
in the safe’ to become useful.”

162
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,360
Ok, firstly, who keeps tires in a safe?

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,650
Secondly, what does a microchip company do
with tires, anyway?

164
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,780
I think what we really need is a ban on stupid
metaphors.

165
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,840
Anyway, Huawei's CEO also insisted that Huawei

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,719
is totally ready for the ban—

167
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,520
while also briefly noting that “the company's
annual revenue growth

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,409
may undershoot 20 percent.”

169
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,990
That’s a lot to... “undershoot”.

170
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,660
It’s like, if you’re flying from New York
to San Francisco,

171
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,229
and you undershoot by 20%,

172
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,110
you’ll end up in Battle Mountain, Nevada.

173
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,990
And no one wants to end up in Battle Mountain,
Nevada.

174
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,979
It’s the Armpit of America.

175
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,860
And while Chinese media are saying 'there's
nothing to see here',

176
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,400
the Chinese Foreign Ministry sure is crying
foul.

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,220
“We call upon the U.S. to stop using the
excuse of 'security issues'

178
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,389
to indiscriminately suppress Chinese companies,

179
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,389
and provide a fair,

180
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,289
just environment devoid of discrimination
for Chinese companies

181
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,219
investing and operating in the U.S.”

182
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,900
Yes, it’s very unfair for the US

183
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,210
to discriminate against Chinese companies.

184
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,050
How could a country just outright ban

185
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,210
foreign tech companies from operating in their
market.

186
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,629
So unjust.

187
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,990
And on a totally unrelated note, Google.

188
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,110
One of numerous American tech companies

189
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,930
that has been blocked from the China market.

190
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,029
Google announced it would cut Huawei off from

191
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,120
some of the Android software that Huawei runs
on.

192
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,630
Specifically, Huawei won't be able to license

193
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,269
the Android operating system with Google services,

194
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:45,100
and will instead have to use a bare-bones

195
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,430
open-source version of Android.

196
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,200
And that means Huawei is in trouble.

197
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,279
"Half of all of its shipments are sold outside
of China

198
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:55,740
and all of those shipments depend on Google
services

199
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,920
being present on them.

200
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,110
If they're not present on them,

201
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,089
no matter how good anything Huawei comes up
with is,

202
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,769
they're going to have a really hard time

203
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,380
selling devices outside of China a

204
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,680
nd that is the essence of the problem."

205
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,240
One tech industry consultant said,

206
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,509
“It will be like an instant kill switch
for Huawei’s ambition

207
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,660
to overtake Samsung in the global market.”

208
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,160
But Huawei has a little more time to figure
it out.

209
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Because earlier this week,

210
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,089
the Commerce Department issued a temporary
license

211
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,350
that allows Huawei to do business with US
companies for 90 days.

212
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,620
That means if you have a Huawei phone,

213
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,180
you can get your Android updates until August!

214
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,720
And after that,

215
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,700
Huawei will roll out its own software.

216
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,440
I hear that when you use Huawei Maps,

217
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,900
no matter where you are in the world,

218
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,199
you’re still within the nine-dash line.

219
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,740
So what do you think about the Huawei ban?

220
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,410
Leave your comments below.

221
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,410
And while you’re here,

222
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,840
it’s time for me to answer another question

223
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,750
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

224
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,850
with a dollar or more per episode—

225
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,410
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

226
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,050
xXAMightyStormXx asks:

227
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,569
“...I've been thinking of getting a Huawei
phone

228
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,089
and just google pro chinese stuff on it

229
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,629
to make sure that I get to be in

230
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:07,800
the good foreigners for china bracket in the
CCP

231
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,310
Do you guys think that would work?”

232
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,940
Well, if you get a Huawei phone,

233
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,220
you might not be able to do much Googling
on it after all.

234
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,019
But as for the idea of a foreigner saying
pro-CCP things

235
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,079
on your phone to get in their good graces,

236
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,079
don’t bother.

237
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,089
You’ll waste your time

238
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,839
because no one will bother monitoring you.

239
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,279
And unless you’re actually working for a
Chinese company in China,

240
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,449
it’s not going to help you get promoted.

241
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:32,750
Now if you want to do it much more publicly,

242
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,750
maybe someone will notice and get you a job

243
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,050
working for Chinese state-run media,

244
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,850
where you can spend all day posting stories
about pandas.

245
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,190
It’s hard to imagine a worse job.

246
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,259
Thanks for your question.

247
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,500
And thanks for watching China Uncensored.

248
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,120
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

249
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
See you next time.
