00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,430
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,410
Taiwan—Donald Trump’s trump card!

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,929
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,370
Donald Trump has now been in office for...

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,890
okay, well, he’s still a month away from
assuming office,

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,120
but he's already making

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,400
ch-ch-ch-changes!

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,300
Yes, turn and face the strain.

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,310
Because for one,

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,550
it looks like he might change 40 years

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,410
of US diplomatic policy in regards to Taiwan—

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,950
policy created in part to avoid having a war
with China.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,950
On Sunday,

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,150
Trump questioned the “One China” policy.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,730
That's the policy where both China and Taiwan

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,270
agree that there's only one China,

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,730
but disagree on which one that one is.

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,160
And the US has its own one China policy

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,510
where it also agrees that there's only one
China,

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,100
but unlike China's version,

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,269
the US doesn't recognize China's authority
over Taiwan.

23
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,269
Whew.

24
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,340
You know what?

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,670
Let's just call it the Highlander policy.

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,670
For clarity.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,640
Anyway, let's recap.

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,829
Two weeks ago, Trump took a phone call

29
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,759
from Taiwanese president Tsai Ying-wen.

30
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,340
That’s the first time in 40 years

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,780
a US president has spoken directly

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,009
with a Taiwanese president.

33
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,520
And that left many with mixed feelings.

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,119
Not the Chinese regime though.

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,789
They were very clear on how they felt.

36
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,399
But even though they consider Taiwan

37
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,100
just a breakaway province,

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,509
they decided to just play it cool with Trump.

39
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,960
Agree to disagree.

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,100
There are indeed some disagreements and differences
of opinion,

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,469
this has been the status quo of U.S.-China
relations.

42
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,469
Vice President-Elect Mike Pence also said
it wasn’t a big deal.

43
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:55,719
The waters here seem like a little bit of
a tempest in a teapot.

44
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,130
Haha, well, now it’s tea time.

45
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,740
I fully understand the one China policy,

46
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,170
but I don’t know why we have to be bound

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,520
by a ‘one China’ policy

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,030
unless we make a deal with China

49
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,220
having to do with other things, including
trade.

50
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,730
Here's what China's foreign ministry spokesman
said in response:

51
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,080
There can be only one!

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,840
Or to quote him more accurately,

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,110
China has noted the report

54
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,920
and expresses serious concern about it

55
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,380
Upholding the one China principle
is the political basis for developing China-US

56
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
ties.

57
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,190
If this basis is interfered with or damaged
then the healthy development of China-US relations

58
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,230
and bilateral cooperation in important areas
is out of the question.

59
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,640
Expressing “serious concern”
may not sound like the strongest language

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,700
out there.

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,610
But the Chinese Foreign Ministry always maintains
an air of decorum and self restraint.

62
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,690
Because the Chinese regime has state-run Global
Times

63
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,900
to express how it really feels.

64
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,250
Trump is “as ignorant as a child” it says.

65
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,720
And “In response to Trump's provocations,

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,190
Beijing could offer support,

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,910
even military assistance to US foes.”

68
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,430
and may even start a war to retake Taiwan.

69
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,430
Of course,

70
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,680
the Global Times is like the New York Post

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,350
of Chinese state-run media.

72
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,010
So while amusing,

73
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,160
we shouldn't read too much into what it says.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,660
It would be like freaking out every time a
politician

75
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,870
says something on Twitter.

76
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,990
People in Trump’s camp

77
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,180
have balked at the idea

78
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,090
of having to make concessions to the Chinese
Communist Party.

79
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,170
Stephen Moore,

80
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,420
a former economic adviser to Donald Trump

81
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,450
and chief economist of the The Heritage Foundation

82
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,750
had this to say in a recent radio interview.

83
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,200
Too many namby-pamby people

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,020
in the foreign policy shop

85
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,840
are saying “Oh my gosh

86
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
we can’t do this,

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
we might insult the Chinese.”

88
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,460
Taiwan is our ally, John.

89
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,720
That is a country that we have backed

90
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,810
because they believe in freedom.

91
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,540
We ought to back our ally,

92
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,430
and if China doesn’t like it,

93
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,710
screw ’em.

94
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,890
And despite what President-Elect Trump says

95
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,910
about the call with Taiwan being something

96
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,490
he only heard about an hour before the call,

97
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,640
reports from Trump’s transition team

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,710
seem to show the call was actually months
in the making,

99
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,180
thanks to lobbyists like former U.S. presidential
candidate

100
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,299
Bob Dole,

101
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,930
who may have been paid by Taiwan.

102
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,930


103
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,639
Meanwhile, the Taiwanese government has no
comment

104
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,580
on Trump’s remarks.

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,790
Taiwan is in a tricky situation here.

106
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,539
Trump seems to view the One China policy

107
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,229
as a bargaining chip that the US can use

108
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:34,139
to get China to cooperate on trade and other
issues.

109
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,069
Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party

110
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,849
views the policy as non-negotiable.

111
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,240
And while Taiwan may welcome more recognition

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,580
and stronger support from the US,

113
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,669
the country-slash-region is at risk

114
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,479
if the boat gets rocked too much.

115
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,479
In fact,

116
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,080
a majority of Taiwanese want to keep the status
quo

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,460
with China forever.

118
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,539
Sure, they may not be formally recognized

119
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,129
as a state right now,

120
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:02,759
but at least those 1,600 missiles pointed
at them aren't firing.

121
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,070
So what’s next?

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,860
Is Trump leading the US to war with China?

123
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,319
Or is he standing up for Taiwan?

124
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,259
And should we just rename the One China policy

125
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,479
the Highlander policy instead?

126
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,990
Tell me what you think in the comments below.

127
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,900
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

128
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,610
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell,

129
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,770
see you next time.
