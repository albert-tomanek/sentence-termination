00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,899
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,759
Are Chinese tourists invading South Korea?

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,880
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,940
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,490
Lunar New Year.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,110
A time for Chinese citizens to celebrate family.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,930
And China's transit system.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,500
But there's a new New Year's tradition among
Chinese citizens with money.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,440
Matt Gnaizda has more.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,300
Chinese New Year.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,660
For China's growing middle and upper class,

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,550
it's a two week break from the monotony of
white collar office jobs.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,440
And there's a growing trend among these Chinese
to

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
not be in China.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,680
One of the hottest new tourist destinations
this time of year

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,040
is South Korea.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,239
And why are Chinese so fond of South Korea?

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,700
Why do you like Korea?

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,380
Korea...

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,620
I don’t especially like Korea.

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,740
The shopping is convenient,

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,840
but the food takes some getting used to.

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,700
I like this country.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
It’s very civilized.

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,380
Why do you like it?

26
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,720
The culture attracted me.

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,851
People are very polite.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,710
What else?

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,180
The shopping is pretty good.

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,160
The beauty products and makeup are really
good.

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,920
So, polite shopping is a huge draw.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,460
But while everyone I talked to was nice,

33
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,460
Chinese tourists overall

34
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,629
don't exactly have a stellar reputation.

35
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:33,299
Last year, this video posted by a Thai celebrity

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,409
visiting South Korea went viral.

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,700
Everyone was lining fine

38
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,520
Then the Chinese got here

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,460
And LOOK

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,820
They don't know what

41
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:42,949
it means to have manner,

42
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:45,301
to form line, or to have curtesy! None!

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,380
Whether it's clumping in line,

44
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:48,359
spitting on the floor,

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,139
or urinating in public,

46
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,419
it's gotten so bad

47
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:54,509
that the Chinese government even published
a handbook

48
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,809
for Chinese tourists traveling abroad.

49
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,740
I mean look at these Chinese people at the
presidential palace in Seoul.

50
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:01,720
They…

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,840
Well, they seem pretty polite, actually.

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,740
But anyway, to get the real scoop, I decided
to ask some Koreans.

53
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,650
How is Chinese people's behavior when they're
here?

54
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,560
I think that problem will be

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,040
smaller and smaller,

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,900
day by day.

57
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,180
Most people's behavior is

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,020
very good and kind.

59
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,000
But I mean,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,600
do they really want so many Chinese visitors?

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,019
I think Chinese tourists coming to Korea is

62
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,219
very, very good for Korean economic system.

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,260
They spend more money in Korea,

64
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,329
so it can be a help for the Korean economy.

65
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,409
I'm looking forward to them—

66
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,120
more Chinese tourists coming to Korea.

67
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,219
Wow.

68
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,750
These Koreans are the nicest, politest people.

69
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,830
Let’s ask an American instead.

70
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,120
I don't like to judge too much on people

71
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,030
until I've actually experienced them,

72
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,910
and talked with them, but.

73
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:05,430
Can't you just stereotype everyone together?

74
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,060
You can, but

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,599
a lot of them only applies

76
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,739
to a few people of that race.

77
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,679
This is getting ridiculous!

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,509
You're causing me a problem here.

79
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,360
Don't edit my words in bad ways!

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,920
You mean, like this?

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,769
I don't...like...tourists from China...

82
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:28,449
They...are...not...considerate in public places.

83
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,209
I would never do something like that.

84
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,099
But if Chinese tourists are not that bad after
all,

85
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,779
does that mean they’re the best tourists
in South Korea?

86
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,019
So which are the best tourists?

87
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,800
Best tourists?

88
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,860
Say Americans.

89
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,550
Americans.

90
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,661
And there you go.

91
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,959
Alright, thanks very much.

92
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,159
This is Matt Gnaizda, reporting from Seoul.
