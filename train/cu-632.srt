1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,199
A shadowy Communist agency

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,100
Is responsible for infiltrating free societies

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,680
And Hong Kong

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,320
is losing the fight

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,980
Welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,480
I'm Chris Chapell.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,910
Joining me today is Dr Sonny Lo,

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,850
an author, professor and political commentator.

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,470
Thanks for joining me.

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,690
Hi, my pleasure.

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,600
So one of your areas of expertise

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,360
is the United Front work in Hong Kong.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,720
What is the United Front?

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,349
The United Front was originally the strategy

15
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:36,160
of the Chinese Communist Party to cooperate

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,979
with the Nationalist Party in China

17
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,899
during the early 1920s and later during the
1930s

18
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,089
to fight against the Japanese

19
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,199
so that both sides can form a kind of alliance

20
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,699
to deal with the Second World War.

21
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,839
The United Front work later on has evolved
into

22
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:00,850
an instrument used by the Chinese Communist
Party

23
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,940
to win the hearts and minds of the people.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,470
And in the context of Hong Kong,

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,990
United Front means that the Chinese government

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,500
has to do everything in order to win

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,980
the hearts and minds of the Hong Kong people.

28
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,740
So what are some of the goals of the United
Front?

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,110
Who are they targeting in Hong Kong?

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,840
The goals of United Front is to number one,

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,450
to win the political support of the ordinary
people

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,080
and secondly to get the support of the Hong
Kong people

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,350
who would support not only the local government
of Hong Kong,

34
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,220
but also the central government in Beijing.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,780
And thirdly, United Front work aims to prevent

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,450
the local Democrats from grabbing more seats
in the legislature

37
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,340
and also the district councils because in
the minds of Beijing,

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,170
if the political opposition in Hong Kong

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,670
can get into political power,

40
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,679
then the situation in Hong Kong would be tipped

41
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,710
in favor of the opposition rather than Beijing.

42
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,579
So basically the goal is to make Hong Kong
less autonomous

43
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,450
and more in line with the Communist Party's
goals.

44
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,430
In the minds of Beijing, United Front work

45
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,650
can coexist with the autonomy of Hong Kong.

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,020
Because in the minds of Beijing,

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,980
if United Front work is successful,

48
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,480
then the pro-Beijing forces would garner sufficient
public support

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
and capture most of the seats in the legislature.

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840


51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,650
So how does the United Front infiltrate a
Hong Kong society?

52
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,420
The United Front work infiltrates into Hong
Kong society

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,800
by using many interest groups like women,

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,590
like labor unions or like district [inaudible]

55
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,640
or even like neighborhood associations.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,290
Many of these interest groups were formerly

57
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,140
pro-British before 1997

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,790
but after 1997 most of these interest groups

59
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,750
have turned to Beijing mainly because of political
loyalty

60
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,780
and also because of financial incentives.

61
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,200
Because Beijing has dished out a lot of

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
financial and monetary incentives

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,150
to all these leaders of the interest groups.

64
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,150
And most importantly,

65
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,780
the leaders of the interest groups

66
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,050
have been appointed to the Chinese People's

67
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,250
Political Consultative Conference,

68
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,040
the Chinese National People's Congress.

69
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,210
So in terms of status, inference and power,

70
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,990
those co-opted Hong Kong elites,

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,300
they feel that they are more politically powerful
than ever before.

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,750
Is it just special interest groups

73
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,100
or is the United Front involved in the education?

74
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Business sector?

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,660
The United Front work also involves deeply
in the business sector

76
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,710
because many business people are highly pragmatic.

77
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,950
They want to do business with China,

78
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,290
they don't want to antagonize China.

79
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,540
So the business sector is particularly vulnerable.

80
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,530
The least vulnerable sector in Hong Kong

81
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,440
or to put it in another way,

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,870
the most resistant sector to United Front
work

83
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,540
is the education.

84
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,350
Because in the education sectors,

85
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,460
many intellectuals, academics, students,

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,239
they are highly post materialistic if you
like.

87
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,239
In other words,

88
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,440
they attach importance to values like human
rights,

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,940
democracy, sustainable development, civil
liberties,

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,610
and they are less interested in material incentives.

91
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,750
So from this perspective,

92
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,200
the education sector is the least vulnerable
to United Front work.

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,750
I'm curious, you talked about the business
sector.

94
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,180
How can you tell the difference between United
Front work

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,700
and just organic natural exchanges

96
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,040
between mainland China and Hong Kong?

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,280
The organic exchanges between mainland China
and Hong Kong

98
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,060
involves some more formalistic levels of exchange,

99
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,550
like for example, you know,

100
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,340
business associations interacting with

101
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,820
the Chinese government departments.

102
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,270
Before United Front work,

103
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,980
it can proceed from formal to more informal
co-optation.

104
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,460
That is to say they try to make friends with
you

105
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,680
and in the process of making friends,

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,430
they try to woo your side to support their
side politically.

107
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,270
So gradually the co-opted targets become their
friends,

108
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,520
and even solid supporters.

109
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,350
So it is a kind of a longterm movement to
win friendship,

110
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,460
to change friendship to political loyalty.

111
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,120
And when we're talking about the United Front,

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,720
the United Front is actually a division of

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,830
the Chinese Communist Party itself, correct?

114
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,910
The United Front Department within the Chinese
Communist Party

115
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,480
is mainly responsible for United Front work.

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,190
However many other Chinese departments

117
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,560
are also dealing with United Front work.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,970
For example, in the case of Hong Kong

119
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,460
we have their liaison office,

120
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,090
which is the representative office

121
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,380
of the Central Government in Hong Kong

122
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,670
and it is also responsible for United Front
work.

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,100
And quite often when the mainland Chinese
government departments

124
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,889
come to visit Hong Kong,

125
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,570
they may interact with some of

126
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,930
the business associations in Hong Kong.

127
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,360
And quite often United Front work is defined
broadly.

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,550
That is to say to win friendship,

129
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,480
to interact with our potential friends

130
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,100
and then to gain their political

131
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,410
and economic support in the long run.

132
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,020
So United Front work in China

133
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,400
is not conducted solely by the United Front
department.

134
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,150
It can be conducted by many other departments
as well.

135
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,030
So sort of like a whole of society method

136
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,450
of subverting and changing a society

137
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,880
to be in line with the Communist Party of
China?

138
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,380
Yeah, we can describe it as a kind of mechanism

139
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,770
in which various Chinese departments

140
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,510
are engaging with their opposite numbers,

141
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,260
so as to win the hearts and minds of the targeted
people,

142
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,350
targeted interest groups and targeted organizations.

143
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,430
So how successful has United Front work been
in Hong Kong?

144
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,070
Actually, United Front work

145
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,550
has been quite successful in Hong Kong,

146
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,220
particularly since the 2012

147
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,010
when the anti national education campaign

148
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,949
was launched by many young parents

149
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,690
and also students as well as intellectuals.

150
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,710
However, the October the,

151
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:34,400
the September to December Occupy Central movement
in 2014

152
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,280
constituted a strong resistance to United
Front work in China.

153
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,930
Many young people in Hong Kong together with
intellectuals,

154
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,080
they were determined to push for democratization

155
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,190
by using the Occupy Central movement, in 2014.

156
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,400
It failed, and so United Front work in China
has deepened further,

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,440
until this year when the government of Hong
Kong led by Carrie Lam

158
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,790
decided to introduce an extradition bill

159
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,310
and that extradition bill alienated many young
Hong Kong people

160
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,940
as well as ordinary people,

161
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,620
because many people were frightened that such
extradition bill

162
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,020
would probably lead to the possibility

163
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,120
that many Hong Kong people would be transfer

164
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,270
from Hong Kong to mainland China.

165
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,270
So United Front work that has its limitations.

166
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,550
The limitation is that with the education
sector

167
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,529
being very resistant to United Front work,

168
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,959
the extradition bill has failed to win

169
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,430
the hearts and minds of the ordinary people.

170
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,050
So what is it about the education sector

171
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,279
that makes United Front work not work?

172
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,420
The education sector is characterized

173
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,079
by very independent minded intellectuals

174
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,220
whose understanding of China

175
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,339
is not really through ideological indoctrination

176
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,959
or even socialization.

177
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,579
Unlike the mainland Chinese intellectuals
and students

178
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,269
who were educated in the mainland,

179
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,069
who are socialized and indoctrinated to combine

180
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:11,230
the cultural identity with the political identity

181
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,889
of accepting the CCP rule in the mainland.

182
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,249
In Hong Kong, traditionally the colonial rulers

183
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:21,999
were very loose in educating Hong Kong people

184
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,459
not to mention about Chinese nationalism.

185
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,809
So in Hong Kong traditionally and historically

186
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:33,379
the education system did not inculcate strong
patriotic sentiment

187
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,899
in the psyche of many young people.

188
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:42,610
And after 1997 this perhaps semi-colonial
education legacy persists.

189
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,990
Not only that, with the era of globalization,

190
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,980
many young Hong Kong people understand China

191
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,050
not through the textbook but through the Internet.

192
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,689
So in that sense the education sector in Hong
Kong

193
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,730
is highly autonomous.

194
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,790
So how does the United Front respond to things

195
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,300
like the Umbrella Movement or the extradition
bill protests,

196
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,319
much of which is student led,

197
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:05,779
student and teacher led?

198
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,240
The United Front, you know,

199
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
machinery responds to the Umbrella Movement

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,990
by resuscitating or reorganizing the youth
groups in Hong Kong.

201
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,829
They try to organize many pro-Beijing youth
groups

202
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,600
to support mainland's policy towards Hong
Kong

203
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,429
such as the recent Greater Bay Area plan

204
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,620
in which young people of Hong Kong

205
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,610
are encouraged to do business in China,

206
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,040
to work in China and even to reside in China.

207
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,459
However, the opposition to the extradition
bill

208
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:48,720
has dealt a severe blow to China's United
Front work in Hong Kong

209
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,639
because many young people are proven to be
very resistant

210
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,529
to the idea of political and economic integration

211
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:59,399
between Hong Kong and mainland China.

212
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,470
And I know the United Front is very active

213
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,410
in countries around the world.

214
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,620
How does the United Front work in Hong Kong

215
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,029
tie into United Front work globally?

216
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,999
United Front work in Hong Kong cannot be easily

217
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:15,170
translated into foreign countries for several
reasons.

218
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,639
Number one, in other foreign countries,

219
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,970
there are many overseas Chinese who have long
been assimilated

220
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,410
into the mainstream society of these countries.

221
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,350
So they are not so vulnerable to United Front
work.

222
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,860
Secondly, United Front work conducted by China

223
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,940
tends to focus on the individuals,

224
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,300
like the individuals, politicians or the individuals

225
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,920
who tend to have a emotional attachment to
China.

226
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,899
So in other words,

227
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,779
United Front work in Hong Kong is one thing.

228
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,680
United Front work, you know,

229
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,720
conducted by China in foreign countries

230
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,119
remains a relatively underdeveloped

231
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,279
and under-researched topic,

232
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,360
which is a fascinating one.

233
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,120
So with elections coming,

234
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,069
what chances do the pro democratic factions

235
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,809
have against the United Front?

236
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,519
Because of the protests of almost a million

237
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,600
to 2 million people against the extradition
bill,

238
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,540
we can safely anticipate that in the upcoming

239
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,800
November district council elections,

240
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,589
the localists and the Democrats

241
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,170
will have a strong political comeback.

242
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,370
However, whether the government of officials,

243
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,180
including the electoral officials responsible
for elections,

244
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,999
whether they allow some localists to run in
the elections

245
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,519
remains to be seen

246
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,119
and it will probably become a controversial
issue

247
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,899
because some localists advocate the idea

248
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,279
of quote self determination end of quote,

249
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,420
which is legally and politically unacceptable

250
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,660
to both Beijing and the Hong Kong authorities.

251
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,129
So there's going to be an effort

252
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,899
to make sure pro-Beijing forces win?

253
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:05,569
There will be such a thrust to ensure that
candidates who are,

254
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:10,529
you know, relatively pro-Beijing who support
the basic law

255
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:13,189
and also the SAR government

256
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:15,589
will be allowed to run in the election.

257
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,639
However, the localists who are now anti government,

258
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,060
anti China,

259
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,119
they may face the possibility of being

260
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,709
disallowed to run in the election.

261
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:31,490
So this will possibly be a bone of contention.

262
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,360
So with United Front active around the world,

263
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,670
why should other countries like the United
States

264
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,350
care about what's happening in Hong Kong?

265
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,670
Countries like United States can care about
Hong Kong

266
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,100
because Hong Kong can be regarded as a semi-democracy.

267
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,309
Hong Kong doesn't really look like a democracy
as with the West,

268
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,670
but Hong Kong has a pluralistic society.

269
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,040
We also have civil liberties combined with
the rule of law.

270
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,379
Hong Kong is a good indicator of how China

271
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,879
may democratize in the long run.

272
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,480
So in that sense Hong Kong is extremely important
to the West

273
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,389
because Hong Kong's existing civil liberties

274
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,040
and also pluralistic system

275
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,239
belong to the universal values shared

276
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,829
by many western democratic countries.

277
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,829
In that sense,

278
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,189
Hong Kong situation deserves to be observed.

279
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:29,619
So Hong Kong can show an example of how China

280
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,190
could become more democratic,

281
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,029
but could it also show the world

282
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:35,100
the ways in which the Chinese Communist Party

283
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,490
undermines democratic institutions?

284
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,639
In a sense, yes, because the extent to which
China

285
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,170
penetrates and infiltrates into the semi-democracy
of Hong Kong

286
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,853
can illustrate that kind of erosion of autonomy.

287
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:52,790
Do you think the US should be concerned about

288
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,290
the United Front work in general?

289
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,209
Well, many foreign countries are actually
concerned about

290
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,319
United Front work conducted by China in general

291
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:08,499
because of the perception of the China threat,

292
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:11,480
many countries like a United States, Australia,
New Zealand,

293
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,559
they have been highly concerned about United
Front work

294
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,619
conducted by China in their countries.

295
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,619
To that extent,

296
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,999
I think United Front work can be regarded
as

297
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:29,589
a potential threat to the national security
of these countries.

298
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:33,079
In particular, if United Front work involves

299
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,269
say provision of a donation to, you know,

300
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,219
politicians in America, Australia or New Zealand

301
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:47,049
and that donation may be orchestrated

302
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,040
by pro-Beijing groups and individuals.

303
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,730
And in this scenario there may be a possibility

304
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,790
of violating the domestic law of foreign countries,

305
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,759
just like the case of Australia.

306
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,319
So United Front work sometimes can trespass

307
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:07,439
or step into the boundaries

308
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:08,439
or direct bottom line of the foreign countries.

309
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:09,439
So you United Front work can be potentially
problematic

310
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,439
and controversial because of the campaigning

311
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:11,439
and the electioneering activities

312
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,439
conducted by the pro-Beijing groups

313
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,439
and individuals in foreign countries.

314
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,439
So what is the future of United Front work

315
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,589
after these extradition protests?

316
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:18,139
I think after the extradition protest,

317
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:24,089
United Front work has to be resuscitated,

318
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:28,689
reorganize, rearrange in such a way as to
win

319
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,560
the hearts and minds of the people of Hong
Kong.

320
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,899
In the short run,

321
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,619
China's United Front work in Hong Kong,

322
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,989
will encounter tremendous obstacles.

323
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:42,529
I don't think that United Front work conducted
by China

324
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:46,149
will really be easy in Hong Kong

325
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:48,769
mainly because many Hong Kong people,

326
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,629
they tend to treasure their civil liberties.

327
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,489
They tend to have their post materialist values

328
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:00,129
and they tend to be less materialistic.

329
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,410
In mainland China, many citizens are encouraged

330
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,990
to adopt a materialistic attitude towards
society and economy

331
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,549
and exactly because of this focus and emphasis
on materialism,

332
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,730
mainland China doesn't have significant inroads

333
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,819
towards political liberalization and political
democratization.

334
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,819
Hong Kong is very different.

335
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:29,190
Hong Kong traditionally has a very strong
liberal minded society.

336
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,420
In that sense,

337
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,529
I anticipate that United Front work

338
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,519
conducted by China in Hong Kong

339
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,720
will still encounter tremendous obstacles

340
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,450
from now to the year 2047.

341
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,120
When the One Country Two System policy ends.

342
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Yeah.

343
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,460
And we can expect that

344
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,179
with such strong opposition to China's United
Front work,

345
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,679
one country, two system, will likely continue.

346
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,419
And mainly because a one country two system

347
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,630
was originally designed by Deng Xiaoping

348
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,820
to appeal to Taiwan for reunification.

349
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,600
Given the fact that one country two system

350
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,750
has become so turbulent and problematic

351
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,149
and given the fact that Taiwan

352
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:16,230
is unwilling to accept the one country two
system easily,

353
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,980
we can boldly anticipate that Beijing

354
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,580
may prolong the idea of one country,

355
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:28,110
two system so as to appeal to Taiwan for reunification

356
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,490
so as to buy time for Taiwan to consider

357
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,789
or reconsider this one country, two systems.

358
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:35,789
And I imagine the United Front

359
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,580
is very active in Taiwan as well?

360
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Yeah.

361
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
United Front work

362
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,600
is also trying to penetrate into Taiwan,

363
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,220
but Taiwan has very strong local Taiwan identity

364
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,730
and that kind of resistance to United Front
work

365
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,990
is even stronger than the case of Hong Kong.

366
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,019
So we can see this interesting tug of war

367
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:59,350
between Taipei and Beijing in the coming years.

368
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,520
So somebody wanting to learn more about you
or the United Front,

369
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
where should they go?

370
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
What should they do?

371
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,740
I think to learn more from a United Front
work,

372
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,029
they can assess China's policy not only towards
Hong Kong

373
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,570
but also towards Taiwan.

374
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,510
And secondly, outside observers have to understand

375
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,929
and assess whether China's policy in Hong
Kong and Taiwan

376
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:28,580
are opposed by the local people.

377
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,710
And that kind of opposition and resistance

378
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,210
can be regarded as good indicators of the
extent

379
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,900
to which United Front work can work or cannot
work.

380
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,980
And you have an upcoming book, is that right?

381
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,480
Yes.

382
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,940
My book on China's new United Front work in
Hong Kong

383
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,260
will be published soon.

384
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,640
That's the name of the book?

385
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,140
Yes.

386
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,960
All right.

387
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,540
We'll keep an eye out for that.

388
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,700
Thank you so much for joining me today,

389
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,040
it was a pleasure to hear about the United
Front.

390
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,600
Thank you.

391
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
Thank you.
