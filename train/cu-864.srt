1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,470
Chinese spies are trying to infiltrate the
US.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,650
From universities to the FBI

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,039
A former FBI undercover agent

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,660
Reveals their operations.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,100
This is China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,120
Ever hear of a honey trap?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,710
A honey trap is when a hostile foreign government
uses,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,330
say, a beautiful woman,

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,220
to seduce someone—a politician, a businessman,
a scientist.

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,200
They might give information to her

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,460
that could pose a national security risk.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,570
Or she could just use the salacious encounter
to blackmail him.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,829
And let’s just say,

14
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,160
Chinese leaders know a thing or two about
honey.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,820
I sat down with former FBI operative Marc
Ruskin,

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,610
author of “The Pretender: My Life Undercover
for the FBI”...

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,930
to find out how Chinese agents are using honey
traps—

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,420
and many other techniques—

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,920
to infiltrate the United States.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,400
Thanks for joining me today, Marc.

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,250
Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,309
Thank you for inviting me.

23
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:05,840
Sure.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,680
Well, so as a former FBI agent,

25
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,120
what have you seen are some of the ways the
Chinese Communist Party

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,479
is trying to gain influence in the United
States?

27
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,840
Well, the Chinese intelligent services along

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,049
with other hostile intelligence services exploit

29
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:25,479
a number of vulnerabilities that exist in
the United States.

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,909
And to a large extent, and this may be surprising

31
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,469
to some of your viewers,

32
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:34,469
but the majority of the data that they seek

33
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,670
is actually available through open sources.

34
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,130
Much of it is available legally to anyone

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,159
who takes the trouble to look for it.

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,850
Is this what you mean by vulnerabilities?

37
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,850
Yeah.

38
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,990
By vulnerabilities, I'm talking about open
...

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,079
manners in which data which can be of use
to a hostile power,

40
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,700
such as China, can be accessed without necessarily

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,489
violating any federal or American laws.

42
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,789
A lot of the data that is significant

43
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:10,890
and can be used for a hostile adversary purposes

44
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,770
is actually available through open sources.

45
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,390
Much of it is information, for example,

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,070
such as a technical report, research, engineering,

47
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,970
which has been conducted on a very sophisticated
level

48
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,280
and has not yet been classified.

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,160
So there's often a lag time, for example,

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,950
with advanced research,

51
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,090
the publication of the research not being
reviewed

52
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,470
and being ultimately classified as secret
or top secret.

53
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,630
But since the Chinese intelligence services

54
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,070
are very active and on the ball and alert,

55
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,620
often they've already accessed the information

56
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,400
and it's out the door prior to it being classified.

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,490
So what does China do with this information?

58
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,040
Well, we're talking,

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,700
I'm thinking basically information of a technical
level,

60
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,400
which can then be used by own engineers and
their own researchers

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,860
to advance their own level of sophistication,

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,070
bypassing the research that they would've
had to do themselves

63
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,700
in order to reach the same point.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,010
In other words, they're taking advantage,

65
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,819
and this is a problem with academia in the
United States

66
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,290
and that we have a very open society.

67
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,850
And by having this kind of openness,

68
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,040
it gives more access to hostile services to
obtain information

69
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,290
either through a variety of methods,

70
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,880
but often not necessarily to espionage,

71
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,170
but often it's simply by being alert

72
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,470
and being quick and accessing the,

73
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,120
and knowing where the look and when to look.

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,900
So that's kind of similar to how recently
it came out

75
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,130
that the Chair of Harvard's Chemistry Department

76
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,060
was getting funding from China.

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,660
Right.

78
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Just last month,

79
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,660
just at the end of January,

80
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:21,019
there was an arrest of Professor Lieberand
announcements by the special agent in charge

81
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,860
of the FBI in Boston,

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,960
Bonaventura,

83
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,800
who he explained in his statements that right
now China is,

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
in his view,

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,449
and presumably reflects the view of the FBI
today,

86
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,699
China's the largest intelligence threat to
the US.

87
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,629
Whether it's larger than Russia or not,

88
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,909
it's kind of like how many angels

89
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,030
can dance on the head of a pin type of question.

90
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,060
In either case,

91
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,990
they're all hostile intelligence services
and need to be,

92
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,199
we need to take a preventative,

93
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,999
counter-intelligence type measures

94
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:03,699
in order to protect ourselves from a hostile
act.

95
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,650
So, you've talked about how China

96
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,159
takes advantage of open source information.

97
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:12,569
How in the case of the Harvard Professor Lieber,

98
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:15,409
how money can buy off people.

99
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:19,490
How does China use foreign agents in the United
States?

100
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,300
Well, historically there've been a number
of ways

101
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,789
that the Chinese have used traditional espionage
techniques.

102
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:32,979
One in particular that's been very successful
is,

103
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:39,080
and it may seem reminiscent of John Le Carre
novels,

104
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,069
but it's the reality is what's referred to
in trade craft

105
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,969
as a honey trap,

106
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:51,909
which is using an attractive female case officer,

107
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,180
intelligence officer,

108
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,379
to develop a relationship with someone

109
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,089
who has access to classified information.

110
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:05,349
And it's a longterm proposition to develop
an intimate,

111
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,009
ultimately physical relationship or maybe
even the relationship

112
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,300
that the target believes is a legitimate emotional
relationship.

113
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,469
There was an FBI agent, a Supervisor, James,

114
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,719
and his last name escapes me right now,

115
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,029
but who with Katrina Leung,

116
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,909
was the name of the intelligence officer.

117
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,559
Not her real Mandarin name,

118
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,589
but she developed a relationship with him

119
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,339
and for 20 years that relationship continued.

120
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,710
It's hard to imagine for nearly two decades,

121
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,169
and he was the supervisor of a China Counter
Intelligence squad

122
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,699
in the FBI's Los Angeles office,

123
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,909
and he was taking, apparently, from what I
understand,

124
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:04,569
confidential classified documents to his rendezvouses
with her.

125
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,619
So until ultimately he was arrested

126
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:12,190
after he retired and entered into a plea agreement

127
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,710
with the US Attorney's office.

128
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,350
How common are these honey traps?

129
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,319
Unfortunately, it's a question that has no
real answer

130
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,779
because all we know about is the ones that
were caught.

131
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,779
Right?

132
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,529
So from time to time,

133
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,789
in the FBI it's not very common that we know
about.

134
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,639
The first one in the history of the FBI

135
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,499
involved an agent called Richard Miller,who
was seduced by a Soviet at that time,

136
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:46,900
Soviet Union agent,

137
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,960
whose name was Svetlana Ogorodnikova.

138
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,499
And so, how often does it happen in other
agencies?

139
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,660
I would suspect it happens more often in other
agencies.

140
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,409
The FBI has a pretty serious vetting process
for recruiting agents.

141
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,910
And as the CIA does as well.

142
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,029
But there are other areas where these honey
traps could be used

143
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:18,199
and which are not to infiltrate America's
Counter Intelligence services,

144
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,899
but simply to infiltrate, say academia.

145
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,399
You could have this kind of technique being
utilized

146
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,460
with the college professors or engineers

147
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,050
working at nuclear research laboratories,

148
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,180
which we wouldn't know about

149
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,670
because they haven't come to surface yet.

150
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,770
So besides these methods, what other tactics

151
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,020
is the Chinese Communist Party using in the
United States?

152
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,200
I guess the one answer would be

153
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,650
whatever they can imagine and come up with.

154
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,340
As we all know, the Russians, the Soviets
were,

155
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,450
since the creation of the Soviet Union

156
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,320
has been attempting to influence the American
elections.

157
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,930
With regard to the Russians, we can read about
it

158
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,450
because since the fall of the Soviet Union,

159
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,700
many ex-KGB officers who worked in the US

160
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,690
have been able to publish their memoirs.

161
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,960
So you can go to the bookstore and buy Kalugin's
book

162
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,960
and see how they were in New York and in Washington

163
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,410
doing their best through all types of clandestine
activity

164
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,370
to influence the elections.

165
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,880
Now, presumably if the Russians were doing
it,

166
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,150
the Chinese were doing it also.

167
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,220
However, we don't have a bunch of ex-Chinese

168
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,590
intelligence officers publishing their memoirs

169
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:43,280
because I would imagine that their longevity
would be very dim indeed

170
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,640
were they to attempt to do so

171
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,340
as would the health of their family members,
right?

172
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
Probably.

173
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,410
So we don't know firsthand, but what we do
know

174
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,330
is what has been uncovered just through ordinary
criminal investigations.

175
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,720
And for that we can just look back to the
Clinton re-election campaign.

176
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,510
In the Clinton re-election campaign,

177
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:10,940
there was Johnny Young, and the thousands
and thousands of dollars

178
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,090
that were being apparently allegedly contributed

179
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,090
both directly to the Clinton re-election campaign

180
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,580
and to the Democratic National Committee.

181
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,510
This is Bill Clinton and the China Gate scandal
in the 90s?

182
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,510
Right.

183
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,590
Of course, it didn't become as much of a scandal,

184
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,970
I would suggest as it should have been,

185
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,560
because according to reporting in the media,

186
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:40,320
there was direct links between the People's
Republic of China

187
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,370
Military Intelligence Services

188
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,970
and the recipients or the middlemen for that
money going to the campaign.

189
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,300
So you asked how, in other words, other techniques,

190
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,280
I would suggest that contributing to a political
party

191
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,620
and contributing to a president's re-election
campaign.

192
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,410
And it's more than just mere suspicion.

193
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,870
There was 22 convictions as a result of this.

194
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,820
So, this is another tactic.

195
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,820
It's a tactic.

196
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,040
It's a tactic.

197
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,050
How successful is it?

198
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,160
I can't evaluate it,

199
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,190
but it's certainly a tactic that arguably
was used

200
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,860
in order to influence the outcome

201
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,110
for an American political presidential election.

202
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,000
And also arguably inference can be made

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,970
that there's a certain amount of influence

204
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,810
that's being purchased through that kind of
a donation.

205
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,851
So it seems like the Chinese Communist Party

206
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:40,180
is taking advantage of the free and open society

207
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,930
we have in the United States.

208
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,500
How can the US counter this without giving
up these freedoms?

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,050
Well, there had been an attempts for the FBI,
for example,

210
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,820
many years ago, had an initiative.

211
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,440
It was librarians were recruited,

212
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,270
since there's so much access to open source
information,

213
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,030
the thought was that by bringing in librarians

214
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,550
to identify suspect individual patrons,

215
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,170
it may sound a little simple,

216
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,620
but it could've been very effective,

217
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,510
individuals with accents from countries

218
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,390
which are known to be hostile to the US,

219
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:32,310
accessing highly technical reports on a continuing
basis.

220
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,840
It was thought, the idea was,

221
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,550
and I think it was a good idea that it could,

222
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,690
these could have provided leads in order

223
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,690
to identify whether they be Chinese or Russian,

224
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,970
or from other hostile powers,

225
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,360
individuals seeking to exploit open source
information.

226
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,170
The reaction from the librarians and from
the civil liberties groups

227
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,000
was hardly very cooperative.

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,450
It was just the opposite.

229
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:06,870
There was a big negative reaction that caused
the initiatives

230
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,990
to essentially have to be shut down.

231
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,880
And there was a lot of publicity about it
at the time.

232
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,220
And at the time in the New York Times,

233
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,560
but ultimately it didn't work.

234
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,110
A similar attempt occurred after 9/11,

235
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,180
when the Patriot Act was passed,

236
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,180
there was a clause that was referred to as
the library clause.

237
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,460
In which again,

238
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,750
the FBI and other government agencies were
seeking

239
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,870
to obtain information regarding access

240
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,220
by the Chinese and other hostile powers

241
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,120
to open source significant technological information.

242
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,260
Again, the reaction was hardly cooperative.

243
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,980
It seems almost absurd,

244
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,830
but there were signs being put in the library

245
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,290
to warn patrons that their access

246
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,000
may be subject to government review.

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,690
So rather than cooperate, it was just the
opposite.

248
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,790
The librarians were essentially warning off
potential patrons

249
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,320
who could be identified.

250
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,290
So it's a tricky ... it's a balancing act,

251
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,290
we want to be-

252
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,290
Well, I was going to say,

253
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,120
because I can kind of understand that fear,

254
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,050
because in going after,

255
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,370
China takes advantage of the open source information,

256
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,740
but essentially the free and open access information
in the United States.

257
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,570
So if the government tries to stop that,

258
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,650
it's almost like they're trying to stop

259
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,490
free and open access to information,

260
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,840
which is at the core ...

261
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,550
is one of the cores of our society.

262
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,550
Right.

263
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,920
It's a core value.

264
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,650
And I would argue that we want to maintain
openness.

265
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,519
We want to maintain our liberties.

266
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,700
That's what makes this country almost unique

267
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,920
among other countries is our Constitution,

268
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,220
the Bill of Rights and the privacy rights,

269
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,560
which we enjoy.

270
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,050
Albeit, some would argue,

271
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,590
I would argue that many of the Bill of Rights
provisions

272
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,620
of being chipped away now, unfortunately.

273
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,330
But we do want to continue to enjoy them best
we can.

274
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,200
And so it's a balancing act.

275
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,420
To what extent do we maintain openness

276
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,530
and at the same time protect national security.

277
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:29,910
And I think a lot has to involve ethical behavior

278
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,040
by our counter intelligence services

279
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,860
and our intelligence gathering services

280
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,870
and regulations legislation,

281
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,050
which is designed or tailored to safeguard
our country.

282
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,610
And at the same time, safeguard our liberties.

283
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,810
So what are some of the ways the FBI

284
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,360
is trying to counter Chinese espionage operations?

285
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,410
Or is that too classified?

286
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,860
I mean, I think the best way to address

287
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,460
that is to just refer to the FBI's techniques
in general

288
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,110
to counter the intelligence activities of
hostile countries.

289
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,560
And I would suggest that they're not country-specific
necessarily.

290
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,610
So the techniques that the Bureau uses are
...

291
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,980
to fight Soviet, or not Soviet,

292
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,120
to fight Russian intelligence activities

293
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,760
or Cuban intelligence activities or Chinese
intelligence activities,

294
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,040
are essentially ... in the unclassified sense,

295
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,040
are pretty much the same techniques.

296
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,420
There may be, depending on the techniques

297
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,480
being used by the hostile power,

298
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,770
they may be fine tuning so that

299
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,660
they are adapted to that particular country.

300
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,760
But overall it's not like it's a whole different
bag of tricks

301
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,670
for each different country.

302
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,470
For example, I worked a number of cases

303
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,640
and they're discussed in some of the chapters
in my book

304
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,870
as an undercover agent, I worked false flag
operations.

305
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,780
Now, false flag operations are directed against

306
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:30,550
any number of hostile type of intelligence
activities.

307
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,480
And they're not country-specific.

308
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,300
And the way a false flag operation works essentially

309
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,970
is just to briefly summarize,

310
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,670
because I don't think that this is popular,

311
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,940
known to a large extent,

312
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,100
is when an individual is identified who wants
to sell

313
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,440
or transfer classified information

314
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,560
to another country's intelligence service.

315
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,670
So it could be to China,

316
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,940
to the Chinese intelligence,

317
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,760
it could be to Russian intelligence,

318
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,790
but they're trying to sell it.

319
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,460
So the individuals identified,

320
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,270
let's say he is a nuclear engineer

321
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,640
at a facility that does research,

322
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,490
that does classified research

323
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,710
or perhaps an Army Colonel

324
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,860
who has access to classified military intelligence.

325
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,350
Then he or she reaches out through some tech,

326
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,750
perhaps let's say to a friend,

327
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,250
do you know anyone in X capital of X country

328
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,960
who might be interested in buying this information?

329
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,350
And the source then instead of going to someone
in that country

330
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,190
comes to the FBI and says,

331
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,530
"Hey, do you know that professor so-and-so

332
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,970
or Colonel so-and-so, or engineer so-and-so

333
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,920
is seeking to sell secrets to whoever."

334
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,960
And then the espionage unit at FBI headquarters

335
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,900
would then reach out to me and say,

336
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,800
"Marc, we need you to reach out to this individual."

337
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,170
And we very quickly set up an operation

338
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,380
where I would pretend to be an intelligence
officer

339
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,780
working on behalf of that country.

340
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,700
Now, depending on the country,

341
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,350
I could say that I'm either from that country

342
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,400
or if it's obviously I'm not from that country-

343
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Like China.

344
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Yeah, right.

345
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
But I could be working for

346
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,510
the intelligence service of another country
on behalf as a proxy,

347
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,230
on behalf of China or wherever.

348
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,620
And then it's a hostile operating environment
here

349
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,040
so they can't send somebody out.

350
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,460
But they've asked my country to send out someone
in their stead,

351
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,700
and I'm ... you are so important and stroking
the individual,

352
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,010
you are so important that they've sent me,

353
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,300
a very high level intelligence officer in
my country,

354
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,080
to make contact with you and establish a relationship.

355
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,560
And these cases were very sensitive because,

356
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,640
and they needed someone who by this point

357
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,080
I had a lot of experience doing this kind
of work,

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,040
because the first contact was critical.

359
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,380
If the individual,

360
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,590
the future trader didn't believe that

361
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,431
I was who I was claiming to be,

362
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:27,470
that would be the end.

363
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,610
It would be shut down.

364
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,870
There'd be no second chance,

365
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,809
no second bite at the apple.

366
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:36,540
So these were, but once they bit,

367
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,679
then we would develop a whole clandestine
system

368
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,880
for them to transfer information to me.

369
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
It was something, again,

370
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,640
straight out of a John Le Carre or Tom Clancy
type thing

371
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,360
with dead drops and whatever

372
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,700
to make them feel they were really working
in clandestine activity.

373
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
And then they would transfer,

374
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,460
we would pay them, they would transfer ...

375
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,390
that's what they wanted, was money,

376
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,910
it was not ideological,

377
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,220
but often most of the time there was money
being paid.

378
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,010
And then once they were believing

379
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,560
they were transferring information to a hostile
power.

380
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,640
It's actually us who's collecting it.

381
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,600
And then at the end of the day,

382
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,080
the handcuffs come on and usually lengthy
prison terms.

383
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,770
Well, so what is the Chinese Communist Party's
ultimate goal

384
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,520
with these influence operations in the United
States?

385
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:37,260
Well, again, now you're calling for speculation
as to what, what ...

386
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,590
I think that when there's an attempt

387
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,010
to influence an outcome of an election,

388
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,900
whether through finances,

389
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,200
financial contributions or whatever.

390
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,760
Presumably, it's being done for a reason.

391
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,150
I mean, large quantities of money are not
going to be spent

392
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,680
unless there's some gain,

393
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,690
there's some advantage that is expected to
be obtained

394
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,750
as a result of that.

395
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,500
So yeah, I would suggest, I mean, again and
again

396
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,000
it's speculation and opinion,

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,410
but that they're seeking to obtain advantages
and leverage

398
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,430
in order to expand whatever goals

399
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,840
that their central committee has established,

400
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,780
be it economic or otherwise.

401
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,860
Thanks again for joining me today.

402
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,440
It's a pleasure having you on.

403
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,360
My pleasure.
