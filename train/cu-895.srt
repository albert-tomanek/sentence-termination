1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,440
China is damming up rivers in Tibet.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,480
They’re stealing India’s water.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
And it could lead to armed conflict.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,520
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
This episode has been sponsored by Surfshark.\h\h

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
Disputes between India and China have been getting\h\h

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,720
worse this year. Especially since\h
that deadly border clash in June.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,600
But while things seem to have calmed down for\h
now, there’s a lot at stake here. But here’s\h\h

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,800
something you maybe haven’t thought about—water.\h
This border dispute is also about protecting\h\h

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
India’s, and many other countries’, water\h
supply from Chinese Communist control.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,080
It has to do mainly with these\h
two rivers, which begin in Tibet.\h\h

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,480
One flows from Tibet through\h
northwestern India into Pakistan,\h\h

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,400
and the other flows from Tibet through\h
northeastern India into Bangladesh.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
These are major rivers. Millions\h
of people depend on them.\h

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
But the Chinese Communist Party\h
would prefer that millions of people\h\h

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,160
depend on the Communist Party. And\h
it’s becoming a big dam problem.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,360
China has plans to build and finance\h\h

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
up to five new dams along the Indus River in\h
the part of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan.\h

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
You see, Pakistan and India don’t have enough\h\h

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
conflict in Kashmir already, so\h
China is just trying to help out.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,840
The problem with adding new dams is that it could\h
mess up agriculture downstream. That includes\h\h

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,120
sending less water to farmland, and reducing\h
the amount of silt, which also supports farming.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,840
And those problems could mean that huge\h
numbers of Indian farmers have to relocate.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
The Indian government is very unhappy\h
about this new dam in Kashmir.\h\h

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,080
But surprise! Pakistan and China don’t care.

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,080
In July this year, a Chinese\h
state-owned company began construction.

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,960
It’s the first major Chinese infrastructure\h
project in Kashmir. It’s part of the\h\h

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,920
China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which China is\h
tying into its global Belt and Road Initiative. So\h\h

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,720
there’s a lot of money and political power behind\h
it—way more money and political power than the\h\h

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,360
Indian farmers downstream have. So, the project\h
moves forward, environmental concerns be dammed!\h

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
And that’s just the Indus River.\h
There’s also the Brahmaputra River.\h\h

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,080
It flows from Tibet through\h
India and down to Bangladesh.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,640
“Over a period of 10 years,\h
China has managed to construct\h\h

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,440
three dams on the Brahmaputra river in\h
parts of Tibet close to the Indian border.”

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,240
The largest one became fully operational in 2015.

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,160
Initially, the Chinese government denied its\h
existence. But when satellite photos came out, and\h\h

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,920
they were caught in a lie, they were like, don’t\h
worry, it won’t affect the water flow downstream.

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
Yes, dams never affect water flow.

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,360
China now plans to build eight\h
more of these kinds of dams.

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,560
There’s another motivation for building\h
them, though, besides generating power.

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,400
In the kind of mega project fit only for the most\h
self-aggrandizing dictatorships, the Communist\h\h

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,440
Party wants to divert water from these rivers to\h
Xinjiang, home to all the happy ethnic Ughyurs.

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
They plan to do that with a 600 mile long\h\h

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,720
tunnel. Chinese authorities hope it\h
will “turn Xinjiang into California.”

46
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
California? Maybe they need a better analogy.

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,320
One expert from China’s Dalian\h
University of Technology said “The\h\h

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,520
project is ‘anticipated to solve the problem\h
of water, food, and drought in the country.’”

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,640
Yes. Massive projects that\h
radically alter the environment\h\h

50
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
will definitely solve the problem\h
of water, food, and drought.

51
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,720
But Northwestern China is\h
facing a water shortage crisis.\h\h

52
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,280
It’s a manmade crisis of course. It stems\h
mainly from cramming too many people and\h\h

53
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,840
too much farmland in a region that’s\h
not naturally able to support it all.

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,720
But I don’t think the Chinese Communist\h
Party would mind if they solve that crisis\h\h

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,080
inside China, by causing an environmental\h
catastrophe for people in other countries.\h

56
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
And according to an India\h
analyst at the Hudson Institute,\h\h

57
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,480
this will ultimately mean more Chinese\h
troops on the border with India.

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,280
“This nightmare scenario has already started.\h
Because China needs more water to develop,\h\h

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,560
China has started plans to divert the flow\h
of the river. The more China develops Tibet,\h\h

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,960
the more Chinese troops will get\h
deployed to secure these water resources.\h\h

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,840
As a result, China’s military activities in the\h
India-China border (around Tibet) will increase.”

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Because in the end, it always seems\h
to come down to territorial conflicts.

63
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
And this episode has been sponsored by surfshark.\h\h

64
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,480
Whenever you go online, you should be using a\h
VPN like Surfshark to protect your identity.

65
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,880
Because governments and your internet\h
service provider may be watching you.

66
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
And besides protecting your identity,\h
there’s another advantage to using a VPN:\h\h

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,840
You can access websites that are\h
only available in other countries.

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,560
For example, let’s say you want to watch a movie\h
where there’s plenty of water, like Waterworld.

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
But you can’t access Waterworld\h
on Netflix in the US. So,\h\h

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,720
use Surfshark to switch your location to\h
Australia...log in again...and there it is.\h

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,760
Wait, if Kevin Cosner’s water filter\h
can create drinkable water from his pee,\h\h

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,200
why can’t he also use it for seawater?

73
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,320
Anyway, if you don’t want to watch Waterworld,\h
there’s tons of other movies and TV shows that you\h\h

74
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,560
can only watch if you’re logged into Netflix in\h
another country...by using a VPN like Surfshark.

75
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
And with one account,\h\h

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,920
you can connect as many devices as you want.\h
