1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,250
China’s Belt and Road is going after the
West

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,860
And New Zealand is the first stop

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,400
Will this be One Belt, One Ring to Rule them
All?

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,080
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
China’s One Belt, One Road Initiative.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,850
It’s Beijing’s trillion dollar

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,140
infrastructure investment scheme.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,320
And it’s kind of like the One Ring.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,960
Sure, it looks shiny and nice.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,480
But if you put it on,

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,890
you might find yourself enslaved to Sauron.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,890
Or in this case,

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,350
the Chinese Communist Party.

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,719
Which I’m pretty sure is worse,

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,940
since it’s actually real.

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,190
A lot of developing countries

18
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,280
that have joined the Belt and Road,

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,210
end up unable to pay back Chinese loans.

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,629
They get trapped in debt,

21
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,559
and are forced to give the Chinese Communist
Party their souls.

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,649
As well as strategic assets

23
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,519
like natural resources and shipping ports.

24
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,569
Most countries that have joined the Belt and
Road

25
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:58,949
are poor developing countries.

26
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,839
But the Chinese Communist Party is now making
a push

27
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:06,030
to get Western developed countries to join
in as well.

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,770
This year, Beijing nabbed its first G7 country—Italy.

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,760
And it’s doing some major PR by saying the
Belt and Road

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,760
will from now on be green and sustainable.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,630
Somehow using these buzzwords

32
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,530
must be really convincing,

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,289
because now New Zealand

34
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,109
has just joined the Belt and Road.

35
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,460
I get it.

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,159
New Zealand *is* green.

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,679
And it *is* sustainable—

38
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,509
like its amazing grass-fed dairy farms.

39
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,700
And of course New Zealand *is* the place

40
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,750
where Lord of the Rings was filmed,

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,659
so it seems so natural!

42
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,189
You know, I once visited the set of Hobbiton

43
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,960
dressed as Hugo Weaving dressed as Elrond.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,909
You’ve probably never seen that episode.

45
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,310
But you will now?

46
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,619
Anyway, New Zealand is a beautiful country—

47
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,820
which is why they filmed Lord of the Rings
there.

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,400
But now, like Middle Earth,

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,609
New Zealand is also under the watchful eye

50
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:00,249
of a shadowy, sinister force:

51
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:01,729
The Chinese Communist Party.

52
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:06,219
In 2008, New Zealand signed a free trade agreement
with China.

53
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,869
And in the years that followed,

54
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,420
their trade with China tripled.

55
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,840
So has the Communist Party’s influence.

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,200
Chinese dissidents in New Zealand have been
harassed.

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,890
People with questionable ties to the Communist
Party

58
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,890
have been elected to powerful positions

59
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,849
in the New Zealand government.

60
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,970
And people who have criticized this,

61
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,370
have been threatened.

62
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,209
Like professor Anne-Marie Brady,

63
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,750
who “reported that her home was broken into,

64
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,819
her car was being tampered with,

65
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,590
and she was the recipient of threats

66
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,849
through the post and via phone.”

67
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,010
So it’s kind of shocking

68
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,280
that New Zealand’s trade minister

69
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
recently went to Beijing

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,250
for a Belt and Road Forum.

71
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,880
And came back saying New Zealand

72
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,700
wants to join the Belt and Road.

73
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,900
I believe we have a clip of that.

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
Against the power of Mordor,

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,960
there can be no victory,

76
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,220
Oops, wrong clip.

77
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,940
What the New Zealand trade minister actually
said was,

78
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,940
“It seems more likely that we can find

79
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,180
a win-win situation with China.”

80
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,500
And if you believe that,

81
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,800
I’ve got a shiny new ring of power to give
you.

82
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,189
What the trade minister said is,

83
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:12,189
in a way,

84
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,360
even more disturbing.

85
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,299
Because “win-win” is exactly the phrase

86
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,850
Chinese leader Xi Jinping uses to describe
the Belt and Road.

87
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,360
And anyone who’s been paying attention to

88
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,150
should know that “win-win” just means

89
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,170
the Chinese regime wins either way.

90
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,200
It means the country either

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,909
pays back their loans with interest,

92
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,750
or China takes their strategic assets instead.

93
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,579
Of course a lot of developing countries

94
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,310
feel like they have no real choice.

95
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,680
That it’s either Chinese investment

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,890
or no investment at all.

97
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,209
But is New Zealand really in that same position?

98
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,709
Actually, the previous New Zealand government

99
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,840
had originally signed a Belt and Road agreement
in 2017.

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,469
But it never really went anywhere

101
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,709
because there were concerns over having too
much

102
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,079
Chinese influence in the country.

103
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,920
So how does the current New Zealand Prime
Minister

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
Jacinda Ardern feel about it?

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,880
I mean, I know I’d be a little concerned

106
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,090
if my trade minister went to a country

107
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,120
that was actively trying to undermine mine,

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,720
and came back spouting propaganda slogans.

109
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,230
Well, after the trade minister’s return,
Arden said,

110
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,850
“The fact that we’ve taken a little bit
of pause

111
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,010
as we’ve worked to really flesh out that
arrangement

112
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,780
has been no bad thing,

113
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,940
because Belt and Road has really evolved.”

114
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,500
Oh yes, it’s evolved so much!

115
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,120
I mean, it’s now green and sustainable.

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,830
And when has the Chinese Communist Party ever
lied.

117
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,570
Actually, never mind,

118
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,870
we don’t have time to go through that list.

119
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,780
Incidentally, Prime Minister Ardern’s Labour
party

120
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,010
has accepted donations that may be linked

121
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,580
to the Communist Party.

122
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,710
But don’t worry!

123
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,620
Because the opposition National Party

124
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,210
has also been accused of hiding political
donations

125
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,120
that are possibly linked to the Chinese Communist
Party.

126
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,230
The Communist Party knows how to cover all
of its bases.

127
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,610
So far there have not been any

128
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,240
concrete investment plans for New Zealand.

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,370
That’s because New Zealand is not like

130
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,010
most of the developing countries

131
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,010
that have joined the Belt and Road.

132
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,460
New Zealand doesn’t need massive infrastructure
investment.

133
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,320
But New Zealand’s Finance Minister

134
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,030
feels New Zealand has a lot to offer to China,

135
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,670
specifically “greening the Belt and Road,

136
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,400
or helping address some of the issues…

137
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,140
around transparency,

138
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,620
or whether it’s using our regulatory systems,

139
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,830
which are amongst the best in the world.”

140
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,051
Yes, China is the perpetual bad boy.

141
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:33,160
The United States, Canada, Australia,

142
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,820
they never really understood China.

143
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,140
But New Zealand does.

144
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,870
New Zealand will be the one to make China
change.

145
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,910
But there’s also the pressure of missing
the boat—

146
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,160
the idea that if New Zealand doesn’t join
up now,

147
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,330
China will take its big economy to another
country.

148
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,300
One more willing to deal.

149
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,340
Now New Zealand’s security agencies

150
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,040
have been saying they’re concerned

151
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,320
about foreign interference from China.

152
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,730
Particularly in the case of Huawei,

153
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,390
a Chinese company that the US has said

154
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,060
poses a national security threat.

155
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,750
And New Zealand’s security agencies

156
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,870
were able to block a New Zealand telecom company

157
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,050
from using Huawei equipment.

158
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,311
But Prime Minister Ardern was quick to say
that

159
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:17,210
there was no final ban on Huawei.

160
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,850
All this has led security experts to question

161
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,700
if maybe New Zealand is at risk of turning
into a Nazgul.

162
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,670
New Zealand is part of the Five Eyes,

163
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,530
an intelligence network set up in 1955

164
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,660
between the United States, Canada,

165
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,800
the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,900
But former CIA China expert Peter Mattis

167
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,000
has suggested maybe New Zealand

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,410
shouldn’t be in it anymore,

169
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,410
because of the level of Chinese Communist
Party influence.

170
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,680
Australia faces the same issues.

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,830
The difference is,

172
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,920
in New Zealand,

173
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,740
the former and current prime ministers

174
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,020
don’t seem to realize there’s a problem.

175
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,610
And there are a number of well-connected

176
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,240
voices of support inside New Zealand

177
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,650
that want to join the Belt and Road.

178
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,890
Air New Zealand for instance.

179
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,890
More than half the company

180
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,640
is owned by the new Zealand Government.

181
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,050
Its chief executive said,

182
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,910
“We're a little country...

183
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,570
we've got to step into this space.”

184
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,640
Aww, like a Hobbit.

185
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,660
The problem is,

186
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,970
if you actually put a Hobbit in front of a
Dragon,

187
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,010
the dragon will bite his head off.

188
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,120
Sorry Bilbo.

189
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,870
Countries and business around the world

190
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,760
have been making this mistake for years.

191
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,040
People see the gold,

192
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,530
and forget there’s a giant dragon.

193
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,280
So how has China trade worked out

194
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,920
so far for Air New Zealand?

195
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,160
Over the 13 years its been in China,

196
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,330
Air New Zealand has lost 100 million dollars.

197
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,020
That’s because the Chinese government

198
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,640
gives preference to Chinese airlines.

199
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,060
But surely just because this is the same story

200
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,150
that happens again and again,

201
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,450
doesn’t mean tomorrow won’t be different.

202
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,460
So hand over the ring.

203
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,610
What do you think of New Zealand

204
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,610
and the Belt and Road?

205
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,430
Leave your comments below.

206
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,780
And before you go, may I remind you,

207
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,550
China Uncensored is not part of the Belt and
Road.

208
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,530
So instead of getting billions of dollars

209
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,060
from the Communist Party,

210
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,820
we rely on several thousand small contributions

211
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,390
from viewers like you—

212
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,390
fans who support us

213
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,590
through the crowd-funding website Patreon.

214
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,850
And as a way of saying thanks for your support,

215
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,380
I answer your questions on the show.

216
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,190
Today’s question comes from...

217
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,190
Charlie Matsubara

218
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,560
When a CCP panda takes off its cuddly dimwitted
mask

219
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,530
to reveal its real face,

220
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,490
what animal is behind it?

221
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,180
You mean there’s something more terrifying
that a panda?!

222
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,039
I shudder even to imagine such a thing.

223
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,039
Brrr.

224
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,550
But I get what you’re saying,

225
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,360
what will happen the world finally realizes

226
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,990
that win-win cooperation is a lie?

227
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,139
Well, I imagine a lot of people in the West

228
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:50,529
might have to answer some

229
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,460
pretty uncomfortable questions about,

230
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,980
I don’t know,

231
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
how they helped build

232
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,990
those systems of mass surveillance in China,

233
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,829
or why they helped censor the Chinese internet

234
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,959
or handed over data to the Chinese authorities,

235
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,759
or the World Health Organization

236
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,600
has been trying so hard to promote

237
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,550
China’s organ transplant system,

238
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,829
when Chinese state-run hospitals

239
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:14,520
are killing innocent people for those same
organs.

240
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,960
And then everyone will realize...

241
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,820
pandas aren't cuddly.

242
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,860
Nope, not cuddly at all.

243
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,699
Thanks for your question.

244
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,860
And thank you to everyone watching.
