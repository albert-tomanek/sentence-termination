On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,940
The true meaning of democracy with Chinese
characteristics

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,910
I'm your host Chris Chappell

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,880
If you were watching the lamestream media last year

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,480
you probably heard a lot of nonsense like this:

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,599
India is surely the biggest democracy on this planet

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,619
The world's most populous democracy

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,079
India - they are the world's largest democracy by a mile

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,730
The only country larger than them at all is
not a democracy

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,890
Or is it?

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,140
Fortunately, my favorite Chinese state-run
newspaper Global Times

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,190
is here to set the record straight

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,620
In this recent article entitled:

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,060
which country is really the world's largest
democracy?

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,990
The answer to that obviously is China

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,870
The author Han Zhen explains that China's
National People's Congress system

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,579
is in fact a democracy

19
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,790
not only should we criticize the false nature
of western democracy

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,790
he writes

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,040
but we must clarify the democratic nature
of our country China

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,560
as Han Zhen describes it

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,700
China is a democracy because the government
gives every ethnic group and social class

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,120
an opportunity to take part in policymaking
and the selection of leadership

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,300
It's true

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,240
You may have heard that China is a one-party
dictatorship

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,310
but there are in fact eight other political
parties

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,860
under the Communist Party's United Front department

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,049
five of them even have the word democracy
right there in their names

30
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,500
representatives from these parties occupy
about twenty-five percent

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,850
of the seats in the National People's Congress

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,210
See?

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:57,250
Multiparty Democracy and unlike any ineffective
so-called democracies in the West

34
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,130
China's congressional representatives are
loyal

35
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,689
They've passed every single bill put before
them in the last 60 years

36
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:05,880
most of them unanimously

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
See?

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,509
China knows how to get things done

39
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,180
Simply change the definition of what it means
to be a democracy

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,540
and voila

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,230
you have the world's largest democracy

42
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,090
And if that's not Democratic enough for you

43
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,660
China's nearly 1 million villages hold direct
elections for village chief

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,700
and to ensure that the village chief represents
the true interest of the people

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,470
the Communist Party appoints its local party
secretary to oversee him

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,970
or in most cases the party secretary IS the
one who gets elected

47
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,319
which is just more efficient

48
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,250
so as you can see this all follows China's
Constitution

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,950
which clearly sets forth China's democratic
system

50
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,550
under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China

51
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,840
and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,560
the Chinese people of all nationalities will
continue to adhere

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,450
to the People's Democratic Dictatorship

54
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,060
Speaking of Mao Zedong Thought who better
to explain China's democracy

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,650
then chairman Mao himself?

56
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,030
A man still so revered that his portrait watches
over Tiananmen Square

57
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,650
The last resting place of his own decaying
corpse

58
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,300
Anyway Mao thought that the rest of the world
was corrupt

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,810
In his selected works he wrote

60
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,700
After the outbreak of the Second Imperialist
War

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,019
i.e. the Second World War

62
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,390
there is hardly a trace of democracy in many
of the capitalist countries

63
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,500
which have come or are coming under the bloody
militarist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie

64
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,050
well obviously a democracy under capitalism is bad

65
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,160
and so are bloody military dictatorships

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,930
that much we can all agree on

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,209
so chairman Mao, tell us what kind of government
China ought to have

68
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,610
Let's see

69
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,190
democracy is shared by the common people

70
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,190
by which Mao means: the peasants and the farmers

71
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,860
Check!

72
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,050
The bourgeoisie i.e the middle class, are
not allowed to own things privately

73
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,450
Check! - obviously

74
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,100
and it's led by the working class i.e blue-collar
factory types

75
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,860
Check!

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,330
Mao was right

77
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,379
China is a democracy

78
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,379
Take that!

79
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,340
800 million voters in India

80
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,220
So what do you think about China being the
world's largest democracy
