1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,160
Now, the question I have to try and think of the
answer of is did they have too much or too little?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,600
Ah!

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,400
"Aargh! So much butter!"

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,360
-I'm going for too much butter.
-Butterlanche!

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,440
-Butterlanche.
-Butterlanche!

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,080
Right, is that an arse avalanche
or a butter avalanche?

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,040
Beneath the butter, loads of butts.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,540
Well, considering I heard 'the Norwegian
buttock crisis' the first time out...

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,400
-Oh!
-Then again, too many or too few?

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,560
-"Altogether too..."
-And do you get an extra hole

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,040
or do they bifurcate around a central orifice,
or...?

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,200
"Oh, there are too many arses."

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,080
What accent was that?

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,800
Because that wasn't Norwegian, Gary.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,520
You can't use WD40 on it.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,240
No, you can't, that's a penetrating fluid.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,720
-Oh, it is.
-Oh, Jesus.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,200
Sorry, it's a real bugbear,
WD40, not a lubricant.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,720
(Penetrating fluid...)

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,040
-It’s a water displacement.
-Yeah.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Are you okay there, Gary?

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,640
Have you just heard the words
'penetrating fluid'?

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah, okay, good.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,480
-Give him a minute.
-I can't go to Halfords again.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,920
Every cloud has a silver lining.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,040
A buttery lining.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,400
A salty, buttery middle.

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,440
Oh, imagine the rain.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,760
"It's raining ghee."

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,480
Hallelujah.
It's raining...

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,840
So is it all stuff that people either
can't be arsed to make any more,

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,400
or they've decided it's not good for you
and it's gone out of fashion kind of stuff,

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,720
and then everyone's forgotten about it?

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah, pretty much, it may not be forgotten
about but it could be.

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,640
Or rules have presented it being done like
unpasteurised milk, that kind of thing.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,440
Ooh, yes, so just in terms of categories.

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Can we just clear this one?
'I said, you want it pasteurised, she said'...?

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
'I'll be happy if it comes up to my chest.'

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
Thank you.

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,520
I thought I'd leave you with that one.

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,040
It's not funny, if you don't set up
the whole bath of milk thing beforehand.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,480
Oh, milk, oh, right.

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,440
Yeah.

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,880
You see, you've done this once before, Gary.

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,080
I know, I know.

46
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,760
If you're going tell a joke…

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,680
-You have to tell people the joke.
-Yes.

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
I'll write that down.

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
Hey!

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,440
Wait, I've got one of those.

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Oh!
