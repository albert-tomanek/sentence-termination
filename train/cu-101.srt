00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,439
On this episode of China Uncensored, eat your
heart out!

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,700
The world totally approves of China’s organ
transplant system.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,809
But actually don't do that,

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,549
your heart is worth 130,000 dollars on the
Chinese market.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,570
Okay, we know China uses executed prisoners
as a source for transplant organs.

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,570
They even admitted it

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,240
...in 2009...many years after we already knew
they were doing it.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,940
Which is like when Alex Rodriguez admitted
to using steroids.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,440
The first time.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,780
But the Chinese Communist Party

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,440
vowed to end the practice of using organs
from executed prisoners in 2012.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,100
Sorry, they meant, in 2013.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,579
Ok, for real on January 1, 2015.

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,579
Which is kind of like

16
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,960
when you keep asking for an extension on that
final college research paper

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,490
...the one you technically haven't started writing yet.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,310
And the CCP has decided to just take an incomplete,

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,360
according to this massive report that came
out in July:

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,310
The one that alleges up to 1.5 million Chinese
organ transplants

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,560
have come not from executed criminals

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,000
—but from prisoners of conscience.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,350
Because you’re only a criminal for doing
this in China.

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,530
So what does the top international transplant
organization

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,369
“The Transplantation Society” think of
China’s system?

26
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,170
Well, they just hosted their annual conference
in Hong Kong.

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,370
And they are big fans of China's transplant
system!

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,950
According to the people running China's transplant
system.

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,190
You see, they were invited to give a presentation

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,659
on China's new and improved system 
at the conference.

31
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,200
As my favorite state-run newspaper Global
Times put it,

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,700
“Scholars say this special Chinese organ
transplant meeting

33
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,200
shows that the Chinese organ transplant world

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,680
has been truly accepted by the Transplantation
Society.”

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,910
And all the pro-communist newspapers in Hong
Kong agree!

36
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,830
Imagine that.

37
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,970
So what did the president of the Transplantation
Society

38
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,220
have to say about all the support and acceptance

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,030
he was giving to China’s organ transplant
system?

40
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,890
"It is important that you understand

41
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,880
that the global community is appalled by the
practices

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,800
which the Chinese have adhered to in the past...

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,209
Many people in the global community

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,870
are not persuaded that China has changed."

45
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,569
So that's what true acceptance sounds like.

46
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,400
As the New York Times puts it,

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,319
“Although Dr. O’Connell did not name any
groups,

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,599
he may have been referring to Falun Gong,

49
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,580
a spiritual movement that is outlawed in China

50
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,450
and that accuses the Chinese authorities of
extracting organs from its members.”

51
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,850
So that was awkward.

52
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,120
But not as awkward as this:

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,680
A Chinese liver surgeon, Zheng Shusen,

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,440
was originally scheduled to speak about

55
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,160
“a new era of liver transplantation in China.”

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,780
But then another Chinese surgeon was called
in to speak about it instead.

57
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,700
Well, that didn’t stop Zheng from pulling
a Kanye.

58
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,500
He just took the stage and talked anyway.

59
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,769
“Imma let you finish, but Falun Gong has
the best organs.”

60
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,050
After Zheng left the stage,

61
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,160
Dr. Jeremy Chapman, former president of the
Transplantation Society,

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,800
came up and was all like someone here,

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,330
not naming names,

64
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,410
presented research that included executed
prisoners.

65
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,960
Oh and interesting fact about Kanye wannabe Zheng
Shusen:

66
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,319
In addition to doing all kinds of liver transplants,

67
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,550
he's also the chair of an Anti-Falun Gong
association in China’s Zhejiang Province.

68
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,330
He’s also given scientific papers on liver-matching
in 24 hours

69
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,000
which is about as legit as guy on the street
selling Rolexes

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,340
that the previous owner “just didn’t want
anymore.”

71
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,850
In the US, it can take years to find a matching
liver.

72
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,489
Well, China’s former deputy health minister
Huang Jiefu

73
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,299
has responded to the claims

74
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,830
that the national organ transplant system
he runs

75
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,349
still uses organs from prisoners.

76
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,019
Unsurprisingly, he called those claims “ridiculous.”

77
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,730
He was also the guy who said China

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,590
would stop harvesting organs from executed
prisoners by 2015.

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,250
And 2013.

80
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,849
So is the Transplantation Society ready to
stop China’s appalling medical practices?

81
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,419
That's where things get interesting.

82
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,270
Because both Dr. O’Connell, the current
president,

83
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,449
and his predecessor Dr. Chapman

84
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,169
had undisclosed ties with a shady Chinese
hospital, according to the Epoch Times.

85
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,150
They both work at Westmead hospital in Australia,

86
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,569
which has ties to Third Xiangya Hospital in
China.

87
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,330
They even have one of those awkward Chinese
group photos together,

88
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,339
from when the doctors visited China back in
2013.

89
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:51,689
Third Xiangya Hospital is a "national research
base" for transplant technology in China

90
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,330
one that Chinese former deputy health minister
Huang Jiefu

91
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,199
promoted as a model hospital.

92
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,940
And according to a now mysteriously deleted
article from their website,

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,699
they once performed 17 transplants in only
one day.

94
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,919
Which is a lot.

95
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,069
Good thing so many people are “donating.”

96
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:15,939
So what do you think of China’s acceptance
by the Transplantation Society?

97
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:17,680
And if you want to know more about

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,090
the Chinese military’s secret involvement
in all this,

99
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,819

Military Secret Revealed!”
