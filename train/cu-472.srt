00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,149
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,819
the People’s Daily is totally not making

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,839
"inappropriate and erotic online content."

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,980
And this is the People’s Daily.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,240
The official newspaper of the Chinese Communist
Party.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,130
It's where people go to get the specific policy
directives of the Party leadership.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,519
And this is the People's Daily Online.

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,940
The official website of the official newspaper
of the Chinese Communist Party.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,480
And it's a little more...market oriented.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,210
You know, being in the newspaper business
is hard.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,820
Sure, the People's Daily is partly paid for
by the state and doesn't have to pay taxes,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,390
but financial stability doesn't guarantee
eyeballs.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,920
And when you're tasked with spreading China's
soft power around the world,

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,930
well, you can't do that if people aren't watching.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,120
So People's Daily Online is taking a…unique
approach to attracting an audience.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,460
Like this photo essay called “Women can
be heartthrobs too:

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,009
Beauties seen doing split in bamboo groves
in [Eastern] China.”

19
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,320
Here they are, a local aspiring girl band,

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,590
who just happen to be innocently practicing
their dance routines

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,320
in the middle of a bamboo forest.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,350
While dressed in leotards.

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,299
And extremely small tutus.

24
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:23,079
How fortunate that the People’s Daily photographer
just happened

25
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:26,509
to stumble across these gazelles in the wild.

26
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,909
Here they are, in their natural habitat,

27
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,789
employing the well-known stretching technique
of making kissy faces at each other.

28
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,600
And in a forest full of vertical bamboo poles,

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,229
they of course need to gently stabilize each
other to get a full extension.

30
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,299
Wow, those two are really leaning into that
stretch.

31
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,439
As the People's Daily so eloquently says,

32
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,619
"Their intimate interactions would make one
blush just by one glance."

33
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,530
I assume they mean we're blushing

34
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,509
because of the girls' exquisite, completely
natural and unstaged artistry, of course.

35
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:03,799
You know, when Mao said that “women hold
up half the sky,”

36
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,100
I didn't realize he meant they should be holding
it up with their legs.

37
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,880
And if the People's Daily is producing such
informative and high quality journalism on

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,030
this girl band,

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,580
I can't wait for next year's International
Women's Day reporting.

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,920
Maybe they'll have a full spread!

41
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,340
This is just one of many similar photo galleries
on the People’s Daily Online.

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,200
But when it comes to non-state-run borderline
pornographic content,

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,350
the Chinese regime has a little different
stance.

44
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,240
“If you had said to me what is China going
to ban,

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,220
eating bananas seductively would have been
fairly low on my list.

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,990
Like I didn’t know that was a thing until
this story.”

47
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,290
But it is! Or was.

48
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,420
“Seductively eating bananas” is the latest
victim of China’s internet censorship.

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,550
And yes, you are looking at CCTV’s facebook
page.

50
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,350
Because clearly, while some things should
be banned for your average Chinese citizen,

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,990
it’s okay when your government does it.

52
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,300
So while this is inappropriate,

53
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,930
this is totally fine.

54
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,400
Just like how Twitter and Facebook are banned
in China,

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,660
but if you want more wholesome content like
this,

56
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,910
“Please follow People's Daily on Twitter
and Facebook.”

57
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,540
At least the People's Daily allows comments
on this article.

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,620
Which I recommend you do not read.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,040
So what do you think about banning fruit eating
as seedy behavior.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,090
Will it be a fruitless effort?

61
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,530
Is it just too appealing?

62
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,930
Let me know what you think in the comment
section below.

63
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,400
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you
next time.
