1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,880
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,850
if the Chinese regime thinks it can

3
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,069
take a bite out of Australia,

4
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:09,580
like it were some kind of Vegemite sandwich,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,500
they...have never tasted Vegemite before.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,880
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,790
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,550
Something terrible has happened in Australia.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,460
Something that will make your skin crawl.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,730
“G’day, losers.”

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,930
Don’t worry, that’s not a real movie.

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,039
It’s just an extremely bizarre

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,660
Australia tourism ad.

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,320
What I’m actually talking about

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,539
is much worse than

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,239
a Crocodile Dundee reboot.

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,920
Ok, slightly worse.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,040
It’s the Chinese Communist Party’s

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,530
ongoing campaign to subvert

20
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,649
Australian politics and society.

21
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,500
There’s been a recent revelation

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,789
that millions of dollars

23
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,640
worth of campaign contributions

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,789
came from donors with

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,850
links to the Chinese regime.

26
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,449
Yeah, China, you call that a knife?

27
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,020
Well, this is a knife:

28
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,230
Australia is fighting back,

29
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,940
by tightening rules on foreign investment.

30
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,160
You see, Chinese state-owned enterprises

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,320
having been investing in critical Australian

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,570
electrical and gas infrastructure.

33
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,150
And there’s been a recent surge of purchases

34
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,650
of Australian agricultural land.

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,380
This is a potential national security concern:

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
letting a foreign,

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,200
sometimes hostile authoritarian regime

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,380
control your energy and food supplies.

39
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,000
Imagine if you could do that in Settlers of
Catan.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,340
Maybe it wouldn’t take so long to get through
a game.

41
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,001
But in real life, letting another country

42
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,350
control your resources is a bad idea.

43
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,610
So Australia is putting in place some new
rules.

44
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,820
One of them is that agricultural land must
be

45
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,460
widely marketed for at least 30 days to Australians

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,890
before it can be offered to foreigners.

47
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,250
Yes, foreigners in general.

48
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,550
No particular foreigner.

49
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,790
We’re not naming names here.

50
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,180
But it’s China.

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,010
See, Australia has received more

52
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,850
Chinese overseas investment

53
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,210
than any other country except the United States.

54
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,250
And if you adjust for GDP,

55
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,240
Australia has 14 times more Chinese investment

56
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
than the United States.

57
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,509
That’s a lot of cans of Fosters.

58
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,230
That’s Australian for beer.

59
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,430
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

60
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,920
Okay, I’m being told

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,609
real Australians drink VB.

62
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:21,150
Anyway, all this Chinese investment

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,569
has made Australia’s intelligence agency

64
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:24,579
ASIO nervous.

65
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,409
They have a security rating system,

66
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,799
from negligible to extreme.

67
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,010
And I’ll give you one guess

68
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,209
as to which country was just ranked extreme.

69
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,189
“In a couple of examples,

70
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,870
we have the threat level at extreme.”

71
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,860
“And government officials have told 9 News
that China

72
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,379
is listed by ASIO as an extreme threat.”

73
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,870
ASIO also warned that Chinese interference

74
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,040
isn’t limited to politics,

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,329
but across Australian society as a whole.

76
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,849
Other countries have made similar moves

77
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,221
restricting foreign investment

78
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:58,700
from Chinese companies—

79
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,180
also over security concerns.

80
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,709
Because as I’ve explained in previous episodes,

81
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,709
all large Chinese companies have significant
connections

82
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,260
to the Communist Party—

83
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,450
even privately owned ones.

84
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,310
For example, last month,

85
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,409
the US government blocked China’s

86
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,090
Ant Financial from acquiring

87
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,329
US company MoneyGram.

88
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,170
The UK has made similar moves.

89
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,239
Of course the Chinese regime

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,010
says all this is just silly.

91
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,719
The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson

92
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,020
even took a page out of the

93
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,849
China Uncensored playbook

94
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,989
and went all sarcastic on us.

95
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,139
I assume she’s a big fan.

96
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,450
She said that if Australians regard

97
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,810
all the millions of Chinese visiting

98
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,319
or living in Australia as spies,

99
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,099
then no wonder Australians feel nervous.

100
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,099
Haha.

101
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,650
What a funnybone tickler.

102
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,439
Except, her sarcasm completely

103
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,519
mischaracterizes what’s happening.

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,799
In fact, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull

105
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,129
has made it pretty clear that Australia’s

106
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,200
security concerns are not about targeting

107
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,060
Chinese Australians,

108
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,620
or even visiting Chinese.

109
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,290
“I want to be very clear,

110
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,999
we have focused on the activities

111
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:10,480
of foreign states and their agents in Australia,

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,999
and not the loyalties of Australians

113
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,139
who happen to be from another country.”

114
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,750
And a mountain of evidence is piling up about

115
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,680
the danger Chinese-backed companies present.

116
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,500
“Australia has backed a new

117
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,190
United States defense strategy

118
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,800
naming Russia and China

119
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,020
a greater threat to national security

120
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,430
than Islamic terrorism.”

121
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,080
So, Chinese regime falls back on

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,770
accusations of racism—

123
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,190
saying Australians are just being prejudiced

124
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,350
against Chinese people.

125
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,060
“Such comments pander to certain

126
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,470
irresponsible reports in Australian media,

127
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,540
they are full of prejudice against China.”

128
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,800
Except that’s not going to work.

129
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Because interference from the Chinese regime

130
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,060
has gotten so bad,

131
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,410
it’s got some Australians saying,

132
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,660
you know what,

133
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,280
our alliance with the US is actually

134
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,840
pretty good by comparison.

135
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,159
“About 8 months ago,

136
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,340
I couldn’t imagine me taking this position,

137
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,319
and defending the US alliance.”

138
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,789
This is pretty significant.

139
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,669
A huge part of Australia’s economy

140
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:10,610
relies on China.

141
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,730
According to Stratfor,

142
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,410
“China accounts for 30 percent

143
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,620
of Australia's trade.”

144
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,710
But the push for regulating Chinese investment

145
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,590
has been building since 2015.

146
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,751
That’s when a Chinese company

147
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:24,539
leased a major Australian port.

148
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,080
That caused waves of concern,

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,759
not just in Australia

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,039
but also in the US.

151
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,770
In 2016,

152
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,090
Australia blocked China’s attempts

153
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,680
to buy a controlling share of Ausgrid,

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,889
a major Australian electrical network company.

155
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:39,889
The shares were bought buy

156
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,090
two Australian pension funds instead.

157
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,150
So Australia’s new rules affect agriculture

158
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,880
and the energy grid.

159
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,419
But they don’t cover Australia’s

160
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,300
second-biggest industry:

161
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,470
Mining.

162
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,509
And right now, an Indian company is seeking

163
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:55,370
Chinese investment money to buy

164
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,129
a $13 billion dollar coal mine in Australia.

165
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,720
The Chinese money is sort of their last option.

166
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,030
The local Australian banks all turned it down

167
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,409
because they don’t want to be caught up

168
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,650
in a project that could have

169
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,500
huge environmental costs.

170
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,569
But China?

171
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,310
They’re fine with it.

172
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,310
After all,

173
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,509
those aren’t China’s resources at risk.

174
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:15,720
The Australian government’s

175
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,759
increased controls on foreign investments

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,440
are probably coming at a good time.

177
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
After all,

178
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,580
they wouldn’t want those 37,000 miles

179
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,960
of pristine beach and all those wineries

180
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,909
to belong to a foreign country.

181
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,250
Otherwise what would they put

182
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,980
in their tourism ads?

183
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,560
Actually, that beach does look pretty nice.

184
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,000
I think I’m due for another vacation...

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,169
Well played, Australia.

186
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,470
So what do you think of Australia

187
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,430
curbing investment from China?

188
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,820
Leave your comments below.

189
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,120
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,810
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

191
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,840
see you next time.

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
Wait, before you go,

193
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,219
I have something important to tell you.

194
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,600
You know, not many companies are brave enough

195
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,060
to advertise on China Uncensored.

196
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,599
But there is one I want you to know about.

197
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,330
They sell amazing food:

198
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,780
Thrive Life.

199
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,000
And unlike a lot of other meal delivery food,

200
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,610
they’ve got GMO Free,

201
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,610
Gluten Free,

202
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,840
and organic options.

203
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,910
And unlike Blue Apron,

204
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,110
Thrive Life meal packs won’t go rotten

205
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,789
in you fridge after a couple days.

206
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:20,220
Thrive food is freeze dried,

207
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,599
so it lasts several months,

208
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,599
even years.

209
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,730
I know what you’re thinking.

210
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,730
Freeze dried food?

211
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,319
Are you sure about this?

212
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,129
I was skeptical too...

213
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,300
until they sent me a box of samples.

214
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,949
And I can honestly tell you,

215
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,590
it’s delicious.

216
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,069
They sent me this whole box.

217
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,310
There’s a ton of amazing food in here.

218
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,240
Everything from snacks to meals.

219
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,199
My personal favorite,

220
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,220
South Pacific-Style Stir Fry with Pulled Pork.

221
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,220
Now I know,

222
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,330
it comes in a box,

223
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,039
but this is what it looks like cooked

224
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,300
and it only took me a few minutes to make.

225
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,610
And they sell hundreds of other foods.

226
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,729
Uncensoring China takes a lot of energy.

227
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,199
And I don’t always have time to plan meals.

228
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,550
I can’t tell you how many times food in
my fridge

229
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,639
has gone bad because I couldn’t cook for
a few days.

230
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,840
Thrive Life basically solved this for me.

231
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,030
It’s super convenient,

232
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,030
tastes great,

233
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,949
and I don’t have to worry about it going
bad.

234
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,620
It’s also more affordable the Blue Apron.

235
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,570
I’ve provided a link below to order.

236
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,150
Just try one or two meals.

237
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,580
You’re gonna love it.

238
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,300
And China Uncensored gets a commission

239
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,169
on any purchase you make.

240
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,750
So this is a great way to help the show,

241
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,000
and get some tasty food out of it.

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,020
Plus, if Kim Jong-un ever does launch a nuke,

243
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,680
you’ll have all the food you need

244
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,280
in the post-apocalyptic future.

245
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,459
So help out the show,

246
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,130
and buy yourselves some treats from Thrive
Life.
