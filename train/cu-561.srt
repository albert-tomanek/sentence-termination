1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,660
Who’s to blame for the deadly Chinese virus?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,549
That’s the life or death power struggle

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,560
Happening right now in China.

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,540
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,549
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,060
It’s been weeks now since the Chinese city
of Wuhan,

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,770
where a deadly coronavirus first spread,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,710
has been under quarantine.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,060
And inside the city,

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,930
people are afraid to leave their homes.

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,160
And it shows.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,920
They’re going a little stir crazy

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,920
But people are finding ways to pass the time.

14
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:38,280
Like fishing.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,760
An impromptu lion dance for the new year.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,469
Or enjoying the party life...

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,579
with a safe amount of distance

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:48,309
between you and the next family.

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,940
But despite it all, the people of Wuhan are
finding solidarity.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,740
They’re chanting “Wuhan, jiayou.”

21
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:03,100
Which means “Wuhan, add oil”.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,760
Which is like saying,
“Go Wuhan, let’s be awesome.”

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,280
Which is way more than I can say for Chinese
Communist officials.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
For them, it’s all about who’s not awesome.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,770
High ranking officials in Beijing

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,480
are blaming low ranking officials in Wuhan

27
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,140
for the spread of the virus.

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,000
Meanwhile, Wuhan’s mayor is blaming Beijing
leadership

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,210
for some of the cover up.

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,550
Yeah, he’s going down.

31
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,730
But regardless of the conflict Communist Party
officials

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,980
are having right now,

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,700
there’s one thing they can all agree on—

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,520
the real enemy is the Chinese people!

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,300
Authorities are cracking down hard on people

36
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,700
trying to break through the veil of government
secrecy.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,190
Or as they call it, spreading rumors.

38
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,640
According to state-run Xinhua,

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,530
“All those who spread fake news and thus
disturb social order

40
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,420
will face up to three years in prison,

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,380
detention, or disciplinary action.

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,640
Those who have caused serious consequences

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,140
will be given 3-year to 7-year prison terms.”

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,700
It makes sense: If they lock *everyone* in

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
prison,

46
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,740
then the outbreak can’t keep spreading,
right?

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,070
Well, despite the threat of prison,

48
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,640
a lot of people are still going online to
blame the government,

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,620
both high and low ranking officials.

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,370
Some residents of Wuhan are posting videos

51
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,990
calling for international help.

52
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,790
This footage that went viral shows bodies
on the floor

53
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,370
as other patients sit by.

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,120
And people are posting dozens of videos of
massively crowded hospitals.

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,700
Which is why local authorities

56
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,380
are trying to build a new giant hospital in
a week.

57
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,310
Don’t get too enamored.

58
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,830
The footage you’ve seen is originally from
Chinese state media.

59
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,720
They released it to the west as a propaganda
tool,

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,140
so we can all see how great their authoritarian
approach to problem solving is.

61
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,600
They’re not really hospitals.

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,510
Actual hospitals cannot be built in a week.

63
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,580
These are large temporary buildings

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,980
that will be used as quarantine centers.

65
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,680
It’s still a good thing,

66
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,330
because normal hospitals are so stressed that

67
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,890
there are reports of people going to multiple
hospitals a day

68
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,870
to try to get tested or treated.

69
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,750
Oh, and there are limited test kits available
so hospitals

70
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,740
have to decide who they’re going to test.

71
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,490
That’s one reason why the true extent of
the virus

72
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490
is still being underreported.

73
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,989
Meanwhile, earlier this week,

74
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,180
Chinese premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan.

75
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,620
Everybody was really impressed.

76
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Except this auntie.

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,930
You never know when you’re going to have
a chance to buy groceries again.

78
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,580
But as Li Keqiang’s propaganda show went
on in Wuhan,

79
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,610
Chinese authorities in other parts of China

80
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,750
were pinning the blame for the coronavirus
on people of Wuhan.

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,910
By treating anyone who is from or has been
to Wuhan like fugitives.

82
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,760
Here’s a Wuhan resident who thought he’d
escaped,

83
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,390
being forced into a van by police.

84
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,220
Rather than take blame for the cover up for
the virus,

85
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,209
the Communist Party is trying to paint the
unquarantined people of Wuhan

86
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,440
as being responsible for the spread of the
virus.

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,190
So I think we should all be sending a message
of support

88
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,020
to the people of Wuhan.

89
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,880
Wuhan, jiayou.

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
So what do you think about the blame game
playing out in China?

91
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,980
Leave your comments below.

92
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,900
And now I’ll answer a question from a fan

93
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,500
who supports China Uncensored

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,710
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

95
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,270
Andy Sleeper asks,

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
“Demonetized?

97
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,020
Interesting, since I saw ads before, during,
and after.”

98
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,340
I’m glad you brought this up, Andy.

99
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,919
So you saw ads on a demonetized episode.

100
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,550
What does that mean?

101
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,440
YouTube is pretty brutal with how they demonetize
us.

102
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,740
Most episodes are instantly demonetized by
a bot.

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,040
There is an appeals process though.

104
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,910
When I appeal, there’s a period of time
where,

105
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,440
as YouTube says,

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,260
“limited, or no ads will play.”

107
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
In other words,

108
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,940
you might see an ad on a demonetized video

109
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,650
only one out of 20 times.

110
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,120
Then 24 or 48 hours after my appeal,

111
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,320
maybe YouTube accepts the appeal

112
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,790
and admits that the algorithm was totally
wrong

113
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,000
for demonetizing our episodes.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
But by that point,

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,540
the video will have already gotten most of
the views it’s going to get.

116
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,699
In other words, even though it's been remonetized,

117
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,190
we aren’t going to make very much money
from it.

118
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,480
Now, believe me,

119
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,620
I’m not doing this show for the money.

120
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,560
If I were, let’s just say I could make a
lot more money being pro-Beijing.

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,730
But YouTube has made it very hard to fund
this show.

122
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,630
I’d have had to quit making China Uncensored
years ago

123
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,229
if fans like you, Andy, hadn’t stepped up

124
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,920
and started supporting the show through Patreon.

125
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,860
So I think you and all the supporters on Patreon
deserve a big thanks,

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,070
not just from me, but from everyone else

127
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,290
who is still able to watch the show today
because of your support.

128
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,430
For those of you watching,

129
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,340
if you’re interested in standing up to the
Chinese Communist Party,

130
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,380
join what I lovingly call the China Uncensored
50-cent army.

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,960

more.

132
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,260
thanks for watching China Uncensored.
