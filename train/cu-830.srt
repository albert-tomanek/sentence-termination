1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,469
China has put new tariffs on US goods

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,120
Trying to force the US to back down in the
trade war

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,920
But Trump says “I’ll see you,

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,000
and raise you 5%”

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,640
And now he’s calling on US companies to
leave China

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,560
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,570
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,019
The Chinese Communist Party is not happy about

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,210
the US’s latest tariffs on Chinese goods.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,849
So they’ve launched new tariffs of their
own—

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,650
of up to 10% on $75 billion worth of US goods.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,480
That was announced last Friday.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,260
And it came after the US unveiled tariffs

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,210
on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,140
scheduled to go into effect in two stages—

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,960
one in September and the other in December.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,260
And the Chinese regime’s new tariffs play
on

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,480
people’s fears of a recession ahead of the
2020 election.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,040
They want to make President Trump blink.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,820
But they forgot they were dealing with Tariff
Man.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,010
Trump had tweeted on Friday,

22
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,210
saying he would not only NOT withdraw the
planned tariffs

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,940
in response to China,

24
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,200
but that he would levy EVEN MORE tariffs on
Chinese goods.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,540
As he told reporters that night,

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,750
"We're having a little spat with China and
we'll win it.

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,680
We put a lot of tariffs on China today as
you know,

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
they put some on us.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
We put a lot on them."

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,210
And then Trump was off to attend the G7 summit
in France.

31
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,810
On Monday, he gave a colorful explanation

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,600
for the logic of why China’s one-upmanship

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,590
in piling on tariffs is doomed to fail.

34
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,380
“When I raise and he raises, when I raise
and he raises,

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,909
we can never catch up.

36
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,700
We have to balance our trading relationship

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,700
at least to an extent.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,340
And they were unwilling to do that.

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,310
And we're never going to have a deal if that
happens."

40
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,700
One of the ways the US-China trade relationship

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,750
is unbalanced is the $420 billion trade deficit
with China.

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,140
In 2018, the US exported only $120 billion
to China,

43
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,830
while imports from China were $540 billion.

44
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,220
But if this was just a trade imbalance problem,

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,189
then it would be easy to solve.

46
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,120
China could buy more pork and soybeans from
the US,

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,140
and everyone would go home happy.

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,400
Except for this little guy.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,750
Mmm, bacon.

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,310
Which is to say, it’s not just a trade imbalance
problem.

51
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,400
According to the U.S. Trade Representative,

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,980
China steals up to $600 billion per year

53
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,480
in American intellectual property.

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,650
This is done in part through state-sponsored

55
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,750
corporate espionage and cyberattacks.

56
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,730
It’s also done through forced technology
transfers,

57
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,420
where the Chinese regime forces foreign companies

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,849
doing business in China to hand over

59
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,810
intellectual property and licenses.

60
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,630
Chinese state-run media has responded to these
allegations

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,910
by accusing the US of using intellectual property

62
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,040
as “a weapon to contain other countries,

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,760
and a veil for bullying the world.”

64
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,590
So…China is stealing from the US.

65
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,120
The US is complaining about China stealing
from the US.

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,770
And now China is saying quit bullying us for
stealing from you.

67
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,620
Sounds reasonable.

68
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,720
Trump said at Monday’s G7 summit

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,840
that if China doesn’t start treating the
US fairly,

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,320
he’s willing to stop doing business with
China entirely.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,629
"You know, and I told this to President Xi,

72
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:27,240
who I really respect.

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,530
I really do...

74
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,040
... But I told him very strongly,

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,150
I said 'look, you're starting up here

76
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,180
and you're making 500 billion a year

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,390
and stealing our intellectual property.

78
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,210
We're down on the floor.

79
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,430
Lower than the floor.

80
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,480
Can't make a 50/50 deal.

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,740
This has to be a deal that's better for us.

82
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,090
And if it's not better,

83
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,330
let's not do business together.

84
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,270
I don't want to do business.

85
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,900
Forget about tariffs for a second,

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,790
we're taking in tremendous amounts of money.

87
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,790
Forget that.

88
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,790
I don't wanna do business.’”

89
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,070
The Chinese regime, meanwhile,

90
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,180
said it would fight back against American
tariffs.

91
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,750
The Communist Party's mouthpiece The People's
Daily

92
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,330
said in an editorial on Sunday that

93
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,340
"China is confident that it will follow its
own path

94
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,440
and do its own things well,

95
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,340
and will never waver in its stand on

96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,819
countering any provocations by the U.S. side."

97
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,569
But despite Trump’s assurances

98
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:22,490
that he and Xi Jinping are still pals,

99
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,259
one person who sees their bromance crumbling

100
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,120
is former White House Chief Strategist Steve
Bannon.

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,889
"I'm glad we're having this interview today
on Friday

102
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,550
because I think the friendship quote unquote

103
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,189
with President Xi and President Trump

104
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:37,819
probably ended today when China came back

105
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,020
and tried to play smashmouth

106
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
and raise tariffs on these American goods."

107
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Does he mean the Chinese regime

108
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,060
is dropping hints that if Trump doesn’t
follow,

109
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,060
there won’t be a tomorrow?

110
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,139
“And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow

111
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,360
But if the offer’s shunned,

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,410
you might as well be walkin’ on the sun”

113
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,000
Ah, remember when bowling shirts were cool?

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,219
Me neither.

115
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:03,360
But anyway, the Trump-Xi Jinping bromance
not withstanding,

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,240
Trump said he’s ordering US companies

117
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,909
to “immediately start looking for an alternative
to China,”

118
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,080
including bringing their companies home

119
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,380
and making their products in the USA.

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,620
...leading American media to ask,

121
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,520
“wait, can he do that?”

122
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,740
Trump answered that question,

123
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,460
telling all the “fake news reporters”

124
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,860
who doubted him that yes, he can,

125
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,979
using the Emergency Economic Powers Act of
1977.

126
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,680
“Case closed!”

127
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,189
Wait, so he CAN do that?

128
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:32,589
Well, yes.

129
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,990
But it’s complicated.

130
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,740
The 1977 law gives the president the power

131
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,669
to block financial transactions between a
US company

132
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:43,680
and a specific foreign country, i.e.

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
China.

134
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,159
So if Trump enacted that power,

135
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,530
it would effectively prevent US companies

136
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,050
from conducting business with China.

137
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,789
But Trump CANNOT specifically force those
companies

138
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,349
to move their manufacturing to the US.

139
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,669
Because they can just move to other countries

140
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,089
with low labor costs.

141
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:04,879
In fact, they’ve been gradually doing that
already

142
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,529
over the past year,

143
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,149
relocating factories from China to Southeast
Asia.

144
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,439
See, it’s important for big companies

145
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,569
to pay their workers as little as possible,

146
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,249
even if they can’t do it in China.

147
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:19,509
At least until the robots take everyone’s
jobs.

148
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,680
So what do you think about

149
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,639
Trump’s response to China’s tariffs?

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,449
Leave your comments below.

151
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,319
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

152
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,819
from one of my 50-Cent Army supporters on
Patreon.

153
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:32,860
Sell asks:

154
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,990
“There's a lot of talk about the potential

155
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,490
for the CCP/Chinese economy

156
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,089
to collapse under all this pressure,

157
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,490
but with how much the global economy is intertwined
with China,

158
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,849
could the rest of the world survive such a
collapse?

159
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,399
Wouldn't that qualify as an economic version
of

160
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,430
"Mutually Assured Destruction"?

161
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,089
Good question, Sell.

162
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,479
If China’s giant economy collapses,

163
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,569
the entire world will feel the ground shake.

164
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:01,009
It could crash stock markets globally,

165
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,800
and lead to another global financial crisis.

166
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,110
However, the less tied the US is to China,

167
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,179
the less the US would feel it.

168
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,449
That’s part of the reason why the Trump
administration

169
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,659
wants US companies to pull out of China.

170
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,930
It protects the US economy against a possible
disaster there.

171
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,860
So really, smart companies ought to pull out
as soon as possible.

172
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,580
Thanks for your question.
