00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,570
China wants to build megacities

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,360
with more people than any city in human history.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,280
But megacities could also mean mega-problems.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,160
Hi, Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,840
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,700
Nothing screams long-term viability like

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,610
heavy-handed central planning.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,660
Just ask the Soviet Union!

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,480
Oh wait, you can’t.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,690
But the Chinese Communist Party

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,250
still believes in central planning.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,500
And that’s why they want to build not one,

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,800
not two,

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,130
but as many as 19 megacities.

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,500
Some of them could be home to

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,390
more than 100 million people.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,050
And really, what’s not to love about

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,180
living in a giant Chinese city?

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,430
Now sure, central planning

21
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,430
can occasionally have some small downsides.

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,110
Like that one time in the 1950s,

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,079
when Mao Zedong suggested that people

24
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,559
make steel in their backyards instead of farming
their crops,

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,339
and then like 50 million people starved to
death.

26
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,450
But oops, right?

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,600
Or more recently,

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,310
how the Chinese authorities have built

29
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,899
several ghost cities like Ordos

30
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,609
that hardly anyone moved into

31
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,380
because it’s too expensive and there are
no jobs.

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,049
See, they’re learning from their mistakes.

33
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,049
And besides,

34
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,170
these new megacity projects will be totally
different!

35
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,640
A few years ago, I talked about Jing-Jin-Ji,

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,060
the new megacity that the Party is constructing
around Beijing.

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,270
Well, apparently that’s working so well,

38
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,359
they want to make another 18 of them.

39
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,840
The concept behind the megacities is the “cluster
policy.”

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,840
China’s central planners believe that by
creating

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,969
“mammoth urban clusters, anchored around
giant hubs”

42
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,599
and containing dozens of nearby cities,

43
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,570
they can increase productivity and accelerate
economic growth.

44
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,340
This idea is called the theory of agglomeration
benefits.

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,779
It says that the bigger a city gets,

46
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:04,290
the more productive it is per person.

47
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,869
Supposedly, that’s because a large labor
market

48
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:11,590
makes it easier for employers to find the
right workers.

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,190
And as companies work together more closely,

50
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,709
more efficient supply chains are formed.

51
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,200
Know-how also spreads more easily,

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,650
and that increases innovation.

53
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,850
According to the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development,

54
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,349
or OECD,

55
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,140
doubling a city’s population can increase
productivity by 2-5%.

56
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,780
Some experts say that in China,

57
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,830
these gains could be even greater.

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,939
One New York university scholar says that,

59
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,310
if done right and integrated well,

60
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,579
China’s city clusters could achieve levels
of productivity

61
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,360
never seen before.

62
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,939
He compares it to the “differences between
England

63
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,079
and the rest of the world during the Industrial
Revolution.”

64
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,079
Alain Bertaud of New York University

65
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,860
I mean, who could argue with that much productivity.

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,200
Labor economists are practically drooling
right now.

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,469
But it’s possible—just possible—

68
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,260
that despite the best intentions of communist
party officials,

69
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,290
China’s megacities won’t be integrated
perfectly.

70
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,200
And if so, that could cause a host of problems.

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
Just think of all the nasty stuff

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,890
big Chinese cities are already known for…

73
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,610
like crowds...

74
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,019
traffic jams…

75
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,170
pollution…

76
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,430
security checkpoints before you get on the
subway

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,659
Wait, no, I said subway.

78
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,069
That can’t be right!

79
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,880
What’s that Shelley?

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,180
Oh, they did introduce airport-style security
checks

81
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,459
temporarily in Beijing after an alleged terror
attack...

82
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,870
in a totally different part of the country.

83
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,810
Anyway, take all the standard big-city issues,

84
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,060
and multiply them across 100-plus million
people.

85
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,819
And multiply that by 19 megacities.

86
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,450
That’s one heck of a math problem.

87
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,920
But one of the most widespread problems with
megacities

88
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
is also one of the most basic.

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,510
Simply getting from A to B.

90
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,629
Theoretically, high-speed train lines should
make this easy.

91
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:09,330
But that’s not quite the case in all of
these future megacities.

92
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,549
For the Wang family, A is Yanjiao,

93
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,299
a 700 thousand strong bedroom community

94
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,980
where Mr. Wang lives,

95
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,590
and B is Beijing.

96
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,930
Mr. Wang gets up at 5 am

97
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,070
to stand for over an hour in a line

98
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,090
that stretches for several blocks,

99
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,390
for a bus to Beijing.

100
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,800
More specifically,

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,980
for a bus to Beijing for his daughter.

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,310
“As a parent, if she doesn’t get a seat,

103
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,750
I feel restless.

104
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,090
So I wait in line for her every day.”

105
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,311
The commute to Beijing is so bad,

106
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,500
that people’s elderly parents stand in bus
lines

107
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,540
on behalf of their children

108
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,250
so they can get an extra hour of sleep and
not burn out.

109
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,390
Then there’s Ms. Ding Shu,

110
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,420
who works in Shanghai and lives in Kunshan,

111
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,280
a satellite town linked to Shanghai by subway.

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,540
She’s out of luck, too.

113
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,480
“When you factor in her bus ride to the
subway,

114
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
security checks to enter the station,

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,930
walking time and waiting time,

116
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,880
she spends about four hours a day commuting.”

117
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,090
In Yanjiao, there’s also a lack of schools
and hospitals.

118
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,550
“The services are bad,” says Zheng Linyun,

119
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,460
whose 6-year-old was one of 65 kids in a grade-one
classroom,

120
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,720
according to this New York Times article

121
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,980
aptly titled “As Beijing Becomes a Supercity,

122
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,800
the Rapid Growth Brings Pains.”

123
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,530
But maybe the economic benefits

124
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,010
outweigh the drawbacks?

125
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,150
Well, the jury’s out on that, too.

126
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,370
In an article from the Journal of the Asia
Pacific Economy

127
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,950
called “Did city cluster development help
improve

128
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,390
labor productivity in China?”

129
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,070
the authors write that “the empirical results

130
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,520
reveal that the city cluster strategy initiated

131
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
in China's 11th Five-Year Plan

132
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,640
has not produced any significant impact

133
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,650
on labor productivity.”

134
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,330
With one exception:

135
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,110
the \hYangtze River Delta super region.

136
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,910
Research shows that counties tied to this
cluster

137
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,880
enjoy a 6% boost in productivity.

138
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,390
According to China Briefing,

139
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,340
the Yangtze River Delta cluster,

140
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,580
which combines Shanghai and several neighboring
cities,

141
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,180
already accounts for about 20% of China’s
GDP

142
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,240
and is the country’s richest region.

143
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,070
And the super-city they want to make it into

144
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,710
has a population of about 150 million people.

145
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,930
That's bigger than the entire populations
of Canada,

146
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,650
the UK, and Australia combined.

147
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,650
And again,

148
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,350
China’s urban planners are building

149
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,420
19 of these mega clusters.

150
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,970
The average population of the five biggest
ones

151
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,750
is 110 million.

152
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,310
But one reason they’re doing it is to actually

153
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,550
decrease the size of the major cities within
each cluster.

154
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,790
The Chinese Communist Party doesn’t want
too many people

155
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,490
living in Beijing or Shanghai,

156
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,110
so they’ll limit the populations there are
force people

157
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,280
into these bedroom communities that are

158
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,360
part of the same mega cluster.

159
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,090
But a big problem for these smaller cities

160
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,490
is that tax revenues from these places

161
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,750
don’t stay there,

162
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,470
but are instead pocketed by the central government

163
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,680
and distributed as they see fit.

164
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,030
This means needy cities have a big problem

165
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,280
to find ways to pay for new schools,

166
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,970
roads or bus service.

167
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,530
Changing this would mean restructuring how
taxes

168
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,940
are collected and distributed,

169
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,880
and that would mean giving some centralized
control

170
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,460
to the people in the community.

171
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,620
And according to that same NYU scholar,

172
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,310
giving power to the people is the very key

173
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,470
to make megacities something more than a mega
pipe dream.

174
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,750
Bertaud says the central government should
share authority

175
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,770
and give local communities an opportunity
to organize themselves.

176
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,570
“If the central government tries to do everything,

177
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,470
they are going to mess up,

178
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,310
because they are not going to answer the local
needs.”

179
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,570
But fostering a civil society

180
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,070
in which people actually have a say

181
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,630
in how they run their lives

182
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,730
has never exactly been the strong suit

183
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,650
of the Chinese Communist Party.

184
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,390
“Power grows out of the barrel of a gun,”

185
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,120
was Chairman Mao’s infamous saying,

186
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,930
not “power to the people.”

187
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,060
And now it’s that time when I answer questions

188
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,480
from fans who support China Uncensored

189
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,770
on the crowd funding website Patreon!

190
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,100
Colin Lee Bradford asks,

191
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,400
Do you think that there is an active campaign

192
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,970
to rewrite Chinese history?

193
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,849
Rewriting history is a classic move

194
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,700
of the Chinese Communist Party.

195
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,260
First, there’s all those ancient maps

196
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,760
the Party keeps discovering

197
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,760
that prove Chinese claims to disputed territory

198
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,400
since ancient times.

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,970
And the Communist Party has launched several
campaigns

200
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,090
that changed how people looked at history.

201
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,000
For example, in 1973,

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,490
people were required to criticize Confucius

203
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,380
in the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius
Campaign.

204
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,140
Lin referred to Lin Biao,

205
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,050
and that’s a whole ‘nother story.

206
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,150
But these days,

207
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,980
the Communist Party is using Confucius,

208
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,840
setting up Confucius institutes around the
world

209
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,480
to spread Party propaganda.

210
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,630
And the Communist Party was photoshopping

211
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,590
before it was cool.

212
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,530
Before it even existed, actually.

213
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,520
Here’s a picture of Mao Zedong

214
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,790
looking awfully emaciated,

215
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,240
with three of his close comrades.

216
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Except Bo Gu on the left was purged

217
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,380
and edited out from the history books.

218
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,900
History is what you make of it I guess.

219
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,471
So if you’d like to have me

220
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,650

221
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,550

plan

227
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,370
to condense into a country of super-regions?
