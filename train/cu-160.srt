1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,440
A top figure in Huawei was arrested in Canada.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,180
Now the Chinese government is threatening:

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,570
“Release her, or else.”

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,160
And Canada says, “Or else, what...eh?”

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,400
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,680
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,340
This is Meng Wanzhou.

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,580
She’s the Chief Financial Officer

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,340
of China’s biggest private company, Huawei.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,900
But she made a big mistake:

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,140
Going to Canada.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,800
See, Meng was at the Vancouver airport on
December 1st,

13
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:35,980
changing flights, when Canadian authorities
arrested her.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,430
She’s suspected of orchestrating a scheme
by Huawei

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,350
to use the global banking system

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,350
to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,440
And now she’s stuck in a Vancouver-area
prison

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,430
called the Alouette Correctional Facility
Center for Women.

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,050
The Alouette is a dangerous place.

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,020
First they pluck the feathers off your head,

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,460
then your beak, then your neck...

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,379
And that was a very obscure joke

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,460
for all 3 of you who speak French.

24
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,930
Anyway, Meng’s arrest in Canada ought to
be a lesson:

25
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,220
She should have spent her winter visiting

26
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,270
a tropical island nation like Vanuatu.

27
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,630
Not so much for the warm weather—

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,100
but because they don’t have an extradition
treaty with the US.

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,560
Meng was arrested in Canada at the request
of US authorities.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,359
The US accuses her of misleading multinational
banks

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,679
about Huawei’s control of a company operating
in Iran,

32
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:31,819
putting the banks at risk of violating US
sanctions

33
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:35,029
and potentially incurring severe penalties.

34
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,789
If extradited to the US and convicted here,

35
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,649
she could face up to 30 years in prison.

36
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,450
But even in her temporary Canadian jail,

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,540
she’s been badly abused.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Don't take it from me.

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,829
Take it from my favorite Chinese state-run
media The Global Times.

40
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,749
They say her human rights are being violated.

41
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:54,749
They write that,

42
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:58,180
“She has been subjected to rude and degrading
treatment.”

43
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,980
For example,

44
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,080
being put in handcuffs and even ankle braces.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,130
I agree.

46
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,609
How dare Canada treat her like a common Chinese
dissident!

47
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,440
She’s a VIP with connections!

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,840
Actually, that’s not true.

49
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,019
A common Chinese dissident would have been
beaten up

50
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,489
at least once or twice by now.

51
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,489
But the point is,

52
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:19,010
Meng is not only the CFO of Huawei.

53
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,340
She’s also the daughter of Huawei’s founder,
Ren Zhengfei.

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,480
He’s worth 3.2 billion dollars.

55
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,250
And he’s a former officer of the People’s
Liberation Army.

56
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,489
That makes her not just an heiress to the
Huawei empire,

57
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,519
but potentially a key figure in the Chinese
Communist Party’s

58
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,970
shady relationship with Huawei.

59
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,409
Huawei has faced accusations of conducting
espionage

60
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,769
on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party,

61
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,500
and of undermining American security

62
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,049
by illegally using advanced US technology

63
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:53,799
to give the Chinese military an edge.

64
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,250
Richard Fisher, Senior Fellow

65
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,060
at the International Assessment and Strategy
Center,

66
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,849
told The Epoch Times that Huawei

67
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,129
and another Chinese company ZTE are quote
unquote

68
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,049
“cat’s paws for Chinese Communist Party
domination.”

69
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,049
Now that should really give you pause.

70
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:14,110
The Chinese company ZTE is a competitor of
Huawei.

71
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,829
And the US recently banned ZTE

72
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,890
from buying components from U.S. manufacturers.

73
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,790
It was punishment for illegally selling telecom
equipment

74
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,129
containing American technology to Iran and
North Korea.

75
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,799
And Huawei could soon face similar sanctions.

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,819
Because it’s also under investigation

77
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,780
by the US Department of Justice

78
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,040
for violating Iran sanctions.

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,359
So it’s little wonder that the Chinese Communist
Party

80
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,409
has rushed to threaten Canada over Meng Wanzhou’s
arrest.

81
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,349
Here’s my favorite Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesperson

82
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,800
and second-favorite Mortal Kombat character,

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Lu Kang:

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,239
“For Canada,

85
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,689
if they do not correctly handle this matter,

86
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:56,080
there will be serious consequences.”

87
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,560
Then things got weird.

88
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,780
“You asked,

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,920
what kind of serious consequences would these
be?

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,020
I can tell you in one sentence—

91
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,580
it is totally up to Canada."

92
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,820
“Totally up to Canada?”

93
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,010
Isn’t that a bit like putting a convict

94
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,500
in charge of their own sentencing?

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
“Your honor,

96
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,599
for all the grievous crimes I’ve committed,

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,920
I hereby sentence myself to...

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,020
total freedom and a six pack of beer!”

99
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,030
And can you really count on Canada for self-discipline?

100
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,250
I mean, it is the country that just legalized
marijuana.

101
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,330
And its Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau,

102
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,420
is nicknamed the “Shiny Pony”.

103
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Seriously.

104
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,280
He got that name in 2012

105
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,849
when he fought a Canadian senator

106
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,760
at a charity boxing match.

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,080
“Justin Truuuuuuudeau!”

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,820
“He’s wearing liberal red, of course.

109
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,400
I call him the Shiny Pony.

110
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,220
He looks like he’s in some sort of zen yoga
trance.”

111
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
Which, let’s face it,

112
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,120
was really a chance to show off his tattoo.

113
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,419
So can you really count on Canada’s Prime
Minister

114
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,919
to read between the lines of China’s

115
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,449
“it’s totally up to you” threat?

116
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,550
Clearly, you can’t.

117
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,820
Shiny Pony did not get the hint.

118
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,580
He told the press that he wasn’t going to
do

119
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,120
any political favors to get Ms. Meng out of
jail.

120
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,300
“I can assure everyone that

121
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,160
we are a country of an independent judiciary

122
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,580
and the appropriate authorities took the decisions
in this case

123
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,760
without any political involvement or interference,

124
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,720
as must be the case.”

125
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,270
This is something maybe Chinese authorities
don’t understand.

126
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,620
But Canada—yes, Canada—

127
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,410
does have rule of law.

128
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,370
“The Prime Minister or Minister cannot phone
the judge

129
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,580
and tell them to release the person,

130
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,430
so what’s China demanding under our rule
of law,

131
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,960
under our system,

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,860
is not a doable thing.

133
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
That being said,

134
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,509
China certainly has the means

135
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,069
to inflict pain on its relationship with Canada.”

136
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,940
So after all of the Chinese regime’s confusing
threats

137
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,190
that didn’t sound like threats,

138
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,629
it finally took Party mouthpiece People’s
Daily to lay it on straight.

139
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:09,909
They directly warned Canada that

140
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:13,509
“The only way to avoid paying a much heavier
price

141
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,240
is for the Canadian side to correct this error.”

142
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,770
So what they’re saying is...

143
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,470
Unless Canadian politicians break the law,

144
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,710
violate their extradition treaty with the
US,

145
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,160
and release Meng,

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,539
there’ll be hell to pay.

147
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,710
So how did Shiny Pony react to that?

148
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,090
“As I said the appropriate authorities

149
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,860
took the decisions in this case.

150
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,530
We were advised by them with a few days notice

151
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,490
that this was in the works.

152
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,389
But of course there was no engagement

153
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,770
or involvement in the political level in this
decision

154
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,729
because we respect the independence

155
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,280
of our judicial processes.”

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,050
Yeah, Canada is not letting her go.

157
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,050
And you know,

158
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,470
as much as I like to make fun of Canada and
Justin Trudeau—

159
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,060
and oh man, I do!—

160
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,360
in this case, I have to say...

161
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,260
TKO Justin Trudeau!

162
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,880
“Justin Trudeau, you did it!

163
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
You’re not the shiny pony, you’re the
stallion!”

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
Let’s just hope he sticks to his...surprisingly
big guns.

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,180
So what’s happening with Meng Wanzhou’s
case now?

166
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,419
Well, in accordance with Canadian law,

167
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,860
she went through a hearing to determine

168
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,030
whether she should be released on bail

169
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,360
due to health concerns while her case is being
decided.

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,330
The judge ended up granting her bail,

171
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,979
which means she won’t have to stay in prison

172
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,550
as her case proceeds.

173
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,080
Meng’s extradition case could last months
or even years,

174
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,449
since under Canadian law,

175
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:43,080
she can appeal an extradition decision

176
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,449
all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court.

177
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,550
Meanwhile, I’m sure that there’s no way
that

178
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,860
the Chinese Communist Party could try to put

179
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,610
more political pressure on Canada to release
Meng.

180
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,229
Like for example,

181
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,330
detaining a former Canadian diplomat in China.

182
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,860
Well, whaddya know.

183
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,639
So what do you think about China’s threats

184
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,000
to punish Canada for not releasing Meng?

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,949
Leave your comments below.

186
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:08,949
And before you go,

187
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,310
it’s time for me to answer a question

188
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,720
from one of you who supports China Uncensored

189
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,219
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

190
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,740
WinniePooh asks,

191
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,900
“Do you think conflict will still exist
between the US and China

192
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,300
if god turns China into a democratic and wealthier
country?

193
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,830
Or is it possible for a democratic country

194
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,180
to become the 2nd most powerful country

195
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,280
which can challenge the US?

196
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,420
Good question.

197
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
Firstly,

198
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,230
turning China into a democratic and wealthy
country....

199
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,440
This is something Chinese people

200
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,530
have to take action on themselves.

201
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,530
And to do that,

202
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,040
they’ll have to bring the Communist Party

203
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,240
and its worst henchmen to justice.

204
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,700
Because China can never have meaningful democracy

205
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,050
under a Party that sits above the rule of
law.

206
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,670
If China does eventually become a country
with democracy,

207
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,780
and rule of law, and wealth,

208
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,320
would we have a conflict?

209
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,360
Well, there might be disagreements.

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,980
It’s normal to not see eye-to-eye

211
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,070
on every issue with every country—

212
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,600
even our allies.

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,840
This is why each leader needs to continuously
forge bonds,

214
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,380
and sometimes re-negotiate treaties.

215
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,450
But it’s pretty rare for democracies

216
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,330
to go to war against other democracies.

217
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,010
So I think that once China ditches the Communist
Party

218
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,060
and establishes rule of law,

219
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,880
it will be on its way to real prosperity,

220
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,620
and will potentially be a long-term ally of
the US.

221
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,020
It’s pretty clear that we’re capable of
being allies

222
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,370
with big countries like India,

223
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,830
wealthy countries like Japan,

224
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,740
and Chinese democracies like Taiwan.

225
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,540
Thanks for your question, WinniePooh.

226
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,320
Wait, you’re not...

227
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,940
Couldn’t be.

228
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,060
And for everyone else,

229
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,060
do you want help us

230
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,100
make more episodes of China Uncensored?

231
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Please support our growth

232
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,620
by pledging a dollar or more per episode.

233
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,120
Go to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,440
The link is below.

235
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,520
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

236
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,140
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

237
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,960
You know, sometimes I feel like I could make an entire
show

238
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,120
of just directly reading Chinese state-run
media out loud.

239
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,380
For example, the recent People’s Daily article.

240
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,220
“To arrest someone without offering a clear
reason

241
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,950
is an undisguised infringement upon

242
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,320
the human rights of that person.

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,340
The Canadian side,

244
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,420
even though there had not been a trial

245
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,400
and determination of guilt,

246
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,030
went entirely against the spirit of the law,

247
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,590
choosing to infer guilt

248
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,370
and placing the person in handcuffs and fetters.

249
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,830
To treat a Chinese citizen like a serious
criminal,

250
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,690
to roughly trample their basic human rights,

251
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,450
and to dishonour their dignity,

252
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,670
how is this the method of a civilised country?

253
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,290
How can this not make people furious?”

254
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,380
Yes, how can a government that tramples

255
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,960
on the basic human rights of Chinese citizens

256
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,060
not make people furious.

257
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,260
Good question, People’s Daily.
