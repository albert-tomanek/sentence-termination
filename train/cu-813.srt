00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,259
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,400
China just stole a US Navy drone, and the
Navy watched it happen.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,740
Which, was better than starting a war.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,080
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,440
On Thursday, China stole an underwater US
research drone

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,480
in the South China Sea.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,070
The USNS Bowditch, an unarmed military research
ship,

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,520
was sailing about 50 miles off the coast of
the Philippines.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,600
They were conducting research with two underwater
drones called ocean gliders.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,430
And the Chinese Navy...simply grabbed one
out of the water.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,740
“The Defense department says

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,780
the Bowditch immediately made contact to ask
for it back,

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,329
but the Chinese ship simply sailed away.

14
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,010
Friday, Pentagon officials asked again.

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,220
Spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters:

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,840
“it is ours and we would like it back.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,970
And we would like this to not happen again.”

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,360
“Hey, you took my drone!”

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,320
“Yeah? What are you going to do about it?!”

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,330
“Give it back! Give it back!”

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,150
According to US officials,

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,970
the Chinese probably thought they were stealing
a spy vehicle.

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,970
It was not.

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,700
U.S. officials say it was a research drone
that was

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,560
“simply measuring ocean conditions.”

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
But you know, “steal” is such a strong
word.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,040
"First, I want to say that we really don't
like this word ‘stolen’

28
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,989
and this word is completely incorrect.

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,800
As state-run media explained,

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,730
they were just trying to find out who the
drone belonged to.

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,240
“In order to prevent the object from endangering
the safety of the ship or people,

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,869
the Chinese rescue vessel took a professional
and responsible approach

33
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,140
and carried out identification checks on the
object.”

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,759
That’s right, they merely discovered it,

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,009
after stalking that US Naval ship,

36
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,840
and wanted to identify whose it was,

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,000
right as the drone was about to dock with
the ship.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,160
I mean, China “highly values peace and stability
in South China Sea.”

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,280
Like when they put weapons on artificial islands
they built in disputed waters.

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,280
But China has now agreed to return America’s
drone—

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,460
presumably after they discovered it wasn’t
that cool after all.

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,700
And that’s the end of the story.

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,020
Except it isn’t.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,560
Because Donald Trump.

45
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,280
Many experts believe this drone-seizure was retaliation for that time two weeks ago,

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,170
when Trump took a phone call from the president of Taiwan.

47
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,390
Or that time one week ago when Trump questioned
the entire One China policy.

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,880
But in fact, this is something the Chinese regime has done before:

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,200
test out America’s new president.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,960
In 2001, just after George W. Bush assumed
office,

51
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,819
two Chinese warplanes made threatening maneuvers
near a US spy plane

52
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,239
flying near China’s Hainan island.

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,280
And then one crashed into it—

54
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,010
killing the Chinese pilot and forcing the
US plane to land in China.

55
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,880
And then in 2009, shortly after Obama took
office,

56
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,890
a group of Chinese navy vessels harassed a
US naval research ship.

57
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,690
But if China was trying to send a message
to Trump, well,

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Honey Badger don’t care.

59
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Trump tweeted,

60
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,560
“We should tell China that we don’t want
the drone they stole back.

61
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
Let them keep it!”

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
Which turns that earlier fight into:

63
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,769
“We stole your drone.

64
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,490
What are you going to do about it?”

65
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,290
“Nothing. Fine. Keep it.”

66
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,720
“Fine then.”

67
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,210
“Fine then.”

68
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,270
Of course, the US probably will still get
the drone back

69
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,070
since it’s not a top secret spy plane.

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,959
And also—as most of us have forgotten already—

71
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,860
Barack Obama is still president.

72
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,379
Anyway, what do you think?

73

74
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,680
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

75

Once again, I’m Chris Chappell, see you
