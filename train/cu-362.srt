1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,320
Abducted in China

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,980
Stranded and helpless

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,700
This is the fate of Americans,

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,120
Britons, Canadians, and Australians

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,160
Who became pawns for the Chinese Communist
Party.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,040
Welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,260
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,890
Canada is feeling the consequences

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,300
of crossing the Chinese Communist Party.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,910
After Canada arrested a Chinese businesswoman

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,010
at the request of the United States,

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,930
for violating sanctions on Iran…

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,620
...China promised retaliation with severe
consequences.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,280
And for starters, they detained two Canadians...

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,660
saying those Canadians had somehow

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,600
“endangered national security.”

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,220
The US State Department may even issue a travel
warning

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,920
to US citizens going to China now...

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,570
just to be safe.

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,570
Because this is a tactic

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,320
the Chinese Communist Party has used before.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,500
And will use again.

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,969
Here are 5 other times Chinese authorities

24
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,260
detained foreign citizens for no good reason.

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Number 5

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,720
In 2015, a group of 20 British, South African,

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,640
and Indian tourists was arrested

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,010
in China’s Inner Mongolia region.

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,530
They were there with a larger tour group

30
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,010
as part of a 47-day sightseeing adventure.

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,460
But little did they know,

32
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,170
one of the sites they would see,

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,450
would be terrorism!

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,680
According to state-run Xinhua,

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,130
the group was arrested for “watching video
clips

36
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,180
that advocate terrorism and religious extremism.”

37
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,810
They spent several days in detention,

38
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,670
and according to state-run media,

39
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,650
admitted their crimes \hand repented.

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,869
Then they were deported.

41
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:37,861
I know, you’re dying to see

42
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:40,020
which extremist video clip they’d watched

43
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,080
that got them into so much trouble.

44
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,100
It was...a BBC documentary.

45
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,210
“The only things watched by myself and the
group

46
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,650
was a short clip of the 10 best Western cowboy
films of all time

47
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,939
and a 40-minute BBC documentary on Genghis
Khan.”

48
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:01,450
Now, this looks like a case where the local
authorities in Ordos

49
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,390
made a Keystone Cops style mistake that

50
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,590
then turned into an international incident

51
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,829
because it’s impossible for the authorities
in China to back down.

52
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:15,919
The tourists said that no one admitted to
or repented anything,

53
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,379
and in the end no charges were brought against
the group.

54
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,529
After being deported back to the UK,

55
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:23,290
one of the tourists called for an apology

56
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,540
from the Chinese Communist Party.

57
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,060
I believe he’s still waiting.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,060
Number 4

59
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,220
If you’re a Chinese citizen,

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,739
and you get on the bad side of the Chinese
Communist Party,

61
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,310
they’ll stop at nothing to get you,

62
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,480
even if that means holding your family hostage.

63
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,430
Even if your family members are American citizens.

64
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,449
Liu Changming is one of China’s most wanted.

65
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:51,450
He used to be the executive at a Chinese state
owned bank.

66
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,430
Until he was accused of playing a part

67
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,590
in a $1.4 billion dollar bank fraud case.

68
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,719
He fled China in 2007.

69
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,829
And so when his estranged wife and two children,

70
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,489
all American citizens, went to China to visit
a sick grandparent,

71
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:09,249
they were captured by Chinese authorities.

72
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:12,559
“[Chinese authorities] moved [the mother]
to a secret site,

73
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,870
commonly known as a black jail.

74
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,079
The children discovered at the airport

75
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,680
that they could not leave China.”

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,840
How could Chinese authorities hold American
citizens without cause?

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,790
Well, they shouldn’t be able to.

78
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,790
For one,

79
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,730
the Chinese government doesn’t recognize
dual citizenship.

80
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,430
So according to Chinese law,

81
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,510
Chinese citizens automatically lose their
citizenship

82
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,680
when they gain citizenship in another country.

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,510
And even more bizarrely,

84
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,919
one of Liu’s kids was born in America,

85
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,400
making him an American citizen from birth.

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,439
Which, according to Chinese law,

87
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,109
means he’s never been a Chinese citizen.

88
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,849
But once Liu Changming’s family were inside
China,

89
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,629
all that went out the window.

90
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,079
Because regardless of the law,

91
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,579
the Chinese Communist Party treats

92
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:03,709
ethnically Chinese people like pandas.

93
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,099
No matter where you were born in the world,

94
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,849
you belong to China.

95
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:12,749
Even if your passport says you’re an American.

96
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,019
Number 3

97
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,120
Here’s the story of another Canadian citizen,

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,530
who also happens to be a panda.

99
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,069
I mean ethnically Chinese.

100
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:21,289
Sun Qian.

101
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,870
She’s a successful businesswoman.

102
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,259
She and her husband co-founded

103
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,189
Beijing Leadman Biochemistry Co.

104
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:31,280
She became a Canadian citizen back in 2007.

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,990
She preferred to live in Canada, not China,

106
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,810
partly because she started practicing Falun
Gong in 2014.

107
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,569
That’s a spiritual practice that’s severely
persecuted in China.

108
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,409
Anyway, Sun found out that

109
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,560
her husband was having extramarital affairs,

110
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,280
and she was planning to divorce him.

111
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,099
So, according to Sun’s family,

112
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,990
when she was visiting China,

113
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,259
her husband called the public security bureau
and told them

114
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,210
his wife was practicing Falun Gong.

115
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,550
Chinese police came and arrested her.

116
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,419
Oh, and tortured her.

117
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:06,820
Sun’s sister said,

118
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,600
“[Sun’s] husband colluded with certain
individuals

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,669
in the public security bureau,

120
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,900
using the policy of suppressing Falun Gong

121
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,340
to bring about Sun’s illegal detention and
prosecution.

122
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,449
In the meantime,

123
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,780
Shen forged Sun’s signature and produced
a fake document,

124
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,240
thereby gaining 2 billion in assets.”

125
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,250
Wow, that’s cold.

126
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,060
Her husband reported on her to the police

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,770
for practicing Falun Gong,

128
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,560
knowing she’d be persecuted—

129
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,759
so he could take her money?

130
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,449
At least she’s probably not so mad about
his affairs anymore.

131
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,370
But look, Sun Qian is a Canadian citizen,

132
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,190
and didn’t actually commit any crimes.

133
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,699
So couldn’t her lawyer have at least gotten
her

134
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,850
deported back to Canada?

135
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,889
Well, she actually lost her lawyer, because,

136
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,870
“Partners in his law firm told him that
if he represents

137
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,830
Ms. Sun or any other Falun Gong case,

138
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,389
they ‘will cancel his contract to continue
working with the firm.’”

139
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,879
That was after the local Justice Bureau put
pressure

140
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,449
on both the law firm and the lawyer.

141
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,639
You know, the Justice Bureau.

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,270
Justice with Chinese Characteristics.

143
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,939
And then they did the same with

144
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,289
the next 10 lawyers Sun’s family tried to
hire.

145
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,889
The latest update on Sun’s case comes from
the Globe and Mail.

146
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,330
Sun has pled guilty,

147
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,680
but most likely under torture.

148
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,919
What’s really sad is how little the Canadian
government has done.

149
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,870
Sun has been held for almost two years.

150
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,720
Last year, when asked about Sun’s case,

151
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,550
all Canada’s ambassador to China

152
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,490
John McCallum had to say was,

153
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,249
“That doesn't always help, for the person
in detention,

154
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,120
If we broadcast their situation in public,

155
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,659
so I think for those cases,

156
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,719
almost all the time,

157
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:50,509
it is better to proceed in a low-profile way.”

158
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,669
You know, not high profile enough that it
would stop torture.

159
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,050
Number 2

160
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,889
What happens when you’re one of the world’s

161
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,729
biggest mining companies,

162
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,520
and you decide to renege on a deal with China?

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
Let’s just say,

164
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,999
you don’t want to have your people inside
China.

165
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,279
In 2009, Stern Hu,

166
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,810
an Australian citizen and General Manager
of Rio Tinto

167
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,650
was abducted by Chinese authorities

168
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,110
and charged with stealing state secrets.

169
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,349
The charge was later downgraded to bribery

170
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,490
and stealing commercial secrets.

171
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,099
I’m sure had nothing to do with Rio Tinto’s
decision

172
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:33,330
the month before “to scrap a planned $19.5
billion investment

173
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,759
in the mining company by Chinalco,

174
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,979
a state-owned Chinese company.”

175
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,789
A later Businessweek investigation

176
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,150
also exposed the fact that the Chinese regime

177
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,659
was hacking Rio Tinto at the time,

178
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,129
and that the arrest of Rio Tinto’s employees

179
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:49,370
may have been linked to the company’s attempts

180
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,219
to change their iron ore prices.

181
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,590
Stern Hu was another good target.

182
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,159
Because even though he held Australian citizenship,

183
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,199
he was born in China.

184
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,199
In the end,

185
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,449
Rio Tinto basically threw him under the bus,

186
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,199
and the Australian government also

187
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,180
didn’t really do anything to intervene.

188
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,990
But don’t worry,

189
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,330
Stern Hu was released only nine years later,

190
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,199
just this summer actually.

191
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,600
He was released two years early because of
good behavior.

192
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,949
Clearly this case was handled well.

193
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,159
And now,

194
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,599
Number 1

195
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,029
One thing you might be wondering about is
what is it like

196
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:29,439
for foreign citizens being detained by the
Chinese regime?

197
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,520
Well, here’s Peter Humphrey from the UK

198
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,390
to describe it in his own words.

199
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,310
From the very first moment you’re dropped
into a cell,

200
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,130
you’re there to be crushed,

201
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,060
you’re there to have your spirit broken.

202
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,860
During the 700 days I was in captivity,

203
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,630
I never slept with the lights off.

204
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,200
I sometimes think I never slept at all.

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,260
He, and his wife were abducted in 2013

206
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,529
and charged with “illegally acquiring personal
information”

207
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,290
about Chinese nationals.

208
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,640
Actually, he and his wife were fraud investigators.

209
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,220
“Humphrey, a former Reuters journalist,

210
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,600
and his wife were hired by pharmaceutical
giant GlaxoSmithKline

211
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,850
to conduct the company’s internal probe
in January 2013.”

212
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,480
The Chinese authorities liked to play

213
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,760
fun mind games with Humphrey and his wife

214
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,670
while they were in detention.

215
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,320
For instance, right before their trial,

216
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,490
police told him his wife’s brother had died.

217
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,090
So when Humphrey sees his wife for the first
time in ages,

218
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,630
at the start of the trial,

219
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,980
he offered his condolences.

220
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,740
“And I expressed my condolences to her,

221
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,060
believing that she knew.

222
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,660
And she didn’t.

223
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,710
They had lied to me.

224
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,500
So Ying broke down.”

225
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,020
Those police are such tricksters.

226
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,269
Humphrey was released in 2015.

227
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,970
And now he’s in a battle to get Chinese
state-run

228
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,090
CCTV’s license revoked in the UK.

229
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,310
That’s because they had broadcast

230
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,880
his forced television confession in the UK.

231
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,610
The one where he was forced to sit in a small
metal cage

232
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,110
and police read out his confession,

233
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,070
the one police had written for him.

234
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,070
Now this was just a small selection among
many,

235
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,740
many cases of the Chinese regime abducting
foreign citizens.

236
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,980
In most cases, their home countries could
do nothing.

237
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,720
In other cases, their home countries chose
to do nothing

238
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,460
for political reasons.

239
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,970
So what do you think?

240
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,760
Leave your comments below.

241
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,400
And now it’s the time you’ve all been
waiting for,

242
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,930
when I answer questions from a member of my
50-Cent Army,

243
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,190
fans who support China Uncensored

244
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,100
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

245
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,930
Rodney Lee Hall asks,

246
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,350
“Chris, do you think we will go to war with
China?

247
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,180
If so, any thoughts on when or the casus belli?

248
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,540
Ah, the million dollar question.

249
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,709
In a way, the US and China are already at
war.

250
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,230
In 1999, two Chinese army colonels published
a book

251
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,279
called “Unrestricted Warfare,”

252
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,670
on how a country like China,

253
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,440
that couldn’t challenge the US military,

254
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,150
could win an unconventional war with unconventional
tactics.

255
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,449
This 2014 report from the US Army Special
Operations Command

256
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:23,040
details just a few of those warfare tactics
they’re already using

257
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,889
But actual troop on troop action,

258
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:27,230
right now, and for many years to come,

259
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,880
would be an embarrassing loss for the Chinese
military.

260
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,529
Hopefully, by the time the Chinese military

261
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,560
is on par with the US,

262
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,620
the Chinese Communist Party will no longer
rule China.

263
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,850
But, only time will tell.

264
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,389
Thanks for your question.

265
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:44,230
