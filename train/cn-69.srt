00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
...in front of me I have an article from Wikipedia, and these folks can't see it.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,600
Every fact they get right is a point
and a... [thump] ding?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,800
A point and a massive thud on the table!

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
You've forgotten the button again!

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Oh. Button's in my bag. Balls.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Button's in your ballbag...? Ha!

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
I need to get my button. I'm sorry.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Blimey.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,360
As you can see, viewers, it's started well.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,360
I hope this stays in(!)

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Tom's gone to get his button out of his... his sack.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,939
So I'd like to welcome you to after the credits.

13
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,859
Shut the door and lock it. We win!

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,379
-- By default!
-- It's our show now.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,080
Such cheating!

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,400
By the way, to everyone --
this is never going to get in it --

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
No, I can't ****ing see his screen!

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,760
'Cos that would defeat the whole object!

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,120
I can't see it 'cos it's over the back. He can see it, but he's blind in the left eye.

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,789
Have you ever tried to look at the side of an LCD screen?

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,789
You can't see anything!

22
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,059
Besides, all he has on there is high-class Dutch pornography

23
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,059
until he looks at it to tell us what the article is anyway(!)

24
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:01,619
*High* class?

25
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,619
Have you ever seen both his hands above the table in any of these episodes?

26
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,199
I think not.

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,760
Are we just starting again, then?

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,549
No, no, we'll cut something together from that, I think.
