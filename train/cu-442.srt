1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,740
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,299
a very controversial and sensitive topic.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,900
Good thing I can say whatever I...

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,680
No!

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,440
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,000
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,860
Well gang,

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,960
we’re in trouble.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,940
You may have heard about how YouTube

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,610
has rolled out some extremely vague,

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,850
nondescript guidelines

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,250
for what topics are “advertiser-friendly
content.”

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,420
And YouTube says

14
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,040
that if I don’t create

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,880
“advertiser-friendly content,”

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,320
they won’t place ads in my episodes.

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,830
In fact,

18
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,800
YouTube has been taking away ads

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,030
across the board

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,850
for thousands of YouTube creators.

21
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,210
If a video violates their vague prohibitions,

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,510
YouTube removes the ads before and during
the video.

23
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,010
Great!

24
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,570
No ads!

25
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,620
Except that’s how everyone supports their
shows.

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,460
Without advertising revenue,

27
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,760
shows like China Uncensored wouldn’t exist.

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,810
This story first broke last Wednesday

29
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,690
when big-time YouTuber Philip Defranco

30
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,159
called them out on it.

31
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,420
By taking away monetization it’s a form
of censorship.

32
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,450
Why censorship?

33
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,210
Because those ads are the main way

34
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,250
we supports ourselves at China Uncensored.

35
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,930
That's how we can create episodes for you

36
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,710
three times a week.

37
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,890
So what’s not “advertiser-friendly content”?

38
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,620
According to YouTube’s guidelines,

39
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,620
it includes

40
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,970
“controversial or sensitive subjects”

41
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,890
including “subjects related to war”

42
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,420
or “political conflicts.”

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,520
That’s why I’ve been getting emails like
this.

44
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,410
Hmmm…

45
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,020
Maybe YouTube prefers I

46
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,150
praise China’s economic development?

47
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,840
Or maybe I should just cover food festivals?

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,820
Ok,

49
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,920
maybe not all food festivals…

50
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,920
Now YouTube has responded to the outrage

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,310
from Youtube creators and fans

52
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,540
by saying this is not a new policy.

53
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,400
They’ve just implemented a new policy

54
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,049
that lets you know they’ve stripped your
revenue away

55
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,349
by sending you an email.

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,280
YouTube didn’t change their policy?

57
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,450
They used to take your money away without
telling you?

58
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,030
Isn’t that even worse?

59
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,400
But actually,

60
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:12,079
this is new to me.

61
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,179
This month marks China Uncensored’s

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,700
4-year anniversary on YouTube.

63
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,200
And until last month,

64
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,439
not once has a video of mine

65
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,129
had its ads stripped away like this.

66
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:25,629
But in the past week and a half,

67
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,129
six of my videos have been flagged,

68
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,519
costing the show potentially thousands of
dollars

69
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,849
in revenue.

70
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,849
And guess what?

71
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,009
I only got emails about two of them.

72
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,420
YouTube is still not properly notifying me.

73
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,829
Now technically,

74
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,069
this isn’t censorship.

75
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,939
YouTube still keeps the videos online.

76
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,519
But it’s ad-censorship.

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,940
Because without ads,

78
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,309
this show can’t survive.

79
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:55,480
And doesn’t this ad-censorship incentivize
all YouTube creators

80
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,160
to avoid sensitive and controversial topics?

81
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,040
Hmmm...

82
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:01,309
I wonder if this has anything to do with Google

83
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,639
trying to get back into China...

84
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,339
Okay,

85
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,000
probably not.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,499
Maybe…

87
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,499
But meanwhile,

88
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:10,940
the Chinese regime invests an estimated

89
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,779
10 billion dollars a year

90
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,779
in what they call

91
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,500
“external publicity work.”

92
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,100
That is,

93
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,280
spreading its propaganda message to the West.

94
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,419
The Communist Party has a giant billboard
in Times Square,

95
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,480
broadcasting Chinese propaganda 24/7,

96
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,909
365 days a year

97
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,310
since 2011.

98
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,200
They place their propaganda in newspapers

99
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,219
like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.

100
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:37,719
Yes,

101
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,980
China Watch is a paid insert

102
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,120
in respectable Western newspapers.

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,749
State-run CCTV gives its propaganda news feed

104
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:49,299
to all the major US TV networks,

105
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:49,819
telling them

106
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,020
“here’s the latest China news, for free!”

107
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:56,719
They even created an English language version
of CCTV

108
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,180
and put its headquarters

109
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,040
seven blocks from the White House.

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,349
The Communist Party even buys airtime on American
radio stations

111
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,010
without disclosing it.

112
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,580
That’s why I created China Uncensored -

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,879
to cut through all that and deliver truthful,

114
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,239
uncensored information about China,

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,579
and how it affects you.

116
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,579
But now,

117
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,410
YouTube is cutting off ad revenue

118
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,950
on controversial topics.

119
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,640
I’m not exaggerating when I say

120
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,130
this could kill China Uncensored.

121
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,980
Without income,

122
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
I’ll have to stop doing the show for you.

123
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,720
And my YouTube revenue has plummeted

124
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
in the last few weeks.

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Unbelievably,

126
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,140
it’s less than it was a year ago,

127
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,310
when I had only 120,000 subscribers

128
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,340
and half as many staff to support.

129
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,030
And another challenge is this:

130
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,680
Even on my videos that YouTube doesn’t ad-censor,

131
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,300
I’ve been losing a lot of revenue.

132
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,820
For a typical episode I publish,

133
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,110
about 30,000 of you use ad blockers.

134
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,980
Look,

135
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,540
I get it.

136
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,580
YouTube ads can be annoying.

137
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,650
But it’s how YouTubers like me

138
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,520
can afford to make content for you.

139
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,500
But there is a way you can help keep this
show going.

140
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,640
Support China Uncensored on Patreon.

141
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
Patreon is a website that lets people like
you

142
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,280
directly support your favorite creators on
YouTube.

143
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,580
Sort of like how during the European Renaissance,

144
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,320
patrons would provide financial support to
artists

145
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,630
so they could focus on their craft.

146
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,910
I started working with Patreon a year ago,

147
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,550
and the extra income has allowed me to do
things like:

148
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,260
Hire Zach, our researcher;

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,180
hire Seamus, our video editor,

150
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,650
so I could make more episodes every week;

151
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,880
travel to South Korea,

152
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
hold fan events,

153
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,310
buy costumes and props,

154
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,550
and much more.

155
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,550
But so far,

156
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,630
Patreon has only been a third of our revenue.

157
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,240
YouTube ads have been the majority.

158
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,940
Until now, I’m afraid.

159
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,380
So your Patreon support is more crucial than
ever before.

160
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,600
If you’re already one of my Patreon supporters,

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
thank you so much!

162
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,480
You’ve been a huge help so far,

163
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,090
and I hope you’ll continue.

164
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,200
And if you can afford it,

165
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
please consider expanding your monthly limit,

166
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,740
And if you aren’t a Patreon supporter yet,

167
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:01,420
please become a supporter now.

168
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,970
Sign-up is super easy;

169
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,910
it takes less than five minutes.

170
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,570
The link is below.

171
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,360
And to commemorate our challenges with YouTube,

172
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,630
I’ve created a new support level:

173
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,360
China Uncensored Uncensorer!

174
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,860
That official title will be yours,

175
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,960
to all of you who contributes 5 cents or more
per episode.

176
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,080
Because if all 30,000 of you who use ad blockers

177
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,140
contribute even 5 cents per episode,

178
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,950
you can make up for it in a big way.

179
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,500
Our most popular level of support,

180
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
of course,

181
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
is 50 cents -

182
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,270
where you can become an official member

183
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,020
of my 50-Cent Army.

184
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,000
I’ll also give you some cool wallpaper to
download

185
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,100
Check out the even cooler rewards

186
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,210
like music downloads

187
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,610
for people who contribute more.

188
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,610
Now recently,

189
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,500
I asked a few hundred of you in my Market
Research Team

190
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,480
what you’d like to see from me.

191
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,780
And the most common request was:

192
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,400
Behind-the-scenes stuff.

193
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,340
So,

194
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,460
wish granted.

195
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,480
Starting now,

196
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,500
for everyone who supports China Uncensored
on Patreon,

197
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,900
I’ll start posting behind-the-scenes stuff

198
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,240
that only you get access to.

199
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,639
Because your support will keep China Uncensored
uncensored.

200
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,199
So please,

201
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,639
share this video.

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,389
Get the word out there that YouTube is censoring
creators

203
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,860
by not placing ads on controversial videos.

204
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,360
And again,

205
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,200
please support the show on Patreon if you can.

206
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,390
The link is below.

207
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,680
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

208
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,440
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.

209
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,420
And one more thing:

210
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,400
China Uncensored has never had ads,

211
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,500
except the ones YouTube places automatically,

212
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,740
haha less so now.

213
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
The only exception was Mania,

214
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,720
the South Korean tailor who gave me suits
and ties earlier this year

215
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,750
in exchange for making that ad -

216
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,420
the kind of ad that goes here,

217
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,760
in what we call the “end card.”

218
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,320
I take the integrity of this show very seriously

219
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,750
and have been reluctant to have

220
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,210
product sponsors for the show,

221
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,880
even though that’s extremely common on YouTube,

222
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,660
and advertisers have been reaching out to
me for a long time.

223
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,760
Now I see that if China Uncensored is to continue,

224
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,850
I’m also going to need to do this.

225
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,890
But I just want you to know

226
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,980
that if you ever see me promoting a product,

227
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,640
it will be something I personally approve.

228
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,920
And never will any advertiser control the
content of the show.

229
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
China Uncensored is

230
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
and will remain

231
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,020
independent and uncensored.
