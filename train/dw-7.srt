00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:08,009
There are a lot of misconceptions out there and this a video about one of the most common ones.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:15,000
So I went around asking people 'what makes the Moon go around the Earth?'  and they told me..

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:22,619
The Earth puts a gravitational force on the moon
But does the moon put a gravitational pull on the Earth?

4
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:32,039
Pull on the Earth yes. It does hence we have tides ETc the moon falls on the earth, [too] it affects like the tides and

5
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,010
women and yes

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,440
It [does] very powerful

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,775
does the moon pull on the Earth

8
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:40,680
probably that as well

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,440
Yeah

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,760
So what I want to know is

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,190
How does that force that the moon exerts on the Earth how does that compare in terms of size?

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,380
To the Force the Earth exerts on the moon

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,960
Well...

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,879
No scientist, but I think that one would be more powerful than that one

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,309
It's got a greater force coming from the Earth because it's greater mass is the Earth has more

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,189
Mass [cuz] it's a bigger mess. I thought greater mass is more [equals] more force [guys]

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,689
Does the moon pull on the earth?

18
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,908
Yes

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,229
But a lot less

20
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:09,840
Yeah, not as much as the Earth pulls on the moon.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,180
Yeah

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,538
Yeah, but a little bit

23
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:13,038
not [very] strongly.

24
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:14,020
Yes

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,960
But much much much much smaller because if it's mass [less], [not] size

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,560
Because it's smaller. It's much smaller than [that] than the Earth

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,779
because it's smaller. This is small

28
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,508
Allow me to let you in on a little secret

29
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,390
Everyone got it wrong

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,009
The Force that attracts the moon to the Earth is exactly the same size as the force that attracts the Earth to the moon

31
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,789
So what's going on here? Why did everyone get it wrong?

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,820
Well, I think it comes down to cause and effect

33
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,779
The effect of the force on the moon is quite clear the moon goes in circles around the Earth

34
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,079
but the effect of that force on the Earth is

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
basically negligible; the Earth

36
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,169
barely wobbles at all So people interpret this

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,729
Negligible effect as

38
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,419
Indicating there's very little force affecting the Earth

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,059
But that is forgetting the third key piece of the puzzle which is inertia

40
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,660
Inertia is the tendency of Mass to Maintain State of motion

41
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,170
Since the Earth has a greater, mass

42
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,759
It has a greater, inertia and so even with the same amount of force on it

43
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,490
It doesn't accelerate that much now the funny thing [is] many of the [people] I interviewed

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,330
Could state Newton's third law which is every [force] has not equal and opposite reaction

45
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,420
Something about Newton's law doesn't seem to fit into that

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
[just] yet. You're good at this wait

47
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,799
Which Newton's law are we talking about the whole equal and opposite force thing?

48
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,849
Yeah, that one. So tell me what you're thinking man [ah] well

49
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,680
Did one would think that if you're into putting a force on me I would be putting an equal Force upon it

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,740
So why didn't they apply it to this problem?

51
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,330
Well, I think they may have memorized the words, but not really [believed] Newton's third law in their core

52
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,420
Did they really feel it in their spleen [I]?

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,180
Don't think they did so

54
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,739
Allow me to try to convince you, all of you spleen included, that Newton's third law really is true

55
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,199
Let's consider two objects

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,369
Initially they have the same Mass 1 kilogram each

57
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:33,849
So obviously the gravitational force of attraction must be the same on both of the objects

58
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,799
Now let's add a second kilogram to the first object

59
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,030
The Force on the second object will now be twice as great because that 1 kilogram is attracted

60
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,660
equally to each of the kilograms in the first object

61
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,799
But what is often forgotten is that new kilogram is

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,530
also

63
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:02,380
attracted to the second object meaning that the total force on each object is still the same they're attracted to each other with an

64
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
equal and opposite Force

65
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,240
We could add a third kilogram

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,380
And we would find the same thing the force on both objects is still the same

67
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,730
Even though the object on the left has [3] times the mass of the object on the right?

68
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:23,799
So we can see that no matter what the mass, any two objects will have the same gravitational force towards each other.

69
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:32,809
Can you feel Newton's third law in your spleen now? It should settle inside you and become a part of you
