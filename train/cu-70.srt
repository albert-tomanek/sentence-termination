1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,770
How big a threat is China?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,820
That’s the question on people’s minds
in Taiwan...

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,900
As they vote for their new leaders.

4
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:14,780
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:15,789
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:21,260
I’m in Taipei, the capital of the country/region
of Taiwan.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,960
Three days from now,

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,609
Taiwan will vote for its new president and
legislature.

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,940
There are election banners everywhere,

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,910
and you can feel the excitement in the air.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,239
One candidate even gave me a bar of soap.

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,270
I guess he’s really trying to clean up politics.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,899
But there’s still one messy issue that’s
on every voter’s mind: China.

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,940
I sat down with Taiwan politics expert Lev
Nachman to find out more.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,940
Thanks for joining me.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,110
Thanks so much for having me.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,059
So the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to
take over Taiwan

18
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,629
with military force if necessary.

19
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:59,750
How does that looming shadow sort of affect
Taiwanese politics?

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,269
So in Taiwan, when we think about a left-right
spectrum

21
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,460
in the way that we think left-right in say
America, it's very different here.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,420
So in America, we think more along the lines
of tax,

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,520
wealth redistribution, welfare, even social
issues

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
like how you feel about things like same sex
marriage, et cetera.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,770
In Taiwan, left-right is instead defined by
independence versus unification.

26
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,020
So how Taiwanese people feel about whether
Taiwan ought to become

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,610
more sovereign and maybe its own independent
state or less sovereign

28
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,619
and slowly create ties and become a part of
the PRC.

29
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,509
So for Americans who don't really know Taiwanese
politics,

30
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,189
what are the main parties and what are their
views?

31
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,969
So the two biggest parties in Taiwan

32
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:46,870
are the Democratic Progressive Party,

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,280
the DPP and the Chinese Nationalist Party,
the KMT.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,900
Now, Taiwan was under martial law for 37 years.

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,740
During that time that came, the KMT was the
only party in Taiwan.

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,310
It controlled all aspects of life and other
parties were illegal.

37
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,289
But through a very long struggle of democratization,

38
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,460
eventually a group was able to actually consolidate

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,320
their kind of pro-democracy,

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,730
[inaudible] KMT political circles and form

41
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,540
what is now known as the DPP,

42
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,620
the Democratic Progressive Party.

43
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,230
Now the DPP is vaguely pro-Taiwan sovereignty.

44
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,420
A lot of people described the DPP as a pro-independence
party,

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,810
but in fact the DPP has not been pro-independence
for quite some time,

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,060
especially since around the year 2000 the
DPP

47
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,450
has been adamantly pro status quo.

48
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,731
So which is actually why the current president
Tsai Ing-wen

49
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,210
was so controversial,

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,000
because she was pushing it further than the
status quo.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,020
No, she actually is explicitly pro status
quo

52
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,730
and a lot of deeper green Taiwanese political
parties don't like her

53
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,390
because she's so pro status quo.

54
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,490
But I thought she wasn't,

55
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,910
she wasn't using the one China policy in speeches.

56
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,520
And I thought that got people's-

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,260
No, that doesn't really have a big impact
on

58
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,970
whether or not they're pro status quo or not.

59
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,890
So pro status quo means that they don't want

60
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,510
to change how things are now.

61
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,750
Okay.

62
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,950
Now whether or not she endorses the '92 consensus,

63
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,980
China's one China versus the America's one
China,

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,550
these are kind of separate issues from whether
or not

65
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,200
she's actually pushing any sort of actual
change, which she hasn't.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,130
She even just this last week has had to actually
emphasized to the T

67
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:39,590
that she is a ROC leader, specifically inciting
[inaudible]

68
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:48,540
as not any sort of pro-Taiwan independence
leaning anything,

69
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,610
which is why when a lot of people say that
Tsai Ing-wen herself

70
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,950
is pro-independence, it's just kind of not
true,

71
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,640
because nothing about her speech or the policy
she's pushes

72
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,440
is really indicative that she's pro-independence.

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,730
She's just very pro status quo and that's
not a good thing or a bad thing.

74
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,790
It's just more of a reflection

75
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,690
of how she actually falls within Taiwan's
spectrum.

76
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,720
Now the KMT falls on the more pro-unification
side.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,200
Now, of course, the KMT doesn't just say we're
pro-unification.

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,090
Instead, what they do is their strategy

79
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,790
is to try to sell closer ties with China

80
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,290
to the Taiwanese public.

81
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,760
So a lot of their strategy is saying

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,620
we can become a more successful Taiwan

83
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,010
if we increase our ties with China.

84
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,040
And of course, they rely on a lot of much
more

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,850
kind of essentialist cultural traits

86
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,450
by saying we were both speak Chinese,

87
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,940
we both come from the same ancestors,

88
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,990
therefore we should align with them.

89
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,530
But for a lot of people in Taiwan,

90
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,430
those kinds of appeals don't work anymore,

91
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,190
because Taiwan has politically and culturally
developed

92
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,440
so separately from the PRC for a very, very
long time.

93
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,950
So what is the feeling in Taiwan with this
sort of independence

94
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,450
or unification stance?

95
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,690
Because I would think a lot of...

96
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,740
I don't understand why there’d be people
talking about unification.

97
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,170
So an important, and this gets very complicated,

98
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,620
so within these camps of independence unification,

99
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,870
there is no black and white.

100
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,260
One thing is independence and one thing is
unification.

101
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,170
So within the independence camp,

102
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,570
what independence means is hotly contested.

103
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,570
Okay.

104
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,680
Within the unification camp,

105
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
what unification means is also contested.

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,940
So when we ask these kinds of survey questions,

107
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,900
are you pro-independence or pro-unification?

108
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,980
If that's all the question asked, that's not
a very good question.

109
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,440
What's a better question is, should Taiwan
pursue more independence

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,480
if there is no chance of war with the PRC?

111
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,010
Because when you ask that question, independence
goes up,

112
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,010
are you pro-independence?

113
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,180
If war with the PRC is likely, then it goes
down.

114
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,110
Are you pro-unification if all of China were
to democratize?

115
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,520
Now, it might seem overstated, but if,

116
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,070
if you're okay with unification if China's
also democratic

117
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,580
and those numbers also change.

118
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,220
So one of the ways the Chinese Communist Party

119
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,420
has presented a possible unification scenario

120
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,680
is the one country, two systems.

121
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,770
Sorry all they have in Hong Kong, which is
going very well.

122
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,050
But so a lot of people have been saying since
people in Taiwan,

123
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,389
I've seen how that has gone down in Hong Kong

124
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,910
that's had a big influence in Taiwanese politics.

125
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,650
Do you think there might be something else
going on?

126
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,650
What's going on?

127
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,510
So the way that Hong Kong has impacted Taiwan's
election,

128
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,430
it most certainly has had an impact,

129
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,270
but it has by no means really defined this
election

130
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,300
the way that many people might think.

131
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,800
So what Hong Kong presents to Taiwan is kind
of the same issue

132
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,660
that Taiwan always talks about.

133
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,150
So in Taiwan, every election, the issue of
independence,

134
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,900
unification is the most important political
issue.

135
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,020
That's what people vote on.

136
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,230
That's how people evaluate their candidates
and evaluate their parties.

137
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:02,770
So in a world where the Hong Kong protests
never occurred,

138
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,300
Taiwan would still be talking about unification,

139
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,170
independence, sovereignty, one country, two
systems just as much.

140
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,840
But what Hong Kong does offer to Taiwan is

141
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,740
a very tangible way of looking at unification.

142
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,740
So we always think about unification, one
country, two systems

143
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,080
in this very abstract way.

144
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,840
And what Hong Kong gives Taiwan is a very
concrete way

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,550
to say that's unification and that's why we
shouldn't be for it.

146
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,120
Now, that appeal is very powerful, but for
green voters.

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,540
Meaning green, meaning pro-DPP pro-Taiwan
sovereignty voters.

148
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,639
So if you're pro-KMT or you're pro-China,

149
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,150
Hong Kong probably isn't going to have that
big of an effect

150
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,070
on how you're going to vote.

151
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,460
Really when the DPP uses Hong Kong

152
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,980
within their rhetorical strategy,

153
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,650
it's a matter of appealing to young people,

154
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,130
but it's also a matter of trying to get their
base of support

155
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,110
to go out to vote, more than it is trying
to convince,

156
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,590
say moderate or pan-Blue voters to instead
vote for them.

157
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,900
So how are these elections different than
the elections

158
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,990
several years ago in 2016?

159
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,740
So a number of big differences.

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,150
So the 2014 Sunflower Movement created this
very dynamic moment

161
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,169
in Taiwanese contemporary history

162
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:23,010
in which a lot of new political parties

163
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,070
formed out of social activism,

164
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,740
formed and entered formal politics in 2016,

165
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,199
in the last election.

166
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,760
In 2016, there was a lot of hype around these

167
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,419
new young progressive pro-Taiwan parties.

168
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,800
Because of the Sunflower Movement

169
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,010
and eight years of a very unsuccessful Ma
Ying-jeou term president,

170
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,800
presidential term.

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,440
The kind of sentiment towards the KMT was
at an all time low,

172
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,440
meaning that people were not excited to vote
for the KMT in the last election.

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,090
And if you look at the results the KMT lost
heart,

174
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,750
the DPP won overwhelmingly.

175
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,010
A lot of these smaller parties had that space
to grow in the last election,

176
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,010
because people were so confident that the
DPP was going to win.

177
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,550
A lot of voters voted for smaller parties
instead.

178
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,580
Four years later, we have the rise of Han
Kuo-yu.

179
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,760
We have the KMT actually regaining a lot of
their popularity.

180
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,050
They're not nearly as unpopular this year
as they were four years ago

181
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,529
and a lot of this kind of common hype around
progressive Taiwanese parties

182
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,580
is just not there and the way that it was
four years ago.

183
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,529
Part of that is due to how these smaller parties
have performed.

184
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,520
But a larger part is how the DPP has performed
the last four years.

185
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,380
So the DPP has had a majority in Taiwan's
legislature,

186
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,880
they've had the presidency,

187
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,000
but a lot of their policies have kind of been
very lukewarm.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,170
People aren't really excited about

189
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,850
how they've performed the last four years

190
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,080
and that's hurt their popularity.

191
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,050
So this year people are kind of just much
more scared that the KMT

192
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,610
will actually do well.

193
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,750
And four years ago people kind of knew they
weren't going to do well,

194
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,460
which kind of creates this bigger sense of
dread

195
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,839
around the future of Taiwanese politics.

196
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,760
There's a very popular phrase in Mandarin

197
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,290
that's been going around called "Wang guo
gan", meaning,

198
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,680
and I think the formal English translation
was like a sense of doom,

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,430
of impending doom about the country.

200
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,880
But that's kind of how a lot of young people

201
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,290
have felt about this upcoming election,

202
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,710
because of the KMT's kind of a return to popularity.

203
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,970
Well, so what's making people go back to the
KMT?

204
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,390
So in 2016, the KMT ran a very bad campaign.

205
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,910
So the best example is that

206
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,710
they switched out their presidential candidate

207
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,380
two months before the election.

208
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,880
That's bad.

209
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,430
That was bad, because it showed one

210
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,960
a total lack of support in their candidate.

211
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,560
It kind of seemed that they were kind of throwing
in the towel

212
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,780
two months early.

213
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,990
They switched as a kind of a hail Mary way
to kind of

214
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,340
consolidate support within the party.

215
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,860
Not only that, but Ma Ying-jeou was not a
particularly

216
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,660
strong president in his later years

217
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,690
that a lot of people were just generally unhappy
with the KMT.

218
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,740
So a lot of people either didn't vote last...

219
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,350
A lot of KMT supporters here, they didn't
vote last election

220
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,890
or they voted for the DPP instead.

221
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,580
And a lot of that kind of common sentiment
just isn't around anymore.

222
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,690
Meanwhile, a lot of KMT voters have really
mobilized

223
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,740
and rallied around Han Kuo-yu in a way that
I think

224
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,149
we didn't necessarily expect in the last year.

225
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:43,180
But the KMT is also, when a party is an opposition,

226
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,540
it's easier for them to regain their support.

227
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,339
Parties that are in power almost overwhelmingly

228
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,980
will be more criticized and have lower levels
of support

229
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,720
than when they were in opposition.

230
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,170
So it was also just kind of a natural rebalancing.

231
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,980
So when the KMT was in power, they were unpopular,

232
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,060
when they're in opposition, their popularity
comes back up.

233
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
Yeah.

234
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Well I know in this election,

235
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,339
it seems to me China is the key issue in a
lot of this.

236
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,670
But it seems this year I guess,

237
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,800
you would call it the kind of pro-Beijing
KMT

238
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,770
has been focusing on calling Tsai Ing-wen
gay.

239
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,459
Now I'm just a simple American,

240
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,149
but I probably don't understand Taiwanese
politics.

241
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,800
But why is that?

242
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,890
So it's important to note that

243
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,180
a lot of anti-same-sex sentiment within Taiwan

244
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,100
does not neatly map onto this pro-unification,

245
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,089
pro-independent spectrum.

246
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,459
And this is the difference between the American
left and right.

247
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,459
Exactly.

248
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,350
So although the KMT tends to be more anti-same-sex
equality than the DPP,

249
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,770
a lot of the DPP is actually very against
same-sex marriage.

250
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,770
In fact, one of the most adamant

251
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:58,430
anti-same-sex marriage groups is our deep
green.

252
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,700
In a lot of anti-Tsai Ing-wen rhetoric

253
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,150
that's come out from Taiwanese groups

254
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,450
actually comes from deep green groups, not
from the KMT.

255
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:12,649
So you might also be familiar with the Tsai
Ing-wen PhD scandal.

256
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,279
There's a very big push to try to say that
Tsai Ing-wen's PhD

257
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,550
was fake and that she never actually graduated

258
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,760
from the London School of Economics.

259
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,990
Now the London School of Economics,

260
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,410
he wrote a letter saying,

261
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,370
"No, her PhD is real,"

262
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,000
but there's this massive conspiracy theory
within Taiwan that it's all fake.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wow.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,200
And this did not come from the KMT.

265
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
This came from deep green parties who do not
like Tsai Ing-wen

266
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,930
and do not want her to be leading the DPP.

267
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,930
Wow. [inaudible]

268
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,600
Well, so clearly China wants something out
of this election in Taiwan.

269
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,130
What is that and how are they going to go
about getting it?

270
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,540
So there's something very interesting about
this election,

271
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,220
unlike previous elections as well, is the
role that CCP has played.

272
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,000
So typically the CCP will in a very politically
correct for the PRC kind of way,

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
tacitly endorse whoever the KMT is running.

274
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,430
They have not done that with Han Kuo-yu.

275
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,130
Now this says a couple of things.

276
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,100
Either they don't have a lot of faith in Han
Kuo-yu,

277
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,990
which I think is partially true.

278
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,660
Han has shown that he's very difficult to
control for the KMT

279
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,610
and that the PRC might see that and say,

280
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,330
"Well, we're not really sure we want to throw
our cards behind this guy."

281
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,230
At the same time, the PRC doesn't really need
to formally

282
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,660
say anything about the KMT nearly as much
anymore,

283
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,160
because they found so many other avenues

284
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,220
with which to disrupt Taiwan's democratic
practices.

285
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:39,220
So we've seen a lot of stories about disinformation
campaigns

286
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,310
coming from the PRC,

287
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,100
fake news being started and pushed by farms
in the PRC.

288
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,970
And a lot of these reports show that the PRC
is actually using

289
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,630
a number of different strategies to try to
influence Taiwan's democracy

290
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,500
rather than just saying we support whoever
the KMT is running.

291
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,560
And what should we be looking for in the election
results?

292
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,040
So when we think about this, suppose that
rise of populism in Taiwan.

293
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,010
As of now according to polls and polling data
is of course just poll.

294
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,920
So election, it could be very different.

295
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,000
It seems like Tsai Ing-wen is going to win.

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,360
But it's not just a matter of whether or not
she wins.

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,130
We should pay attention to how much Han Kuo-yu
loses by.

298
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,900
Because if Han Kuo-yu only loses by like 5%

299
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,040
then that sort of signals that his populist
appeal

300
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,529
was still very successful and that the odds
of him

301
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,490
just kind of disappearing to the sideline
are not very likely.

302
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,360
He's probably going to try to consolidate
his support after the election,

303
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,160
even if it's a small loss.

304
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,150
Now, if he loses by a lot, well then maybe
his populous appeal

305
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,660
wasn't as strong as we thought it was and
maybe Taiwan

306
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,670
may be one of the few democracies to overcome
this challenge of populism.

307
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,510
So we'll have to wait and find out on election
day

308
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:02,360
just by exactly how successful Han's appeals
have been.

309
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,120
And at the same time,

310
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,360
I'm very curious about what voter turnout
will be.

311
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,240
So the DPP [inaudible] has invested so much
of their time

312
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,810
to try to frame Hong Kong as part of its sovereignty
issue.

313
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,060
So appealing to young people through the lens
of Hong Kong.

314
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,460
A lot of these mobilization campaigns

315
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,060
have been geared towards trying to get young
people

316
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,450
to come out to vote.

317
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,829
And I'm very curious what exactly

318
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,880
the young person voter turnout rate will be.

319
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,709
So like all democracies,

320
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,400
young people vote the least in Taiwan as well.

321
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,390
Now that being said, I think the young person
vote,

322
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,180
the younger voting cohort rate in Taiwan was
60%

323
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,970
which for Americans that's the low rate.

324
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,290
Like whoa.

325
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,990
But for people in like the 80 plus age range,

326
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,820
it's over 80% voter turnout.

327
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,820
Wow.

328
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,910
So people here really love to vote, which
is great.

329
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,480
But older cohorts tend to vote way more than
younger cohorts.

330
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,779
And for anyone who's familiar with how younger
Taiwanese people

331
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,429
feel about their politics or political choices,

332
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:08,489
they overwhelmingly do not like the KMT.

333
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,839
Now that's not a tacit endorsement of the
DPP.

334
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,919
A lot of young people aren't crazy about the
DPP.

335
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,239
But they most certainly don't like the KMT.

336
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,569
So if more young people voted,

337
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,289
then the results of the election would be
drastically different.

338
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,269
And so I'm very curious how successful

339
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:23,869
the DPP's appeals to young voters

340
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,949
will actually be come election day.

341
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:29,149
And what about the outcomes for the legislature?

342
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:32,250
So the legislature is a bit complicated.

343
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,259
So, Taiwan has what's called a mixed electoral
system.

344
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,249
So there's single member districts.

345
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:40,309
So you vote for the person from your district,

346
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,279
but you also vote for whatever party you like
most.

347
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,779
There's a party list.

348
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,450
So it's kind of a mix of how Germany does
their politics

349
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,249
with how the U.S. does their politics.

350
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:53,580
And currently there's a lot of different polls
that show

351
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,019
how people are going to vote for which party.

352
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:59,450
Right now it looks like the KMT is going to
get about 20% of the party votes

353
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,210
and the DPP about 30%,

354
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,460
with still about 20 to 30% of the people undecided.

355
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,009
So that's going to be a big mystery.

356
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:07,750
And then you have these smaller parties,

357
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,619
about five small parties that are all competing

358
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,119
for whatever limited space that they can get.

359
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,440
Now within the single member districts,

360
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,880
this is much more complicated and really varies
by area.

361
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,990
Of course, there's a lot more contested seats
than there were last time.

362
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,549
I know another big difference between last
time and this time is the DPP

363
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,609
won a lot of seats that the KMT normally wins,

364
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,809
because the KMT was so unpopular.

365
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:33,809
But four years later,

366
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,929
because the KMT is not as unpopular as it
was before,

367
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,529
a lot of these seats that the DPP won last
time

368
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,379
will not be as easily held this election.

369
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,700
So these are all things to also be looking
for.

370
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,980
All right, well thank you so much for joining
me.

371
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,720
Oh, thank you so much.
