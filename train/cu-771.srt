1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,900
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,279
the US and China are getting along again!

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,380
And we have This guy to thank.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,040
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,690
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,429
Something pretty incredible has happened,
folks.

7
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:19,960
The United Nations Security Council

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,240
all agreed on something!

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,380
And actually got something done!

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,570
That means the United States, Russia, and
China

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,869
found something they all had in common—

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,750
besides that they’re each the best

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,640
and greatest country in the world.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,690
Last Saturday, the UN Security Council

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,530
unanimously voted for tough new sanctions

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,850
against North Korea.

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,039
It’s part of ongoing efforts to stop

18
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,850
North Korea from making nuclear weapons.

19
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,500
Not only is this newsworthy.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,370
It’s Twitter worthy.

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,500
Yes, China and Russia voted with us

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,089
on these sanctions.

23
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,220
And they cover more than $1 billion dollars
in exports—

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,359
including coal, iron, lead, and seafood.

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,450
Meaning North Korea can’t sell those things
abroad.

26
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,880
Of course, that just means all that seafood

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,860
stays in North Korea,

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,860
which Kim Jong-un is happy about

29
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,250
because he’s on a strict seafood diet:

30
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,610
When he sees food, he eats it.

31
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,560
The sanctions also prohibit expanding

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,250
the use of North Korean laborers abroad,

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,800
along with new joint ventures or new investment

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,860
in current joint ventures.

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,950
Though if you think North Korea is a good
investment,

36
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,149
you might want to get a new financial advisor.

37
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,619
In practical terms, the sanctions mainly affect

38
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,060
how Russia and China deal with North Korea.

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,189
Those two countries are basically the only
major powers

40
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,689
doing business with the Kim regime.

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,070
China makes up about 90% of all North Korean
trade.

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,700
According to Bloomberg,

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,810
the US and China had been negotiating

44
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,670
the sanctions for a month.

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,799
Then, a “leak” last week said US President
Trump

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,180
wanted to go after China on trade

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,200
for failing to rein in North Korea.

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,509
And he even got support from Democrats on
it.

49
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:06,840
A rare bipartisan win!

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,720
But days later, news broke that the US

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,660
was going to delay the trade battle

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,260
to guarantee China’s support for the the

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,430
UN vote on North Korea sanctions.

54
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,200
Which shows how important the North Korea
situation

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,540
is to the US government.

56
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540


57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
This is a win-win.

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,890
The US gets cooperation from China on North
Korea

59
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,870
without starting a trade war.

60
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,870
And even though China will take

61
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,170
the brunt of the loss in terms of trade,

62
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,120
it’s great PR.

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
It makes it seem like China

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,870
is part of the solution,

65
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,430
not part of the problem.

66
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,090
It also prevents the US from putting more
sanctions

67
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,430
on Chinese companies with dubious ties

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,780
to North Korea.

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,319
For now at least.

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,730
North Korea for its part has not taken the
sanctions well.

71
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,430
As their perpetually angry state-run news
anchor said,

72
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,280
"We denounce and totally reject the United
Nations

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,000
Security Council Resolution on our country

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,349
which the United States and hostile forces

75
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:10,269
have fabricated to infringe on our sovereignty."

76
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,060
Then North Korea threatened ultimate measures.

77
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,901
Saying that the entire United States

78
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,350
was in reach of their nuclear weapons.

79
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,400
"There is no bigger mistake than the United
States

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:31,030
believing that its land is safe across the
ocean."

81
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,360
After the sanctions announcement,

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,500
China and North Korea’s foreign ministers

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,569
met on the sidelines of an ASEAN summit.

84
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,310
“Chinese foreign minister Wang Li

85
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,780
told reporters he had urged the North Koreans

86
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,280
to calmly handle the resolutions and,

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,880
quote, ‘not do anything unbeneficial

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,740
towards the international community.’”

89
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,040
Yes, we wouldn’t want anything unbeneficial
happening.

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,269
But there’s a problem here.

91
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,150
I mean, besides the rogue regime

92
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,069
threatening to nuke the world.

93
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,439
The problem is that China and the United States

94
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,989
see that problem in fundamentally different
ways.

95
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,579
“China says it’s confident new North Korean
sanctions

96
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,500
will bring the rogue regime back to the negotiating
table.”

97
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,720
The negotiating table?

98
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,549
The United States is not going to the negotiating
table

99
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,390
with an authoritarian regime with an obscene

100
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,470
human rights record that consistently

101
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,800
shows itself to be a belligerent threat

102
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,610
to other countries.

103
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,950
Unless it’s China.

104
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,140
Or Russia.

105
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,260
Or North Korea ten years ago.

106
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,830
The point is, the US doesn’t want North
Korea

107
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,710
to think it can get what it wants

108
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,580
through bombastic threats.

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,290
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said
the US

110
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,480
won’t sit down for talks with North Korea

111
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
until it stops its nuclear and ballistic missile
test

112
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,680
for an undisclosed,

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,610
but significant amount of time.

114
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,760
The Chinese regime sees it differently.

115
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,650
They see the United States as provoking North
Korea.

116
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,820
My favorite state-run media the Global Times

117
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,540
calls it US moral arrogance.

118
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,070
Both sides just need to have a heart-to-heart
discussion.

119
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,460
“Of course we also urge other parties,

120
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
especially the U.S. and South Korea,

121
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,310
not to increase the tension.

122
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,090
The situation on the Korean peninsula

123
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,120
is at a critical point of crisis,

124
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,270
at the same time it is a turning point

125
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,200
to make a decision to resume talks.”

126
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Maybe not so ironically,

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,700
this is the same line North Korea takes.

128
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,440
Well, the “US is to blame” part.

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,060
Not the “let’s have a heart-to-heart discussion”
part.

130
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,880
"We want to make it clear

131
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,480
that the worsening situation on the Korean
peninsula,

132
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,100
as well as the nuclear issues,

133
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
were caused by the United States."

134
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,480
But with these sanctions in place,

135
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,290
what could realistically be done to

136
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,420
de-escalate the situation?

137
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,720
Well, China suggests the US

138
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,320
could get rid of the THAAD missile defense
system

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,640
protecting South Korea for a Northern attack.

140
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,660
I mean that’s totally reasonable right?

141
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,790
It absolutely wouldn’t have anything to
do with

142
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,810
China being worried THAAD

143
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,740
could threaten Chinese missile strikes

144
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,320
in the future.

145
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,410
Especially if say, the United States

146
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,410
does strike the North Korean regime

147
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,640
and suddenly there are US troops on China’s
borders.

148
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,900
But don’t worry,

149
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,281
I’m sure the US won’t strike North Korea.

150
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,710
“North Korea best not make any more

151
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,770
threats to the United States.

152
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,280
They will be met with fire and fury,

153
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,250
like the world has never seen.”

154
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,250
Don’t worry though.

155
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,710
According to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,

156
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,270
that was just President Trump speaking

157
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,810
to North Korea in language

158
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,210
that Kim Jong-un can understand.

159
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,310
And North Korea proved Kim understood that
language

160
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,880
by saying that they would attack the US territory
of Guam

161
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,300
with “enveloping fire” by launching missiles.

162
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,960
You guys, they’re speaking the same language.

163
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,300
They’re having a heart-to-heart talk!

164
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,910
Seriously though, the most recent UN sanctions

165
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,330
are a good start to dealing with North Korea’s

166
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,430
nuclear threats--

167
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,210
an increasingly complicated issue

168
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,410
that makes everyone look back fondly

169
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,940
on the simple days when Kim Jong-il

170
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,430
would just stand around looking at stuff.

171
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,170
That’s another thing that the US,

172
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,470
China, and Russia can all agree on.

173
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,500
Coming up after the break,

174
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,120
the Chinese Communist Party has come up with

175
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,060
a novel way to eliminate poverty.

176
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,340
You know, maybe that movie Red Dawn

177
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
can still happen.

178
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,560
In case it does,

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,160
you’ll want to see every episode of China
Uncensored

180
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,570
as soon as possible.

181
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,820
This segment was part of our full half hour
episode

182
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,660
that you could have seen on Friday.
