00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:07,470
On this episode of China Uncensored, the Eastern
Wind Crazy Soldier...is a type of car in China.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,280
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,270
Whether it's a delicious burger from OMC McDnoalds
or a fun-filled afternoon spent playing the

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,470
Polystation, nothing beats a good old Chinese
knockoff.

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,050
Especially if you like cheap cars.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,390
Because word is, Chinese car manufactures
are looking to play the proverbial Thomas

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,920
Edison to the Tesla car company.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,550
Meet the Le Car.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,780
No, I'm not speaking French.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,839
"Le" in Chinese means "happy."

11
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:47,870
And nothing makes car owners happier than
getting a fancy electric car for half le price.

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,230
For now, LeCar is still in the concepting
phase.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,969
And you might be thinking that Tesla uses
some pretty advanced technology, so there's

14
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:59,140
no way Chinese car makers could knock it off.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,569
But guess what?

16
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:05,170
Chinese car makers have been ripping off foreign
car designs for decades.

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,240
So here are my top seven Chinese car knockoffs.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,730
Number 7

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,760
This is the Bamin.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,820
And this is an old Mercedes-Benz W123.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,930
Look similar?

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,020
That's exactly what the Chinese Army wanted.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,790
Yes, in the 80s, China's People's Liberation
liked the Mercedes so much, they decided to

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,790
rip it off.

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,630
It also came in a station wagon model.

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,831
Back then, basically everything was a state-owned
enterprise and Chinese companies just did

27
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:36,960
whatever they wanted.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
Actually, that second part hasn't really changed.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,210
Number 6
You know, China has come a long way from its

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,210
army "admiring" Mercedes-Benz.

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,530
And by admiring, I mean actively admiring.

32
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,600
These days, Mercedes' parent company Daimler
is actually working with Chinese car companies.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,240
They've got a partnership with China's BAIC
Motor.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,210
In less than a decade they've rolled out over
half a million cars in China.

35
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,789
Which is kind of funny considering BAIC was
also rolling this out during that time.

36
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,920
It looks like the Mercedes Benz G Class with
the grille of a Jeep.

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,620
Number 5
But if classy cars are your thing, then you're

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,300
going to love the Geely GE.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,659
Don't let the characteristic flying lady hood
ornament fool you.

40
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,689
Uh, actually, wait, yes.

41
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,209
Let it fool you.

42
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,709
But while some, like the lawyers representing
Rolls Royce, think it's a cheap knock off,

43
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,319
Geely feels it's just "re-inventing the classic."

44
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,769
Just like how I'm planning to sell my "re-invention"
of the Mona Lisa to the Louvre.

45
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,840
Actually, to the knockoff Louvre in Hebei
province.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,180
Number 4
Does this LandWind X7 look familiar to you?

47
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,409
It certainly looked familiar to the head of
Jaguar Land Rover.

48
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,599
Though he took a pretty soft tone when he
said that "China… has enough creativity

49
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,189
and engineering power to do something on their
own and doesn’t have to fall back to the

50
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:03,269
time when copying was of interest."

51
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,299
Unfortunately for him, copying is still of
interest to China.

52
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,340
And Chinese authorities dismissed his legal
complaints that the LandWind X7 looks almost

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,719
the same as the Range Rover Evoque.

54
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,920
But one thing isn't the same.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,299
The LandWind is only a fraction the price.

56
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,689
Number 3

57
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,620
The Lifan 330?!

58
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,400
How did this get on the list?!

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,930
I'm sorry, this is a mistake.

60
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,719
At first some people thought it looked a lot
like a Mini Cooper.

61
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,939
But the Lifan has made the good point their
car has four doors, not two.

62
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,230
So, totally different.

63
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,269
Wait?

64
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,080
This is the 2015 Mini Cooper.

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,379
Um, but it has stripes.

66
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,550
So again, totally not the same.

67
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,829
Number 2

68
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,800
We've already seen the LandWind.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,900
This is the Eastern Wind, or Dongfeng.

70
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,349
The model is called Crazy Soldier.

71
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,079
I think they mean crazy-good, not crazy-unreliable.

72
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,829
But anyway, it might look familiar to anyone
who's ever seen a Hummer.

73
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,989
Everything is pretty much a direct copy: the
exterior, to the interior, even the engine.

74
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,910
But none of these will prepare you for the
greatest Chinese knockoff of foreign cars...

75
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,340
Number 1
Autobots.

76
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,540
Though the title makes it sound like a knockoff
of Transformers, pretty much everything else

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,700
screams Disney's "Cars."

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,370
Though I can't say for sure because, honestly,
there's no way I'm going to sit and watch

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,380
this.

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:41,520
I mean, what's next, a Portuguese rip off
of Muppet Babies?

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,340
Oh.

82
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,340
So what do you think of these knockoff Chinese
cars?

83
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,280
Are they really different designs?

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,760
Or are they just taking Western car companies
for a ride?
