1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,000
"The future…"

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:19,329
Wow, they got that totally wrong.
If you didn’t already know, we’ve officially

3
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,930
reached the future from Back to the Future
Part II.

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:32,110
"We're descending toward Hill Valley, California
at 4:29pm on Wednesday, October 21st, 2015."

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,650
"2015? You mean we're in the future!?"
That movie was made almost 30 years ago!

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,150
Wow, I feel old.
Yeah, the real 2015 isn’t quite what I imagined

7
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,600
back then either.
That’s why we’re counting down these 10

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,170
Things Back to the Future Part II Got Wrong.

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:59,980
Number 10: Flying cars
Nope!

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,079
Could you imagine what a bad idea that would
be?

11
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,860
Yeah, the only thing worse than traffic in
LA would be throwing that mess up into the

12
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,440
sky.
Speaking of sky, what’s that?

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,970
Huh, I don’t know. It looks like…
Rain.

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,250
In California.
They sure got that one wrong.

15
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,430
That takes care of number 9.
Now on to number 19!

16
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,390
You mean Number 8?
No, I mean 19. As in Jaws 19.

17
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:37,729
Yeah, that was pretty ridiculous. As if movies
would have that many sequels.

18
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:43,310
Unless you’re talking about Harry Potter.
Or Fast & Furious. Or James Bond.

19
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,420
Number 7
Hey, you know that part where the kids say:

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,930
"You mean you have to use your hands?"
"That's like a baby's toy!"

21
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,040
Yep, that kid was Elijah Wood. And they were
wrong. Elijah Wood isn't a kid in 2015. He's

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,040
like 34.
Number 6!

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,610
Ring ring.
Hello? Who is this?

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,119
The phone booth you use in your daily life
in 2015.

25
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,779
Click.
Hey, since there aren't phone booths anymore,

26
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,549
where does Superman change?
Number 5

27
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,349
“Please, no, I cannot be fired! I’m fired!
Ah!”

28
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,669
A world under the influence of Donald Trump?
No Matt. In the 80s, people thought that Japan

29
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,879
would soon dominate the world.
Yeah, all throughout the future scenes, you

30
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,790
see the influence of Japan.
The Japanese boss.

31
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,859
Marty's Rising Sun neckties.
Doc Brown's shirt.

32
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:39,959
Kimonos.
But a decades-long recession in Japan put

33
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,430
a stop to that.
Yeah, it ended up being just a silly xenophobic

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,260
fear.
Because in reality it's China that's going

35
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:57,609
to swallow up the world!
Ok, Number 4.

36
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,449
What are you talking about?
Are you kidding? When's the last time you

37
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,779
sent a fax?
Just last month, to the Chinese Embassy. That's

38
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:09,639
the only way to communicate with them.
Ah, I guess China is living the future of

39
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:09,909
the 80s.

40
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:16,669
Number 3, the fashion
"Pull out your pants pockets. All kids in

41
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:22,939
the future wear their pants inside out."
Really, all the fashion.

42
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:29,699
All of it.
Number 2

43
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:34,799
"The justice system works swiftly in the future
now that they've abolished all lawyers."

44
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,919
Nope! There are twice as many lawyers per
capita in 2015 as there were in 1985.

45
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,409
Except in China, where they just throw the
lawyers in jail.

46
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:50,609
And now Number 1
“Look what happens to your son!”

47
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,809
Hahahaha, people actually get their news from
newspapers!

48
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:57,739
Oh man, they got that totally wrong.

49
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,819
So most of the things they thought we'd see
in 2015 were way off.

50
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,019
Way, way off.
Way.

51
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,719
But there were some thing they did surprisingly
predict. So check out our other video, "10

52
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,400
Things Back to the Future II Got Right."

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,200
So what does this have to do with China Uncensored?

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,220
Uh...America Uncensored?

55
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,150
Uh...This is totally not America Uncensored.
