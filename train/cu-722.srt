00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,780
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,100
it’s Cold War 2: Electric Boogaloo!

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,700
But with less dancing and more stealing stuff.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,700
Hi, Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,380
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,680
A bomb dropped at the Aspen Security Forum
last week.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,760
OK, a figurative bomb.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,120
The director of the FBI revealed

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,100
that biggest long-term threat to the United
States right now

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,140
is Russ--just kidding.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,280
“I think China from a counterintelligence
perspective,

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,570
in many ways represents the broadest,

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,570
most challenging,

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,039
most significant threat we face as a country...

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,760
We have economic espionage investigations
in every state,

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,109
all fifty states, that trace back to China.”

17
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,109
Really?

18
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,809
The FBI has open investigations into Chinese
spying

19
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,120
in all 50 states?

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,140
Like I totally get California for technology,

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,800
or New York for finance,

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
or Hawaii for the military bases.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,290
But what are Chinese spies going to steal
in, like, Iowa?

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,940
What’s that, Shelley?

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,040
OK, corn.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,420
They stole corn.

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,130
Look, I don’t want to play into stereotypes
here,

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,630
but shouldn’t they be stealing our rice?

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,790
What’s that, Shelley?

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,880
They did steal rice from Kansas.

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
OK then.

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,990
Moving on.

33
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,200
The FBI’s not alone in raising an alarm

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,190
about Chinese spies in America.

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,670
Here’s Michael Collins from the CIA.

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,020
“By their own terms, and what Xi Jinping
himself enunciates,

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,910
I would argue that...what they’re waging
against us

38
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,710
is fundamentally a cold war.

39
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,570
A cold war not like we saw during THE Cold
War.

40
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,719
But a cold war by definition.

41
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:53,060
A country that exploits all avenues of power
licit and illicit,

42
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,120
public and private, economic and military,

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,719
to undermine the standing of your rival

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,310
relative to your own standing

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,549
without resorting to conflict.”

46
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,340
Ok, I got it.

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,610
It’s not THE Cold War.

48
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,050
It’s A cold war.

49
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,420
But on the plus side,

50
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,310
it kind of validates what I’ve been saying

51
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,550
on China Uncensored for the past six years.

52
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,610
It almost sounds like the CIA is taking money
from me.

53
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,370
That’s a terrible idea.

54
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,500
Please don’t take my money.

55
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,170
But it’s not just US intelligence officials
speaking out

56
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,560
about what’s going on with the Chinese regime.

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
US politicians are talking about it, too.

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,933
“The biggest issue of our time in my view,

59
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,620
and I think in the view of most of members
of this committee,

60
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,480
and I would venture to guess most the members
of this panel—

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,760
is its China and the risks they pose.

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
I'm not sure

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,780
in the two hundred and forty some odd year
history of this nation

64
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,450
we've ever faced a competitor and potential
adversary

65
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,090
of this scale, scope, and capacity.”

66
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,989
But one thing to remember is that,

67
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,659
even though we’re in A cold war,

68
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:01,010
the good old days of THE Cold War spy versus
spy are history.

69
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,390
You know, the simpler times, when an Iron
Curtain separated

70
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,879
the Soviet East from the Free West,

71
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,569
and Russian spies had Austrian accents.

72
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,490
“How do you Soviets deal with all the stress?”

73
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,490
“Vodka.”

74
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,470
Today, the cold war between the US and China

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,990
is much more complex.

76
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,010
“The United States and the Soviet Union

77
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,420
had minimal interaction in the economic and
academic spheres,

78
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,440
as the two sides maintained strict barriers
to mutual trade

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,080
and academic exchanges.

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,860
Today, by contrast,

81
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,240
the United States and China are deeply intertwined

82
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,849
in economic, trade, academic, and other realms,

83
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,800
posing unique challenges for the United States

84
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,370
across a range of areas.”

85
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,129
A lot of these “cold war” strategies

86
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,110
that CIA official Michael Collins mentioned
earlier

87
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,390
were outlined in the 1999 book “Unrestricted
Warfare,”

88
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,690
written by two Chinese People’s Liberation
Army colonels.

89
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,769
They clearly understood the strategic use
of lasers,

90
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,670
space planes, and random planets

91
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,730
to strike fear in the hearts of people in
the 90s.

92
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,380
But they also had a deep understanding

93
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,430
of how to wage subtle warfare against the
US

94
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,670
in ways that were hard to counteract.

95
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,209
For example, by using financial influence

96
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,040
to change Hollywood plotlines to be pro-Beijing.

97
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,440
Like in Transformers 4,

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,330
where Hong Kong citizens look to the Chinese
government

99
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,390
to rescue them.

100
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,080
“We’ve got to call the central government
for help!”

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,970
Or by setting up Confucius Institutes across
the US

102
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,480
to teach free Chinese classes—

103
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,520
and in exchange control the conversation

104
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,900
about how China is portrayed.

105
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,610
Always as a benevolent partner,

106
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,930
in case you were wondering.

107
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,790
And yes, they even have Confucius Institutes
in Iowa.

108
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,080
And honestly, that stuff is just the tip of
the iceberg.

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,910
Here’s a 30-page report the White House
published in June

110
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,290
that lists dozens of ways the Chinese regime

111
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,130
is trying to undermine the US,

112
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,920
by buying, or stealing,

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,170
or even using so-called “Chinese law”

114
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,990
to forcibly transfer American technology.

115
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,870
For example, they have laws that force US
companies

116
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,150
to “surrender key technologies to Chinese
authorities,

117
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,500
such as source code and encryption algorithms”

118
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,700
as a requirement to operate in the Chinese
market.

119
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,940
And then, the Chinese regime plans to use
this technology

120
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,140
to eventually out-compete US companies in
China,

121
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,440
and around the world.

122
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,800
It’s a type of economic and ultimately political
warfare.

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,830
The Chinese Communist Party has been doing
this stuff

124
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,140
a long time, of course.

125
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,790
But it seems that in just the past few months,

126
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,360
US officials have been far more vocal about
their concerns

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,890
than at any time I can recall.

128
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,960
This bill, sponsored by US Senator Marco Rubio,

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,750
aims to have more than a dozen congressional
committees

130
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,010
share intelligence and produce an unclassified
report

131
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,580
on the Chinese Communist Party’s

132
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,810
political influence operations in the US.

133
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,160
And it also aims to share intelligence on
the Communist Party

134
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,850
with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Taiwan—

135
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,310
which all face similar threats.

136
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,840
Which sounds like a pretty good idea.

137
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,960
At least people are finally starting to realize

138
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,510
what the Chinese Communist Party is doing.

139
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,570
If only there had been a way for people to
find out about

140
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,740
these issues years ago, on, for example,

141
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,300
some kind of YouTube channel.

142
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,910
Speaking of which, I’m going to coin the
phrase “Cold War 2”.

143
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,660
That’s right, you heard it first on China
Uncensored.

144
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,780
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

145
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,470
“Cold War 2” is the name of a B movie
from Hong Kong?

146
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,060
Ugh.

147
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,060
So what do you think?

148
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,640
Leave your comments below.

149
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,311
And before we go, it’s time for me to answer
a question

150
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:37,120
from one of our fans who contributes a dollar
or more per episode

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,460
via the crowdfunding website Patreon.

152
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,850
Wolf Xu aks:

153
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,620
“There is a rationale among many Chinese
that

154
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,320
since China is so large and diverse,

155
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,140
implementing American style democracy

156
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,380
on its political system right away

157
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,260
will only bring about chaos,

158
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,380
like what happened in Iraq or Syria,

159
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,120
if not worse.

160
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,730
I'm wondering if you want to comment on that?”

161
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,190
Good question, Wolf.

162
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,740
To understand the rationale that China can’t
handle democracy,

163
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,070
first look at who the main supporters of that
rationale are.

164
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,450
Why...it’s Chinese state-run media!

165
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,450
Yes, democracy is not a universal truth,

166
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,610
nor is it a universal way to solve the problem

167
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,330
of governing the country.

168
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,140
Look, the Chinese Communist Party

169
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,940
doesn’t want Western style democracy in
China,

170
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,480
because it knows that a lot of people

171
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,860
would reject the Party if given the choice.

172
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,650
But would democracy even work in China?

173
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,920
Well, it’s worked well in Taiwan,

174
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,630
which is full of Chinese people.

175
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,710
And it’s also worked decently in India,

176
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,830
which has a population almost as big as China,

177
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,830
and the people there are on average

178
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,830
less wealthy and have less education.

179
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,470
If over the last 5,000 years,

180
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,990
China could build some of the most glorious
civilizations

181
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,880
the world had ever seen,

182
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,350
it can certainly handle a little democracy.

183
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,310
Now I’m not saying American style democracy

184
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,250
is the only path China could take.

185
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,630
But anyone who says Chinese people

186
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,490
aren’t capable of having democracy

187
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,830
is either buying into the Communist Party’s
false agenda,

188
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,100
or just being racist.

189
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,250
Ahem, Jackie Chan.

190
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,690
Thanks for your question Wolf.

191
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,960
And thank all of you for watching.

192
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

193
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
See you next time.

194
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240

195
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,470
