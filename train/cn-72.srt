00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,380
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're
playing 'Citation Needed'.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,960
Joining me today, he reads books y'know, it's
Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,060
'Ey up.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,100
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,740
Here's a thought: earlier today, Noel Edmonds
was entirely naked.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,120
Just imagine.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,800
And standing in for Matt Gray,
the mouth from the south, Will Seaward.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Hello!

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm not from Yorkshire.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,239
Get him out(!)

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,660
In front of me I've got an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,400
Every fact they get right is a point and a
ding,

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,920
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers, which is:

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,140
Today, we are talking about Julie d'Aubig..

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,460
d'Aubig?...

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,560
D'Aubigny.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
This is it.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,160
Forty minutes of this, try and stay with us.

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,340
To be fair, I am not French.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
And if...

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,340
No way.

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
Really?

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,110
If I were English, I'd pronounce this as der-orb-ig-ny,

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,710
but I think it's d'Aubigny.

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,020
D'Aubigny sounds fine.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,530
Let's go with d'Aubigny, yes.

27
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,630
Better known as Mademoiselle Maupin.

28
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,630
Mopin.

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,630
Moppin.

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,630
I'm not French.

31
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,100
This is going to be…

32
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,100
It's a French article.

33
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,710
I'll be honest, it's downhill from here.

34
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,140
The whole thing's not in French, is it?

35
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,600
No, it's not.

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,540
M-A-U-P-I-N.

37
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,360
P-I-N?

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,260
Maupin.

39
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,180
Mau-pin.

40
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,240
Madame Maupin.

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,040
Was she a mistress of Louis XIV?

42
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
It's a long list, if it is.

43
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,580
Let's face it(!)

44
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,060
Born to Gaston d'Aubigny, a secretary to the
Master of the Horse...

45
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,950
for King Louis XIV.

46
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,420
It's not close enough to have a point,

47
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
but she was certainly-

48
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,950
A secretary for a horse, would you believe?

49
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,190
[whinnies] "Take that down.

50
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,630
"Read it back?"

51
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,020
[whinnies] "Sir, I know it's very sad, but
why the long face?"

52
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,330
You're absolutely right that she was a mistress,
but to a Count.

53
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,369
So I'm going to give you a point for that.

54
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:56,740
To the... oh, god.

55
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
A mistress to-

56
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
French names.

57
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
Count d'Armagnac?

58
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,740
D'Armagnac.

59
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,750
Tom, what have you done to yourself?

60
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,900
It's not gone well.
It's not gone well.

61
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,580
D'Armagnac. Go on.

62
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,520
Became a mistress by the age of 14, because
pre-French Revolution.

63
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,920
But by that point,
she had learned a lot of things,

64
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,730
by learning alongside the court pages.

65
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,730
Okay.

66
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,819
Is that an artful euphemism?

67
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:20,819
No, it's not.

68
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,610
Is it an artless euphemism?

69
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,520
No, her father trained the court pages.

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,380
So what did Julie learn alongside them?

71
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,380
Words.

72
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
I'll give you a point.

73
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Numbers.

74
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
Yes, reading as well.

75
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
Standing very still.

76
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,820
Going "ooh" at the right moment, when the
king comes in.

77
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,570
Yes, all that kind of stuff.

78
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,780
Polishing pointy bits of gold chairs.

79
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,160
There's a couple of other skills that a page
would have in those days.

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,570
Carrying things.

81
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,030
Putting things down.

82
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,300
Something a little more violent.

83
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,700
Swording!

84
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,200
Yes.

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,880
Swording!

86
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,099
Which is an artless euphemism.

87
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,880
Swording.

88
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,910
She learned to fence, and then dressed as
a boy from an early age.

89
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,290
She got involved with an assistant fencing
master.

90
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,800
The police were then looking for him,
to arrest him.

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
What had he done?

92
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,280
You know he's got a sword in his hand?

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,780
Yeah.

94
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,700
You know he waves it around in a violent fashion?

95
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,710
Mm.

96
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,739
Did he - perchance and taking a punt – did
he stab someone?

97
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:15,860
Yes.

98
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,980
I'm looking for something specific here.

99
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,580
What might be a reason for stabbing someone,
pre-Revolution?

100
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,690
Being slightly upset.

101
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,700
In which case, you would do what?

102
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,100
- Oh, a duel!
- Stab 'em!

103
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,740
A duel! You'd fight a duel.

104
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,640
Yes.

105
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,760
The man she was involved with killed a man
in an illegal duel,

106
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,650
so they fled the city, to Marseilles.

107
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,730
How did she earn her living on the way south?

108
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,480
Fighting for money.

109
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,620
Yes.

110
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,440
F***!

111
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,730
Giving fencing exhibitions, and also, singing.

112
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,680
She was a talented singer.

113
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,319
Singing and fencing at the same time
would be a hell of an act, wouldn't it?

114
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,319
Opera.

115
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,840
Which I believe had been invented
at that point.

116
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,709
And not only that; she joined an opera company.

117
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,520
Have a point.

118
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,460
For full operatic effect, did she die of tuberculosis
at the end?

119
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,580
We've seen very different versions of Aida.

120
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,140
Made it to Marseilles.

121
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,120
Grew bored of her lover.

122
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,380
Not what I thought you were going to say.

123
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,849
Grew bored of this humdrum, dull life
of opera singing and fencing.

124
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,530
Decides to become an accountant.

125
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,479
She ran away somewhere,
and she ran away with someone.

126
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,050
To Nice.

127
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,710
With a man from Nice(!)

128
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,419
Right, you are wrong about Nice, and you are
also wrong about a man.

129
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,419
With a woman!

130
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,419
Yes.

131
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,720
From a place that isn't Nice!

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,979
I'm not giving you a point for that, but it's
Avignon.

133
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:37,979
So yes.

134
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,860
Oh, I was going to say Poitiers. So close.

135
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
But she was running away,

136
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,040
because the girl was sent away by her parents.

137
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,390
Where was the other girl sent to?

138
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
A convent?

139
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,780
Yes, absolutely right.

140
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,600
So she followed, entering the convent, and-

141
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
With swords.

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,830
Let's face it, you get in most places

143
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,130
if you turn up waving swords around,
singing opera.

144
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,810
No, she went into the convent,

145
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,320
and then tried to free her lover from the
convent.

146
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,210
This is a hell of an opera in itself,
let's face it.

147
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,360
I like to think that everybody is singing
all the way through this.

148
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Yes, I do.

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,509
It's a full-on Rodgers and Hammerstein, this.

150
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,400
Could we talk through the plan,
the scheme that she went through,

151
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,370
the heist that she pulled?

152
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,124
And it's quite a dark heist,

153
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:18,440
Did it involve swords?

154
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,280
to get her and her lover out of the convent.

155
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,840
Did the nuns have swords?

156
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
Er, not to my knowledge, although-

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
"Bloodbath at convent!"

158
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,600
But frankly, 'Sister Act 3', it's going to
be absolutely amazing.

159
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,340
But then it should have been a very easy heist!

160
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,440
"Give me my ...ing lover,
or I'll chop you all to pieces."

161
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,900
As negotiating tactics go,
it's normally successful, I find.

162
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,699
Well, they were trying to cover their tracks.

163
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,860
What kind of scheme would you pull to do that?

164
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,790
You would pretend to be a doctor.

165
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,750
And you'd say, "This nun has a terrible disease!

166
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,180
"All of you will get the disease.

167
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,110
She must come with me immediately."

168
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,790
And the nuns would go,
"Oh, a doctor has said so."

169
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,640
Then the doctor would also have a sword,
and they…

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,640
Yes, and they were listening, because he was
♪ SINGING ♪!

171
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,400
And then we have the interval.

172
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,880
That's the way it goes.

173
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Er, no.

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,090
She would pretend to be a policeman.

175
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:21,220
and she would say, "This nun has committed
a terrible crime!

176
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,389
"She must come with me immediately."

177
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,320
But she was charged, in absentia,

178
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,310
for kidnapping, bodysnatching, and arson.

179
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,350
So based on that, what was the heist?

180
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,350
Oh, s***.

181
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,500
So you take a dead body,
replace your lover with it,

182
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,930
then burn the whole place down
to cover the tracks.

183
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Damn!

184
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,840
What worries me is that
your mind went straight to that.

185
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Does this s*** count as a confession?

186
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,400
There's no DNA evidence, darling(!)

187
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,800
She escaped from that.

188
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,960
The affair lasted three months,

189
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,460
before the girl returned to her family, and
then she left for Paris.

190
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,630
What happened in Paris?

191
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,319
And I'm deliberately phrasing that vaguely,
because it's kind of a repeat.

192
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,200
Did she dig up the entire Père Lachaise Cemetery,

193
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,461
and burn Paris to the ground?

194
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,350
It's a repeat of something
we've already talked about.

195
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,350
Something with swords?

196
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,350
Yes, definitely.

197
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,910
It's a sword thing, from this lady, I'm guessing.

198
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,910
Yes.

199
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,910
Catastrophic juggling accident.

200
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,940
Oh, did she challenge someone to a duel?

201
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Yes, you're absolutely right.

202
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,810
She was insulted by a young nobleman,
fought a duel with him,

203
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,030
put a blade through his shoulder.

204
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,030
Whoa.

205
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,030
Awesome.

206
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,460
Was he pinned to a tree in a comical-

207
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,530
No, it was just a vicious injury, Gary!

208
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,389
It wasn't a cartoon thing, where he was going,

209
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,630
"Well, this is inconvenient.

210
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,169
"I'm stapled to this tree now."

211
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,569
"I'll fight with the other arm!"

212
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,120
The cool thing about duels, duelling is really
addictive.

213
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,460
Bismarck, I think, when he was a student,

214
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,169
he was also addicted to duelling.

215
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,169
He would walk-

216
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,160
Bit unfair though: six 14" guns against a
man with a sword.

217
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:53,340
Well, no.

218
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,639
He'd walk around the street,

219
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,760
wearing two cudgels, six pistols and two swords

220
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,450
and a dressing gown.

221
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,060
And he'd wander around, going,
"Yeah, fight me. Fight me. I'm Bismarck."

222
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,360
That's a very different Big Lebowski,
isn't it?

223
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,520
Duelling, once it got later, was a really
formal event.

224
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,700
- Yes.
- What would they be wearing?

225
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,240
You're normally just in a shirt, aren't you,
as I understand it?

226
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,570
No, we're talking,
for this at least, much later.

227
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,819
This is German military, 19th century.

228
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:23,449
Oh, your full kit, no doubt.

229
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,449
Armour?

230
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,449
Well, you wouldn't be in armour.

231
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,449
They wouldn't have armour at that point.

232
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,449
You'd have a breastplate.

233
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,610
Well, wasn't the early German thing that you
duelled, growing up,

234
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,810
or you fenced, growing up, to get good gnarly
scars, didn't they?

235
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,669
Yes, you're absolutely right.

236
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,399
They would fight with a mask and a thick scarf,
so you couldn't-

237
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,019
Ah, so that you could only get this bit.

238
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,550
You could only get that bit.

239
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,279
So it was essentially ritual scarification.

240
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,279
Awesome.

241
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,470
Scars were judged by Otto von Bismarck
to be a sign of bravery.

242
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,519
Men's courage could be judged –
and there's a quote here –

243
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,810
"by the number of scars on their cheeks".

244
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,380
Oh, cracking. I'm well away.

245
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,020
Did he specify which cheeks?

246
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,640
How would you duel?

247
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,580
I've just got this image of the sword....

248
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,540
"Oh, I see. I've got a very wrong idea about this."

249
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,760
I've just got two men
backing up against each other,

250
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,420
with a sword, kind of, "Thunk. Thunk."

251
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,320
Only one end of the sword would go, "thunk."

252
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,700
The other one would go...

253
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,340
It's marvellous, the thought of Bismarck stood
there in his dressing gown,

254
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,910
cudgels, hand grenades and cannons,

255
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,790
and someone else reverses bent over,
round the corner.

256
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,560
"Well, we're doing it this way. Fair enough.

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
"I've never been beaten by a more worthy adversary."

258
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,120
At which point, it turns out the guy's got
a cannon up there.

259
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,329
Er, yes, scars, for God's sake(!)

260
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,009
Scars were usually targeted to the left profile.

261
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:48,009
Okay.

262
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,920
Oh, look at you with your, "I'm handsome for
19th century warring Germany" face.

263
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
You know what?

264
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'll take that.

265
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,610
I will take that.

266
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,520
It does explain the haircut.

267
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,589
And the Pickelhaube.

268
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,699
Can we have a big thing that goes across the
bottom of the screen that says,

269
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:06,459
"Do not try this at home?"

270
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,459
Yes, I think...

271
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,030
"unless someone has insulted you and you want
a duel?

272
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,360
"In which case, that's fine, but remember,
we mean the other cheeks.

273
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,340
"Yeah?"

274
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,680
So yes, going back, pre-French Revolution, back to Julie,

275
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,040
Oh, yeah!

276
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,779
Who duelled by stabbing someone with a sword.

277
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,019
This doesn't sound much like a duel.

278
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,850
This more sounds like a very quick stabbing.

279
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,189
She was a very good duellist, by all accounts.

280
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:31,959
Well, excellent, obviously, yeah.

281
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,759
He was Louis-Joseph d'Albert de Luynes,
son of the Duke of Luynes.

282
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,060
"He killed my father. Prepare to die."

283
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Quite the opposite.

284
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,199
One of his companions came to offer his apologies.

285
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,220
"He resurrected my father?

286
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,540
"Prepare to live?"

287
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Okay, when I say the opposite, I mean in more
general terms.

288
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,080
It was more that they certainly weren't enemies
after this.

289
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,740
Is there more about...
just before we go onto this guy,

290
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:01,920
is there more about him, other than this incident?

291
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,639
Because I would hate to be, myself, one of
those people in history

292
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,020
that's only remembered as being the guy that
got stabbed through a shoulder,

293
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,379
and potentially stuck to a tree,

294
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,019
by that lady that pretended to be a nun,

295
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,529
who sang opera, that burnt the convent down.

296
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:14,369
'Cos that's not a great way to be remembered,
let's face it.

297
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,939
For one thing, you can't write all that on
just the one tombstone.

298
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,769
Yeah, both sides.

299
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,749
There is not another reference in here.

300
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,949
This appears to be the one reference to the
man in history.

301
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,540
"How do they remember me?
...oh, you're kidding. Come on!"

302
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,040
If it hadn't been that, he would have been
remembered for being the innately hilarious

303
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:32,299
son of the Duke of Loins!

304
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,989
...I'm probably mispronouncing that.

305
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:37,610
I'm choosing to believe you're not!

306
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,880
It's L-U-Y-N-E-S.

307
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,100
So if there's any French speakers in here
who can…

308
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Loins!.

309
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,380
Loins it is then.

310
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,100
Duke of Loins.

311
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,149
There's no advance from the audience.

312
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:49,689
What happened, though, after he recovered?

313
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,220
And, by the way, and after he sent his apologies?

314
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,459
Oh, good man.

315
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,949
I imagine he went, "Ow," quite frequently,
for a while.

316
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,730
Did his golf take some time to recover?

317
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,389
Was there physiotherapy involved?

318
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,100
Is this back to swording as an artless euphemism?

319
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Did they marry?

320
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,880
You're closer, yes.

321
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,910
They never married, but they became lovers,
and, later, lifelong friends.

322
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,319
How can you...!

323
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:15,019
"Oh, remember that time
I stabbed you in the shoulder?"

324
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,209
"Ah, that's how we met!"

325
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,309
Works for me.

326
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,699
I'm going to point out, she is still in her
late teens at this point.

327
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:24,699
That's nails.

328
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,080
We are not in the section, yet, that says,
'Adult Life.'

329
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,480
You know when you're at home and you think
to yourself,

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,629
"How is my life going?"

331
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:33,319
Do you ever hear articles like this and think,

332
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,179
"I have not achieved enough in life?"

333
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:37,360
Well, how old was she?

334
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Late teens?

335
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,129
By 19, at no point had I tried to burn a convent
down with a corpse inside it.

336
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,790
She is somewhere between 17 and 20 at this
point, but we don't know if-

337
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,790
Oh, well, that's different.

338
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,600
By 19, I was all about that, yes.

339
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,279
She was hired by the Paris Opera.

340
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,029
In full knowledge that she was pretty handy
while she was doing it.

341
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:55,480
Oh, no, as a doorman!

342
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,300
Can you just imagine when she got appointed
at the opera,

343
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,920
the CRB check she must've had
when she got in?

344
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,170
"What do we have?

345
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,670
"Well, a little bit of shoplifting when you
were 12.

346
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,130
"I'm sure that's all done now...

347
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,859
"Burning down a convent and stealing a body
to burn down said convent, now that was not-"

348
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:13,430
She only set the room on fire;
she didn't burn down the entire convent.

349
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,769
Oh, well that's alright then.

350
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:18,009
Five years later,
she's still the talk of Paris.

351
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,920
She's still well known-
thank you for those effects.

352
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,800
At a society ball, there was a scandal.

353
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Turned up as a bloke.

354
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Left with a woman.

355
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Reverted to being a woman.

356
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,990
Burnt the place down when somebody said, "Oi."

357
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,790
One of those things is right,

358
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,170
but it was a broad, blunderbuss attempt there.

359
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,209
So let's try Gary.

360
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,209
Singing opera.

361
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,209
Throws sword.

362
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,209
Stabs man.

363
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:41,209
Room on fire.

364
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:42,209
None of those.

365
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:43,209
So based on those two-

366
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:44,209
Come on, Will.

367
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,360
She pretended to be a doctor.

368
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,020
And she went around the ballroom, going,

369
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,220
"Everyone here has a terrible disease!

370
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,679
"You must all come with me."

371
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,660
What I like about it, in my imagination,

372
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,799
she's dressed as an opera singer.

373
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,470
She's got swords down each leg, so she's a
bit stiff in walking,

374
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,739
and has a stethoscope.

375
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:10,350
Chris, you actually said vaguely the right
words there.

376
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,059
She kissed a young woman at a society ball.

377
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,919
What happened immediately after that?

378
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,949
She had a duel with the entire society ball.

379
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,709
Yes, she was challenged to duels by
three separate noblemen,

380
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:21,810
so I'll give you a point for that.

381
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,800
What did she do that night?

382
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,140
Er, beat them all in duels.

383
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,970
What was illegal in Paris, at that point?

384
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,389
Duelling more than two people in an evening.

385
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:32,589
It was considered greedy.

386
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:34,239
Just duelling, in particular.

387
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,419
So she now has to flee Paris, because she's
also wanted there.

388
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,709
Mate, I'd say Marseilles now.

389
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,989
I think we're going there.

390
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,660
I think she went to Marseilles!

391
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,740
Brussels.

392
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,980
Re-joins the opera, and the final years of
her career here

393
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:56,149
were spent in a relationship with, well, who?

394
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,799
Anyone brave enough.

395
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,829
Madame la Marquise de Florensac.

396
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,639
I'm, again, butchering all the French in here.

397
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,209
Well, that's what she was doing with the swords,
to be honest.

398
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,980
That's taken time.

399
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,200
That's excellent.

400
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,790
Ugly four that just reached the rope, yeah.

401
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,800
On her death, she was inconsolable.

402
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,020
She retired from the opera, and then took
refuge where?

403
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,680
Not a convent...?

404
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,540
She died at the age of 33, has no known grave,
and is a legendary figure.

405
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,749
That window needs just a gentle tap
on it now, doesn't it?

406
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,929
With a point of a sword, just to come through...

407
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,700
So at the end of the show,
congratulations Will, you win this one.

408
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,320
Yay!

409
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:44,739
You win a Greek philosopher's
Mexican salamander speed control.

410
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,009
Oh!

411
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:49,040
Aristotle axolotl something throttle.

412
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Yes!

413
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,260
An Aristotle axolotl throttle.

414
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,080
Congratulations, Will.

415
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,500
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel,

416
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,620
to Gary Brannan,

417
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,200
to Will Seaward.

418
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,199
I've been Tom Scott,
and we'll see you next time.

419
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,160
Goodnight!
