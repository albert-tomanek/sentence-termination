00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,960
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,600
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,530
have solved the nuclear crisis—

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,820
thanks to China.

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,700
The Chinese Coast Guard is caught stealing

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,500
fish near the Philippines.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,380
And the story you’ve been waiting for,

8
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,920
a Chinese doctor pulls a live leech

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,100
out of a guy’s nose.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,900
Really, just skip to that part.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,800
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,220
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,099
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,739
Now I wasn’t personally in Singapore this
week

15
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,150
during the summit between Donald Trump and
Kim Jong-Un.

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,390
But you know who also wasn’t?

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,390
China.

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,390
Probably.

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,629
Actually, maybe they were listening in.

20
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,750
Who knows?

21
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,440
But even if they weren’t officially there,

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,809
that didn’t stop Chinese officials from
taking credit

23
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,239
for all the positive outcomes.

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,410
Yes, China’s role was “indisputable.”

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,519
Getting Trump to agree to halt America’s

26
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:01,870
big joint military exercise with South Korea?

27
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,409
That was originally China’s idea.

28
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,450
And if Trump starts lifting sanctions on North
Korea—

29
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,070
which he has not done yet, by the way—

30
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,070
but if he does,

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,070
that’s also China’s idea.

32
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,540
And having the summit end in paperwork instead
of nuclear war?

33
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,900
Obviously, China’s idea.

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,320
And the lunch menu?

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,770
Definitely China’s idea.

36
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,560
Chinese telecom company ZTE

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,119
has lost about 3 billion dollars this week.

38
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:29,740
Which makes me feel a lot better about

39
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,280
how much money I’ve lost in student loans.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,220
Ok, not really.

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,180
3 billion dollars is about 15% of ZTE’s
stock value.

42
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,649
But it’s still the world’s 4th largest
maker

43
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:43,930
of telecommunications equipment—

44
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,189
things like cell phones and routers.

45
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,369
Back in April, the US had put a seven-year
ban on ZTE,

46
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,600
forbidding it to buy any parts from US companies.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,950
That’s because ZTE had violated US sanctions
by selling

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,580
made-in-America parts to North Korea and Iran.

49
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,230
I’m sure it was an honest mistake.

50
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,520
As part of a settlement with the US government,

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,320
ZTE has to pay 1.4 billion dollars in penalties.

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,940
It also has 30 days to fire “all members
of its leadership

53
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,120
at or above the senior vice president level.”

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
OK, so it fired a few people.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
No big deal.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,190
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

57
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,270
“That could result in about

58
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,160
40 senior executives being replaced”?!

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,750
How many senior vice presidents does a company
need?

60
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,340
About 40, I guess.

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,300
The Chinese Communist Party has plans to put

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,470
a radio frequency ID chip in cars across China

63
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,910
starting July 1st.

64
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,360
Officials have described it as a way to

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
“help ease worsening traffic congestion...

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,950
partly because clogged roads contribute to
air pollution.”

67
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,360
Which is why it’s being implemented by...

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,590
the Ministry of Public Security.

69
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,460
Now while whole chip-tracking-your-car thing

70
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,530
may sound like some scary,

71
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,780
big brother type surveillance plan,

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,050
don’t worry!

73
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,320
It’s voluntary.

74
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
For now.

75
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,610
That’ll change on January 1st.

76
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,330
Then it’ll become mandatory for all new
vehicles.

77
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,710
But even without this ID chip program,

78
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,360
the Ministry of Public Security can still
track wherever you go.

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,330
They’ve got 200 million surveillance cameras
across the China,

80
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,330
and they can already track your car by its
model, color,

81
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,720
and license plate number.

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,220
Speaking of vehicles,

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,930
truck drivers across nine provinces in China

84
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,480
have been protesting.

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,960
They’re gathering in parking lots,

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,010
and even on major highways.

87
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,600
The truck drivers complaining about high gas
prices

88
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,950
and excessive highway tolls.

89
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,580
But also they’re kind of mad about how they
police

90
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,710
keep harassing them.

91
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,530
“Overthrow the CCP!”

92
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,640
Overthrow the Chinese Communist Party?!

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,660
Whoa!

94
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,170
People aren’t supposed to think like that!

95
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,170
No!

96
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,510
They’re supposed to be patient

97
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,600
while the Chinese Communist Party fixes all
the problems

98
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,690
it totally didn’t cause in the first place.

99
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,610
And now, off the roads and into the sea.

100
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,520
The South China Sea.

101
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,110
Where Filipino fishermen are accusing

102
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,360
the Chinese Coast Guard of stealing their
fish.

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,680
Now, I know,

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,250
it seems unfair that people who have boats
like this

105
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,010
would need to steal food from people who have
boats like this.

106
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,220
But the Chinese ambassador explains.

107
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,460
“This is not harassment.

108
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,680
This is not confiscation.

109
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,240
It is some sort of barter trade.”

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,260
Yes, the kind of barter trade where

111
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,760
a Chinese Coast Guardsman boards a fishing
boat,

112
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,870
and puts their fish into his laundry basket.

113
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,610
And in return, the Filipino fishermen get...angry.

114
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,410
That’s a good trade.

115
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,540
Man, it sucks when your crimes get caught
on video.

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,600
And finally, the story you’ve been waiting
for.

117
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,500
A Chinese doctor removes a live leech from
inside a guy’s nose.

118
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,890
Yeah, I’d be surprised too if I were that
guy.

119
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,700
He’s a 51-year-old from Yunnan province.

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,220
Apparently, he’d been suffering from a nosebleed
for ten days,

121
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,910
when he finally decided, “You know what?

122
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,420
Maybe I should see a doctor about this.”

123
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,400
And the doctor decided,

124
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,730
“You know what?

125
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,100
Maybe some random person should stand next
to us

126
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,560
and shoot a video of this thing.

127
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,000
It’s going to be amazing.”

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,750
The guy thinks he got the leech in his nose

129
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,890
when he went swimming in a river.

130
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,460
Which is why I’m never going swimming again.

131
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,860
And that’s it for this week’s headlines,

132
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,190
but stay where you are,

133
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,730
because it’s time for another fan question

134
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,920
from one of our amazing fans

135
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,330
who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

136
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,680
T Yoc asks:

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,840
“Do you think it is still worthwhile going
to China

138
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,940
even with all that’s been going on?

139
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,450
I’ve been accepted for a study abroad opportunity
in Shanghai,

140
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,139
but a lot of the stuff I hear has me second
guessing

141
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,330
due to safety and political concerns.”

142
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,230
Great question.

143
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,150
Going to China could be interesting...

144
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,220
but also unnerving.

145
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,120
Everyone has a different experience.

146
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,300
If you decide to go there,

147
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,840
there’s obviously things you should be careful
about.

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,770
Like don’t talk about politics in class.

149
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,150
And use a VPN when you go online—

150
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,300
not one made in China.

151
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
And of course,

152
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,690
don’t go swimming in any rivers.

153
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,690
On the plus side,

154
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,040
you’ll probably meet a lot of cool people.

155
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,140
Look, you’ll be fine if you follow all the
rules.

156
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,420
But just keep in mind,

157
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,510
authorities could be monitoring what you do.

158
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,380
And don’t try to break anyone out of a labor
camp.

159
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,240
I know a bunch of China Uncensored fans

160
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,980
are actually foreigners living in China.

161
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,050
So maybe you guys can help out, too.

162
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,380
Give him your advice in the comments below.

163
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,840
What’s it like as a foreigner studying in
China?

164
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,790
What should you be careful about?

165
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,790
And to everyone,

166
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,970
thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

Well, that’s all folks.

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,760
But remember,

171
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,280
