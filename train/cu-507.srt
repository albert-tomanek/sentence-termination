00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,980
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,310
when an international court rules against
you,

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,430
and you’re all like...

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,720
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,529
China has been committed to peaceful development
in the South China Sea.

6
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,820
And nothing says peaceful development

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,320
like stockpiling surface-to-air missiles

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,359
and fighter jets

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,500
on artificial islands that China is totally
not militarizing.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,920
Those are civilian fighter jets.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,260
And civilian surface-to-air missiles.

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,020
But there's one country that just doesn’t
want to see peace in the South China Sea.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,350
"It is exactly one country

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,760
and let me not avoid mentioning the name:

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,870
that is, the Philippines…"

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,260
That's right. The Philippines.

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,930
It seems they disagree with China's territorial
claims.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,300
Now, the Chinese regime has always said

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,660
"sovereign countries should resolve disputes
through dialogue."

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,539
"[All sovereign nations have rights] to resolve
the issue

21
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:12,999
through direct dialogue with countries who
are involved in the (dispute)."

22
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:16,130
Except of course when the regime finds dialogue
inconvenient.

23
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,159
Like at the recent Asia-Europe Summit.

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,700
"The Asia Europe Meeting is not an appropriate
venue

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,920
to discuss the South China Sea issue.

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,799
But back in 2013,

27
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,959
despite all China's done to resolve disputes

28
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,569
through saying they want peaceful talks at
appropriate venues,

29
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:39,649
the Philippines sought out international arbitration
over the South China sea dispute.

30
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,329
Well, on Tuesday,

31
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,590
the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea tribunal in the Hague

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,849
ruled on China’s claims.

33
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,520
So here are the 5 things you need to know
about it.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,429
Number 5: What’s on the line

35
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:59,649
Five trillion dollars a year in shipping goes
through the South China Sea.

36
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,719
But there’s also a fortune in natural resources

37
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,429
like oil and fishing underneath those waters.

38
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:09,229
According to that United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea,

39
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,489
which China signed,

40
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:16,650
200 nautical miles off a country’s coast
is its Exclusive Economic Zone.

41
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,069
That means within those 200 miles,

42
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:24,060
all those sweet, sweet resources belong exclusively
to that country.

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,010
The problem is China’s claim overlaps everyone
else’s.

44
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,459
And that Hague tribunal was about whether
those claims are legitimate.

45
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,629
Number 4: The Military Build Up

46
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,750
The week before the ruling,

47
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,099
China’s People’s Liberation Army sectioned
off a chunk

48
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,150
of the South China Sea for military drills.

49
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,099
Just you know, to remind everyone that China
has a military,

50
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,489
in case anyone’s forgotten.

51
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,049
Which would be really hard to do

52
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:55,799
considering a lot of China’s claim to the
South China Sea

53
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,390
revolves around building artificial islands

54
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,340
on submerged reefs and stockpiling weapons
there.

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,010
The US has responded by sailing its military
through disputed waters.

56
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,450
So everything is really tense,

57
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,780
and there are a lot of guns!

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,709
What could go wrong?

59
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,010
Number 3: Are China’s Claims Legitimate?

60
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,810
Nope! At least that’s the unanimous decision
by the Hague tribunal.

61
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,299
“The Tribunal concluded that there was no
legal basis

62
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,900
for China to claim historic rights to resources
within the sea areas

63
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,510
falling within the ‘nine-dash line.’”

64
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,069
"This is an absolutely huge decision.

65
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,950
It doesn't come as a complete surprise

66
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,829
but to have the international court rule on
the illegitimacy of the Nine-dotted line

67
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,480
is a huge development.

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,579
The Tribunal also found that the artificial
islands built by China

69
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,620
“don’t freakin’ count.”

70
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,180
And it gets worse for China.

71
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,500
The tribunal also ruled that China

72
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,840
violated the Philippines’ sovereign rights in several ways.

73
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,269
Interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum
exploration.

74
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,430
Constructing artificial islands.

75
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,969
And failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from
fishing.

76
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:12,269
All in the Philippines' exclusive economic
zone.

77
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,309
Number 2: La la la I can’t hear you

78
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,099
That’s apparently now a legitimate legal
defense.

79
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:26,229
The Chinese regime has made it very clear
it’s not happy with this whole state affairs.

80
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,590
“We will have nothing to do with this illegal
so-called arbitration court case

81
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,419
which might create any sort of legal meaning
or relevant court order."

82
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,800
Now China is a signatory of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea.

83
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,520
That should mean

84
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,479
“China will be legally bound by the tribunal’s
decision,”

85
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,770
according to Jerome A. Cohen, Director of
the US-Asia Law Institute.

86
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,330
The problem is China will do what it wants,

87
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,580
and with a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council,

88
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,520
it has a lot of power to do just that.

89
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,430
In fact, very likely China will take another
country as it’s model

90
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,009
—the US.

91
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,520
Back in 1986, the US was aiding Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,360
Uhh, not that Contra.

93
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,330
The US was trying to undermine the socialist
government of Nicaragua, you understand.

94
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,750
When the International Court of Justice in
The Hague

95
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,370
awarded Nicaragua $370 million dollars in damages,

96
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,060
the US basically did what China is doing now

97
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,780
deny the court’s jurisdiction,

98
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,139
boycott the proceedings,

99
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,840
and ignore the verdict.

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,160
And when resolutions came through the UN Security
Council to make the US obey the ruling,

101
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,780
the US, as a permanent member of the Security
Council,

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,229
simply vetoed them.

103
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,479
So very likely, China will do the same.

104
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,319
"So yes, it is not strictly enforceable

105
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,000
but it is significant

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,599
and if it were not significant

107
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:01,279
then Beijing would not be reacting so vociferously
as they are."

108
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,960
and finally Number 1: China isn’t the only one that
disagrees with the ruling

109
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,349
China has managed to wrangle a coalition of
all its allies with,

110
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:14,620
sometimes less that transparent governments.

111
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,150
Countries like, Liberia, Madagascar, and Cambodia.

112
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,370
In all, the Chinese regime says it has about
70 countries behind it.

113
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,180
But here’s where it gets weird.

114
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,750
This might be one of the few times that China
and Taiwan agree on something.

115
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,569
The 9-Dash Line the Chinese regime bases most
of its claims on

116
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,370
actually was first claimed by the Republic
of China

117
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,879
that is, the government of China

118
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,449
before the Communists seized power.

119
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,569
In 1949, at the end of the Chinese civil war,

120
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:48,280
the Republic of China fled to Taiwan.

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,800
Taiwan is still officially the Republic of
China.

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,220
And while the communist People’s Republic
of China

123
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,810
refuses to recognize the Republic of China
as a legitimate government,

124
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,039
at least they both agree on the South China
Sea.

125
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,099
Or from the Communist Party's perspective,

126
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,439
at least they agree with..themselves.

127
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,750
“We again express that we will not accept
this,

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,750
and also maintain that this arbitration ruling

129
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,449
does not bear any legal consequences for the
Republic of China."

130
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,840
So what’s next for the South China Sea.

131
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,680
Was this truly a victory for China’s neighbors?

132
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,270
Or will nothing change?

133
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,020
Leave your comments below.

134
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,250
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

135
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,200
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,
see you next time.
