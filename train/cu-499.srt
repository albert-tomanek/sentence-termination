00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,320
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,930
China's master plan to rule the world...'s
financial system.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,670
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,150
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,180
If you've been watching this show for a while,

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,500
you know that China has plans for world domination.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,100
What's that, Shelley?

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
OK.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,600
So more accurately,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Chinese leaders are trying to give China more
global influence

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,529
be it with money, politics, or Confucius

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,710
to counterbalance what it calls "Western hegemony."

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,230
China's view is that the 21st century should
belong to China.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,640
But, according to my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,120
we in the West are just too arrogant to see
it.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,140
There are some problems with this plan, though.

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,350
And one of them is that the rest of the world
doesn't really want to trade in China's currency,

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,360
which is called the yuan,

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,289
or the Renminbi.

20
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,989
And you need a dominant currency to be a global
hegemon.

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,060
Gotta rule 'em all!

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,809
So whose currency dominates?

23
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,280
Well, here's one indication.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Every five years,

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,140
the International Monetary Fund determines
what's awkwardly called the Special Drawing

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,140
Rights,

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,380
or SDR.

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,530
Think of the SDR like a basket that contains
a few different countries' currencies.

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,490
It's made up of specific amounts of US dollars,
euros, British pounds and Japanese yen.

30
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,159
And then the basket itself acts like a unit
of currency that countries can trade.

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,450
The IMF picked these four currencies for the
SDR because of their stability,

32
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,600
as well as the fact that a lot of countries
actually hold them as part of their foreign

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
exchange reserves.

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
But now,

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,149
there's a new kid in town.

36
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,430
The Chinese yuan.

37
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,670
On November 30th,

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,790
the IMF announced that the new SDR basket
is going to have some Chinese currency in

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,790
it, too.

40
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:03,560
"The IMF's executive board decided that the
Renminbi qualified for the SDR basket and

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,719
existing criteria."

42
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,179
So what's going to happen when this takes
effect next October?

43
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,390
Well there's only so much room in the basket.

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,390
So now, something's got to make way for Mao.

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,390
In the new SDR,

46
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,900
the yuan will make up an even higher portion
than the pound or yen.

47
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,390
Some media are saying that the yuan could
eventually rival the US dollar.

48
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a huge move by the IMF.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,670
Partly because China is the only non-democracy
to be included in the SDR.

50
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,090
And that's a big concern for some people

51
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,230
because of the heavy-handed approach China
sometimes takes.

52
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,310
"Just the difficulty I think is that maybe
in the light of some of the extreme policies

53
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,760
that the government have been implementing
with regards to financial markets in China

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,790
such as devaluing the yuan,

55
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,890
such as making institutions not being able
to sell their shares for a certain number

56
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,890
of months,

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,680
quite extreme policies that are taking place,

58
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,630
maybe suggesting that China is not quite ready
for this."

59
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,630
See?

60
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
China isn't ready for this.

61
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,280
It's going to completely destroy...

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,650
Wait.

63
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,849
What's that Shelley?

64
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,400
Roll the rest of the clip?

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,069
"You know, if the IMF can bring China in and
consult with them on the kind of policies

66
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,620
that are being used in more developed countries,

67
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,129
China can be brought on board and be shown
the benefits of doing so.

68
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,099
It has only got to be a positive in terms
of Chinese reforms."

69
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,710
Wait, so it's a good thing?

70
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,730
Shelley, I'm getting mixed messages.

71
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,820
Can you just come over here and help sort
this out?

72
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,800
Sure, Chris.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,209
So China's inclusion in the SDR:

74
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,370
Danger to America, or Extreme Danger to America?

75
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,400
Uh, neither, Chris.

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,709
This could actually be a good thing.

77
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,269
The US government has been frustrated for
a long time with the way the Chinese government

78
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,060
manipulates its currency.

79
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,439
And now getting into the SDR has forced China
to clean up its act somewhat.

80
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,010
And if Chinese leaders want to continue to
make the yuan more influential,

81
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,310
they will have to make reforms that will eventually
allow the yuan to be traded at a fair price

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,360
determined by the international market.

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,570
Ahh, so, China thinks it's getting more power,

84
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,880
but it's a trap.

85
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,100
Like what happened to Jafar.

86
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,220
"You wanted to be a genie?

87
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,240
You got it."

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
"What?"

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,510
"And everything that goes with it."

90
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,510
"Noooooo!"

91
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,910
Well... sort of.

92
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,490
It's true, there are a lot of constraints
that come with being a global reserve currency.

93
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,340
For example, now China is supposed to be more
transparent and enforce regulations.

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,020
But China wasn't tricked into it like Jafar
was.

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,910
I think Chinese leaders were just ready to
make the sacrifices.

96
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,130
So what benefits does China actually get from
the yuan being in the SDR?

97
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,280
It'll probably encourage more countries to
use yuan in their foreign transactions.

98
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,120
It'll also make it easier for China to borrow
money.

99
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,729
But the biggest effect is symbolic:

100
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,419
It raises China's prestige.

101
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,210
It's a double-edged sword, though,

102
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,070
because this will also probably push up the
value of the yuan.

103
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,580
And that will make it harder for China to
sell its exports.

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,410
That's not good news in the short term,

105
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,509
because China is an export-driven economy
that's already in a slowdown.

106
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,100
But in the long-term it's healthier for the
Chinese economy if there's less artificial

107
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,990
control over the currency.

108
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,500
So, this could eventually be a good thing.

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,200
So what does this mean for the US dollar?

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,560
It doesn't really affect the dollar at all.

111
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,009
What really makes a currency powerful is whether
people actually want to use it in business

112
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,100
transactions.

113
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,490
The vast majority of global payments are still
made in dollars or euros.

114
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,030
This year, only 2.8 percent of global payments
were in yuan.

115
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,440
So again, it's mainly symbolic.

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,210
For the American economy overall,

117
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,289
it's better if the yuan goes up in value.

118
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,120
So this could eventually be a good thing.

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,750
So China's currency isn't the greatest threat
America's ever faced?

120
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,730
Shark attacks are a greater threat.

121
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,600
Shark attacks are as big a threat as China?!

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,930
All right, everyone out of the water!

123
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,570
Thanks, Shelley.

124
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,080
Meet me later today at the beach.

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,699
Bring your harpoon.

126
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,699
