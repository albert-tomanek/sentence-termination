1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,000
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,050
China’s pouring money into its team of 16
in Europe.

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,149
Just to make sure that when it really counts,

4
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:11,600
somebody’s going to know which way to kick
the ball.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,480
Wait, no, no!

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,280
Not that...way.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,080
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
I’m Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,779
You know, international politics and sports
are a lot alike.

10
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,580
You train hard, play your heart out,

11
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,660
and in the end…

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,390
the team with the most money wins.

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,579
Obviously everyone wants their team to be
the best.

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,160
And over the years, Europe has produced lots
of champions.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,100
“Italy! World Cup champions...”

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,420
“Spain are the kings of world football.”

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,340
“That is it! Germany are the champions of
the world!”

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,580
Europe has also produced champions of human
rights.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,760
“We recommend an international investigation

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,770
into forced organ harvesting in China,”

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,250
And more than once,

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,250
Europe was willing to address

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,760
one of the most difficult human rights issues
in China.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,760
In July 2016, the European Parliament,

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,670
which represents 28 countries,

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,260
passed this declaration on stopping organ

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,909
harvesting\hfrom prisoners of conscience in
China.

28
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,060
And even before that,

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,090
Parliament passed this resolution,

30
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,090
which “expresses its deep concern

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,740
over the persistent and credible reports of
systematic,

32
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,850
state‑sanctioned organ harvesting” in
China.

33
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,100
And they called for the EU to investigate.

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,240
Well, to make sure this kind of embarrassing

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,549
exposé of their human rights problems

36
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,329
doesn’t happen again,

37
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,439
the Chinese Communist Party

38
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,060
is going on a spending spree.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,399
To see if some players on team Europe

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,509
could “accidentally” fumble the ball sometimes.

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,600
Like Greece.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,920
In our episode from December,

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,369
Shelley talked about how while the rest of
Europe

44
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,580
was busy squeezing Greece,

45
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,810
China showed up with cargo containers full
of cash.

46
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,299
And in a move that

47
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,119
was definitely in no way related,

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,030
Greece blocked an EU statement

49
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,950
on China’s human rights...

50
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,150
one that the EU usually makes every year.

51
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,290
Greece’s European pals were not impressed.

52
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,209
“The global human rights agenda

53
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,280
is best served when the EU speaks with one
voice,”

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,740
an EU spokesperson said.

55
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,550
Which is diplomat-speak for,

56
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,390
“Hey Greece, that was not cool.”

57
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,980
But China loved it.

58
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,040
So much, in fact,

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,590
that it wants to buy a whole team of players
like Greece.

60
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,470
It’s even got a name: 16 + 1.

61
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,840
That is, 16 Central and Eastern European nations,

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,580
plus one owner-slash-manager with deep pockets—

63
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
China!

64
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,400
11 of those 16 countries

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,420
are on the field with the EU,

66
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,500
and 5 are on the bench.

67
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,849
Team 16 is already getting lots of criticism.

68
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,870
Not just in Brussels—

69
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,190
the informal capital of the EU—

70
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,590
but across the entire continent.

71
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,590
One problem,

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,640
according to an unnamed European diplomat,

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,129
is that China is using Team 16

74
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:09,110
to change laws in Europe.

75
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,810
“Some of them are touching on

76
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,000
areas where there are already initiatives

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,440
between the EU and China.

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,569
And we only see the tip of the iceberg.”

79
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,260
Ah…the “tip of the iceberg.”

80
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,319
Don’t worry.

81
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,250
Icebergs are probably nothing to worry about.

82
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,989
But that warning seems lost on some countries.

83
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,150
“In Hungary Chinese Investment

84
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,720
is hailed as the ‘Eastward Opening.’

85
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,850
Serbian authorities see it as the glue

86
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,159
in a ‘reliable friendship,’

87
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,020
while the Polish government describes it as

88
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,580
a ‘tremendous opportunity.’”

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,650
An Eastward Opening?

90
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,330
Oh, I think I see one…go…go….oh…no!

91
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,840
That wasn’t supposed to happen.

92
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,319
Anyway, it’s obvious why

93
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,780
Team 16 wants China.

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,280
China is investing billions of dollars

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,159
in building infrastructure that will hopefully

96
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,930
spur other economic development in their countries.

97
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,650
In fact, since 2012,

98
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,770
Chinese companies have announced

99
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,739
15 billion dollars worth of investment.

100
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,209
It’s now all being wrapped into

101
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,610
China’s One Belt, One Road Initiative.

102
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,280
And roads are getting built.

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,739
In 2014,

104
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,780
Chinese state-owned power company and bank

105
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,660
agreed to build a 1.5 billion dollar to highway
in Bosnia.

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,410
And a year later, a different Chinese company

107
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,870
signed a 3.6 billion dollar deal

108
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,020
to build a highway between

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,440
Albania and Montenegro.

110
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,970
These are glorious, heady times.

111
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,600
At least until it’s time to repay

112
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,220
those billions of dollars in loans.

113
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,810
But they’ll cross that bridge

114
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,320
when they come to it.

115
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,900
Hopefully.

116
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,300
Of course,

117
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,580
the Chinese Communist Party is thrilled.

118
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,340
Because it stands to buy 16 players in Europe,

119
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,620
each willing to take one for the team.

120
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,660
And that starts to add up.

121
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,780
Like with Hungary—

122
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,640
which has been hungry for Chinese investment.

123
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,240
Last March, Hungary blocked an EU joint letter

124
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,060
that would have denounced the torture

125
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,780
of jailed rights lawyers in China.

126
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,020
And in July 2015,

127
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,180
Greece, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia

128
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,810
managed to take out a direct reference to
China

129
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,120
in an EU statement about a court ruling

130
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
that struck down China’s legal claims

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,430
over the South China Sea.

132
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,050
Now that’s the team spirit!

133
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,640
Knocking some of the teeth out of

134
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,070
Europe’s “one voice” policy on China

135
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,660
is definitely part of the plan,

136
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,900
say EU officials.

137
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,710
“China’s strategy in Europe is divide
and rule,”

138
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,710
said Franck Proust,

139
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,900
a French Member of European Parliament.

140
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,300
“And it’s working because the 27 EU member
states

141
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,539
are incapable to remain in solidarity with
each other.”

142
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:42,610
But the bigger danger is that China could

143
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,729
use its influence to change laws inside Europe.

144
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,610
Already, China is suspected of using

145
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,560
its money and influence to change

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,830
an important EU initiative—

147
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,680
that is, EU-wide screening

148
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,660
of foreign investments.

149
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,669
The push for screenings comes as Chinese investment
skyrockets.

150
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:01,669
Which also makes countries

151
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:03,479
more dependent on Chinese money,

152
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,090
and less eager to criticize the Chinese regime.

153
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,940
But “China’s lobbying has already proved
effective

154
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,009
in diluting the proposed review process.”

155
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,830
Basically, the screening process

156
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,030
originally would have allowed the EU

157
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,889
to block Chinese investments

158
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,100
that threatened national security—

159
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,340
like CFIUS does in the United States.

160
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,090
But in the diluted version,

161
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,669
it merely “allows EU institutions

162
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,190
to give guidance.”

163
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,389
That’s like the TSA changing

164
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,840
its airport screening policy to a suggestion.

165
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,620
“We, uh, suggest that you take your laptop

166
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,490
out of your bag and walk through this metal
detector

167
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,710
and—and hey, hey!

168
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,710
Get back here, guys!

169
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,570
I was suggesting it for everyone’s own good!”

170
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,150
I mean, I’d like fewer airport screenings
too—

171
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,190
unless I found out the group lobbying for
it was ISIS.

172
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,190
So anyway,

173
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,950
the Chinese regime has made some progress

174
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,750
at weakening the power of the EU.

175
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,530
Some pro-EU politicians are worried

176
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,050
that Team 16 countries might use their

177
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,349
strong bilateral ties with China as leverage

178
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,240
with which to fight against Brussels.

179
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,760
And that has Sigmar Gabriel,

180
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,169
Germany’s foreign minister, very concerned.

181
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:15,680
He says, “If we do not succeed

182
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,139
in developing a single strategy towards China,

183
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,539
then China will succeed in dividing Europe.”

184
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,930
If true, this is bad news for fans of

185
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,750
a strong, united Europe.

186
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,350
Especially as the Chinese regime

187
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,020
takes advantage of Brexit

188
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,599
to further weaken the EU.

189
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,599
Pro-EU enthusiasts see

190
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,169
long-lasting peace and prosperity

191
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,729
as a major benefit of unification—

192
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,310
a benefit that’s shared among friends.

193
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,130
But, when it comes to high-stakes politics,

194
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,220
it may be like former Governor of Texas

195
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,400
Ann Richards famously said:

196
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,080
“In politics your enemies can’t hurt you,

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,539
but your friends will kill you.”

198
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,270
Especially if your friends are the kind of
people

199
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,550
who like buying soccer teams...

200
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,599
...and torturing dissidents.

201
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,480
So what do you think about China’s investment
in Europe?

202
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,610
Is China building a winning team,

203
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,900
or just making sure when push comes to shove,

204
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,129
it’s got someone to help them score?
