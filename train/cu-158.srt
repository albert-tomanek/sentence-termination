1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,070
Are these Chinese military police gathering
near Hong Kong?

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,700
A new poll says more Americans See China as
a Threat.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,170
And the Communist Party declares war on Buddhist
statues.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,780
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,640
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,039
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,349
This week’s China news headlines!

8
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,060
What you’re looking at is a satellite photo

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,720
of China’s Shenzhen Bay Sports Center,

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,179
filled with what appears to be

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,950
more than 100 armored military vehicles.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,610
That sports center is only 10 miles

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,860
from the border with Hong Kong.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,740
Some people fear the Chinese military is preparing
for an attack,

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,020
to quell the protests that have erupted in
the city

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,210
for the past two months.

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,090
I, however, am just amazed those alleged armored
trucks

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,620
are keeping off the grass.

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,900
On Thursday, reporters witnessed China’s
paramilitary police force,

20
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,580
the People’s Armed Police,

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,040
doing drills in the stadium,

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,920
and shot footage of police and their vehicles
outside.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,460
According to my favorite Chinese state-run
media,

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,690
the Global Times,

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,600
the military police were massing in Shenzhen

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,150
“in advance of apparent large-scale exercises.”

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,750
Oh I get it, that’s why they’re at the
stadium.

28
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,820
It really was for large-scale exercises.

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,470
Clearly nothing to do with Hong Kong.

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,910
Even though one of the exercises involved
some police

31
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,330
“wearing black t-shirts similar to those
worn by protesters in Hong Kong”

32
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,530
While another group of police

33
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,240
“practiced charging at them” with riot
shields.

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,591
So does this mean that Chinese military police

35
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,000
are minutes from marching into Hong Kong?

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,170
Is it time to panic?!

37
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,390
Not so fast.

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,710
The Chinese Communist Party is keenly aware

39
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,500
that the optics of sending in the People’s
Armed Police

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,100
to crush a peaceful democracy movement in
Hong Kong,

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,700
is not a good look.

42
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,360
Especially during the 30th anniversary

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,810
of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,450
But the Party also wants Hongkongers to worry
that

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,270
they could send in the military police.

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,370
So it’s time to stop protesting because
the Communist Party

47
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,300
wouldn’t want anything bad to happen to
Hong Kong.

48
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,720
That they might be forced to do.

49
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,950
US officials have suggested

50
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,490
removing Hong Kong’s special trade status

51
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,330
if China intervenes in the protests.

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,800
Which once again shows who’s really

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,190
to blame for the Hong Kong protests.

54
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,030
The United States.

55
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,270
Yes, “Official state media pin the blame
for protests

56
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,610
on the ‘black hand’ of foreign interference,

57
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,590
namely from the United States.”

58
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,180
Which really hurts President Trump’s feelings.

59
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,000
China’s Foreign Ministry also accused

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,170
Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell

61
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,750
of inciting chaos in Hong Kong.

62
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,750
Which is ridiculous.

63
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,350
These two people could never work together
on anything.

64
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,860
Other Chinese media published a photo

65
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,860
of a US diplomat speaking with protesters,

66
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,190
under the headline Foreign Forces Intervene.

67
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,290
Those reports have gone from irresponsible
to dangerous,

68
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,270
according to the US State Department.

69
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,050
They accused the Chinese government

70
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,840
of leaking personal information about

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,880
that U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong,

72
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,090
including the names of her children.

73
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,190
But the disinformation doesn’t stop at blaming

74
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,860
everything on the US and endangering children.

75
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,360
No, they’re way more sophisticated than
that.

76
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,040
After one young protester lost her eye to
a police bean bag,

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,480
CCTV posted this photo,

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,420
alleging it was the same girl,

79
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,410
that she wasn’t actually injured,

80
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,700
and that she’s being paid off.

81
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,340
Of course, that’s not the same girl,

82
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,530
but I guess CCTV has a hard time telling Chinese
people apart.

83
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,731
Of course you can’t be sure of

84
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:33,120
the intentions of all of the protesters.

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,500
Especially after Hong Kong Free Press released
this video.

86
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,420
Why are protesters beating and arresting other
protesters?

87
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,950
It’s because they were actually Hong Kong
policemen.

88
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,910
They’ve now admitted to “disguising”
themselves

89
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,239
as protesters to go undercover.

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,720
Of course, this is in no way part of Beijing’s
disinformation campaign

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,010
to incite conflict and make protesters seem
violent.

92
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,459
That’s ridiculous.

93
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,420
“I can say that during the time

94
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,920
when our police officers were disguised,

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,769
firstly they would not provoke anything.

96
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,700
Reporter: “People have seen them yesterday
provoking”

97
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,060
“We won't ask them to stir up trouble,

98
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,420
and we won't ask them to conduct illegal acts.”

99
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,509
So you see?

100
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,939
Any rumors you may have heard about

101
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,620
communist spies dressing up as protesters
to start trouble

102
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,509
are completely ridiculous.

103
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,120
Why would they need to do that when they have

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,939
the Hong Kong police to do it for them!

105
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,139
But stories like that may be putting protesters
on edge.

106
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,240
Which could be why protesters surrounded three
different men

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,120
during a protest on Tuesday

108
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,629
and accused them of being undercover police.

109
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,719
Two of them had to be taken away by ambulance

110
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,770
after being roughed up by the crowd.

111
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,919
Even though this man claimed he was a tourist,

112
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,960
protesters say he was acting suspiciously.

113
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,129
Turns out, he’s a reporter for the Global
Times.

114
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,889
And now a hero in the Mainland.

115
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,069
Must be why the editor in chief of the Global
Times

116
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,689
said Hong Kong protesters should be shot on
the spot.

117
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,889
Obviously not the protesters who are your
undercover agents.

118
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,419
The other ones.

119
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,110
That incident happened at a recent five-day
protest

120
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,189
inside the Hong Kong airport.

121
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,860
The first three days were peaceful.

122
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
The fourth day,

123
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,280
the Hong Kong government cancelled all flights,

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
thousands of them,

125
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,999
leading to tensions between protesters and
travelers.

126
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:19,999
On the fifth day,

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,029
the government sent in police to break it
up.

128
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,800
Flights have since resumed.

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,530
Time to visit Hong Kong!

130
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,090
It’s the Pearl of the Orient!

131
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,840
And it seems like Hong Kong police

132
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,610
are getting at least some of their strategies

133
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,949
from major Hollywood blockbusters.

134
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,289
This is police firing tear gas...

135
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,400
in a subway...

136
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,300
at very close range.

137
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,110
That’s horrible.

138
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,759
Now it probably smells almost as bad as the
New York subway.

139
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,539
And China has rejected a US Navy request

140
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,401
to dock ships in Hong Kong

141
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:54,229
later this month and in September.

142
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,110
Finally, the Communist Party is doing something

143
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,389
to protect peace in the region!

144
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:01,309
Meanwhile, in a show of support for Hong Kong,

145
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:05,550
Taiwan is offering Hong Kongers who come to
Taiwan humanitarian aid.

146
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,279
Which, it’s shocking to think of Hong Kong

147
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,559
as a place where people now flee from to get
humanitarian aid.

148
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,529
And of course, in response to the offer,

149
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,710
the Chinese Communist Party told Taiwan

150
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,930
to remove its black hands from Hong Kong.

151
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,639
But I wouldn’t want you to think the only
China news this week

152
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,669
comes from Hong Kong.

153
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,669
According to US Ambassador-at-Large

154
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,169
for International Religious Freedom, Sam Brownback,

155
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,719
the US may consider sanctions on Chinese tech
companies

156
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:34,789
involved in the persecution of Uighur Muslims.

157
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,740
“Regarding possible sanctions on high-tech
Chinese companies

158
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,960
involved in the oppression Uighurs,

159
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,479
Brownback said they are ‘never off the table’

160
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,009
and ‘always a possibility.’”

161
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,499
So...we may be soon seeing the headline

162
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:52,460
“Trump Administration Sanctions China for
Persecuting Muslims.”

163
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,030
We are living in the strangest timeline.

164
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,210
Meanwhile, Coach and Versace

165
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,059
have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.

166
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,520
The Chinese internet exploded in rage at the
discovery

167
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,099
of t-shirts suggesting Hong Kong, Macau,

168
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,430
and Taiwan were separate from China.

169
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,710
They should really take a lesson from Hermes.

170
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,270
Let’s just say,

171
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,379
they know how to navigate Chinese sensibilities

172
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:18,319
with this one-of-a-kind and extremely patriotic
Birkin bag.

173
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,449
And at the low low price of only 124 thousand
dollars!

174
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,180
It’s such a steal.

175
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,550
That’s not a joke.

176
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,869
Birkin bags can go for up to $300,000 dollars.

177
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,679
Maybe the fact that this bag is so cheap

178
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,809
hurts the feelings of the Chinese people.

179
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,050
You’d better be careful about playing video
games.

180
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,759
Because that’s the latest target of

181
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,009
one of China’s most prolific hacker groups.

182
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,159
According to this report by cybersecurity
firm Fire Eye,

183
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,360
The group, known as advanced persistent threat
41,

184
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,259
or APT41,

185
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,709
injected malicious code into legitimate files

186
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:56,439
that were later distributed as video game
updates.

187
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,069
The reason this is significant is because

188
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,080
it means a state level operator

189
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,059
normally engaged in espionage activities

190
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,819
has taken to financial crime.

191
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,449
It’s always good to diversify.

192
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,250
But it’s not just the video game industry
APT41 is targeting.

193
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,809
They’re hitting other industries like “Healthcare,”

194
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,569
“Media,” “Pharmaceuticals,” “Education,”

195
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:17,979
as well as “High-Tech” sectors.

196
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:19,779
I just hope they don’t hit the

197
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,590
“small team making videos about China on
YouTube” sector.

198
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,229
And it’s really not too surprising that

199
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:27,770
this new poll by the Pew Research Center

200
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,419
shows Americans’ view of China

201
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,449
is becoming increasingly negative.

202
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,560
“60% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion
of China,

203
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,440
up from 47% in 2018

204
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,580
and at the highest level since Pew Research
Center

205
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,350
began asking the question.”

206
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,100
China is also tied with Russia

207
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,350
as the perceived greatest threat to America.

208
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,350
Greatest threat?

209
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,270
Apparently most American’s haven’t yet
heard of…

210
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,590
pumpkin spice spam!

211
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,890
And finally, the Chinese Communist Party seems
to have it out...

212
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,270
for Buddha.

213
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,220
Buddha statues across the country are being
demolished,

214
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
according to Bitter Winter,

215
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,870
a magazine on religious and human rights in
China.

216
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,520
Some are being dismantled.

217
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,010
Others demolished.

218
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,030
Of course, the Communist Party is surely doing
this

219
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,220
to protect the Chinese people from Buddhist
extremists

220
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,330
who might terrorize China.

221
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,380
Such as by blowing things up across the country.

222
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,940
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

223
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,330
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

224
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,070
a fan who support China Uncensored

225
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,050
with a dollar or more per episode,

226
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,700
by contributing through Patreon.

227
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,380
LT Straven asks,

228
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,200
“do we know any other nations in the world

229
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,150
who have shown any manner of support for Hong
Kong

230
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,900
and have done so clearly/visibly?”

231
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,760
I’d say so far the US and Taiwan

232
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,260
have probably shown the most support for the
Hong Kong protesters.

233
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
As I mentioned,

234
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Taiwan is offering aid to Hong Kongers who
come to the island,

235
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,180
and there’s been mass demonstrations in
Taiwan

236
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,320
showing solidarity with Hong Kong protesters.

237
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Many high ranking US politicians

238
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,050
in the Trump Administration and Senate

239
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,070
have also voiced their support.

240
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,210
However, as of yet, there’s been no concrete
action taken.

241
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,590
I mean, other than being the black hands

242
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,770
secretly behind the entire protest movement.

243
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,640
Sadly though, the UK government

244
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,620
has been kind of quiet about the whole thing,

245
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,310
which is disappointing since the UK has certain
moral—

246
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,590
if not legal—

247
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,220
obligations to its former colony.

248
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,620
The UK made an agreement with the Chinese
Communist Party

249
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,560
called the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

250
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,020
It set up the one country two systems model

251
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,160
and was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong’s

252
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,890
freedom and independence.

253
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,700
Two years ago that China made it clear

254
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,840
they didn’t consider that deal to have any
meaning.

255
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,690
And the British, being British,

256
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,320
apologized and quietly walked away.

257
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,900
Thanks for your question.

258
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,930
And if you have a question for me

259
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,700
you want to hear answered on the show,

260
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,400
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

261
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,070
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

262
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,290
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

263
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,050
we would have to shut down the show

264
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,090
if it weren’t for your support.

265
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,170
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

266
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,500
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

267
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,800
See you next time.
