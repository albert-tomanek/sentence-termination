00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,820
did someone just drop a bomb on Beijing?!

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,400
Welcome back, Chris Chappell here.

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:13,410
What happened in Beijing?!

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,239
Did North Korea launch a missile?

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,800
It looks like a war zone!

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,010
What’s that, Shelley?

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,410
Oh, I’m sorry, that isn’t a war zone.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,720
What you’re looking at...is progress!

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,910
I mean, not progress.

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,740
That sounds so self-serving.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,100
What you’re looking at the Communist Party’s
deep,

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,890
caring concern for the welfare of the common
people.

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,570
Funny how concern looks like wholesale destruction.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,999
This is Daxing district.

16
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:44,280
It’s home to many of Beijing’s estimated

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,570
8.1 million migrant workers.

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,570
Just to give you an idea

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,460
of how many people 8.1 million is,

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,820
it’s like the entire population of New York
City.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,120
But all crammed into a city

22
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,530
with 3 times as many people.

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,719
Plus add terrible traffic and unbreathable
air.

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,330
And if you think the living conditions

25
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,970
for the average New Yorker are bad...

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,320
well, you’re right actually.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,050
But for Beijing’s migrant workers,

28
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,000
it’s so much worse.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,410
A million of them literally live underground.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,410
On the plus side,

31
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,900
if things ever do go south with North Korea,

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,760
the migrant workers are already living in
bomb shelters.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,640
I can see the real estate agent

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,350
trying to rent out this apartment.

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,100
An exclusive opportunity

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,050
to live three floors underground

37
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,300
in a historic air defense bunker.

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,690
It has high ceilings!

39
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,230
Spacious closets!

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,170
Washing machine in the building!

41
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,600
Truly a steal.

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,770
China’s migrant workers

43
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,450
travel from their tiny villages

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,650
in the economically depressed countryside

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,790
to big cities like Beijing to find work.

46
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,850
That means they don’t have the residence
permits

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,600
that would let them officially stay in the
cities

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,250
and do things like send their kids to school.

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,150
Migrant workers have fueled China’s economic
boom.

50
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,150
And unsurprisingly

51
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,110
“Migrant workers doing construction

52
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,210
and service jobs

53
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,670
are often poorly paid

54
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,210
and lack any semblance of workers’ rights.”

55
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,210
And many of their homes

56
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,540
are not exactly what we would call up to code.

57
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,380
That’s why a massive fire broke out last
month.

58
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,040
It killed 19 people

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,430
and made thousands of others homeless.

60
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,080
So the authorities responded

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,720
by providing warm food,

62
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,430
a place to stay…

63
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,580
…Haha, just kidding.

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,090
The CCP used it as an excuse

65
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,510
to kick everyone out of the neighborhood,

66
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,410
demolish all the buildings,

67
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,410
and leave them homeless

68
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,970
on the streets of Beijing,

69
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,290
where the nighttime temperatures

70
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,020
were several degrees below freezing.

71
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,740
It’s for the good of the people.

72
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,990
In some cases,

73
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,050
residents only got a few hours’ notice.

74
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,910
“Word comes out you have to move,

75
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,959
and the machines are coming in

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,550
and destroying buildings.”

77
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,630
“Why do you treat us like this?

78
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,480
It's not like we’re foreigners.

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,590
We are Chinese.

80
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,723
Let’s say you want us to move out,

81
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,750
to go back to our hometowns,

82
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,040
that's fine.

83
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,620
But give us a couple of days to do this, right?

84
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,720
One day is not enough.”

85
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,700
I guess you’d call these people

86
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,900
the huddled masses yearning to be free.

87
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,900
And don’t worry,

88
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,959
there were swarms of warmly dressed police
officers around

89
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,209
to make sure everyone did as they were told.

90
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,480
And just to be clear,

91
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,910
these newly homeless migrants

92
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,190
aren’t just the people whose homes burned
down.

93
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,540
It includes tens of thousands of people

94
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,850
in the surrounding areas, too.

95
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,380
In fact, Beijing announced

96
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,459
a 40-day “safety” campaign

97
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,160
to clear out “illegal structures.”

98
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,910
Because forcing the migrant workers

99
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,709
out into the freezing weather

100
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,830
with practically nothing but the clothes on
their backs

101
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,720
was totally about their safety.

102
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,450
It is absolutely not a pretext for the Party

103
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,800
to carry out a population control plan

104
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,400
they had announced in September.

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,250
Or the fact that the freshly evacuated real
estate

106
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,930
is worth a lot of money.

107
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,940
Since, you know,

108
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,500
in China, there are no meaningful private
property rights,

109
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,610
and local governments typically make about

110
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,420
40% of their revenue from land sales.

111
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,920
Fortunately for the homeless migrants,

112
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,440
they’re not completely out of luck.

113
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,209
There has been an outpouring of support

114
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,340
from people across the city.

115
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,280
Fellow citizens have donated food,

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,740
clothing, and temporary housing.

117
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,690
The people of Beijing really came together

118
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,210
to help each other.

119
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,710
There’s also an open letter to authorities

120
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,660
written by more than 100 scholars,

121
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,080
lawyers, and artists

122
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,250
protesting the evictions.

123
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,770
People also protested the way

124
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,930
Chinese state-run media

125
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,770
callously referred to the migrants

126
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,160
as Beijing’s “low-end population.”

127
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,990
So how did authorities respond to the public
outcry?

128
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,180
By ordering the media

129
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,880
to censor all references to the evictions.

130
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,560
And then authorities tried to shut down

131
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,620
local people’s attempts to help the migrants.

132
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Because you know,

133
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,540
they were making the Communist Party look
bad.

134
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,840
But even though the Party is censoring TV,

135
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
newspapers,

136
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
and even social media—

137
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,690
people are still going to notice

138
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,139
that something happened to all the migrant
workers.

139
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,960
Like when no one is around to deliver their
food.

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,770
“The ripple effect of the mass evictions

141
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,720
has swept the city—

142
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,200
fashionable restaurants without waiters,

143
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
airport ground staff

144
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,850
and security personnel left homeless,

145
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,280
online shopping blocked

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,880
as Beijing delivery services are disrupted

147
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,180
by distribution warehouses suddenly bulldozed.”

148
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,740
Chinese authorities have bitten off

149
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,360
more than they can chew with this one.

150
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,900
This is just one of two huge scandals

151
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,270
to hit Beijing back to back.

152
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,520
The other one, we reported on last week.

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,110
There are allegations of sexual abuse

154
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,990
at an expensive kindergarten

155
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,180
targeting the upper middle class.

156
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,800
According to Weiboscope,

157
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,240
which tracks censorship on Chinese social
media,

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,460
“the level of censorship in recent days

159
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,169
was even higher than during

160
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,490
the politically sensitive Communist Party’s

161
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,419
five-yearly national congress in October.”

162
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,410
Which is insane.

163
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,110
The Party Congress is one the most

164
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,100
politically sensitive events there is.

165
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,120
And these scandals even have surpassed

166
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,509
that level of censorship.

167
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,880
Over the last couple weeks,

168
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,810
the CCP has managed to alienate

169
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,860
both the poor and the middle class

170
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,840
of Chinese society.

171
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,449
Even the censors are complaining

172
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,320
they can’t keep up.

173
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,720
So what will the impact be?

174
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,900
For the migrant workers themselves,

175
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,630
the ones who can’t find another place to
live

176
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,509
are mostly going home quietly.

177
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:37,970
There’s not much else they can do.

178
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,030
Overall, it’s hard to say right now

179
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,930
what the economic impact of this will be.

180
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,930
And remember,

181
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,550
Beijing typically sets an example

182
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,419
for the rest of the country.

183
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,120
So probably we will see evictions in other
cities

184
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,740
of more migrant workers—

185
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,800
a.k.a. the “low-end population”.

186
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,919
And a nationwide campaign to evict migrants

187
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,229
could cause a national uproar...

188
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,860
or maybe just give real estate developers

189
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
more great business opportunities.

190
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,919
Look at this place.

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,919
So rustic!

192
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,130
So much open space!

193
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,740
Lots of light!

194
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,720
It’s a steal.

195
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,730
So what do you think?

196
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,840
Has the Communist Party crossed a line?

197
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,520

You know,

202
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,240
it’s about time that the Chinese Communist
Party

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,720
got their own eviction notice.

204
