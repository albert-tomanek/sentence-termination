1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,590
Protests erupt across Hong Kong.

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,220
Chief executive Carrie Lam

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,890
called them "organized riots."

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,560
So I'm braving the danger,

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,260
and heading into the chaos.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,240
It was the night of Sunday, June 16th,

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,830
right after two million people

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,960
took to the streets of Hong Kong.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,030
They were protesting a controversial extradition
bill

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,029
that could see Hong Kong authorities

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,240
send people to mainland China for trial.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,769
Hong Kong's chief excutive, Carrie Lam,

13
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,700
called last week's protests "organized riots."

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,260
That's after Hong Kong police launched

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,289
150 tear gas canisters into the crowd.

16
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,660
I mean, Sunday's protest seemed pretty peaceful,

17
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,140
at least during the day.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,820
It was Father's Day, after all.

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,280
But as night fell,

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,300
a fringe group of extremists

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,100
occupied this eight-lane highway

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,129
near the Hong Kong government offices.

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,030
And I could smell trouble in the air.

24
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,170
Shelley, what are you doing?

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,200
Why aren't you in your safety gear?

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,760
What?

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
What are you doing?

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,670
Why aren't you in your safety gear?

29
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,670
Don't you know this is where the protest

30
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,840
turned violent last week?

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,960
Have you looked around?

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,400
I really think it's fine.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,130
But I wasn't convinced.

34
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,140
The place looked like a warzone.

35
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,120
Is that a tank?!

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,420
That's definitely a bus...

37
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,590
with pandas.

38
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,650
She may have a point.

39
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,399
This doesn't exactly sound like a warcry.

40
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,600
Sing Hallelujah to the Lord!

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,360
And the police didn't exactly seem on-edge.

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,040
In fact, it didn't eveen seem like

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,500
they needed to be there.

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,760
Though clearly, someone should've called the
grammar police.

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,960
Are you sure it's safe?

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,900
Why don't we walk around and talk to some
people?

47
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,240
Okay...

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,140
But I'm at least wearing the helmet and the
googles.

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,400
Were these a bunch of mastermind rioters

50
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,509
waiting around for a chance to strike?

51
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:06,630
Or just a bunch of kids standing around,

52
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,270
looking at their cellphones?

53
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,220
Or sitting around, looking at their cellphones?

54
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,230
Or lying around, looking at their cellphones?

55
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,280
Kids these days...

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,950
So are you one of these violent protesters

57
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,950
I keep hearing about?

58
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,950
No.

59
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,950
Where are those people?

60
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,440
Sorry?

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,060
Where are they?

62
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,120
Where are those violent protesters?

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
I'm freaked out.

64
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,940
I'm not sure.

65
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,700
Are you one of those violent protestors I've
heard about?

66
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,200
No, no!

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Definitely not!

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,600
I am a peaceful protester.

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,580
That's what a violent protester would say!

70
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,180
Are you one of those violent protestors?

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,780
No, I am not, well, I'm scared too.

72
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,620
I don't support being violent.

73
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,160
So you're one of those violent protestors
I've heard about?

74
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,980
Nope.

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,640
This doesn't make sense.

76
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,860
Carrie Lam said these were rioters.

77
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,760
Does that mean this wasn't an appropriate
use of force?

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,000
Well so then who got violent last week?

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,700
Police do the violence first.

80
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,950
The police fired first?

81
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,950
Yeah.

82
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,470
We are peaceful.

83
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,340
We don't want to hurt anyone.

84
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,980
We don't want to hurt police.

85
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,400
We are all Hong Kongers.

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,670
So you're putting on the goggles and the helmet

87
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,880
to protect yourself from the police?

88
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,510
Yeah, we have the goggles and the vests already

89
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,360
in case the police put the tear gas

90
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,480
or anything else onto us.

91
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,239
We will do our protection.

92
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,630
So it's some of the police I need to watch
out for?

93
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,090
Yeah, it's the police you should watch out
for -

94
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,310
not the protesters.

95
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,980
I was beginning to think that Carrie Lam

96
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,870
may have been wrong to decribe this -

97
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,870
thank you -

98
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,340
as an organized riot.

99
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,620
I mean, there's been absolutely zero looting

100
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,280
in a place with a lot of high-end stores and
malls.

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,820
Crowds even moved out of the way for an ambulance.

102
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
Okay, I found the water guy.

103
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,330
There's also a couple of water guys, too.

104
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,080
And also a lot of water stations.

105
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,160
Someone also offered Shelley a sandwich.

106
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,960
Oh really, oh that's lovely.

107
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
It was.

108
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,070
It was very lovely, actually.

109
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,610
It actually makes me want to cook up a bunch
of sandwiches

110
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,200
and bring them here, and be like, hey,

111
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
anyone want some?

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Anyone hungry?

113
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,020
I'll wait here for those sandwiches.

114
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,700
I'm beginning to think I may have overracted.

115
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,820
Slightly.

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,460
Hey.

117
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,260
Hey.

118
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,580
What's wrong?

119
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,440
Oh you know, I just witnessed

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,540
a once in a lifetime historic moment

121
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,130
of a group of nonviolent protesters with no leader

122
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,260
changing the world.

123
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,270
Isn't that a good thing?

124
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
Yeah, I guess,

125
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,060
but I was hoping to become the leader of the revolution myself.

126
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,040
But I guess they don't need me.

127
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,380
Don't worry, you'll always have China Uncensored.

128
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,900
Thanks, Shelley.

129
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,620
I think this is the continuation of a beautiful
friendship.
