1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,040
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it's Chris Joel.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,240
Gary's line, just before Gary said it,
so Gary's isn't funny, remember that.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,640
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,520
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,760
And now on ITV1, our new
Saturday night entertainment game show,

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,600
join Stephen Mulhern in
Get Out, That's My Trout.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,520
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,080
And I'll be following up on ITV2
with your reaction.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,920
In front of me I've got an article from
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers which is:

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,160
-They're getting better at that.
-Yeah.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,680
Today we are talking about
the Crazy Eights incident.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,640
The Crazy Eights or the Crazy Apes?

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,120
Because one of those sounds brilliant.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,920
The Crazy Eights incident,
also known as the CSX 8888 incident.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Is it Chinese, they like eights, don't they?

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,440
Oh, bloody hell.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,200
No, you're completely and utterly wrong.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,960
-It's a lucky number, isn't it?
-Yes.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,560
That would be a lucky number,
but this is (a) not in China

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,920
and (b)... I nearly said two there.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,920
This is… this is (a) not in China
and (b) not lucky.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Was it unlucky?

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,760
-CSX transportation is the company in question.
-Okay.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
-A flight?
-No.

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,760
Public transport?

29
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,840
-It's more of a freight carrier.
-Is it a runaway train?

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,800
-Oh, it is.
-Does it go around... damn it.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,120
I wanted to do the whole first line.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,320
Is it that film?

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,520
Oh, which film?

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,920
There was a film with the guy
that played Kirk in the new Star Treks.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,040
That would be Chris Pine.

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Yes, I think, and it was all undercranked,

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,760
it's artificially sped up footage
of American trains moving really slowly.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,400
I saw about 10 minutes of that.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,360
-It was terrible. It was amazing.
-Yeah.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
Was it that?

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,600
-Yes, it was.
-Yes!

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
It's called, it's got a terrible pun name,
hasn't it though?

43
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
-It's something like just Runaway, isn't it?
-Runaway.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,920
-Unstoppable.
-Unstoppable, there we go.

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,960
Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, yes.

46
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Yeah.

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
And you've skipped a huge amount
of the article here,

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,800
because that is the film
based on this incident.

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,560
So we've got a run…
we've got a train what is running away?

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,320
-Yes.
-And not cos it scared, cos it naughty.

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,960
Now, if I remember from the film,

52
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,440
it was running away towards a city
that had a very tight bend in it,

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,440
and there was something
that it couldn't fall off and destroy,

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,020
- and it had terrible things inside it.
- Now...

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,600
Why did your movie pitch career
never take off, Matt?

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,280
Have you not heard me describing things before?

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
Yeah, but never so compelling.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,800
You're right with some of that,
it did have bad things in it.

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
Was it radiation-y?

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,160
-No. No, it was…
-Was it chemical-y?

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,680
Yes. I'm going to give a point for that
and I feel like I shouldn't.

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,880
Chemical-y bad things.

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Yeah, thousands of gallons of phenol.

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,320
Is that a solvent?

65
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,380
-Phenolic acid.
-Is it an acid?

66
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm not, I'm not...

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,320
Can we not just get a runaway train
of Gaviscon to hit it

68
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,800
-'cos that'd sort it out?
-Oh!

69
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,920
Yeah, you're also right that the movie
had Devil's Curve in the city of Stanton.

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
Is there actually a city of Stanton?

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
I don't know if there's a city of Stanton,
there certainly isn't a Devil's Curve.

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Is it… is it just a bad curve?

73
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,640
No, the train… the actual real train,
which was CSX 8888, that was the registry number,

74
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,880
was not headed towards
anything particularly dangerous.

75
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,200
So Hollywood found it vaguely boring
but someone thought, 'Oh, if we…

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
'if we made this worse than it actually was,
it would be a compelling kind of film?'

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Yes.

78
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,200
I like the thought of someone sat at home
with their kid's train set,

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
trying to think,
'How can I make this film exciting?'

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,960
And they just kick the little bit of track,
and it bends and he goes,

81
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,800
"There we have it."

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,680
This is notable for one particular
aspect of it,

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,600
but apart from the fact that there were
no significant injuries or anything from it.

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,280
It's notable for one thing.

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,800
Had a film made about it.

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
-Two things.
-Okay.

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,800
They tried to do the sort of stupid s***
that you see in the film

88
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,440
where they pull a train alongside,

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,640
and somebody leapt across
to try and slow it down.

90
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,720
Yes.

91
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,040
Oh, right.

92
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,200
So someone having seen a film tried to do
something they might see in a film.

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,480
Well, it was a little more thought out than that,
but yes, this was rescued...

94
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,600
That is damning with such faint praise.

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,080
So first of all, what went wrong?

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,960
What's happening here at this place?

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,560
Did they not catch up to it and pull up next to
it to do the… the jumpy thing?

98
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,120
How do you pull up next to it?

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
S***!

100
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,200
-Was it on a single track railway?
-Yes.

101
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,000
Did it come up with all this idea,
so we'll get this, we'll put it up, 'Oh...'

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,960
No, no,  they knew what it was on.
And it's also notable for how far it went.

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,680
Why is it running away?

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,120
Well, that's how the show works, Gary.

105
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Gary, why was it running away?

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,760
Well, alright, if I zip my anorak up
ever so slightly, they should have vacuum braking.

107
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,760
So if there's a break in the vacuum pipe,
the brakes should come on.

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,640
So has the driver collapsed or something?

109
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,680
Oh, you so were close until the end.

110
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,920
-Yeah, I'll still give you a point because…
-Hit the point button you dick!

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,840
This starts in a classification yard
or a marshalling yard as it's known in the UK.

112
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,080
So that's where they move stuff about
and put them on the…

113
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,160
the freight gets moved and…

114
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,360
-Yes.
-Trains; trains are made up into trains.

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Yeah.

116
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Where a mummy train and a daddy train
make a baby train.

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,720
There are different types of yard,
what's a hump yard?

118
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
You shunt without connecting.

119
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
It's over a hump,
it's a hill and it runs down via gravity.

120
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
And you can… you can brake it at the top

121
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
by popping things between the rails
to catch the wheels, to slow them slightly,

122
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,000
someone in a big room, goes;
a big lever and goes, "Erghrrr," like that,

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,480
-and they stop.
-Goes what?

124
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,640
I can't do it again, it's already passed,
hasn't it?

125
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,160
Yeah, there's another one…
there's another one coming.

126
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
"Erghrrr."

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,280
It's a different lever,
before anyone says anything else.

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,080
There's also a gravity yard.

129
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,320
I want to see the anti-gravity yard personally.

130
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,600
That's for moving them between tracks,

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
because then you can just
shove them sideways gently.

132
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,720
It's the same thing, isn't it,
it's just a hill, they run down them.

133
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,520
Yeah, it's literally: right, the trains are here,
and you push them down the hill,

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,000
you start them going and then you just have to
align all the points up

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,040
-and the switches up, so it goes the right way.
-Now, is that where it went wrong?

136
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,880
-Yes.
-Did they align them to the output

137
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,000
instead of to a siding,
and then they just kept going?

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,080
So it's not actually a gravity yard here,
it's a flat yard,

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,600
but the engineer on the train noticed that one
of the switches, points, is misaligned.

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,160
-So what does he do?
-Hit it with a big hammer.

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,920
Well, he can't brake fast enough, he knows

142
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,760
-the train's not going to stop in time.
-Did he jump off?

143
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,800
Yes, he did.

144
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Ah, now, what you’ve done there, mate, now what
you've done there is you've…

145
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
you've left your train off,

146
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,640
and it's going all on its own,

147
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,880
at no point is this Thomas
and the train will stop for not having a driver.

148
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
Yes, he did… he did actually apply the airbrake,

149
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,000
but the airbrake was disconnected,

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
because it's in the middle of a yard
and they don’t activate it there.

151
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,600
Yes, yeah, yeah, and you might only have the
engine brake which won't stop a full train.

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,240
Yes. But it did turn off the dead man's switch
because the brake's pushed.

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,800
Now, that is very silly.

154
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,280
If you take the keys out,
you can't actually stop it, can you?

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,080
No. Does anybody here know
what a dynamic brake on a train is?

156
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Oh God, is it … oh no.

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,720
It's what … that's what the APT had, isn't it?

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,880
That's, that's fluid dynamic brake,
isn't it? Yeah.

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,360
That was liquid,
that was a hydraulic brake, wasn't it?

160
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,520
A dynamic brake is using the throttle
to power the brakes.

161
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
That's it, it recharges the brakes
and goes by like the reserve energy,

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
because they are electric motors rather than
just a diesel engine driving the wheels.

163
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,440
It's a diesel engine driving an electric motor
and you use that to recharge the brake circuits.

164
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,360
-Yes.
-Is it like using a flywheel as a brake?

165
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,960
-Yeah, a little bit.
-Yeah, moving kinetic energy into the other system.

166
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,240
Sorry, I'm getting just a bit
engineery-intrigued now.

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
No, that's fair.

168
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,280
I like the fact
that they're all having these discussions

169
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,160
while the train was running away
out of the yard behind them.

170
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,040
What happens if, for example, you fail to set
the dynamic brake

171
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,960
and then send power to it?

172
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,520
Ah, now, does that just make the brakes
not work even better?

173
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,960
No, it's just going to accelerate.
-Oh s***.

174
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,040
-He'd just turned the throttle on.
-Awesome.

175
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Oh s***,
you've just made it go faster there, mate.

176
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,920
-Yes.
-And then he jumped off.

177
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,960
He... yes.

178
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,440
Now. Now, what he really did there…

179
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,720
-This is America, right?
-Uh-huh.

180
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
The thing I know about America is that
it's big, yeah.

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,520
-Yes.
-Point!

182
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,960
So, and America has big long straight bits
of railway with nothing.

183
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
-Yes.
-Was this a diesel engine

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
and did they just wait for the diesel to run out?

185
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
They've got quite a bit of diesel on though,
haven't they?

186
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,800
Yes. Did they just wait?
They’ve got quite a bit of America too.

187
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,920
No, they didn't, but you’re along sort of
the right lines, when I said this was notable...

188
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,980
Ha, 'lines'.

189
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,840
...when I said it was notable, I mean it was
notable for something in particular about this.

190
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,160
Did they try and syphon the diesel out
while it was driving?

191
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,840
Someone just comes up with a hosepipe,
sticks it in and goes...

192
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,400
The brakes aren't working.

193
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,680
Is this the train that's travelled on its own
the longest?

194
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,720
No. I don't know if it's officially the longest
but it is certainly a very, very long distance.

195
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,540
It went for two hours at somewhere
around fifty miles an hour.

196
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,840
Whoa!

197
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,360
That's nearly 100 miles.

198
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
Yes.

199
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,040
There are all sorts of movie plot threats
and ideas that you've come up with here.

200
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,560
What are they actually
going to try and do to it?

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,760
What's the practical solution to: runaway train?

202
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
Get one of those little carts.

203
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,880
Here we go.

204
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,920
What has the pumpy thing on and go dead fast so
you catch up with it down a hill.

205
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,560
And then you climb up all along the top and get
in the driver's cab and then, and turn it off.

206
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
Do that but with another locomotive.

207
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes.

208
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,120
Actually you could just bring something out
in front of it and brake it, right?

209
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,840
They also planned to do that,
they didn’t actually need to do that in time.

210
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,160
-Did it crash by that point?
-No.

211
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,440
No, what's… what's the plan here?

212
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,360
So first of all they use something called
a portable derailer.

213
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,480
So they want to jump the wheels off the track so
then it's grinding and more than driving,

214
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,120
and then it'll just slow down because it hasn't
got enough grip.

215
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,240
Yeah. Well, more than that,
it will knock the wheels off the track.

216
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,000
And just … I mean that's not a great place
for a locomotive to be in?

217
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,040
At this point, you get the police coming out and
throwing a stinger trap underneath it.

218
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,240
-Oh!
-Trying to pop the tires… oh, it doesn't matter.

219
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,000
-Now…
-Somebody's like, "what you did there"…

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,200
The police did try to do something to it.

221
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
-Shoot it.
-Yes.

222
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,760
Because it's America and the police.

223
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,320
What with, a f***ing cannon?

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Well, they were trying to hit something on it.

225
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,720
The fuel lines?

226
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,000
The brake?

227
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,280
-Not quite.
-The driver.

228
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,440
That pillock who jumped off.

229
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,160
They're trying to... fire at the fuel...
well, it's diesel so it won't ignite.

230
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,880
But, yeah, I suppose you could shoot the fuel lines.
Or the tanks! The fuel tanks.

231
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,320
The emergency fuel cut-off switch, you know,
that’s close enough.

232
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,120
They're trying to hit a switch.

233
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,160
Yes, it … it didn't work.

234
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
They're just dicking around,
it's a moving f***ing target, isn't it?

235
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,920
So we now have: runaway train
that has been shot at by the police.

236
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,640
Unsuccessfully shot at.

237
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,760
With the accelerator being a bit stuck down.

238
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,520
Yeah.

239
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,680
And the, the other brake being on, but essentially
being completely burned out by this.

240
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,640
What’s the plan?

241
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,040
What do they go with?
We have experienced railroad engineers here.

242
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,480
They put it in reverse somehow with the
power of the mind.

243
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,160
You sort of suggested this earlier.

244
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,520
What, drive another vehicle, couple it and then
use those brakes?

245
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,080
Yes.

246
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,960
So the two engineers, you know,
train coming the other way, pulled off.

247
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, okay. I was going to say,
coming the other way? Yeah.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
Waited for that train to pass
and then chased it.

249
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,400
That must have looked awesome.

250
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,280
Yes.

251
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,960
When was this, did they video it?

252
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,960
There is video of the runaway train
but not of this actual moment.

253
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,320
-That's a real… that’s a massive oversight.
-Is it the 70s?

254
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
2001.

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,480
Yeah, massive oversight,
get a helicopter over this, you've got rights.

256
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,280
So an engineer with 31 years of service.

257
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,640
Nice, is it his last day before retirement?

258
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,680
I think it was in the film,
it actually was in the film.

259
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,160
Oh, of course it f***ing was.

260
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,920
And a rookie conductor with one year's
experience.

261
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,100
"But it'll never work!" "Listen to me kid, I am,"
looks down imaginary camera,

262
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,160
"the engineer."

263
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,120
Looks at picture of dead wife.

264
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,120
I watched that film thinking it was so formulaic,
but it actually happened like that.

265
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes, then the… the train master…

266
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,440
Oh! "Behold!"

267
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,560
"The train master."

268
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,080
Stood in front of it on the tracks and said,
"Halt."

269
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,320
Is the train master Brunel?

270
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,640
No, it's Topham Hatt just with
his little straight arms.

271
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,960
"You have been a very naughty engine."

272
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Suddenly then they listen and Ringo has suddenly
appeared in the back of the train to narrate this s***.

273
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,280
Wait a minute, did the young engineer
try and go first,

274
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,680
and the old engineer said, "no, you've got
too much to live for" at the last second?

275
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
Pull him out of the way and do it himself.

276
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
Yeah, train master, John Horsfeld,
ran alongside the train.

277
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
Ran?

278
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,680
They've got it down to like 11 miles an hour
now, so he sprints along…

279
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay, fifty mile an hour.
-Climbs aboard.

280
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,120
-That's still a quick run, that.
-And shuts down the engine, yes.

281
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,200
They have another train upfront to…
ready to try and…

282
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,440
Ram it.

283
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,680
Not quite ram it, but, you know,
slow it down by braking.

284
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,280
-Ram it.
-Ram it, fine, yes.

285
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,980
What happened to the engineer who first
made the mistake, way way back?

286
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,480
So it's now stopped, they've recovered it,
it's going back to the yard.

287
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,400
The engineer at the start, what happened to him?

288
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,400
He was made to lie down on the rails
while they backed it up.

289
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,320
Ooh!

290
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,800
Did he have to walk all the way
to pick it back up again?

291
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,280
It’s actually a bit harder to work out because
they never released the name of the engineer.

292
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah, I don't think I would either.

293
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
Because in aviation, you don't do that,
you don't go for blame, you go for,

294
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,960
let's work out what happened and then work out
how to make it not happen again.

295
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,200
-Yes.
-And then you get at that rather than it's …

296
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
it's a blameless culture,
whatever they call it.

297
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
-So then things get reported.
-Yeah, you've actually…

298
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
Because in the end it's always systems or technology
that's eventually caused the problem.

299
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,040
And if not, you think you're going to get
blamed for something,

300
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,480
you're not going to report that something
happened, then you don't get good safety.

301
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,360
Yeah, it's called a 'just culture'

302
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,440
and you've literally answered
several of the questions I was about to ask.

303
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,200
-Have two points.
-Yeah!

304
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,800
Alright, so what's happened to the engine
in the end?

305
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Has it been destroyed as a warning to others?

306
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,800
Is it in a retirement home?
What are they called? Museum?

307
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,640
Those are two very different things.

308
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,360
A retirement home for objects is a museum.

309
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay. Okay, right yeah.

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
He's not wrong.

311
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
But neither is he right.

312
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,000
But that's…
that doesn't work the other way around.

313
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,320
Like a retirement home
is not a museum of people.

314
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,240
No.

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,280
Several railway museums tried to buy it
but officials replied,

316
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,600
they "did not feel it worthy of preservation."

317
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,000
-Yes, because…
-Please forget this.

318
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,880
The train would tell the other trains
how to run away.

319
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,920
Oh.

320
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,080
Dangerous knowledge.

321
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,120
And it was torn down and rebuilt
as part of a regular rebuild process.

322
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,520
So it is now...
bits of it are now in other places.

323
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,160
It got hung, drawn and quartered.

324
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,440
I am... yeah, basically, yeah, that's pretty much
what hung, drawing and quartering was.

325
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,680
I've got the idea now, of all these bits from
other trains and these bits are sentient

326
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,920
and suddenly at some point,
and here's the second film...

327
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,520
Lots of trains run away.

328
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm getting a sense this second one's
written by Stephen King.

329
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,040
Ideally me, but, yeah,
alright, I'll sell the rights.

330
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,240
So at the end of the show, congratulations,
Gary, you win this one.

331
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,680
You win the rights
to your screenplay being produced.

332
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,600
No, sorry.

333
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,840
You win a shirt that exposes your midriff
sponsored by a series of Korean boy bands.

334
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,560
It's a K-pop crop top.

335
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,720
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel,

336
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,680
to Gary Brannan,

337
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
to Matt Gray.

338
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
I've been Tom Scott,
and we'll see you next time.
