1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,740
On this episode of Hong Kong Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,790
You go to jail.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,920
You go to jail.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,900
Everyone goes to jail!

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,750
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,370
The Hong Kong government has just made

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,539
a huge mistake.

9
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,160
Um, yes, but sending political activists to
prison

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,179
is not exactly the mistake I’m talking about.

11
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:26,569
The mistake is:

12
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,480
If you’re going to secretly undermine

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,289
the freedoms of your people,

14
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,500
you have to do it in secret!

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,510
Like, if you’re coming home at 3 am

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,809
after sneaking out to a party:

17
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,489
get your friend to drop you off down the street,

18
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,620
and climb back into your room

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,769
through the window.

20
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:42,930
I’m just saying.

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,219
That’s just common sense

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,910
and is not based on personal experience, Mom.

23
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,590
Anyway, Hong Kong authorities

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,629
are still kinda new at this,

25
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,449
which makes them inexperienced and foolish.

26
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,449
Because when the Hong Kong court

27
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,449
sentenced these three political activists

28
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,890
to prison on August 17,

29
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,190
it really let the cat out of the box:

30
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,379
The Hong Kong government

31
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,220
is undermining the freedoms of its people.

32
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,850
Of course, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie
Lam

33
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,060
defended the move.

34
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,670
"Rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people

35
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,990
are protected under the Basic Law.”

36
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,000
Ah yes, Basic Law.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,049
That was the agreement the CCP and the UK

38
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,030
made ahead of the 1997 handover.

39
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,380
Under the One Country, Two Systems principle,

40
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,261
the Basic Law guarantees Hong Kong

41
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:31,540
a variety of rights and freedoms—

42
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,350
even rights and freedoms denied

43
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,469
to people in the rest of China.

44
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:37,500
Anyway, go on Ms. Lam.

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,509
“But the exercise of these rights and freedoms...

46
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,320
is not without limit.”

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,159
So what limits did three dangerous criminals
violate?

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,520
Well, Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Alex Chow

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
were influential leaders of the 2014 Umbrella
Movement.

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,460
“The 2014 protests—

51
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,090
known as the Umbrella Movement—

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,960
were triggered after Wong and his colleagues

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,810
stormed the city's government headquarters.

54
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,049
They were later found guilty of unlawful assembly

55
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,140
and were sentenced to community service.”

56
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,140
Just to clarify,

57
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,830
“storming government headquarters” in
this case

58
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,750
meant jumping police barriers

59
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,290
in front of a popular protest location

60
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,910
outside the central government offices

61
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,410
known as Civic Square.

62
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,790
Anyway, go on.

63
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,070
“But that wasn't enough for the department
of justice

64
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,030
which applied for a review....

65
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,660
Joshua Wong will spend the next six months

66
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,340
behind bars.”

67
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,770
So Joshua Wong and the other two less famous
guys

68
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,980
were sentenced to community service.

69
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,700
Which they served.

70
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,800
And then the court decided to sentence them
again—

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,270
this time to 6 months,

72
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,270
8 months,

73
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,790
and 7 months respectively in prison.

74
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,790
Why?

75
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,580
Well, the Hong Kong Department of Justice

76
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,680
decided that the punishments weren’t harsh
enough,

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,860
and that they wanted a review of the sentences.

78
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,210
Of course Hong Kong Chief Executive

79
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,970
Carrie Lam will assure you,

80
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,980
Beijing had nothing to do with the decision.

81
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,410
"Our courts are exercising judicial powers
independently,

82
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,520
free from any interference.

83
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,510
So any allegation that in these particular
cases

84
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,690
that judges in the Court of Appeal

85
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,690
have made decisions under political interference,

86
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,890
again, are totally unfounded.”

87
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,120
That’s like when you sneak out at night

88
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,610
and then try to convince your parents the
next day

89
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,510
that the lump in your bed that night

90
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,830
was you all along,

91
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,920
and totally not the pillows from the guest
bedroom.

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,210
What’s interesting here

93
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,450
is that Lam defends the judges

94
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,710
as being politically unbiased,

95
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,210
but there are signs that the Justice Department
itself

96
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,300
wasn’t politically unbiased when deciding

97
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,020
to “review” the sentences.

98
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,020
For one, it’s highly unusual for them

99
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,150
to review the sentences in the first place.

100
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,880
There are reports that Secretary of Justice
Rimsky Yuen

101
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,280
overrode his own prosecutors

102
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,840
in order to get those harsher sentences—

103
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,050
even though his prosecutors didn’t want
to do it.

104
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,320
Interestingly, Rimsky Yuen is also a member

105
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,040
of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative
Conference,

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,400
the terribly-named rubber-stamp advisory body

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,320
to China’s rubber stamp legislature.

108
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,900
Being in the CPPCC

109
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,870
is a marker of status and influence.

110
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,009
And you can get kicked out

111
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,870
for not toeing the Party line.

112
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,590
But I’m sure he made his decisions

113
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,979
about the Hong Kong activists

114
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,290
completely without any political agenda.

115
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,050
So when the courts handed down the prison
sentences,

116
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,270
their ruling talked about the importance

117
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,780
of deterrent sentences.

118
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,290
That is, by severely punishing these three
people,

119
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,330
they would make Hong Kongers not want to protest...

120
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,680
sorry, I mean, “unlawfully assemble”

121
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,990
in the future.

122
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,740
Which worked incredibly well.

123
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,860
In fact, the sentencing reinvigorated the
movement

124
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,900
for rights and freedoms in Hong Kong—

125
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,729
with over twenty thousand people taking to
the streets.

126
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,039
There’s more uproar over this than for other
recent events

127
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,300
that eroded Hong Kong’s freedoms.

128
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,490
Like allowing Chinese police to patrol in
Hong Kong.

129
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,990
Or saying the joint declaration Hong Kong
Basic Law

130
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,780
is founded on no longer has meaning.

131
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,999
Or kicking out democratically elected

132
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,090
pro-democracy lawmakers.

133
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,300
Again.

134
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
As you can see,

135
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,879
the Chinese Communist Party’s influence
over Hong Kong

136
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,960
has been getting really blatant lately.

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,870
So the question is why?

138
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,669
This carries serious risks for the CCP.

139
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,729
It clearly shows that the One Country Two
Systems policy

140
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,349
that the CCP promised the UK

141
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,449
is being thrown out the window.

142
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,219
And that makes it hard for anyone

143
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,439
to trust the CCP about any agreement.

144
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,949
As Financial Times puts it,

145
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,840
“If a bilateral treaty,

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,030
signed by two heads of state

147
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,210
and registered with the UN,

148
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,310
can be unilaterally ignored,

149
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,889
what is stopping China from trashing

150
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:55,729
any other treaty it does not like?”

151
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,879
So why would the CCP take this risk?

152
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,949
Well, one factor is that the CCP

153
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,060
doesn’t care as much as it used to

154
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,759
if the lack of independence

155
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,689
hurts Hong Kong’s economy.

156
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:06,849
In 1997,

157
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,360
when the UK handover happened,

158
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,529
Hong Kong made up 20% of China’s GDP.

159
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,419
It was also the only real way for China

160
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:15,039
to access Western investment.

161
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,159
But now, 20 years later,

162
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,090
other parts of China have grown so much

163
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,840
that Hong Kong’s contribution to China’s
GDP

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,780
has fallen from 20%

165
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,580
to just 3%.

166
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,650
So why bother appeasing Hong Kongers with
pesky freedoms

167
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,360
unless those freedoms have limits?

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,770
Another factor is that the government of the
UK,

169
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,580
and every other country,

170
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,000
still wants to do business in with China—

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,340
even if they’re not super happy

172
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,690
about this latest move.

173
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,039
I mean yeah the CCP is terrible

174
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,539
and breaks its promises,

175
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,050
but...cha-ching!

176
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,310
So put on that awkward smile

177
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,689
and move on.

178
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,430
And here’s another factor:

179
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,110
After the 2014 Umbrella movement was over,

180
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,110
many of the young people

181
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,080
who participated in the protests

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,330
tried to continue to change the system from
within.

183
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,550
For example, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law

184
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,490
founded a political party so they could

185
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,449
officially join Hong Kong’s democratic process.

186
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,360
Nathan Law even won a seat

187
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,409
in the legislature last year,

188
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:13,409
along with many other new

189
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,449
pro-democracy lawmakers.

190
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,582
Unfortunately, Law was kicked out of office

191
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:20,080
last month for adding a Gandhi quote

192
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,930
while taking his oath of office.

193
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,129
That’s another topic.

194
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,050
But now, their long prison sentences

195
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,979
trigger a rule that disqualifies them

196
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,830
from running for office for the next five
years.

197
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,409
So the Hong Kong government

198
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,169
is effectively shutting them out of the political
process.

199
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,169
It seems like a side effect,

200
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,219
but I think it’s actually one of the main
reasons

201
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,249
the Hong Kong government did it.

202
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,259
By disqualifying and shutting out pro-democracy
legislators,

203
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,120
the pro-Beijing government is more likely

204
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
to be able to pass laws that the CCP wants,

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,619
but Hong Kongers have resisted for years,

206
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:51,430
like the patriotic education law,

207
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,129
or Article 23,

208
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,400
that anti-subversion law that would let police

209
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,870
search people’s homes without a warrant.

210
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,009
But here’s the thing:

211
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,840
This move is extremely stupid!

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,490
What happens when you force people

213
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,889
to operate outside the system?

214
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,490
When you show them that protesting

215
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,680
is the only way to prevent the government

216
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,620
from stomping all over your rights

217
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,470
in order to appease the Communist Party?

218
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,059
You get this!

219
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,620
Twenty thousand angry people protesting.

220
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
And we’re probably going to see

221
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,180
more protests in the future—

222
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,860
because the Hong Kong government’s decision

223
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,680
tells the people one thing clearly:

224
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,610
Civil disobedience is now the only way to
make

225
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,050
effective political change in Hong Kong.

226
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,640
Now, as for Joshua Wong,

227
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Alex Chow, and Nathan Law,

228
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,700
they’ve already started their prison sentences,

229
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,020
although their lawyers say they will appeal.

230
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,620
Hopefully prison won’t harden them too much.

231
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,700
Joshua has already shaved his head

232
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,070
and talked about taking graphic design classes.

233
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,510
Good luck, kid.

234
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,040
Now, I personally admire these guys,

235
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,430
and for viewers who feel the same,

236
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,500
why don’t you head over to Twitter,

237
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,700
and send them some words of support

238
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,380
from the China Uncensored 50-cent army.

239
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,280
Their twitter handles are in the description
below,

240
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,550
and their accounts are being managed

241
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,530
by friends while they’re in prison.

242
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,920
Don’t forget to tag @chinauncensored

243
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,930
so I can see your tweets as well.

244
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,930
And as always,

245
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,930
let me know what you think

246
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,720
in the comments below.

247
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,020
Coming up after the break,

248
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,670
if only getting political prisoners out of
China

249
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,000
were as easy as getting money out.

250
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,060
When I was in Hong Kong last December,

251
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,500
I was lucky enough to sit down

252
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,830
with Joshua Wong for an interview.

253
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,260
We talked about his plans

254
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,580
for the future of Hong Kong,

255
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,740
and we even sang a song of angry men

256
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,180
from my favorite musical, Les Mis.

257
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,160
Of course, this is before I realized

258
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,280
Joshua Wong was a dangerous criminal.

259
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
So click here on the left

260
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,460
to watch that interview now.
