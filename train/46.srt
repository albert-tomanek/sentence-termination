00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,950
For those just tuning in?! This is YouTube.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,920
You're not just going to open up YouTube and
find yourself half way through a video!

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,460
I did wonder.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,780
I occasionally get emails from internet startups
who want to try and get our videos on something.

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,030
I got one from someone who's trying to "bring
the TV experience to YouTube".

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,710
So it removes all the ability to skip back
and forth, or over things,

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,529
and just shows you one video...

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,460
Ah, so you go to a place, can't find anything
interesting,

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,179
and then turn it off again(!)

10
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:25,829
That... that's not quite how I phrased it
to them, but yes. That's essentially...

11
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,819
No. The answer's no.

12
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:32,230
However, if you want to give us a massive
studio like BBC TV Centre's TC1...

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,679
We wouldn't know what to do with it!

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,359
That's true.

15
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,969
Oh, oh, I'd have a go. Don't you worry about
that.

16
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,600
You still want to run down the stairs like
"Game for a Laugh" onto a shiny floor, don't you?

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,960
Yes. And what will happen is, like that bloke
on Catchphrase...

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,360
You'll skid on your heels and land in the
camera!
