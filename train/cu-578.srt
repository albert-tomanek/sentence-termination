1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,540
The Chinese and US navies have a close friendship.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,080
Or maybe just a close call.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,680
A reporter from Chinese state-run media learns
about democracy.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,440
And a famous Chinese actress is free!

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,920
To apologize.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
This is China Uncensored.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,960
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,510
A Chinese warship played a game of chicken

11
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,960
with a US Navy destroyer in the South China
Sea.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,230
Apparently they’re 45 yards apart,

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,280
but it sure looks a lot closer than that.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
The US ship was forced to maneuver out of
the way

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,670
to prevent a collision.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,969
Which means...America blinked first.

17
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,170
Sad!

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,719
The Pentagon called the Chinese move

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
an “unsafe and unprofessional maneuver.”

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,390
Well that’s rather a polite way to put it.

21
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,440
The encounter happened in the Spratly Islands,

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,660
where the Chinese regime makes territorial
claims.

23
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,590
Actually, they claim pretty much the entire
South China Sea.

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,590
Needless to say,

25
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,140
not everyone agrees with that claim.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,390
The US has performed regular freedom of navigation
operations

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,560
in the South China Sea since 2013,

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,340
as a way of saying, these are international
waters,

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,759
and what are you gonna do about it, huh?

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:21,360
And this was the Chinese military saying,

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,580
this is what we’re gonna do about it.

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,040
This also happened right after the US postponed

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,799
a planned mid-October security talk

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,150
between the Secretary of Defense

35
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,260
and his Chinese counterpart.

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,000
So US-China relations aren’t doing so hot
right now.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,060
If tensions continue to escalate,

38
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,570
things could get serious, fast.

39
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,530
Ok, who TP’ed the US Navy destroyer?

40
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,540
I knew it!

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,070
Of course the next time

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,630
there’s a US-China military encounter,

43
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,340
it may be Xi Jinping himself leading the way.

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
He looks so natural in the pilot seat, doesn’t
he?

45
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,479
I guess you could call him a “great helmsman.”

46
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,729
Xi Jinping: not just the head of the Chinese
Communist Party,

47
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,090
not just the president of the government,

48
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,220
but also the chairman of the Central Military
Commission—

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,270
among many other titles.

50
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,190
He gave a military inspection this week,

51
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,200
and reminded everyone to be ready for war.

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,780
Not with any country in particular.

53
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,319
Just, you know, in general.

54
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,250
I guess Xi wants the PLA to be like the Boy
Scouts.

55
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,390
Always be prepared.

56
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,140
But, for war.

57
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,340
Meanwhile, one war the US and China

58
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,110
are already fighting is the trade war.

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,260
And the latest battle was fought in the new
trade deal

60
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,550
between the US, Mexico and Canada.

61
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,060
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement,

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,599
USMCA, which will replace NAFTA,

63
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,769
has some clauses built into it that will affect
China trade.

64
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,099
Take article 32.10.

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,590
It’s about free trade negotiations

66
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,950
with non market economies.

67
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,300
China is considered a non market economy.

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,290
The clause gives all three countries the power

69
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,150
to block each other from making free-trade

70
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,620
agreements with China without approval.

71
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,379
It effectively gives the US more power in

72
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,950
“weakening Beijing’s negotiating power
in future trade talks”.

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,950
Technically, China is not mentioned by name,

74
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,860
but, come on, we know who they mean.

75
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,040
Keep in mind, the USMCA has been agreed on,

76
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
but not ratified.

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,650
It still needs to be approved

78
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,300
by each of the three countries’ legislatures,

79
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,670
which probably won’t happen till early next
year.

80
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,849
But regardless, Canada’s Prime Minister
Trudeau

81
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,170
still says that despite the USMCA’s restrictions,

82
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,950
he’s really excited about closer trade ties
with China.

83
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,390
I mean, sure Canadian citizens

84
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,500
are being illegally detained there.

85
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,290
But what’s not to love about partnering
with China?

86
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,069
I’m telling you, it’s the pandas.

87
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,450
Every.

88
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,830
Time.

89
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,370
Hey, ever want to challenge your friends

90
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,269
to see who knows the most about

91
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,060
China’s glorious leader Xi Jinping?

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,180
That’s a dumb question.

93
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,750
Of course you have.

94
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,739
And the good news is, now you can!

95
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,069
There’s a new primetime game show all about
Xi Jinping!

96
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,760
It’s called Studying Xi in the New Era.

97
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,840
According to the South China Morning Post,

98
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,680
it’s being broadcast on “Hunan TV,

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,900
the country’s second most watched channel,

100
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,280
which is wildly popular among the younger
generation

101
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,620
for its entertainment shows and idol dramas.”

102
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,130
It takes place on a spaceship,

103
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,080
with Karl Marx and a robot.

104
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
The show is part of

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,200
a general trend pushing “Xi Jinping thought.”

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,630
It’s his very own brand of ideology

107
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,810
that was added to the Communist Party constitution.

108
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,740
The gameshow tests your knowledge of Xi Jinping,

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,090
plus has a smattering of questions

110
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,340
about Karl Marx and Mao Zedong.

111
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,770
And the best part is...there’s no cash or
prizes!

112
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,970
It’s the perfect Communist game show.

113
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,890
And I assume that if a contestant is too intellectual,

114
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,509
he gets sent to the countryside.

115
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,700
Speaking of great Chinese state-run television,

116
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,720
a reporter for China Central Television attended

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,139
an event held by Hong Kong democracy activists
in the UK,

118
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,910
where she yelled at one of the speakers

119
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,780
that he was “anti China”

120
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,610
and called other attendees “traitors”.

121
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,960
Then, when a volunteer tried to escort her
out of the meeting,

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,110
she...slapped him.

123
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,650
If you hit me again, I will call the police.

124
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,950
Oh, how democratic UK.

125
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,580
Wow, she really doesn’t understand democracy.

126
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,770
The police came and arrested her.

127
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,960
But then the Chinese embassy intervened,

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
she was released without charges,

129
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,430
and state-run CCTV demanded that conference
organizers

130
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,110
issue an apology to her.

131
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,280
Because did you see how they violated her
rights?

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,830
Well, you might think that she got off easy,

133
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,199
since a professional journalist from the UK

134
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,610
who did the same thing in China

135
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,180
would have probably been kicked out of the
country.

136
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,340
But you would be mistaken,

137
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,759
because CCTV reporters aren’t professional
journalists.

138
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,600
That’s not me saying that.

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,630
That’s former CCTV president Hu Zhanfan,
who said,

140
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,620
"Journalists who think of themselves as professionals,

141
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,020
instead of as propaganda workers,

142
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,770
are making a fundamental mistake about identity."

143
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,770
In that case,

144
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,940
I think this reporter,

145
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,100
sorry, propaganda worker,

146
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,690
is probably going to get a promotion.

147
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,319
Speaking of journalism versus propaganda,

148
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,300
NPR just released a wide-ranging interview

149
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,650
with Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai.

150
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,030
After Cui pushed for more “openness” in
the US toward China,

151
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,240
the NPR reporter asked if China

152
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,979
would be willing to have more openness

153
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,840
for foreign reporters to go into Tibet,

154
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,430
where they’ve been banned from traveling
for years.

155
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,150
And Cui says, well,

156
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,460
the altitude in Tibet is kind of high,

157
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,540
and the climate is pretty tough.

158
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,180
I mean, the Chinese regime

159
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,990
is just looking out for foreign reporters,
you know?

160
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,650
They wouldn’t want them to get altitude
sickness.

161
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,050
The NPR reporter pushed back, saying that

162
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,840
“we have high altitudes in the United States.”

163
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,729
And Ambassador Cui promptly pivoted to the
fact that

164
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,550
they can’t have too many visitors in Tibet,

165
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,650
because they need to protect the local environment.

166
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,020
I mean, sure the local government

167
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,240
has been encouraging tourism—

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,040
mostly from other parts of China—

169
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,570
and now Tibet gets 25 million visitors a year.

170
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,700
But even though the Chinese Communist Party

171
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,530
would love to have foreign reporters over
in Tibet,

172
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,139
it’s just that, you know,

173
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:20,570
the house is a mess and they really should
clean it up first,

174
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,380
but they’ve been so busy.

175
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,190
Maybe in another decade or two.

176
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,920
Oh, and about those political re-education
camps in Xinjiang?

177
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,599
Ambassador Cui is not saying there are camps,

178
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,919
but he’s also not saying there are not camps.

179
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,410
But you know, if there were camps,

180
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,400
they’d be a great place for people to learn
skills and…

181
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,050
...look over there, it’s terrorism!

182
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,139
It’s spreading all over the place!

183
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,770
What a diplomat.

184
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,889
We have an update on Fan Bingbing,

185
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:51,319
the missing Chinese celebrity superstar.

186
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,129
“Fans heard very little of Fan Bingbing

187
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,700
when she suddenly dropped off the radar in
June.

188
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,800
Until now.

189
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,780
The Chinese superstar has released a statement
on social media,

190
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,080
apologizing for tax evasion.”

191
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
She owes 130 million dollars now,

192
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,990
a combination of back taxes and fines.

193
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,319
As we reported two weeks ago,

194
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,750
the entertainment industry in China

195
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,349
has been using what’s called yin-yang contracts.

196
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,780
Basically there’s a fake contract to show
tax authorities,

197
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,789
and a real one with a much higher salary

198
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,990
that the actor actually gets paid.

199
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,950
Fan Bingbing’s sudden disappearance

200
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,599
and then public apology falls in line

201
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,030
with an age old tradition in Communist China—

202
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,860
of secretly detaining people

203
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,300
until they see the error of their ways.

204
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,519
“In her statement, she says,

205
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,120
‘Without the good policies of the Communist
Party and state,

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,229
without the love of the people,

207
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,540
there is no Fan Bingbing.’”

208
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,930
And without publicly apologizing

209
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,830
to the Communist Party and the state,

210
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,320
there’s also no Fan Bingbing.

211
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,459
Speaking of putting pressure on things,

212
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,450
this dramatic video posted to Chinese social
media

213
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,930
shows a giant boa constrictor squeezing the
life from a dog.

214
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,589
Three boys attempt to help.

215
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,220
And presumably there’s a fourth boy,

216
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,260
who does NOTHING,

217
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,230
just stands there holding a camera.

218
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,529
Anyway, they attempt to unwind the huge snake
from the dog.

219
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,270
And I wouldn’t end this episode without
something uplifting.

220
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,440
So don’t worry:

221
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,980
they’re finally able to set the dog free.

222
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,380
At least this China Uncensored episode

223
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,330
has someone being set free.

224
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,330
So what do you think?

225
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,690
Leave your comments below.

226
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,690
And before you go,

227
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,770
now is the time when I answer questions from
you!

228
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,610
The loyal members of the China Uncensored
50-cent army

229
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,180
who support the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

230
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,200
David Michael White asks,

231
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,470
“Chris, where did you get those socks?

232
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,630
Ah, the important question gets asked.

233
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,000
I noticed that many of you noticed my socks

234
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,750
in the recent interviews.

235
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,470
Perhaps I should try longer pants?

236
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,050
Perhaps, shorter legs?

237
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,490
Either way, those were some good looking socks.

238
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,260
But I can’t tell you where I bought them,
David,

239
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,260
because I didn’t.

240
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,080
They were a gift from my mom.

241
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,500
Thanks for you question.

242
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,170
But now I have a question for all of you.

243
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,510
I got so many YouTube comments about this,

244
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,180
should I be selling China Uncensored socks?

245
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,120
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

246
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,420
When people say, “Nice Socks”

247
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,600
they don’t actually mean nice socks?

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
Fine.

249
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,500

Uncensored.
