00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,439
keep your friends close,

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,440
your enemies closer,

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,840
and make your frenemies your biggest trading
partner!

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,519
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,019
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,100
In one of history’s rather bizarre twists
of fate,

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,460
the United States is now selling weapons to
Vietnam.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,830
You know, Vietnam!

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,780
War!

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
Good god y’all,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
what is it good for?

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,719
"I can also announce that the United States

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,899
is fully lifting the ban on the sales

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,870
of military equipment to Vietnam

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,770
that has been in place for some fifty years."

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,980
President Obama says it’s so Vietnam can
defend itself.

18
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,190
But from whom, I wonder?

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,040
"The decision to lift the ban was not based on

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,380
China or any other considerations."

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Of course not.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Why would China be part of it?!

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,720
A lot of countries have competing claims to different parts of the South China Sea,

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,760
but if you look at this Nine-Dash Line

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,760
so-called

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,340
China claims virtually all of it,

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,680
down to Indonesia and nearly the coast of
the Philippines.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,760
And has built artificial islands with military
bases on them.

29
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,770
Five trillion dollars worth of shipping

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,259
goes through the South China Sea every year.

31
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,640
It’s also loaded with sweet, sweet natural
resources

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,780
like oil!

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,780
It’s like a pie that everyone wants a piece
of.

34
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,640
And China is determined to eat most of.

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,500
You see, the Chinese regime is like a Decepticon.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,160
It’s been happily bullying its

37
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,200
much smaller, less metallic neighbors

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,030
in the South China Sea.

39
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,310
But then this guy shows up.

40
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,540
And now the Chinese regime might be rethinking
its strategy.

41
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,789
It realizes that sometimes you catch more
bumble bees with honey.

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,000
“We would gladly see Vietnam develop a normal,

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,220
friendly and cooperative relationship with
all countries,

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,960
including the United States.”

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,640
So basically, China’s like,

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,470
“The US wants to team up with Communist
Vietnam?

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,100
Fine.

48
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,560
No, seriously, they’re a great couple.

49
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,560
We’re sooooo over Vietnam!”

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,700
Because now China is leveling the playing field.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080
Joint military talks with Thailand,

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,130
Myanmar,

53
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,150
Malaysia,

54
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,310
Laos.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,580
China’s leader even sent a congratulatory
message

56
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,750
to the Philippines’ President-elect seeking
deeper ties

57
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,830
and “a friendly, stable and sound” relationship.

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,080
Taiwan, they’re still kinda mad at.

59
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,490
I mean, what’d you expect?

60
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,080
But anyway, China’s response to a deepening

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,629
US-Vietnam military partnership is to

62
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,269
build their own, bigger military partnerships.

63
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,080
If you threaten us now with your Kick-a-Poo
Kid,

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,700
we’ll build something better than you ever
did.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,400
Well, we know how that turned out.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,060
But fortunately,

67
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,440
there’s one thing that may be able to stop
this

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,420
from becoming a Big-Boy Boomeroo showdown:

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,660
Money.

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,380
China is one of the top three trading partners

71
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,349
for pretty much every country with competing
South China Sea claims,

72
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,229
including Vietnam.

73
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,379
And if your relationship status is “frenemy,”

74
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,690
you can hate each other,

75
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,709
and still do business together.

76
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,060
And no one wants to blow that up.

77
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,799
So what do you think of China’s actions
in the South China Sea?

78
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,580
