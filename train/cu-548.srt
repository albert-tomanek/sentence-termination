1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,710
This Chinese law professor and internet celebrity,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,240
Had his social media account wiped

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,730
Was it for mentioning China’s organ harvesting?

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:33,670
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,079
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,579
This episode is sponsored by PC-Doctor Toolbox.

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,670
Protect your PC from software crashes, hardware
failures, and the kind of glitches that make

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,969
your life miserable.

9
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,859
So in China, the constitution guarantees free
speech.

10
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,719
Yes, it actually does.

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,569
It’s in Article 35.

12
00:00:53,569 --> 00:01:01,010
Now you might think: But the Chinese government
arrests people for things they say—so it’s

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,879
not following its own constitution!

14
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:04,879
But you’d be wrong.

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,460
You see, a few paragraphs later, the constitution
clarifies that citizens, “in exercising

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,970
their freedoms and rights, may not infringe
upon the interests of the State”.

17
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,920
So you can say whatever you want, as long
as it doesn’t offend or expose people in

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
power.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,330
Freedom of speech, with Chinese characteristics.

20
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,030
Just part of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,080
But surprisingly, one famous Chinese criminal
law professor failed to understand this.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,040
After one video of his started circulating
online, he had years of work and millions

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,230
of followers on Chinese social media wiped
out.

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,950
This is professor Luo Xiang.

25
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,540
He’s the director of the Institute of Criminal
Law at a prominent university in Beijing.

26
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,350
But he’s much more than that.

27
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,750
Luo Xiang is like a rockstar.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,950
Well, a rockstar among criminal law professors.

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,280
But still, over time he accumulated 2.5 million
followers on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,450
Then, when Covid hit, his classroom lectures
were moved online to Bilibili, China’s version

31
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,780
of YouTube—where he quickly gained 15 million
followers.

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,519
He even got a stint on China’s hip new stand-up
comedy show.

33
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,480
2020 was a magical year for me.

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,690
Out of nowhere, we were in a new generation
of online learning.

35
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,849
Someone uploaded my class lectures on a video
platform, and in one night I gained 10 million

36
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:35,849
followers.

37
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:40,260
I would have never thought that everybody’s
favorite online class, turns out, is a class

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,579
on criminal law.

39
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,579
(audience laughs)

40
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:49,049
I have friends telling me to stop posting
about these advanced topics, and to start

41
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,049
posting selfies.

42
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,249
But with this face?

43
00:02:52,249 --> 00:03:04,110
Though it’s not particularly illegal, it
feels pretty immoral.

44
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:11,840
Hold on, if Luo can make it big with mediocre
jokes like that, how come I can’t get 15

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,549
million followers and an invitation to a Chinese
comedy show?

46
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,819
My jokes are even more mediocre!

47
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,779
But while Professor Luo Xiang may have a lot
of interesting things to say, it’s dangerous

48
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,870
to say some of them.

49
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,250
In a video that was circulating online a couple
weeks ago, he touched the Chinese Communist

50
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,980
Party’s third rail topic: forced organ harvesting.

51
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,980
“People who have mental illness or are mentally
handicapped, who eat from garbage cans, are

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,019
sent to the outskirts to be cleaned, raised
pale and plump.

53
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,079
They are regularly sent to sell their blood,
and even have their organs harvested!

54
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,269
People are raised like animals...

55
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:51,139
“If Social Darwinism goes to the extreme,
If you truly don’t respect others, you’re

56
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,810
treating people like they’re just animals.

57
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:02,150
How could you not say this kind of behavior
constitutes a crime?

58
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,370
It’s impossible!

59
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,270
It’s the crime of intentional harm.

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:11,939
If you remove both of a person’s kidneys,
it’s the crime of intentional homicide.“

61
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:17,579
Luo was talking about cases like this one,
from 2009, where a homeless man was killed

62
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,090
and his organs harvested.

63
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,449
Several doctors were implicated in the crime.

64
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:29,000
It doesn’t seem like Luo was talking about
how the Chinese regime itself kills dissidents

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,770
and ethnic minorities for their organs.

66
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,729
But even mentioning forced organ harvesting
is taboo in China.

67
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,740
Outside China, a lot of people already know
the Chinese Communist Party is killing people

68
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,460
for their organs.

69
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,520
And if you didn’t, check out my episode
“6 Things That Show China's Organ Harvesting

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,430
Is Real”
An international tribunal confirmed it in

71
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,580
2019.

72
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,550
You can read all the evidence in their 60-page
judgement.

73
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,990
Or you can just watch my listicle video.

74
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,210
The point is, forced organ harvesting is being
carried out directly by the Chinese state,

75
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,860
in state-run hospitals.

76
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,210
But the Chinese state also gave itself the
constitutional right to forbid any “free

77
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,280
speech” that “infringes upon the interests
of the State.”

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,030
Which brings us back to professor Luo Xiang.

79
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,460
The Chinese Communist Party does not want
anyone talking about forced organ harvesting—especially

80
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,479
when it’s trying to celebrate its 100-year
anniversary this month.

81
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,520
And so Luo Xiang’s Weibo account was wiped
clean.

82
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,060
It’s not clear whether authorities wiped
his account or whether Luo did it himself

83
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,650
after being pressured.

84
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,570
Either way, it was the result of Luo Xiang
saying things that could not be said.

85
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,590
Human rights activist and lawyer Teng Biao
pointed out that this censorship shows how

86
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,759
“Authorities have repeatedly tightened control
over speech.”

87
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,580
And “Intellectuals with a reputation and
conscience like Luo Xiang are now forced to

88
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,879
quit Weibo and no longer have room to speak.”

89
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,360
Silencing intellectuals: a proud communist
tradition.

90
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,680
But even before Luo Xiang’s Weibo account
was wiped clean, he had made several controversial

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,699
statements.

92
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,340
A lot of his most popular videos criticized
problems in Chinese society, and issues with

93
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,310
China’s legal system.

94
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,560
Like when he said Chinese laws are written
in a vague way, and that makes it easier for

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,110
authorities to abuse them.

96
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,819
Even in this video, Luo is criticizing Social
Darwinism, and how it runs rampant in modern

97
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,460
Chinese society.

98
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,509
Which could be seen as a criticism of the
Chinese Communist Party.

99
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,819
The sad truth is that if you talk about problems
with Chinese society, sooner or later you’re

100
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:52,629
going to get in trouble with the Chinese Communist
Party.

101
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:58,960
Luo Xiang has been repeatedly harassed on
Weibo by “patriotic” pro-CCP commenters.

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,310
And then there’s the fact that he’s criticized
Chinese officials for having double standards.

103
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,580
In this post from January, Luo Xiang pointed
out hypocrisy by China’s foreign minister

104
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,879
Zhao Lijian.

105
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:19,189
Zhao had pushed the theory that the coronavirus
was a bioweapon created by the United States,

106
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,770
and sent out to infect China.

107
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,400
Zhao even called for the World Health Organization
to investigate an American lab at Fort Detrick

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,090
as the possible origin of the coronavirus.

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,389
Professor Luo Xiang saw this and wrote, “Regarding
the theory about America creating the coronavirus

110
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:43,009
as a bioweapon, is this not spreading rumors
and false information?

111
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,060
How come there are no punishments for sharing
this rumor?

112
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:53,090
In accordance with the law, this is a typical
case of purposely broadcasting false and fear-mongering

113
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,090
news.

114
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,150
I hope officials can handle this accordingly.”

115
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,230
No wonder Luo Xiang’s Weibo account was
wiped.

116
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,460
For now, Luo Xiang’s other videos aside
from the organ harvesting one are still up

117
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,879
on his teaching platform, so he can still
give his university lectures.

118
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,669
And his videos are still on Bilibili.

119
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,970
But it looks like he won’t be back on Weibo
anytime soon.

120
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,789
And this episode is sponsored by PC-Doctor
Toolbox.

121
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:24,480
Computer and software crashes, hardware failures,
and general computer slowdowns are way too

122
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
common.

123
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,319
And they can come up during the worst times—like
during a business meeting, or when you're

124
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,130
traveling away from home, and your trusted
IT person isn’t around.

125
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,349
If you're concerned about the health of your
computer and want tools to prevent untimely

126
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,149
system issues, you should be using PC-Doctor
