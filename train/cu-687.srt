00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,840
China Threatens the Biden Administration

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,080
With Four Policy “Red Lines”

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
Plus, China’s dangerous monkey business

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,920
That and more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
Welcome to China Uncensored,\h
I’m Chris Chappell. The Chinese\h\h

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,360
Communist Party has drawn some red\h
lines for the Biden Administration.\h

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,800
But before we begin, YouTube is demonetizing\h
us and secretly unsubscribing people from this\h\h

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,120
channel. You can help us stand up to censorship\h
and ensure you get notified of new episodes\h\h

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,040
by supporting us on Patreon.com/China\h
Uncensored, for as little as a dollar an episode.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,600
So as I said, China has drawn some red lines\h
for the US. Four red lines, to be exact. These\h\h

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,640
are demands the Communist Party is making\h
of the Biden Administration. As my favorite\h\h

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,080
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times, calls\h
them, “‘the red lines’ that can’t be crossed.”

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,160
Those red lines were drawn by Chinese\h
Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi\h\h

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
at a video conference earlier this week.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,480
And it’s kind of confusing. Because they’re not\h
really red lines that can’t be crossed. They’re\h\h

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,880
actually four things that the Chinese Communist\h
Party demands that the US government do.\h

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,120
The US must end support for Taiwan,\h
Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet;\h\h

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,200
resume the U.S.-China dialogue on all levels;\h
end the tariffs on Chinese products and\h\h

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,720
sanctions on Chinese enterprises; and remove\h
all restrictions on China’s state-run media\h\h

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,760
and cultural entities such\h
as the Confucius Institutes.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,200
First, I feel like this is cheating.\h
This is way more than four things.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Second, this sounds like when kids write a\h
Christmas list for Santa and they put four\h\h

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,760
ponies on the list. They know they’re\h
not going to get four ponies. But maybe\h\h

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,840
they could get one pony. Or\h
at least a My Little Pony.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,200
So will Biden make Xi Jinping\h
a Brony? We don’t know yet.\h

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
The reason that the Chinese regime can come\h
out and make these red-line demands now\h\h

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,760
is that Biden has only been in office for\h
a month, and he hasn’t clarified where he\h\h

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,520
stands on a lot of these issues. And it’s not\h
just China that wants to know. For instance,\h\h

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
the Ugyhur rights group, the East\h
Turksitan Government in Exile,\h\h

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,320
has called on Biden to clarify his\h
stance on the genocide of Ugyhur Muslims.

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,680
That was in response to these comments\h
Biden made on a CNN town hall.\h

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,400
I point out to him: No American President\h
can be sustained as a President if he doesn’t\h\h

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,760
reflect the values of the United States.\h And\h
so the idea I’m not going to speak out against\h\h

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,400
what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing\h
with the Uyghurs in western mountains of\h\h

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,360
China and Taiwan, trying to end the One\h
China policy by making it forceful — I\h\h

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,720
said — and by the — he said he — he gets\h
it.\h Culturally, there are different\h\h

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,880
norms that each country and they —\h
their leaders — are expected to follow.

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
Those comments caused a lot of controversy.\h
Conservative media had a field day.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
For more on that, check out this\h
episode of America Uncovered.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,520
And former President Trump is also calling into\h
question Biden’s resolve on China. Here he is\h\h

41
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,920
in an interview with Newsmax, responding\h
to a question about the Biden Town Hall.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
“His family’s involved with the\h
Chinese, certainly, a long time and\h\h

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,160
a lot of money. The whole thing is ridiculous:\h
We had China exactly where we wanted them.”

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,080
Biden has not clarified his China policy yet.\h
But is it as bad as some people make it seem?\h\h

45
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
More on that after the break.

46
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Welcome back.

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,960
So some people are concerned\h
about Biden’s China policy.\h

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,360
However, Biden might just keep\h
Trump’s China tariffs in place.\h

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,480
And Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken\h
has been critical of the Chinese regime.\h\h

50
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,240
He’s called out the genocide of Ugyhurs\h
in Xinjiang. And in a recent interview,\h\h

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,400
he also said China needs to come\h
clean on the coronavirus pandemic.

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
He said, “It requires countries to be transparent;\h\h

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,400
it requires them to share information; it requires\h
them to give access to international experts at\h\h

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,120
the beginning of an outbreak—things that,\h
unfortunately, we haven’t seen from China.”

55
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,080
And State Department spokesman Ned Price\h
expressed concern about a new Chinese law\h\h

56
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,560
that “explicitly allows its coast\h
guard to fire on foreign vessels.”

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
Price said, “We are further concerned\h
that China may invoke this new law\h\h

58
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,160
to assert its unlawful maritime\h
claims in the South China Sea.”

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,120
So at least as far as talking points go, the\h
Biden Administration doesn’t seem to care\h\h

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,520
too much about China’s four red lines. But it’s\h
unclear what kind of actions they plan to take.\h

61
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,200
But the good news is that right now standing\h\h

62
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,920
up to the Chinese Communist\h
Party has bipartisan support.

63
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,040
This week, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck\h
Schumer said he wants a bill to counter China.\h

64
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,000
Specifically he told lawmakers “to\h
start drafting a legislative package\h\h

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,320
to out-compete China and\h
create new American jobs.”

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,400
That sounds nice and all, Mr. Schumer. But\h
with a tough on China stance, have you ever\h\h

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,600
thought about all the wealthy Americans\h
who might lose their investments in China?

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,560
Meanwhile, it turns out China gave US\h
Diplomats anal Covid tests “in error”.

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,120
In error?! A butt dial is an error. A butt\h
swab isn’t something that just happens.

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,280
“Sorry, I was going for your\h
nose but then I slipped.”

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
The US State Department has now\h
assured everyone that it is “committed\h\h

72
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
to preserving the ‘dignity’ of American diplomats\h\h

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
and their families, consistent with the\h
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.”

74
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,080
And I’ll be back with more probing\h
news after this final commercial break.

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,440
Welcome back.\h

76
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,520
According to an Israeli cyber firm, a Chinese\h
hacking tool was modeled on NSA spyware.

77
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,720
It says that the Chinese tool was a copy of a tool\h
used by an NSA group called the Equation Group.\h\h

78
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,440
So China essentially pirated\h
a hacking tool from the NSA.

79
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
“The Tel Aviv-based firm\h
hypothesized that Chinese spies\h\h

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,920
may have obtained the code during an Equation\h
Group operation against a target in China,\h\h

81
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,760
captured it while monitoring an Equation\h
Group attack against a third party,\h\h

82
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,240
or acquired it during a Chinese\h
operation against the Equation Group.”

83
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
So basically everyone is terrible in this story.

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
And speaking of everyone is\h
terrible, UK Prime Minister\h\h

85
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,680
Boris Johnson is rejecting a boycott of the\h
Beijing Olympics despite all the genocide.

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
According to the BBC,\h\h

87
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,320
“Mr Johnson said the UK was ‘leading international\h
action in the UN to hold China to account.’”

88
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,760
International action in the UN? So, Boris\h
Johnson is planning to accomplish nothing.\h

89
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
Sure, his government is demanding\h
China give the United Nations\h\h

90
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,320
“urgent and unfettered” access\h
to Xinjiang to investigate.

91
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,600
But China is treating that about as seriously\h
as Johnson is treating the Olympic boycott.

92
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,480
While we’re on the topic of getting\h
the UN to investigate stuff,\h\h

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
let’s talk about the World Health Organization.

94
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Everyone’s favorite international health\h
organization just got a bit scummier.\h

95
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,200
The Guardian recently obtained an internal\h
World Health Organization document that admitted\h\h

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,560
China did little to hunt for\h
the origins of the coronavirus.

97
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,320
That’s the kind of information\h
that would have saved lives.\h\h

98
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,480
And yet the WHO spent months praising\h
the Chinese Communist Party publicly.\h

99
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,320
“If I had Covid-19, I’d want\h
to be treated in China.”

100
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,760
I’m so glad Biden announced he wants to\h
keep the US as the WHO’s biggest funder.

101
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,160
Now this will shock you, but the Chinese\h
Communist Party has betrayed the Vatican.

102
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,360
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!

103
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:48,000
Is probably something that\h
the Pope would never say.\h

104
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,160
You see, the Vatican and the Chinese Communist\h
Party have argued for years over who has the\h\h

105
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,880
right to appoint Catholic Bishops in China. The\h
Vatican thinks it’s a job for the Catholic Church.\h\h

106
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,840
The Chinese Communist Party thinks it’s a job for\h
the atheist Chinese Communist Party. Makes sense.\h

107
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,640
But after careful negotiation, the Pope\h
agreed to a deal with the Chinese regime.\h\h

108
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,400
What was the deal? Well, the\h
details were never made public.\h

109
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,960
But I’m guessing the Chinese regime\h
has broken whatever agreement they had.\h\h

110
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,880
According to new rules that\h
will take effect on May 1,\h\h

111
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,480
“China’s state-run Catholic Church and\h
bishops’ conference will select, approve,\h\h

112
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,840
and ordain episcopal candidates—with no mention\h
of the Vatican’s involvement in the process.”

113
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,000
You’d think the Pope, as the head\h
of the Catholic Church,\hwould\h\h

114
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,000
know that deals with the Devil\h
usually work out in the Devil’s favor.

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
But I guess the Holy See didn’t see it coming.\h

116
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,040
Last week, the Chinese Communist Party admitted\h
that at least 4 Chinese soldiers died during a\h\h

117
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
border clash with India last year.\h
\h\h

118
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,320
And this week, China detained 6\h
people for insulting those soldiers.

119
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,400
And by insulting, they mean they did things\h
like questioning China’s official death toll.\h\h

120
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,840
And they’re getting up to 15 days in jail for it.

121
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,280
But they’re getting off\h
easy. Because back in 2018,\h\h

122
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,520
China passed a law that bans people from\h
“insulting or slandering heroes and martyrs”.

123
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,640
At the time, it was a civil law. But next\h
month, it will become a criminal law.\h\h

124
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,640
And the penalty goes up to three years in jail.

125
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:47,520
So don’t try to sell Chairman Meow merchandise\h
in China. The penalty could be cat-astrophic.

126
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,680
A great US weakness has been\h
revealed by the coronavirus pandemic.

127
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,880
We were unprepared for it. Not only\h
did the Chinese Communist Party hide\h\h

128
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,680
the severity of the coronavirus in\h
order to hoard medical supplies...

129
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,160
but they also ensured a shortage\h
of test subjects for coronavirus\h\h

130
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,080
research. And by test subjects, I mean monkeys.

131
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,920
Yes, China banned the export of monkeys and other\h
wildlife just when the world needed it most.

132
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,240
You see, as the New York Times\h
says, “The world needs monkeys,\h\h

133
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,960
whose DNA closely resembles that of humans, to\h
develop Covid-19 vaccines. But a global shortage,\h\h

134
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,120
resulting from the unexpected demand caused by\h
the pandemic, has been exacerbated by a recent ban\h\h

135
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,400
on the sale of wildlife from China, the\h
leading supplier of the lab animals.”

136
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,840
Wait, China is the world’s leading supplier\h
of lab animals? Not only do they dominate\h\h

137
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,840
the medical equipment market. They\h
also dominate the monkey market!

138
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,760
This ain’t no monkey business. Okay, it\h
technically is. But the US is taking it seriously.

139
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,440
“The latest shortage has revived talk\h
about creating a strategic monkey reserve.”

140
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,840
So this is how it starts.

141
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,520
But this is actually very similar to how the\h
US has an emergency stockpile of oil and grain.

142
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,280
In other words, President Biden:\h
Build that strategic monkey reserve!

143
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
Strategic Monkey Reserve will also\h
be the name of my new rock band.

144
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,520
And now it’s time for me to answer questions from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

145
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,800
fans who support China Uncensored on\h
the crowd funding website Patreon.

146
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,760
Bill Hanna asks, “Hi Chris, love your channel.\h\h
China was the first recipient of a Tesla Giga\h\h

147
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,040
factory outside of the US and competes directly\h
with local Electric Vehicle manufacturers...Xpeng\h\h

148
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,400
is one such competitor that has a\h
law suit pending about IP theft.\h\h\h

149
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,520
What is the "Un-censored" view of the CCP's\h
real long term view of this relationship.??

150
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
Yes Elon Musk seems to have\h
a rather rosy view of China.

151
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,600
And guess how that’s working out for him?

152
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,960
That was from earlier this month. And\h
this is pretty typical of what happens\h\h

153
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
to big foreign companies when they go to China.\h\h

154
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,760
The Communist Party opens the door, welcomes them\h
in, and then steals their intellectual property,\h\h

155
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,240
makes a Chinese knockoff, and then uses\h
regulation to crush the foreign company.

156
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,560
Now I don’t know if that’s what happened\h
with the Tesla factory. But I wouldn’t\h\h

157
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,280
be surprised if Elon Musk someday finds himself\h
cursing China’s sudden but inevitable betrayal.

158
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,200
Thanks for your question Bill.

159
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
And thank you for watching.\h\h
