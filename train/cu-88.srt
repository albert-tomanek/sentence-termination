00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,530
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,640
Get LinkedIn... to a Chinese spy network!

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,980
We’re really running with the Cold War 2
theme

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,180
And finally, here’s one fight the Shaolin
Temple doesn’t want.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,260
This is China Uncensored

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,830
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,779
The Chinese Communist Party wants to target

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,429
America’s best and brightest.

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:30,989
But there’s more than 300 million people
in the US.

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,320
If only there was some way to narrow down

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,010
and search for the ones with the right kind
of credentials.

13
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,220
Oh right!

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,220
LinkedIn.

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,220
See?

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,220
I’m even on there.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,190
That’s why, according to the US counter
intelligence chief,

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,860
China is waging a super aggressive spy campaign
on LinkedIn.

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,210
Yes, LinkedIn.

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,210
The Chinese Communist Party

21
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,780
has even infiltrated the most boring social
media network.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,430
And their spy campaign isn’t just super
aggressive,

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,560
it’s super effective, too.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,960
Chinese agents have set up

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,189
an as of yet undisclosed number of fake accounts,

26
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,119
“contacting thousands of LinkedIn members
at a time.”

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,460
The Chinese agents look for foreigners

28
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,590
with access to government and commercial secrets.

29
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,799
Then they offer them jobs, for example,

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,999
at a so-called think tank in Shanghai.

31
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:22,869
And once the foreigner takes the job,

32
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,289
they’ll be expected to give up the secrets.

33
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,679
Sounds sketchy and super illegal, sure.

34
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,119
But you got to admit,

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,340
it’s a pretty clever way to

36
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,350
trick people into betraying their country:

37
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,439
“Hey, it’s my job!

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,119
I have to do it for money!”

39
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,020
So far, we don’t know how many people

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,100
this aggressive campaign has successfully
recruited.

41
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,810
But this is something both British

42
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,329
and German authorities have warned of previously.

43
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,880
Which is why I’ve added to my LinkedIn profile

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,399
that I’m not a good candidate for a spy.

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,450
The US has asked LinkedIn to take action

46
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,759
to shut down these Chinese agents’ accounts.

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,399
Could you imagine being the Chinese spy

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,130
whose job is to recruit people through LinkedIn?

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,640
You thought you were going to be James Bond,

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,830
but instead you’re writing the worst recruiting
emails ever.

51
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,230
And incidentally, this is not the first time
LinkedIn

52
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,420
has been at the center of some China controversy.

53
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,500
When they went into the China market back
in 2014,

54
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,390
they started censoring users’ profiles on
the Chinese site

55
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,909
if those profiles had content relating to

56
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,049
the Tiananmen Square Massacre or Falun Gong.

57
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,340
Even if those users were in America.

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,370
The modern world depends on technology in
space.

59
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,370
For example,

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,260
if it weren’t the GPS satellites

61
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
put up by the US government,

62
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,500
I wouldn’t be able to use Google Maps

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,329
to find the nearest Medieval Times theme restaurant,

64
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,530
and enjoy an evening of good old-fashioned
jousting.

65
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,680
So, since we rely so much on GPS satellites...

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,150
this might be a problem.

67
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,579
For years, China has been building up

68
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,500
its anti-satellite capabilities.

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,709
In 2007, China shot down

70
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,860
one of its own weather satellites with a missile.

71
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,150
Its most recent anti-satellite test was last
year.

72
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,980
Chinese authorities claimed it was just

73
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,099
a totally normal missile defense system.

74
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,360
The US, for its part,

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,819
has been falling behind China and Russia

76
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,659
for the future of space warfare

77
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,530
But really, these are exciting times.

78
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,440
As a top official said, we’re in Cold War
2

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,950
With an Arms Race 2

80
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,400
With a Space Race 2

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,239
Now some might tell you this could all lead
to World War 3.

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,879
But, really, that’s ridiculous.

83
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,209
It will be Space Wars 1.

84
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,010
I said “space wars”, Disney.

85
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,030
You can’t sue me!

86
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,700
But I wouldn’t want you to worry that

87
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,559
we won’t still have warfare right here on
Earth, too.

88
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,829
Because China may be also helping with that.

89
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,849
China is helping to set up

90
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,060
a mountain brigade in Afghanistan to fight
terrorism.

91
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,109
And China has a long history of mountain brigades.

92
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,280
What?

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,370
It’s clearly an Outlaws of the Marsh reference.

94
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,469
Come on, people!

95
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,569
It’s a classic.

96
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,980
It’s literally one of the four Chinese classics.

97
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,480
Ok, back to Afghanistan...sadly.

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,659
Now, supposedly,

99
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,920
Chinese troops won’t actually be on Afghan
soil,

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,810
according to the Afghan embassy in Beijing.

101
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,340
But despite that very believable denial,

102
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,740
China has already paid for and started building
a training base

103
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,060
for Afghan troops inside Afghanistan—

104
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,680
in the the Wakhan Corridor,

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,870
which is next to China’s Xinjiang Autonomous
Region.

106
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,390
Xinjiang is where the Communist Party

107
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,020
has detained up to a million Muslims.

108
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,190
Is this mountain brigade really about fighting
terrorism?

109
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,810
Or is it more about cutting off any hope of
escape?

110
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,340
Speaking of no escape,

111
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,370
China’s State council has made it easy

112
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,610
for the happy people of Macau, Hong Kong,

113
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,550
and Taiwan to get Chinese residence cards—

114
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,970
so they can live and/or work in mainland China.

115
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,030
Surely there’s no sinister catch to this!

116
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,280
Here’s the sinister catch.

117
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,210
Misbehave, lose the card.

118
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,270
That could spell trouble for say, Hong Kongers,

119
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,960
who hold the incorrect view of democracy in
Hong Kong.

120
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,970
Or Taiwanese who hold the incorrect view of
what a country is.

121
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,210
Speaking of gradually eroding freedoms,

122
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,740
a new high speed rail linking Hong Kong and
Mainland China

123
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,979
is opening soon.

124
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,580
Part of the train station inside Hong Kong

125
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,750
has been ceded to Mainland Chinese control.

126
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,080
Meaning, for example,

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,080
mainland anti-subversion laws can be enforced
in Hong Kong—

128
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,849
if you’re, say, a dissident

129
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,889
and accidentally step over the line.

130
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,100
Now I know that sounds controversial, but
don’t worry.

131
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,120
The handover was done in a secret ceremony.

132
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,570
“The event was closed to press and neither
news media

133
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,130
nor local lawmakers were given advance notice.”

134
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,740
Probably because if they announced it,

135
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,560
too many overjoyed people would have come
to the train station

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,690
to celebrate this historic event,

137
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,960
creating a public safety issue.

138
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,270
That must be the reason.

139
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,699
Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam,

140
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,660
who was appointed by pro-Beijing interest
groups,

141
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,950
tried to ease Hong Kongers’ worries.

142
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,870
She said “It was not a ceremony per se,”

143
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,590
and also that, “There was nothing sneaky.”

144
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,169
Which is about as reassuring as when your
friend says,

145
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,849
don’t worry, your car is fine.

146
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,419
You have collision insurance, right?

147
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,099
The Chinese Communist Party is not spiteful.

148
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,139
I would never accuse it of that.

149
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,139
But, remember how Australia barred Chinese
telecom companies

150
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,430
from building their 5G network,

151
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,170
because of national security concerns?

152
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,970
Well, it turns out, that same day, in a total
coincidence,

153
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,849
the biggest Australian broadcaster, ABC,

154
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,680
was blocked on the Chinese internet.

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,720
Or the ban could be because I was once interviewed
on ABC.

156
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,100
Six months ago.

157
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,320
Ok, it was probably because of Huawei.

158
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,050
The Chinese Communist Party is trying to “sinicize”
religions.

159
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,460
In other words, make religions

160
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,159
more loyal to the Chinese Communist Party.

161
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,159


162
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,159
Maybe this is some sort of

163
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:10,900
alternative to persecuting Christians.

164
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
And Muslims.

165
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
And Tibetans.

166
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
And Falun Gong.

167
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,509
I mean, wouldn’t it be easier of those religions

168
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,380
could just be morally flexible,

169
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,620
and change their core beliefs to worship

170
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,000
the atheist Communist Partyinstead of their
god or whatever?

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,110
Of course it would!

172
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,240
And you know who “gets it”?

173
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,970
The Shaolin Temple.

174
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,460
They just hoisted the Chinese flag.

175
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,940
A first in its 1,500 year history.

176
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,199
State-run media said it was because

177
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,570
they were leading the way in sinicization.

178
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,970
Although, according to one Shaolin monk

179
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,000
who spoke to Radio Free Asia,

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,039
it was because authorities forced them to
do it.

181
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,729
I mean...couldn’t they have fought back?

182
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,069
Isn’t fighting back what Shaolin monks are
supposed to do?!

183
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,150
It’s the kung fu movie we’re all waiting
to see!

184
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,319
A small group of rebel monks take on

185
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,479
and defeat the entire Chinese paramilitary!

186
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,150
While playing soccer!

187
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,490
But sadly, the only kung fu move they did

188
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,250
was “docile tiger, obedient dragon”.

189
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,300
So what do you think?

190
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,889
Leave your comments below.

191
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,430
And now the moment you’ve been waiting for,

192
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,789
I answer questions from fans who are

193
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,880
a part of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,

194
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,539
a group of rebel viewers who support this
show

195
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:22,910
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

196
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,800
David Michael White asks,

197
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,120
“Chris, will you participate in No Shave
November?”

198
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,780
Oh David.

199
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,920
You don’t remember the last time I did that?

200
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,880
Never again.

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,860
I can’t do that to all of you.

202
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,080
Unless, you think it looks good...

203
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,780
I could be talked into it...

204
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,320
what’s that Shelley?

205
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,100
Okay, I will not be growing a mustache again.

206
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,850
Thanks for your question, David.

207
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,300
And for all of you, if you want to send me
your questions,

208
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,829
become a member of the China Uncensored 50
cent army

209
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:57,910
by supporting the show on Patreon with a dollar
or more per episode.

210
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,440
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,560
See you next time.

212
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,060
Thanks for watching.

213
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,430
Did you know we also make a half-hour version
of this show every week?

214
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,050
It’s broadcast on the NTD network in New
York, LA, and San Francisco.

215
