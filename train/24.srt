"And so the waitress asked, 'super sex'?

6
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,050
"And the vicar said, 'I didn't realise there
was a choice!'"

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,090
- I ****ed that one up.
- Yeah, you have.

8
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,150
The punchline is 'super sex'. Come back to
me! I'll try that again!

Ooh! "I can talk!"

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,330
You can talk.

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,970
What? Ooh, it's all gone a bit meta.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,860
- Shall we start again?
- Yes!

15
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,380
I've lost my line now! I'll make something
up, it'll be fine.

Wow! Zings off the room, that one!

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,799
Ow! I don't feel good about myself at all!

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,460
Has anyone got any burn cream?

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,060
I'm going to go around the horn again, if
that's OK!

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,380
"The horn"!

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,180

"Could you? Would you mind awfully...

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,250
"I think it would just break the atmosphere."

34
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,750
"Just turn round, and when it gets to you..."

35
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,200
Let's go for it. We're wasting mirth here.

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,479
I'm not sure we are!
