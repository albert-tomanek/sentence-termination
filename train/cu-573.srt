1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:03,650
A Cover Up of the Deadly Coronavirus

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,859
Was only the beginning of the cruelty

3
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:08,880
China’s response to the Coronavirus

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,460
Can only be described as “vile”

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,200
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,560
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,510
Now this may shock you, but it turns out,

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,310
an authoritarian regime that’s killed

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,380
millions of its own people over the years

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,849
doesn’t really care if people die from an
epidemic.

11
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,210
Not if the bigger threat is to its own rule.

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,210
The Chinese Communist Party

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,780
spent the first crucial weeks of the Wuhan
coronavirus outbreak

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,120
trying to cover it up,

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,579
which meant more people got sick.

16
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,100
And that’s bad because it makes the Party
look bad.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,149
Like that international media are calling
it

18
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,710
“China’s governance failure.”

19
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,390
Even more humiliating, Chinese people

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,359
are actually praising Japan’s response to
the virus

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,750
and the help they’ve given China.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,890
And that is impressive,

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,590
given the Communist Party’s decades of propaganda

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,110
about how terrible the Japanese are.

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,480
But don’t worry,

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,690
there’s still something the Chinese Communist
Party

27
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,340
can hate even more than Japan.

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,800
And that is America.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,580
China’s Foreign Ministry is accusing the
US

30
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,360
of not helping with the coronavirus

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,550
and spreading fear and chaos by…

32
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,260
...evacuating its citizens from Wuhan.

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,140
And instituting a travel ban on foreign nationals
coming in from China.

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,720
Just like many other countries.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,930
Including Japan.

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,590
And while Chinese state-run media accused
the US of not offering help,

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,580
that’s...a lie.

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,930
The US had offered to send CDC experts to
help in Wuhan.

39
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,000
That was back in early January,

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,960
when officials were still trying to pretend
things were fine.

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,650
China rejected the US’s offer.

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,870
Now US experts will be joining a W.H.O. delegation

43
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,510
to help with the coronavirus.

44
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,620
Meanwhile, the Chinese central government

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,320
is demanding that local Wuhan officials

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,740
round up everyone who may be infected,

47
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,280
and force them to go to quarantine centers.

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,580
A Beijing official has demanded that

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,390
“City investigators should go to each home

50
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,850
to check the temperatures of every resident.”

51
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,350
And that “During these wartime conditions,

52
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,820
there must be no deserters,

53
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,430
or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical
shame forever.”

54
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,790
It should be noted that the quarantine centers

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,000
don’t actually have nearly enough beds for
everyone.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,600
And many of them don’t have enough doctors
or supplies

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,280
or even basic conditions to prevent the spread
of infection.

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,230
Although mentioning that might also get you

59
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,860
nailed to that pillar of historical shame.

60
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,170
Here’s a photo from inside a Wuhan gymnasium

61
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,540
that’s being converted into a quarantine
center.

62
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,530
That does not look like a good isolation ward
to me.

63
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,140
And anyone trying to get real news out from
Wuhan is being targeted.

64
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,730
One citizen journalist named Fang Bin spent
days

65
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,650
traveling to hospitals,

66
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,400
documenting overcrowded conditions

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
and a lot of dead bodies.

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,830
Then the police showed up at his door.

69
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,300
Well, technically they were just a group of
men in hazmat suits s

70
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,840
aying they had to see if he was infected.

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,150
Obviously, to test if he had the coronavirus,

72
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,490
these men had to break into his home,

73
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,970
and take away his laptop, desktop computer,
and cellphone.

74
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,069
And then they took him to a police station.

75
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,970
As is common procedure for well trained medical
staff.

76
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,680
The police “accused him of taking money
from ‘foreign forces,’

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,120
and threatened to quarantine him for ‘creating
fear.’”

78
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,080
Yeah, somehow I don’t think that’s a quarantine
you’d ever come back from.

79
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,400
Luckily, others quickly spread word of Fang
Bin’s detention online,

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,069
and he was released.

81
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,220
But beyond citizen journalists,

82
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,750
there are also doctors who’ve spoken out.

83
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,240
Dr. Li Wenliang

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,090
was one of eight doctors detained by Wuhan
police

85
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,540
after he warned other colleagues about the
coronavirus.

86
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,750
His mistake?

87
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,500
Speaking the truth while the Communist Party
was trying to cover it up.

88
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,290
Police let him go after he signed a statement

89
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,710
hat he would no longer commit “unlawful
acts.”

90
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,160
Unfortunately, none of that matters now,

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,430
because he died this week—

92
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,000
after contracting the coronavirus he tried
to expose.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He leaves behind his pregnant wife and a 5-year-old
child.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
But the tragedy doesn’t end there.

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
After initial reports from state-run media
that Dr. Li had died,

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
there was a furious backlash on Chinese social
media.

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,940
And Dr. Li was suddenly no longer dead.

98
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,000
Instead, the hospital said he was in critical
condition

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,919
and on life support.

100
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,460
There were reports that Dr. Li had been put
on life support

101
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,460
hours after he had already passed due to the
backlash.

102
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,700
Hours later, after the hospital finally officially
announced his death,

103
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,840
the online anger continued.

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,560
People posted images like this one,

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,810
with Dr. Li’s mask replaced by barbed wire.

106
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,530
They used references to Les Mis and Chernobyl
to mourn Dr. Li.

107
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,110
And hashtags like I want freedom of speech.

108
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,860
And after that was censored,

109
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,669
we *demand* freedom of speech.

110
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,760
They even posted protest videos on TikTok.

111
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,010
But don’t worry,

112
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,830
the Chinese Communist Party knows how to handle
this.

113
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,130
First, “control” the online reaction.

114
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,699
And then, send officials to “investigate”
Dr. Li’s death.

115
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:50,480
The only question is, who will the scapegoat
be?

116
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,699
And it’s not just doctors and citizen journalists

117
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,520
the Party is going after.

118
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,070
They’ve turned anyone from Wuhan into pariahs,

119
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,710
turning neighbors against neighbors.

120
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,060
In one case,

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,290
authorities used metal poles to barricade
a family

122
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,490
that had been to Wuhan.

123
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,490
If you’re wondering how that family gets
food,

124
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,800
they rely on neighbors to lower something
down to their rear balcony window.

125
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,840
And some local officials are offering bounties
to people

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,440
who turn in Wuhan residents who are hiding
in other cities.

127
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,930
As the New York Times says,

128
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,200
“Across the country,

129
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,570
the response from local authorities often
resembles

130
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,010
the mass mobilizations of the Mao era.”

131
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,410
And I wish I could say that was the worst
of it.

132
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,470
But I’ve found with the Chinese Communist
Party,

133
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,720
the worst can always get worse.

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,330
Check out this story.

135
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,690
Authorities quarantined the father of a boy
who had cerebral palsy.

136
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,000
So the father “posted on Chinese social
media platform Weibo

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,910
appealing for help and explaining that his
son

138
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,320
had been left alone without food or water.”

139
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,470
Well, that didn’t go so well.

140
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,150
Without adequate care, the boy died.

141
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,560
Two local officials were fired in connection
to this case,

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,360
but this is always what happens.

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,060
Systemic corruption leads to tragedy,

144
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,310
and the Commuinst Party tries to push the
blame on local officials,

145
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,880
while the ultimate source of the problem remains
untouched.

146
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,990
Meanwhile, the Communist Party for more than
a week

147
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,050
denied Taiwan’s requests to evacuate its
citizens from mainland China...

148
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,130
since, you know, they don’t allow Taiwan
to have their own citizens,

149
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,240
because they consider Taiwan to be part of
China.

150
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,680
But finally, on February 3,

151
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,550
a charter flight was arranged,

152
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,900
but not through the Taiwanese government,

153
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,430
because the Communist Party can’t admit

154
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,890
there’s a separate Taiwanese government.

155
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,210
Instead, the flight was arranged through a
Taiwanese businessman.

156
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,520
It was supposed to get the most vulnerable
people out first—

157
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,789
frail and elderly Taiwan citizens.

158
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,850
At least, that’s who was on the flight manifest.

159
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,139
But it turns out,

160
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,240
dozens of the passengers who actually boarded
the plane

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,979
were not people with urgent needs,

162
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,729
but instead the spouses and children

163
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:13,110
of wealthy Taiwanese business people.

164
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,550
There are also reports that one person added
to the flight

165
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,430
was already confirmed to have the coronavirus.

166
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,449
As you can imagine, people in Taiwan are a
little upset about this.

167
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,220
Speaking of Taiwan, the Chinese Communist
Party

168
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,519
is using its position in the United Nations

169
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,889
to turn the deadly outbreak into a political
weapon against Taiwan.

170
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,979
The World Health Organization is a UN Body.

171
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,300
“At Beijing’s behest, the WHO has given
Taiwan the pariah treatment...

172
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,329
The WHO has held two emergency meetings since
the coronavirus outbreak.

173
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,339
Taiwan wasn’t permitted to attend.”

174
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,170
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party

175
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,879
is using the coronavirus to play politics.

176
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,990
So it really undermines the credibility of
the WHO

177
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,889
when its director praised

178
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:08,779
“the seriousness with which China is taking
this outbreak,

179
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,670
especially the commitment from top leadership,

180
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,279
and the transparency they have demonstrated.”

181
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,089
I think Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman
explained it a little better.

182
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,649
“We have seen the Chinese government rudely

183
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,059
and unreasonably pressuring Taiwan on the
international stage

184
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,200
and putting political considerations above
human health.

185
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,670
We have seen that the disease has no national
boundaries

186
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,800
and epidemic prevention around the world should
have no loopholes,

187
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,769
so that they are putting political considerations
over people's health and safety,

188
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,959
this, basically, is extremely vile.”

189
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,899
“Extremely vile” sounds about right.

190
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,920
So what do you think about how the Chinese
Communist Party

191
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,370
has responded to the coronavirus?

192
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,370
Tell me what you think in the comments below.

193
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,369
And as you may have heard me mention,

194
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:57,249
YouTube has refused to run ads

195
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:00,209
on most of our episodes about the coronavirus.

196
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:04,100
Which means we can’t afford to keep covering
it.

197
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,769
Except for one thing:

198
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,809
We have the support of viewers like you,

199
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,199
whom I call the China Uncensored 50 cent army.

200
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,500
Through your contributions on the crowdfunding
website Patreon,

201
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,660
China Uncensored can keep paying our staff
and our expenses,

202
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,339
so we can keep letting you know about important
China issues,

203
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:23,889
like a deadly global pandemic.

204
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,589
So as a thank you to supporters,

205
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:28,579
I answer a question from them at the end of
some of my episodes.

206
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,860
Today’s question comes from Logan.

207
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,689
“Is there any truth to the drones with disinfectant
story

208
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,160
I have been hearing about?”

209
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,829
Wow, you know what?

210
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:39,490
It’s true.

211
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,740
According to Chinese state-run media,

212
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,990
they are using drones to spray disinfectant.

213
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,720
I guess in China, chemtrails are real.

214
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,579
Drones are actually being used in a lot of
ways

215
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:51,540
to combat the coronavirus.

216
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,810
In some cases,

217
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,279
drones are delivering groceries to people
in quarantined villages.

218
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,290
And my favorite state-run media the Global
Times

219
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:04,139
reposted online videos of drones yelling at
people to go home.

220
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,800
Some of the drones were used by local traffic
police.

221
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,209
Others, like this one, were from a local social
media influencer

222
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,400
working with his village Communist Party committee.

223
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,840
Yes, auntie, this is the drone speaking to
you.

224
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,980
You shouldn’t walk about without wearing
a mask.

225
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,820
Yes, you’d better go back home and don’t
forget to wash your hands.

226
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
You see we’ve been telling people to stay
at home

227
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,220
but you still wander outside.

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,080
Now a drone is watching you.

229
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,260
I mean, that’s only marginally less scary

230
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,040
than actually getting sick from the coronavirus.

231
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,920
Thanks for your question, Logan.

232
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,610
