1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,260
China is killing Africa with debt

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,380
And colonizing it

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,560
Country by Country

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,759
This China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,230
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,059
Have you ever borrowed money—

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,580
say, for school, or a shipping port—

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,390
but struggled to pay it back?

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,589
And then your loan shark,

10
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,099
I mean, lender was like

11
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,170
“Ok, no problem.

12
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,490
Just give me the rights to everything you
earn

13
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,050
for the next 99 years.”

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,430
I think we can all relate.

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,270
And so can a lot of countries who’ve borrowed
money from China.

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,340
It’s called “debt-trap diplomacy”.

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,320
Just ask Sri Lanka, a small island nation
off the coast of India.

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,190
In 2010, they got a small 1.5 billion dollar
Chinese loan

19
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,920
to build a giant shipping port in the town
of Hambantota.

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,800
But there wasn’t much shipping traffic,

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,240
which meant not much cashflow.

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,290
Sri Lanka missed a few payments and,

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,290
next thing you know,

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,950
they had to sign away the entire port to China

25
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,440
with a 99-year lease.

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,390
But it’s not always easy to learn from others’
mistakes.

27
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,160
In Africa, dozens of countries have taken
out Chinese loans.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,390
And last September,

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,880
China pledged to invest another 60 billion
dollars in Africa.

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,290
“China and Africa will join hands to build

31
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,680
a China-Africa community with shared future

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,450
that features win-win cooperation,

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,880
happiness for all,

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,860
and harmonious coexistence.”

35
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,240
Of course, Xi Jinping’s definition of win-win
is that,

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,630
if the country can pay off the loan,

37
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,630
China wins.

38
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,820
If they can’t,

39
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,960
China takes over its assets instead,

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,590
and China still wins.

41
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,850
So, win-win.

42
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,270
So which African countries are most at risk
of,

43
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,880
shall we call it,

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,390
“getting Sri Lanka’d”?

45
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,049
Well, here are the five African countries

46
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,880
with the most debt to China.

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,340
Number 5

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,490
Sudan.

49
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,909
Sudan was first country in sub-saharan Africa

50
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,760
to recognize the People’s Republic of China.

51
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,049
That was back in 1959.

52
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:08,300
The Diplomat calls it China's original foothold.

53
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,209
Which should not be confused with the original
Footloose.

54
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:13,969
You can tell the difference because Footloose
had Kevin Bacon,

55
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,840
and Sudan had...genocide.

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,799
Sudan is a conflict-torn country that holds
the record

57
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,469
for the longest-running civil war in Africa,

58
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,639
resulting in the deaths of 2 million people

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,969
and the breakup of the country into Sudan
and South Sudan.

60
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,840
Here’s Sudan’s leader Omar al-Bashir

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,660
at the recent China-Africa summit in Beijing.

62
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,659
Bashir’s name might sound familiar because
of...

63
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,069
all the war crimes he committed in Darfur.

64
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,069
Allegedly.

65
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,760
But things are looking up for Sudan,

66
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,540
since it’s set to get the largest share
of that 60 billion dollars

67
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,910
Xi Jinping pledged Africa back in September.

68
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,640
Chinese investment in Sudan has given China

69
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,140
control of around 75% of the country’s oil
industry,

70
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,560
under supervision of the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC).

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,829
Although some of the facilities are fixer-uppers.

72
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,159
Some of that Chinese money was used

73
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,279
to upgrade the Khartoum Refinery

74
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,709
and double production to 100,000 barrels a
day.

75
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,099
Which is important.

76
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,099
Because the vast majority of that oil goes
to China.

77
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,609
And there are plenty of other resources to
tap in Sudan, too.

78
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,609
Like gold.

79
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,020
And loyalty.

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,430
Sudan’s estimated debt to China is now $6.4
billion dollars.

81
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,489
And with China’s pledge to provide more
financing,

82
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,230
that debt could balloon big time.

83
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,540
According to this IMF report,

84
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,819
“Sudan’s external debt is assessed to
be unsustainable.”

85
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,049
But that’s not even so bad,

86
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,230
compared to several other countries, including...

87
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,480
Number 4

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,950
The Republic of the Congo.

89
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,370
Not to be confused with the Democratic Republic
of the Congo,

90
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,419
its larger and less democratic neighbor.

91
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,519
The Republic of the Congo owes China 7.3 billion
dollars.

92
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,049
“China and Congo have launched projects

93
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:03,439
worth several billion dollars.

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,739
These include a motorway between Brazzaville

95
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,159
and the economic capital of Pointe Noire,

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,290
the construction of Brazzaville Stadium,

97
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,139
a hydro-electric dam,

98
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,589
and upgrades to the country’s airport.”

99
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:18,049
According to a paper by the China-Africa Research
Initiative,

100
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,769
the Republic of the Congo is one of three
African countries—

101
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,199
alongside Zambia and Djibouti—

102
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,550
where Chinese loans make up

103
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,680
“the most significant contributor to high
risk of debt distress.”

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,180
So what does this Chinese debt mean?

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,009
It’s a growing amount,

106
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,920
we don’t know the conditions,

107
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,680
and these countries are going to be increasingly
leveraged

108
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,010
to repay that when they are unable,

109
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,050
China will make additional demands,

110
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,509
these countries will have less money

111
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,259
to spend on social services and other programs,

112
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:50,419
it’s somewhat of a downward spiral.”

113
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,810
The mere thought of those “additional demands”

114
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,580
are making Congo’s president break out in
a sweat.

115
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,949
Some of the projects there have raised eyebrows,

116
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,520
like when Chinese companies built

117
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,330
the new Congolese parliament building.

118
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,340
For free!

119
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,060
Maybe it’s so they can make sure the offices

120
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,430
are set up just the way they like it

121
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,080
when Congo defaults on its debts

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
and Chinese officials move in and take over.

123
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,389
No, I’m just kidding.

124
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,840
The Chinese regime doesn’t want to take
over.

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,590
It’s more likely that they built the parliament
building

126
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,300
so they could bug the whole thing.

127
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,360
Like they did with the African Union building.

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,460
More about that in a few minutes.

129
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,409
According to the IMF,

130
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,830
Congo is officially in debt distress

131
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,689
and they’ve been shopping around for a bailout.

132
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,099
But it’s not going to be easy.

133
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,430
When the IMF did some due diligence,

134
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,479
they found the Republic of the Congo

135
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,360
may be hiding part of its debt.

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,380
The the country claims its debt to GDP ratio
is 77% of GDP.

137
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,980
But the IMF calculated that ratio to be 117%.

138
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,689
They accused the government of lying,

139
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:02,120
and called for an anti-corruption watchdog

140
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,379
to be set up before they agree to release
any funds.

141
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,389
But I have a better idea,

142
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,080
one that won’t require Congo to clean up
its corruption.

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,850
Congo is a major oil producer,

144
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,689
so maybe China will agree to take oil as collateral...

145
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,900
and then lend them some more money.

146
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,439
It’ll be win-win.

147
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,590
For China.

148
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,889
Number 3

149
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:26,889
Kenya

150
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,430
Home of the famous Maasai warriors.

151
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,009
“Kenya's Maasai warriors may have used spears
like these

152
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,639
to hunt wild animals in the past.

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,330
But now they're using them to take part in
Maasai olympics.”

154
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,199
In the past young Maasai men proved themselves
by killing lions.

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,819
But now, with its debt to China at nearly
8 billion dollars,

156
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,740
the Maasai are instead hunting for cash.

157
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,880
More money, fewer dead lions.

158
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Win-win.

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,590
But not all Kenyans feel like they’re winning.

160
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,789
There are reports of disgruntled travelers

161
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,139
on a new 3.5 billion dollar railway,

162
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,540
built and funded by China.

163
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,879
“Customers complain tickets can be bought
one-way only

164
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,020
and just 3 days in advance.”

165
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,060
The 290-mile Nairobi-Mombasa railway

166
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,810
is Kenya’s biggest infrastructure project

167
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,080
since the country became independent in 1964.

168
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,169
It’s catchy slogan with Chinese characteristics
is:

169
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,569
“Connecting Nations.

170
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,949
Prospering People.”

171
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,939
Kenya’s president loves his train set so
much,

172
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,139
that he recently secured another 3.6 billion
dollar loan from China

173
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,680
to extend the railway line by 155 miles.

174
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,979
Opposition parties say the project is too
expensive,

175
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,419
won’t generate enough revenue,

176
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,719
and is a ticking financial time bomb.

177
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,020
Because after a 10-year grace period,

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,009
Kenya has to start paying back the loan.

179
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,889
But Kenya’s president isn’t worried.

180
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,770
Because that’ll be the next president’s
problem.

181
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,050
Number 2

182
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,050
Ethiopia.

183
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,629
Ethiopia owes China an estimated 13.5 billion
dollars.

184
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,520
But don’t worry.

185
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,199
China’s ambassador says by lending all this
cash,

186
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,629
China is not only helping Ethiopia,

187
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,860
but the entire world.

188
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,870
“China sometimes feels lonely,

189
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,220
because we are one of the biggest,

190
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,249
and the only country that has invested heavily

191
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:33,390
in the development of infrastructure in this
country,

192
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,300
because we believe finally the development
of infrastructure

193
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,860
has not only served the local people,

194
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,480
the host country,

195
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,530
it has also served the investors from other
countries.”

196
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,370
How selfless.

197
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,700
Chinese money and Chinese workers built Ethiopia

198
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,030
a rail link to neighboring Djibouti,

199
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,040
and a system of trams in Ethiopia’s capital,

200
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,710
Addis Ababa.

201
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,760
“It’s good they’re building the tram

202
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,680
to reduce the traffic jams in the city.

203
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,460
With regard to quality,

204
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,970
I think the Chinese did an ok job.

205
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,420
Still, it might have been better to give it
to a Western company.”

206
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,270
Well, at least the quality is ok.

207
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,110
Not as high tech as the African Union headquarters

208
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,630
China built in Ethiopia, though.

209
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,930
That building is so advanced,

210
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,900
it was able to spy on people inside and transmit

211
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,960
confidential data to Shanghai each day for
5 years.

212
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
In China’s defense,

213
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,310
it was a feature,

214
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,110
not a bug.

215
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,110
And...

216
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,430
Number 1

217
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,590
Angola.

218
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,790
It’s the African country with the most debt
to China:

219
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,100
$25 billion dollars.

220
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,060
To rack up that kind of debt,

221
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,230
it took more than a few one-off projects.

222
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,940
In Angola, Chinese companies and Chinese loans

223
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,680
are building entire cities.

224
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,090
Like the city of Zongo,

225
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,600
on the outskirts of the capital.

226
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,540
“The multi-million dollar city is being
fully-funded

227
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,740
by the China International Fund Limited.

228
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,870
It will hand over the project to the government
upon completion.”

229
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,200
Yes, it will definitely hand it over to the
Angolan government.

230
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,610
Because it’s the right thing to do.

231
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,490
Incidentally, that China International Fund
Limited

232
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,990
has shady links to the Chinese regime,

233
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,990
and a history of investing in unstable African
dictatorships,

234
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,450
all the while securing rights to extract minerals
and other resources.

235
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,340
Chinese companies are also using debt

236
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,880
to finance what will become the biggest airport

237
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,300
in a city you’ve never heard of:

238
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Luanda.

239
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,840
Luanda is Angola’s capital,

240
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,710
but it probably doesn’t need an airport
as big as the one in Cairo,

241
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,030
a city you’ve definitely heard of.

242
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,460
Especially when it costs nearly 4 billion
dollars,

243
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,700
and is several years behind schedule.

244
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
On the plus side,

245
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,440
the construction is creating jobs in a country

246
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,240
where the unemployment rate is 20%.

247
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,030
The downside is,

248
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,290
those jobs are being done

249
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,440
almost exclusively by Chinese workers.

250
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,010
And let’s just say locals are not happy.

251
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,470
Maybe this isn’t a win-win.

252
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,780
So what do you think about African countries

253
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,060
being so highly indebted to China?

254
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,510
Leave your comments below.

255
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,680
And before we go,

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,250
it’s time to answer a question from a fan

257
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,370
who supports China Uncensored

258
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,970
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

259
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,430
David Michael White asks

260
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,710
“Chris, I know that it's been awhile

261
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,010
since you have been in South Korea

262
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,910
but what was the best part of your trip there?”

263
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,110
Good question, David.

264
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,600
Matt and I went to South Korea in February
2016—

265
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,810
where we explored traditional Korean clothing...

266
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,410
Traditional Korean dancing...

267
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,140
And traditional Korean fried chicken.

268
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
But the best part of our trip

269
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,520
was definitely going to border with North
Korea.

270
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,250
We almost didn’t make it.

271
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,460
We has asked our Korean guide to drive us,

272
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,530
but they wouldn’t let us in, because—

273
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,690
and this is actually the reason—

274
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,890
because he was Korean.

275
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,150
Apparently, locals are too big of a risk

276
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,530
unless they’ve gotten special permission.

277
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,210
Anyway, we didn’t get in

278
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,340
and we had to fly home the next day.

279
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,920
But before we left,

280
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,150
Shelley explained to me over the phone that,

281
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,410
you know, it is possible to change plane tickets.

282
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,410
Which we did.

283
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,410
And two days later,

284
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,840
we signed a waiver acknowledging

285
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,920
that we accept the risk of being shot at any
time,

286
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,230
and we stepped over the line into North Korea.

287
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,120
“So what country are we in right now?”

288
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,170
“Think about it.

289
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,610
We crossed the border line.

290
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,830
North Korea.

291
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,290
North Korea this side.”

292
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,290
That was a fun trip.

293
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,250
Thanks for your question, David.

294
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,040
And thank you for watching.

295
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,990
Be like David and support China Uncensored
