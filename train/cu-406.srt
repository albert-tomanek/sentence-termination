1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:02,409
Could Chinese soldiers…

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:05,990
be about to get a major headache?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,950
And the US lifts Taiwan travel restrictions.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:17,910
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,600
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,500
Before I begin, did you know YouTube has been
secretly unsubscribing people and demonetizing

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,440
a lot of our videos?

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,410
You can help the show by hitting the like

Wednesday, Friday, and sometimes Saturday.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,579
So check back often.

12
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,449
Life’s hard for a Chinese soldier.

13
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:49,210
Most of the time, you’re not actually doing
any real training.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,460
You’re studying Communist Party ideology—singing
propaganda songs, performing propaganda skits,

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,410
and going through ideological “reflection
sessions.”\h

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,360
And when it comes to actual training—I’m
not entirely sure what playing hot potato

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,010
with a live grenade is supposed to accomplish.

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:16,740
Other than make for highly trained soldiers. 

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:27,920
I’m sure Taiwan is terrified.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,289
So given the state of the PLA, when you see
reports that China has developed a helmet

21
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:40,479
with a self-destruct system, one that could
be controlled remotely to blow up the soldier

22
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,049
if they fall into enemy hands, it might seem
easy to believe.

23
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,399
But as far as we can tell, that story is not
true.\h

24
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,090
Here’s where the story came from.

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,170
On December 27, Chinese state-run media China
Observer, published a report about Chinese

26
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:05,149
troops in Tibet being equipped with a new
individual digital combat system.\h

27
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:11,520
Then a website called 123 Military Observation
Room, which seems to be some kind of military

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,440
news blog, picked up the story.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,860
In their headline, they claimed that the system
could self-destruct if captured by the Indian

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,080
army.

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,060
They also said that “heavily injured soldiers,
who do not want to be taken captive, can activate

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,670
the mechanism to defend his or her dignity
as a member of the military, while preventing

33
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,910
the enemy from obtaining information about
the system.”

34
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,230
So that makes it sound like the “self-destruct”
wouldn't just destroy the combat system, but

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,160
it would also “self-destruct” the soldier.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,760
And the article also claimed that the self-destruct
could be activated remotely by the command

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,680
center if they lost contact with a soldier.

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,430
\h
As you can imagine, this story that seemed

39
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:07,920
to claim that PLA commanders could remotely
self-destruct soldiers, caused an...explosive...reaction

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,370
online.

41
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,390
Netizens were incredibly angry.

42
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,700
The reaction was so explosive that the article
ended up self-destructing.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,250
It’s been pretty much censored from the
Chinese internet.\h\h

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,280
But where did this article get their information?

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,080
They said it was from the PLA’s website,
but we couldn’t find anything like that

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
on there.

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,430
So it’s likely either exaggerated or completely
made up.

48
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,440
Fake news with Chinese characteristics.

49
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,320
The problem is, that article started being
picked up by overseas Chinese news websites,

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,330
and then translated into English, and so now
you may have seen claims that Chinese soldiers

51
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,760
have helmets that can blow them up.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,260
Again, as far as we can tell, that’s not
true.\h\h

53
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,230
I’m sure that’s a relief for all of the
PLA soldiers currently playing grenade hot

54
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,540
potato.

55
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,240
The State Department has radically changed
the US Taiwan relationship.

56
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,890
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in this
statement, “Taiwan is a vibrant democracy

57
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,470
and reliable partner of the United States,
and yet for several decades the State Department

58
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,820
has created complex internal restrictions
to regulate our diplomats, servicemembers,

59
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,010
and other officials’ interactions with their
Taiwanese counterparts.

60
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,690
The United States government took these actions
unilaterally, in an attempt to appease the

61
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,060
Communist regime in Beijing.

62
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,070
No more.”

63
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,470
The Chinese Communist Party is furious.

64
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,660
My favorite state-run media, the Global Times,
suggested Pomepo may “toll the knell”

65
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,740
for Taiwanese officials.

66
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,850
Weird expression.\h

67
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:54,370
Anyway, the editorial says that “Those who
infringe China on core interests will be doomed.”

68
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,910
Ok, that’s pretty clear.

69
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,950
And it does certainly raise some questions
for the coming Biden Administration.

70
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,950
Going back on America’s current support
for Taiwan would look like Biden is abandoning

71
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,700
a democratic ally to get in good with a communist
authoritarian regime—confirming the fears

72
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,370
a lot of people have about so-called “Beijing
Biden.”

73
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,670
So will Biden continue with the Trump Administration’s
tough-on-China polices?\h

74
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,060
Pompeo is definitely trying to force Biden’s
hand.

75
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,070
The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations
Kelly Craft was supposed to make a trip to

76
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,730
Taiwan this week.\h

77
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:38,450
But Pompeo said all travel was cancelled because
of “transition efforts with President-elect

78
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,730
Biden’s team”.

79
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,020
So Pompeo is definitely trying to lay it all
on Biden.

80
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,139
But it's not just Pompeo standing up to the
Chinese Communist Party.

81
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,770
Australia has rejected a multi million dollar
Chinese buyout of an Australian builder because

82
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,670
of security concerns.

83
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,360
The Chinese Company, state-owned China State
Construction Engineering Corporation wanted

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,139
to buy a controlling share of the Australian
builder ProBuild.

85
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,490
Blocking the buyout may be a wise move.

86
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,990
Because over in the US, the Defense Department
has blacklisted China State Construction Engineering

87
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,730
Corporation—since it has links to the People’s
Liberation Army, which is the military arm

88
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,700
of the Chinese Communist Party.

89
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,510
I know, a Chinese state-run company with links
to the Chinese military?

90
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,190
You’re shocked.\h

91
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:35,480
Speaking of explosive news, guess which American
has been exposed as a lobbyist for a Chinese

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,710
surveillance company?

93
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,670
The answer, after the break.

94
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,240
Welcome back.

95
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,270
You may remember former US Senator from California
Barbara Boxer.\h

96
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,270
After retiring from government, Boxer joined
a Washington DC based lobbying firm.

97
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,280
And one of that firm’s clients is Hikvision.

98
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:06,220
If that name rings a bell it’s because in
2019, the US unfairly blacklisted Hikvision,

99
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,300
simply because it helped the glorious Chinese
Communist Party do mass surveillance—I mean,

100
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,250
security—for the Uyghur people.

101
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,250
Geez, what’s wrong with a little facial
recognition to stop crime before it happens?

102
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,030
Anyway, in the great American tradition of
former politicians becoming lobbyists, Baraba

103
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,470
Boxer joined this lobbying firm.

104
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,620
And to represent their client Hikvision, she
had to register as a foreign agent.

105
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,800
When that was exposed in the press this week,
it raised a lot of eyebrows.

106
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,700
And then Joe Biden’s inaugural committee
returned the $500 donation Boxer had made

107
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,280
to his campaign.

108
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,500
For Joe Biden, it’s just not worth being
caught up in a scandal involving a Chinese

109
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,169
state-controlled company.\h

110
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,710
At least not for just $500.

111
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,889
And speaking of the persecution of Uyghurs,
the UK has taken steps to remove Ugyhur forced

112
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,330
labor from British supply chains, accusing
China of torture and barbarism.

113
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,110
And so has the US.

114
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,470
The Trump administration has now banned the
import of all cotton and tomatoes from Xinjiang.

115
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,800
America’s pro-Beijing tomato lobby is outraged.

116
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,150
“Independent researchers and media reports
have linked dozens of the world’s most prominent

117
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:31,110
multinational companies to workers or products
from Xinjiang, including Apple, Nike, Kraft,

118
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,550
Heinz, and Campbell Soup.”

119
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,769
And don’t try claiming that your Xinjiang
tomatoes are actually Beijing tomatoes.

120
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,479
This ban includes products that have been
shipped to another region or country to disguise

121
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,459
the fact that they’ve actually come from
Xinjiang.\h

122
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,180
But how will the US government know where
the products are originally from?

123
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,579
Pollen analysis.\h

124
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:58,730
And more good news, human rights lawyer David
Mattis has won the Global Humanitarian Leader

125
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,269
of the Year Award for his work exposing organ
harvesting of prisoners of conscience in China.

126
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,740
I mean, who else was going to do it?

127
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,949
Obviously not the New York Times.

128
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:14,459
Mattis’s award comes from the human rights
group Canadians in Support of Refugees in

129
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,350
Dire Need.

130
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,970
And no, they aren’t talking about Americans
seeking refuge in Canada.

131
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,449
And if you thought it was bad last year when
China locked down 11 million people in Wuhan

132
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,569
because of the coronavirus—now it’s twice
as bad.

133
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:37,119
More on that after the break.

134
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,430
Welcome back.

135
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,050
The coronavirus is getting worse in China.

136
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,990
22 million people have been put on lockdown.\h

137
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,000
“More than 22 million people in all have
been ordered to remain inside their homes—double

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,059
the number affected last January when China’s
central government locked down Wuhan.”

139
00:09:55,059 --> 00:10:00,999
Huh, that’s the opposite of the message
last week in the New York Times, about how

140
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:06,220
China handled the coronavirus so well that
people there have more freedom than people

141
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,369
in the West.\h

142
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:12,310
Yes, Chinese people have the freedom to move
around and lead a normal day-to-day life.

143
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,259
Unless they try to move around and lead a
normal day-to-day life.

144
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:21,430
Of course the entire world is suffering from
the coronavirus, or as I call it, the CCP

145
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,980
virus, since it spread because of a Communist
Party coverup.\h

146
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,309
But people aren’t just suffering from the
CCP virus itself.

147
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,860
They’re also suffering from CCP Virus tests
and vaccines.

148
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,480
The Chinese vaccine Coronavac is being tested
in Brazil, but its efficacy rate is only just

149
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,929
above 50%.

150
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:46,170
That’s far lower than the Chinese company
initially claimed.

151
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,180
Compare that to the two main vaccines made
by US companies.

152
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,399
Those have an efficacy rate of 95%.

153
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,529
Meanwhile, two US Federal agencies have learned
nothing from the past year.

154
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:05,630
Because they’ve been pushing Chinese Covid-19
tests—despite warnings that it’s a security

155
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,630
risk.

156
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,759
How could a coronavirus test be a security
risk?

157
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:16,459
Well, it was created by BGI, China’s leading
genetics company.

158
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:22,879
And there are concerns that the tests could
give Americans’ DNA data to a Chinese company.

159
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:31,009
Some of the genetic data from BGIs gene sequencing
machines gets stored on Huawei equipment.

160
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:32,259
Yeah.

161
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:38,120
And get this—“The U.S. Commerce Department
sanctioned two of BGI’s subsidiaries earlier

162
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,499
this year, saying they provided technology
to collect and catalog the DNA profiles of

163
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,829
China’s persecuted Uighur population.”

164
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:51,509
So kind of a problem, huh?

165
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:58,029
Well, nevertheless, BGI “enlisted a foundation
tied to a former U.S. president—George H.W.

166
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:05,600
Bush—and used a company linked to the United
Arab Emirates’ top spy to promote its efforts.

167
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,200
A prominent New York real-estate lawyer threatened
to complain to California’s governor if

168
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,790
state health officials there didn’t use
BGI’s tests.”

169
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,160
Am I only the person who isn’t corrupt?!\h

170
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,040
Clearly, I need to sell out.

171
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,060
Last week, I told you about how the Chinese
Communist Party is continuing to block a World

172
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,199
Health Organization investigation into the
origin of the coronavirus in Wuhan.

173
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:36,579
And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
is criticizing that.

174
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,269
Here he is on Canada’s City News.

175
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:44,930
“There’s certainly going to be a time
for necessary accountability and understanding

176
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:53,220
exactly how the world ended up plunged into
this terrible, terrible situation and the

177
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,649
role China had to play in this as the origin
of the virus is going to need to be known.

178
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:04,939
For China to not cooperate and not participate
in that is unfortunately very predictable,

179
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:10,860
given the recent stances by the Chinese government
on collaborating with international authorities,

180
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,629
but [it’s] not going to be able to protect
them from making sure that the truth does

181
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:19,629
come out.”

182
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:20,629
Wow.

183
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:24,190
Now hearing that from Trudeau, was very shocking
for me.

184
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,550
Until I realized the truth: This Trudeau is
not the same as this Trudeau.

185
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,920
The one with the beard is from a mirror universe!

186
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,749
Simple Star Trek logic!

187
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:44,180
Wait a minute, does this mean we’re in the
evil universe?

188
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,519
Oh yeah, that actually makes total sense.

189
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,269
Which brings me to Uncle Roger, aka comedian
Nigel Ng.

190
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,509
You might know him as the fried rice guy.

191
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:01,869
Anyway, he has apologized and deleted a video
featuring a YouTube star who in the past has

192
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:04,889
criticized the Chinese Communist Party.

193
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,680
Apparently Uncle Roger’s video got flagged
in China—or possibly he got pressure from

194
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,639
Chinese sponsors or business partners.

195
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,829
So he took it offline and made an NBA-style
apology, saying “I wasn’t aware of his

196
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,699
political thoughts and his past incorrect
remarks about China.

197
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:25,480
This is my negligence.”

198
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,149
That YouTuber with dangerous thinking is Mike
Chen from Strictly Dumpling.

199
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,560
What were Chen’s past incorrect remarks
about China?

200
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,679
Well, he’s made a few.

201
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,879
For instance, this post from June on Instagram
of Tank Man says “Today, on the 31st anniversary

202
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,910
of Chinese troops opening fire on protesters
in and around Tiananmen Square.

203
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:58,160
The people of HK are facing a similar standoff
over freedom, democracy and basic human rights.”

204
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,509
What an incorrect remark about China!\h

205
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:08,379
Now at no point in the joint video with Uncle
Roger did Chen talk about any of these political

206
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:09,529
topics.

207
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:15,949
The problem is that in the past, in totally
unrelated posts, Chen had expressed concern

208
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,600
over Chinese Communist Party’s human rights
abuses.

209
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,639
And this just goes to show how deep the CCP’s
censorship reaches overseas.

210
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,970
Uncle Roger doesn’t live in China.

211
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,089
He’s not political.

212
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,759
He didn’t ask Mike Chen any political questions.

213
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,309
But simply because Chen is a person who has
political views that support freedom for the

214
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,440
Chinese people, Uncle Roger felt pressure
to self-censor.

215
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,920
Now, Uncle Roger is hardly alone.

216
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,280
This is something that multinational corporations
do all the time, like we’ve constantly been

217
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,239
talking about on this show.

218
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:56,899
But it feels more personal when it’s someone
you liked doing it.

219
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:03,160
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow
even dressed up as Uncle Roger for Halloween

220
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,869
last year—where she did a video review of
Hong Kong police.

221
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:12,579
So this latest self-censorship from Uncle
Roger has got to hurt.

222
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:17,559
On the bright side, Agnes Chow probably doesn’t
know about what Uncle Roger did... because

223
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,540
Hong Kong police put her in prison.

224
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,809
That’s not a joke.

225
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:31,639
Anyway, I for one can’t wait for Uncle Rogers’
next video on how to eat boot fried rice.

226
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,740
If you add enough MSG, you can barely even
taste the boot you’re licking.

227
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,949
And speaking of censorship, YouTube has been
demonetizing a lot of China Uncensored videos.

228
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:47,300
I know this is technically not censorship—but
it has a similar effect: It discourages us

229
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,170
from making content that criticizes the Chinese
Communist Party.

230
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,119
But we refuse to self-censor.

231
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:59,429
And we can afford to only because of direct
support from viewers like you—members of

232
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,769
the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army who support
us through Patreon.

233
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,549
And as a thank you to them, I answer their
questions on the show.

234
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:09,750
Today’s question comes from...

235
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:15,059
Drew McTygue: “Will the CCP attempt to seize
control of the moon?”

236
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:18,010
Oh Drew, you’re thinking too small.

237
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,870
I mean, yeah, the CCP is talking about building
a moon base.

238
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,880
And just to be clear, China’s space program
is run by the military.

239
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,000
But who cares about the Moon?

240
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,970
The CCP has much bigger space plans.

241
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,750
Like a space station.

242
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,580
Since NASA isn’t allowed to work with China.

243
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,660
But China’s real prize is Mars.

244
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,350
After all, Mars is the red planet.

245
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,460
Thanks for your question Drew.

246
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,490
And thank you for watching.
