1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,560
China’s winning the race

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
For a coronavirus vaccine

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,200
But they’re taking some pretty big risks

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,920
Could it all backfire?

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,320
Welcome back to China\h
Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,240
Last week, China announced that it would join\h\h

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,200
the World Health Organization’s\h
coronavirus\hvaccine initiative.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,360
The Covax global initiative is meant to\h
provide Covid-19 vaccines to poor countries.\h

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,520
“China’s government will buy 15\h
million doses of a future vaccine\h\h

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,640
from Covax” for its own citizens, which\h
will help finance the overall project.\h

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
Joining Covax gave China\h
a bunch of good publicity,\h\h

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
especially because the United\h
States is not joining it.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,240
“The White House said last month\h
that it would not join Covax\h\h

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,760
because it did not want to be\h
‘constrained by multilateral\h\h

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
organizations influenced by the corrupt\h
World Health Organization and China.’”

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,920
Wow, White House. Tell us how you really feel.\h

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,760
The Chinese Communist Party\h
covered up the coronavirus,\h\h

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,560
which allowed it to spread around the\h
world. Which is why I call it the CCP Virus.

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,600
But since that’s happened, the Chinese regime has\h
been trying to turn all of that negative publicity\h\h

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,080
around, with a propaganda campaign on how China\h
is leading the battle against the pandemic.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
And a big part of that effort is\h
China’s goal of being the first country\h\h

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,560
to approve and widely distribute\h
a vaccine for the coronavirus.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
China already produces 700 million\h
vaccine doses a year—vaccines\h\h

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
against other diseases. Mostly these\h
are for China’s domestic market.\h

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,320
But if China can produce the first\h
successful coronavirus vaccine,\h\h

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
that would help Chinese pharmaceutical\h
companies open up the global market.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,440
It would give China prestige and\h
credibility in scientific research.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,160
And the Chinese Communist Party would\h
have a great way to repair its reputation

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
—maybe even make people forget\h
that the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
caused the global pandemic in the first place.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
So the Party is willing to take\h
some big risks to make that happen.\h

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,240
The problem is, China doesn’t have\h
the greatest vaccine safety record.

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,760
There have been a series of vaccines\h
scandals in China over the last few years.\h\h

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,880
Including one from 2018 involving more\h
than 900,000 faulty children’s vaccines.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
Although those vaccines were\h
mostly just ineffective,\h\h

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
some children developed disabilities\h
after taking the faulty vaccines.\h

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,600
That scandal prompted Chinese officials to\h
pass a much stricter vaccine law in 2019.\h\h

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,040
“The country tightened supervision over the\h
vaccine development and distribution process,\h\h

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
and increased penalties for fabricating data.”

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,160
But one of the companies that made some\h
of those faulty children’s vaccines

41
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,240
—Wuhan Institute of Biological Products—

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,120
is now helping to develop one\h
of the coronavirus vaccines.\h

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,640
But some say that there are unlikely to be these\h
kinds of safety issues with the CCP Virus vaccine,\h\h

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,160
since the Chinese authorities are\h
watching this issue so closely.\h

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
And that’s true.

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,200
But in their race to get the first vaccine,\h\h

47
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,720
Chinese companies are also cutting\h
corners, and some experts are worried.

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
I’ll tell you why, after the break.

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Welcome back.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,480
Chinese companies are racing to\h
develop a coronavirus vaccine.\h\h

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,360
But in the process, they’re also cutting corners.

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,880
For example, China’s coronavirus\h
vaccines are still in phase 3 trials.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,760
Those trials evaluate the safety and\h
effectiveness of the vaccines in humans.

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,160
But despite the fact that\h
these trials aren’t finished,

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,960
several companies have started injecting\h
people with their vaccines anyway.

56
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,440
I mean, what could go wrong?\h

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,880
State-run Sinopharm has inoculated 350,000 people\h
while their two vaccines are still in trials.\h

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,080
That was through an emergency-use program\h
“originally restricted to frontline health workers\h\h

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,760
and state employees traveling\h
overseas to high-risk areas.”

60
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,280
But it seems authorities are looking to expand the\h
number of people receiving the trial vaccines.\h

61
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
“Health authorities in one Chinese province have\h
asked enterprises and government departments\h\h

62
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,720
to gather details of employees willing to\h
receive emergency use vaccines ahead of winter.”

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,760
According to bioethics professor Arthur Caplan,\h\h

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,520
“China appeared to be acting irresponsibly by\h
stretching the definition of emergency use.”

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,720
He called China’s approach closer to “throwing\h
something up against the wall to see what sticks.”

66
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,040
Look, if throwing it against the wall\h
works for spaghetti and post-it notes,

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,320
why wouldn’t it work for something\h
that you inject into your body,

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
that could be a matter of life or death?

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
But if you think injecting hundreds\h
of thousands of people with a vaccine\h\h

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,560
before clinical trials are finished is dangerous,

71
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
that’s just the tip of the needle.

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,440
Because they also injected people with\h
vaccines before clinical trials even started.\h

73
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,800
That’s right, Sinopharm’s\h
“employees, including top executives,\h\h

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,640
received experimental shots even before\h
the government approved testing in people.”

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,800
The company even boasted about it!

76
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,160
They said that “For more than a hundred years,\h\h

77
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,640
it is a tradition for...employees\h
to test the medicines on themselves.

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,840
Furthermore, it is a spirit of sacrifice that\h
passed down generation after generation.”

79
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,680
And the tradition has been carried on by all\h
the generations that survived the testing.

80
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,240
You know, maybe this is just one\h
of those cultural differences.

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,480
Sure, here in the West we\h
have our so-called “ethics”\h\h

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,480
and our so-called “double-blind,\h
placebo-controlled clinical trials.”

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
And so injecting your employees with an\h
untested vaccine sounds...crazypants.\h\h

84
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,000
But in China, it is a noble\h
tradition and spirit of sacrifice.\h

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,000
And Sinopharm isn’t the only company doing it.\h

86
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,920
“Another company, Sinovac, has injected\h
90% of its employees and family members.”

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,840
So here’s my question. If your\h
boss asks you whether you want\h\h

88
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,920
to get injected with your company’s\h
vaccine, can you really say no?

89
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,840
Even if you don’t want to do it? Maybe I just\h
don’t understand the spirit of sacrifice.

90
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,040
But don’t worry. Because China’s\h
National Health Commission official\h\h

91
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,440
Zheng Zhongwei says that the COVID-19\h
vaccines put into emergency use are safe.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,840
They just don’t know if they are effective.\h

93
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
And that might be the larger issue here.

94
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
Being the first to get a working coronavirus\h
vaccine could make China a scientific superpower.

95
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
So the Chinese Communist\h
Party is highly incentivized\h\h

96
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
to approve a vaccine as quickly as possible.

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,160
Even if it’s not the most effective.
 In 2006, the Communist Party set a\h\h

98
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,680
goal for China to become a science\h
and technology superpower by 2020.

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
But there have been some bumps along the road.\h

100
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,120
For example, there’s been\h
a lot of scientific fraud.

101
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,520
Back in 2016, “China’s food and drug\h
regulator...carried out a one-year review\h\h

102
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,920
of clinical trials, concluding that more than\h
80 percent of clinical data is ‘fabricated.’”

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,920
“Some companies were suspected of deliberately\h
hiding or deleting records of adverse effects,\h\h

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,120
and tampering with data that\h
did not meet expectations.”

105
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,600
So Chinese pharmaceutical\h
companies were manipulating\h\h

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,840
their data to make their drugs look better.

107
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,200
And that was happening EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE TIME!

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,840
But it’s not just individual\h
companies who are to blame.

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,440
The Chinese Communist Party\h
has completely politicized\h\h

110
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,480
scientific research, which is a huge problem.

111
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Here’s an example: Chinese authorities have been\h
pushing the use of traditional Chinese medicine,\h\h

112
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,160
or TCM, to treat COVID-19.

113
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,400
“A senior official from the government’s TCM\h
administration said more than 90% of all sufferers\h\h

114
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,120
of covid-19 had received traditional therapies,\h
and these had been ‘effective’ 90% of the time.”

115
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,960
Is that true? Well, “She offered\h
no data to support this claim.”

116
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
Not that it would matter, since\h
so much data is apparently fake.

117
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Of course, that hasn’t stopped Chinese\h
state-run media from constantly\h\h

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,080
talking about how TCM plays a\h
big role in the virus fight.

119
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,360
But that’s not because TCM is better at\h
treating the CCP Virus than Western medicine.

120
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
It’s because promoting TCM is part of the\h
Communist Party’s overall political goals.

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,400
It’s a traditional Chinese science that the Party\h\h

122
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,320
can claim ownership of, and use\h
to compete with Western medicine.\h

123
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has\h
himself promoted TCM to the world.

124
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
So why is this a problem for scientific research?

125
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,480
Well, it turns out that published Chinese\h
studies always say that TCM works.\h

126
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,920
This study looked at almost\h
850 randomized clinical trials\h\h

127
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,640
on acupuncture published in Chinese journals.

128
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
99.8% of the trials reported positive results.

129
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
That’s almost impossible.

130
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,520
Now I’m not saying that TCM doesn’t work.

131
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,800
But I am saying that\hbecause the Chinese Communist\h
Party wants TCM to work for political reasons,

132
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,720
they’ve set up a system where no one is\h
allowed to say that TCM doesn’t work.

133
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
That’s not a good system for developing\h
a new vaccine for a new disease.\h

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,160
I mean, are you going to criticize\h
Xi Jinping’s coronavirus response?\h

135
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,680
I didn’t think so. Not after a tycoon who\h
denounced Xi Jinping’s coronavirus response\h\h

136
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,320
was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

137
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
So Chinese companies are cutting corners to\h
get their coronavirus vaccines out faster.

138
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,720
And the Chinese Communist\h
Party has politicized science\h\h

139
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:39,200
and incentivized researchers to say that these\h
vaccines work—whether or not they really do work.

140
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,280
Why is this happening? I’ll tell you\h
after this short commercial break.

141
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,680
Welcome back. Why is the Chinese Communist Party\h
pushing so hard to get a coronavirus vaccine?

142
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,200
If it were about protecting\h
the health of Chinese citizens,

143
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,680
you’d think they wouldn’t put their\h
citizens’ health at risk by doing things like

144
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,520
giving the vaccine to huge numbers\h
of people before it’s ready.

145
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,080
But of course it’s not really\h
about health and\h safety.

146
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,600
It’s about China wanting to use\h
access to the vaccines for diplomacy.

147
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
The Chinese Communist Party has “begun\h
promising early access to countries\h\h

148
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,880
of strategic interest as it seeks\h
to shore up its global standing.”

149
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,520
Now this might sound kind of familiar,

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,120
since it’s pretty much the same\h
thing the Communist Party did\h\h

151
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
earlier this year with their face mask diplomacy.

152
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,400
They sent medical supplies to hard-hit\h
countries to boost China’s image.\h

153
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,040
But that kind of backfired when Beijing demanded\h
praise in exchange for those medical supplies.\h

154
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,720
And when it turned out that China had\h
sent out faulty masks and flawed tests.

155
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
But surely that won’t happen\h
with the coronavirus vaccine!

156
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
Speaking of quality control, China\h
is using their phase 3 drug trials\h\h

157
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
to their diplomatic advantage, too.

158
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,040
These are some of the countries that are\h
running phase 3 trials of China’s vaccines.

159
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,920
Many of them are in regions where the Chinese\h
regime is trying to grow its influence,\h\h

160
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
like South America and the Middle East.\h

161
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,320
It’s notable that China has not reported any\h
major safety issues with their vaccine trials.\h\h

162
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Especially because two major\h
Western pharmaceutical companies,\h\h

163
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Astrazeneca and Johnson &\h
Johnson, have both had to pause\h\h

164
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,160
their phase 3 vaccine trials because\h
of an unexplained illness in a patient.

165
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,960
That is a definite advantage\h
for Chinese companies.\h

166
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,720
In fact, SinoVac has said its vaccine\h
will be ready to go by early 2021.\h

167
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,440
And Sinopharm’s vaccine could\h
be ready by the end of 2020.

168
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,840
So it looks like China will likely win\h
the race for a coronavirus vaccine.

169
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,000
The downside is, the Communist Party is taking\h
some pretty big risks to make it happen.

170
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,320
And it could potentially backfire.

171
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,840
And with that, I think I’ll now\h
answer a question from one of you,

172
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,680
a fan who supports China Uncensored\h
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

173
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:18,080
William E Williams asks, “OK - If you became\h
presitator of America - What Winnie-the-Pooh\h\h\h

174
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,600
character would you be?”
￼\h

175
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,880
Okay, William, first of all, I have no\h
interest in being the presitator of the US.

176
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,000
I’m running for Supreme Leader of the United\h
States for life. Totally different thing.

177
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
But I’ll forgive. For now. At least until\h
I become your power-mad Supreme Leader.

178
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
But that is a good question.

179
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,440
People have compared Xi Jinping and\h
Obama to Winnie the Pooh and Tigger.\h

180
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,040
And former Japanese Prime\h
Minister Shinzo Abe to Eeyore.\h

181
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,400
Even Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam\h
has her 100 acre wood counterpart—piglet.

182
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,320
So who would I be?

183
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,000
First of all, I want to say how upset I am by my\h
decision to Google Winnie the Pooh characters,

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,840
because I saw about a dozen not-safe-for-work\h
versions of Kanga that I cannot unsee.\h

185
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,480
So which character would I be?

186
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
I’ll go with...a Jagular.

187
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,200
People walk through the forest,\h
forgetting it’s even there.

188
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,400
But then when they look up, boom,\h
the Jagular gets the drop on them!

189
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,400
Thanks for your question William.
