Hong Kong: The Frontline Battle Against China

2
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:03,274
Baggio Leung,

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,660
a protester in the 2014 Umbrella Movement

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,740
He was elected to office...

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,790
but disqualified and thrown in jail

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,520
for challenging the system

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,140
Now he shares whatâ€™s changed in this battle
for Hong Kong

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,980
Welcome to China Uncensored.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,900
I'm Chris Chappell.

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,579
Joining me today is Baggio Leung,

11
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,669
a Hong Kong politician and activist.

12
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:26,119
Thanks for joining me today.

13
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,970
Thank you for interviewing me.

14
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,970
Sure.

15
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,519
So what was your reaction

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,440
when 2 million Hongkongers took to the streets

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
to protest the extradition bill?

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,940
It is a quite touching moment to me.

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,810
When you get into the transportation, metro,
Admiralty,

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,370
you feel like all people,

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,800
90% of them,

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,220
is wearing black clothes.

23
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,220
The other 10%,

24
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,660
maybe they are medias,

25
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,370
wearing a media shirt.

26
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,820
Yeah, that was me.

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,190
And this like...

28
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,650
all people is standing as one.

29
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,820
So it's quite touching.

30
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,920
Now after the Umbrella Movement,

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,140
were you concerned that Hong Kong had lost
its will?

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,299
After the Umbrella Movement we failed to...

33
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:20,080
we failed, actually, in the movement.

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,549
We failed to have universal suffrage,

35
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,960
which is our main focus of the movement.

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,780
And then different peoples tried to come out,

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,789
tried to form parties like me,

38
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:40,069
tried to have different action to make Hong
Kong better.

39
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:43,530
However, most of us failed again.

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,939
And in year 2019, luckily,

41
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,749
we did have some progress this time.

42
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:56,009
Of course, I would not claim this is a victory,

43
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,159
but we have some progress on the bill, extradition
bill.

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,069
I know you were a democratically elected legislator.

45
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,020
But then you were disqualified

46
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,700
because you changed the oath,

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,690
and then they threw you into jail.

48
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,690
Did you ever imagine that would happen in
Hong Kong?

49
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:21,580
We can never imagine before in Hong Kong,
I think.

50
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,450
In the past few years actually we have

51
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,600
a lot of strange incidents that we cannot
imagine.

52
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
We cannot imagine the police forces

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,790
will shoot at their own people and the press.

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,300
We cannot imagine they can disqualify

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,220
before the election and after the election.

56
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,590
We cannot imagine that the government

57
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,260
can have no response to what people want at
all.

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,230
They were just...

59
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,570
even though Carrie Lam, she apologized last
night.

60
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,640
However, still some of...

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,710
she didn't promise anything that we want,

62
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,330
including no prosecution to the protesters,

63
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:21,960
including no extradition bill amendments later
on.

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:31,370
And so I don't think if I look back,

65
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,980
when this is 10 years ago,

66
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,900
I can't imagine Hong Kong will change

67
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,160
to this position or situation.

68
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,220
Do you think your disqualification

69
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,030
discouraged other young people

70
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,380
from trying to make changes within this system?

71
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,990
Indeed it is.

72
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,770
If you want to join,

73
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,560
take part in the election, firstly,

74
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,580
they will have offices, government offices,

75
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,300
to try to disqualify you with some reason

76
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:12,180
like you are not sincerely agree the Basic
Law.

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,069
And after this,

78
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,600
even though when you get into the parliament,

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
the LegCo,

80
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,160
they can still use different kind of reason

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,500
to try to put some charges on you or disqualify
you,

82
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:33,100
like unlawful assembly in the LegCo building

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
when you are working, okay?

84
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,900
So actually government

85
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,560
is putting a strong message on the young,

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,860
especially to the youngsters,

87
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,000
is that we cannot change much within the system.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,070
Would you do anything differently?

89
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,510
When I look back,

90
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,850
I would still do the same thing.

91
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,740
Because what I add to the oath

92
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,340
is that I bring a flag "Hong Kong is not China."

93
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,150
Now in year 2019 still

94
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,620
we are seeing Hong Kong is not China.

95
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,880
So we say no to the extradition bill.

96
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,300
And I changed the oath to say

97
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,670
I want to guard Hong Kong nation interest.

98
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,630
I was elected by the people,

99
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,870
but not by Basic Law,

100
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,150
not by Hong Kong SAR and not by CCP.

101
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:29,080
But I need to take a oath

102
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,919
that is nothing related to the people.

103
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,130
So I add this.

104
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,090
And still I think who I should,

105
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,090
what I should do,

106
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,910
who actually guard this Hong Kong people's
interest.

107
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,840
What have you been doing

108
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,800
since you were disqualified

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,110
and thrown into jail?

110
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,300
In Hong Kong we are at the frontline

111
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,639
that between some values of freedom,

112
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,870
democracy and the dictatorship.

113
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,410
China, CCP,

114
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,810
is the greatest dictatorship in the history.

115
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,760
And we are just in the frontline, Hong Kong.

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:20,360
And everyone who brings out the same ideology...

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,990
actually facing such a threat from them.

118
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm not the only one.

119
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,450
Many people, maybe some protesters at the
frontline,

120
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,850
they support even much than me.

121
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,070
I'm not the only one.

122
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,680
So I will do what I can to try to make Hong
Kong better,

123
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,090
a better place.

124
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,410
How do you think these protests for the extradition
bill

125
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,450
are different from the Umbrella Movement?

126
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,860
I think one main different I can observe

127
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,300
is that we have no icon figures

128
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,180
or so-called leaders in the extradition bill
movement.

129
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,919
In the Umbrella Revolution,

130
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:10,110
we have Joshua Wong,

131
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,110
we have Benny Tai,

132
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,780
we have a lot of figures that can represent
the people.

133
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,280
However, after the movement,

134
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,070
all of them are being put into jail, okay?

135
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,540
And people learned from this history.

136
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,450
Okay, if we have a leader and then the leader,

137
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,790
so that for this time,

138
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,669
let's make this no leader.

139
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,510
And somehow it works.

140
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,979
We form small circles,

141
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,830
we join small circles by ourselves,

142
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,360
and decide what to do,

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,639
when to do,

144
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,850
on internet and through different Telegram
channel,

145
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,300
Telegram groups.

146
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,890
And somehow this new model somehow improves.

147
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,150
And the government since...

148
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,419
they just cannot response to this.

149
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,180
Speaking of that,

150
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
what do you think Carrie Lam

151
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,450
should do over the extradition bill?

152
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,780
At least she should promise two things.

153
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,840
Firstly, to make a promise that there will
have

154
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,240
no prosecution on the protestors.

155
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,820
And the second thing is that she should promise

156
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,820
not to put the bill on to the LegCo forever.

157
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,210
I think Hongkongers and people around the
world

158
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,740
shows what we are,

159
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,380
show our wills already.

160
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,860
We don't need this bill.

161
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,310
And we have different solution

162
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,230
to solve so-called the problem,

163
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,770
the crux of the system.

164
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,010
And please, just consider those option, those
solution,

165
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,560
but not to amend the extradition bill

166
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,300
and put people in the dangers.

167
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,110
If she doesn't do that,

168
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,420
what do you think the Hong Kong people will
do?

169
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,180
If she doesn't promise this,

170
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,561
I think Hong Kong people

171
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:18,950
will have some extra action on this

172
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,190
and keep putting pressure on the government

173
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,810
and try to make her change her mind.

174
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,810
We don't want to put this into a really threatening
way,

175
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,880
but if she keep sitting here,

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,450
making no change,

177
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,630
I don't think this is acceptable to the people.

178
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,240
Do you think any kind of reform

179
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,980
is possible in Hong Kong

180
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,730
as long as the Chinese Communist Party

181
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,000
rules mainland China?

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,670
Unfortunately, I don't think we can change
a lot.

183
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,440
We cannot change a lot about power structure.

184
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,300
We cannot change the system.

185
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,500
We cannot have universal suffrage.

186
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,170
Because from the history we can know that

187
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:15,670
CCP won't let or won't release the power on
his hand.

188
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,810
This is the core idea

189
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,250
and the core interest they care about.

190
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,610
So universal suffrage,

191
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,100
rule of law, separation of power, etc.,

192
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:34,020
such idea that will constrain,

193
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,230
make constraint or limit their power,

194
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,080
they will try to break off this.

195
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,140
But this is what we treasure.

196
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,370
And so I think try to make

197
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,820
some separation between Hong Kong and China

198
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,040
is the best solution to solve the problem

199
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,920
right now in Hong Kong.

200
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,180
And what message would you like people around
the world

201
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,740
to get about Hong Kong?

202
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,510
How can they show support?

203
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:10,990
China, CCP indeed, they are kind of imperialism.

204
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,360
They try, keep expanding their influence among
the world.

205
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,339
They are a huge dictatorship to the world

206
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,279
and threatening the freedom, democracy,

207
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,360
such idea among the world.

208
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,920
Hong Kong, we just unfortunately stay

209
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,910
in the frontline between this core values

210
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,000
and a great dictatorship,

211
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,209
so please support this frontline.

212
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:46,960
We will fight till the end.

213
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,020
But please support us.

214
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,810
Please stand with us.

215
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,890
That was wonderful speaking to you.

216
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,050
Thank you so much for joining me today.

217
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,050
Thank you so much.

218
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,280
And good luck out there.
