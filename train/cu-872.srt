Hi, welcome to China Uncensored

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,784
I'm your host Chris Chappell

3
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:05,619
Before starting "China Uncensored"

4
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:09,334
I worked as a script writer for a show called "Journey to the East".

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,770
A TV documentary series about traditional Asian culture

6
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,232
and the people carrying it on today.

7
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:19,202
Unfortunately, the show was scrapped before making it on air.

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,825
Not long ago I posted one of the never-aired episodes

9
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:25,681
"The Truth Behind Traditional Chinese Kungfu"

10
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:28,189
The response to that was so incredible

11
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,162
that I decided to post more.

12
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,343
This one is about traditional Japanese carpentry.

13
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:38,568
Without the use of any nails, thay can build temples that last for hundreds of years.

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,585
It's a fastinating look at the not-quite-lost art.

15
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:44,419
I hope you enjoy.

16
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:07,593
Traditional Japanese carpenters built furnitures, houses and temples

17
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:12,900
without the aid of screws, nails or bolts.

18
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:20,224
No bolts, no nails. It lasts longer.

19
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,847
In Japan there are temple towers, after 1,000 years

20
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:26,494
they are still standing.

21
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:34,899
We have two things in our human history:

22
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:39,102
against the nature; with nature.

23
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,447
You have to choose either one.

24
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:54,729
So, we do the more natural side, the real craftsmanship side.

25
00:01:55,655 --> 00:02:00,627
The finished pieces reflect the ancient philosophy of Japanese carpentery

26
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:03,576
that is still alive today.

27
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,601
Journey to the East

28
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,171
JAPANESE CARPENTRY

29
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,956
[Zui Hanafusa] My father actually grew up doing woodcut prints.

30
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:04,018
This is something that they did in an old country.

31
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,660
They always learn a trade. So some people were farmers. Some people were electricians.

32
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:14,025
But he chose wood working.

33
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:20,109
[Mr. Hisao Hanafusa] When I graduated, I had to start setting up my life

34
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:24,916
where to stay, where to work.

35
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:30,233
So I said: "Oh, this is very easy. I want to get homesick

36
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:34,343
I want to know home more

37
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,380
If you stay where you are, you don't know too much, because you have blind spots.

38
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,236
When you're far away you can see.

39
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:48,600
So, I decided to leave Japan, to go somewhere else.

40
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,893
Hisao Hanafusa has been working with Japanese carpentery for over 50 years.

41
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:59,815
With his son, he now runs Miya Shoji,

42
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:04,088
a traditional Japanese carpentery workshop in New York.

43
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,521
[Laura Fisher] One day I was walking on 17th Street

44
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:15,349
and I saw the beautiful tables inside. And I went in to look.

45
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:23,500
I met Mr. Hanafusa and I said "One day, I'm going to own one of your tables"

46
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:27,215
and of course being a quick sales man he said "Why not now?"

47
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:36,433
And when I met Ken, my husband, and we decided we would start another life together,

48
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:41,820
we both wanted to change the way we were living.

49
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:47,579
I wanted to simplify, you know. I just wanted to simplify my life.

50
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:58,492
All the pieces in Hanafusa's showroom have been handcrafted using traditional japanese techniques.

51
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:06,944
The pieces of lumber have also been individually selected by Hanafusa and his son.

52
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,523
Every morning, Hanafusa's team of carpenters begins by sharpening the blades of their hand-forged planes and chisels

53
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:26,449


54
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:36,178
Caring for these hand-tools, takes almost as much time as using them.

55
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:41,286
But in the right hand, the Japanese hand plane

56
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:44,909
produces a smoother cut then a machine plane.

57
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:54,104
As the blade passes through these Shoji screen beams, it clearly slices off thin ribbons of wood.

58
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:09,824
The process of using and caring for these traditional tools reflects Hanafusa's philosophy

59
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:14,166
of working with nature, not against nature.

60
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,647
[Mr. Hisao Hanafusa] We have two things in our human history:

61
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:22,455
against the nature; with nature.

62
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:25,311
You have to choose either one.

63
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,186
When I was a kid I studied Industrial Revolution.

64
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:38,175
Fantastic stuff, but it killed all the craftsmen.

65
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:42,634
All the personal, individual talent they killed.

66
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:52,363
So, we do more the natural side, the real craftsmanship side.

67
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:55,776
We're still doing it that way.

68
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:59,979
Some people say it's stupid.

69
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,030
[Ken Woodlock] I knew of Mr. Hanafusa. So I would go by the place with my children.

70
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:16,953
We'd look in the windows and there were plenty of screens, and the furniture was all there.

71
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:23,036
So we started talking about how we're gonna decorate this apartment after we bought it.

72
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,310
He became a given.

73
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:33,578
All we did initially was go to Master Hanafusa's workshop and we chose the piece of lumber we wanted for the table.

74
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:45,513
[Zui Hanafusa] The wood carpentery in the past, the wood within the area would actually dictate what the actual carpenter can make.

75
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:51,597
We actually practice the same thing here.

76
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:55,637
Where wood in the area we collect,

77
00:07:56,398 --> 00:08:00,536
would dictate what the actual clients can have.

78
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:14,143
[Joe Kleinberg] Well we're taking down an alm tree and giving it a second life.

79
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:21,133
We're gonna slab these branches and the big trunk and some day it'll become furniture.

80
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,006
It's with a disease known as Dutch-Elm disease, which devastates Elm trees.

81
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,594
It survived the first batch of dutch elm which came here over 30 years ago.

82
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:47,000
Unfortunately, we've been hit with dutch elm disease once again and the tree didn't survive.

83
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:58,006
This tree is approximately 300 years old. It's a shame to see it go.

84
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:43,401
This is real specialty work. it takes a lot of wherewithal

85
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:51,180
to tackle a tree like this, not to mention the equipment to be able to manufacture it into slabs of wood.

86
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,119
Although you know, this tree is dead, it's always living.

87
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,574
In the spring and summer, it breaths, it picks up moisture and in the winter it loses moisture

88
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:11,218
so just think of it as something that's always living.

89
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:35,088
"Here's your table". take it to museum, right?

90
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:46,580
Everywhere, beautiful.

91
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,951
After the tree has being milled into slabs,

92
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:51,900
it has to go through a drying process for many years

93
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:56,195
before it is ready to be made into furniture.

94
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:07,178
A fresh tree's water content is like a 100%, right?

95
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:16,374
"ready to use it", means that you have to remove the water content.

96
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,319
That's why 10, 15, 20 years, you air-dry it.

97
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:26,265
You watch it; ready to use it or not?

98
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,241
By the time the wood first hits the cutting bench

99
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:45,793
it is already nearing the end of its journey.

100
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:57,101
At this stage, the carpenter begins to craft the joints

101
00:11:58,013 --> 00:12:00,329
that will hold the finished piece together

102
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:06,947
like a three dimensional puzzle. without the need for screws, nails or bolts.

103
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,693
The joints must fit together perfectly

104
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:28,193
which is all the more difficult to achieve when using hand saws and chisels

105
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,139
instead of precise electric tools.

106
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:39,896
These butterfly joints will prevent the crack in this tabletop from spreading.

107
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,696
This rectangular dinning table is an extremely simple and elegant design.

108
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:13,007
The base consist of two wide legs attached to a long trestle by two mortise and tenon joints

109
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,594
...And the legs hold the top in place with four dowels.
Although it's extremely heavy,

110
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:30,631
the table is held together with only 4 pieces of lumber and 6 joints.

111
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:37,528
New construction is usually with nails, bolts, screws.

112
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:41,429
But we still actually use joinery which will be wood-in-wood expanding and contracting with each other.

113
00:13:41,914 --> 00:13:48,743
so this is actually something that'd last forever.

114
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:55,012
No bolts, no nails. It lasts longer.

115
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,868
Also strong for earthquake, hurricane.

116
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:03,162
Even in Japan there are temple towers, after 1,000 years

117
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:06,413
they are still standing.

118
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:10,245
The techniques for building Buddist temples

119
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:16,119
originally came from China's Tang dynasty era in the 6th and 7th Century AD.

120
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:21,553
This period is considered China's golden age

121
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,663
where art and religion flourished.

122
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,256
The mastery of joinery can be seen in the interlaced wooden brackets

123
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:38,828
that support the temple's wide roof with the minimum number of columns

124
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:45,655
and give the visitors an unobstructed view of the Buddha statue.

125
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:52,342
Like the Buddhist temples, traditional Japanese homes and furniture

126
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:55,918
are also held together with wooden joints.

127
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:05,485
And reflect the aesthetic values of simplicity, modesty and appreciation of nature.

128
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:20,764
[Faith Lieberman] Designing in a Japanese fashion or wanting to live that life entails a certain quest for simplicity.

129
00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:25,779
It's easier to be eclectic

130
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:32,466
and it can be wonderful and beautiful to be eclectic but it's not part of anything permanent.

131
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,134
The Japanese design is what it is.

132
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:44,936
I mean it goes way back and it doens't change.

133
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:53,225
And I think that you want to be as true as you can be to that vision and that philosophy.

134
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,586
When you close the screen, you don't see the other side.

135
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:10,570
So, it's just paper, but paper makes it a different space.

136
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,002
I call it a "Mysterious Space".

137
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,372
What we don't know is very mysterious, I think.

138
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,225
Just like in life: we don't know tomorrow.

139
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:27,683
Ten years later, will you exist?

140
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:32,397
You don't know. Maybe we won't exist.

141
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:42,939
This is also, you can also take it off. No hardware.

142
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,646
Gravity sliding. Wooden frame

143
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:56,801
shallow groove, deeper groove.

144
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,051
No hardware. Chopsticks, knife and fork. That's different.

145
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:09,178
Bottom of the screen is made from bottom of the tree.

146
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:13,287
Trees grow like this, trees don't grow upside down.

147
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:20,695
So, these are all made in the same way that the tree grows. So that's why they don't warp.

148
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:25,130
If you position them upside down, or mix them they'll all warp.

149
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:30,145
it's basically a "with nature", no "against nature" process

150
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:38,760
[Laura Fisher] The Shoji screens, they offer a really wonderful diffused light

151
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:45,308
It offers us serenity. it's like our sanctuary

152
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:51,717
when we come here, and I think that's in part because of the Shoji screens

153
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,323
[Stephen Globus] I was looking for a space that was more visually peaceful

154
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,291
and actually a space that would get me away from my Western New York busy life

155
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:17,676
into a more contemplative meditative space.

156
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,577
My current apartment was almost the opposite.

157
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:30,006
I've been collecting American ephemera stuff for about 30 years, so it's all over my apartment

158
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:38,296
And if you go into the Japanese apartment, there is absolutely nothing that is visible or discrete.

159
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,025
I find this space very peaceful and relaxing

160
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:49,622
and I often go there to meditate.

161
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:58,892
You close the Shoji screens and all of New York is now disappearing

162
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,051
You can be any where in the world.

163
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:05,510
It's almost like a little spaceship. Like a little time travelling

164
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:13,033
Many Japanese who have seen this space said wow, that's so cool, "su-goi" (awesome)

165
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:25,757
Once all the joints have been carved and fitted together, the pieces are hand-planed to a flat smooth finish

166
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:37,623
And coated with many layers of traditional tung oil made from the seeds of the tung tree

167
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,880
The finished table is then assembled

168
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:59,380
In this folding table the legs fold out via dowels

169
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,815
and are held in place by small wooden pegs

170
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:12,035
The top is joined to the frame with four sliding dovetail joints

171
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,564
The genius of the table lies in the flexible wooden beam

172
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,629
that holds the legs securely open or closed,

173
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:39,550
with the help of joints on the base and legs

174
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,864
[Mr. Hisao Hanafusa] Su-goi. (Awesome)

175
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:53,622
Everything is done in a very traditional way that lends itself to pride in what you do, pride in the job.

176
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:03,188
And that pride is reflected in the quality of the things that we have in our home

177
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:06,973
that make our lives wonderful and beautiful, easy to live in

178
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:09,690
So it arrived one day.

179
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,962
When Hanafusa's men show up at your apartment they will stop at our door

180
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:22,391
they will remove their shoes, they would bow, they honor the space itself

181
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,874
by being so traditionally Japanese

182
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,725
[Laura Fisher] They have a reverence for their materials,

183
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:31,471
for the space, for what they're doing and we can feel that.

184
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:42,203
Using the table after they have put so much care into making it.

185
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:49,048
You can feel it. it comes through.

186
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:58,754
[Faith Lieberman] I cannot say why I chose the Japanese.

187
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:04,744
That's why I think it's something in me that came from some remote place.

188
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:14,659
I can only think that if there were an after life, then perhaps I was Japanese in some other culture

189
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:18,978
because it really comes from something very innate

190
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:28,382
Hanafusa is really a philosopher and I think what we have in common is that he's an artist and I'm an artist.

191
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:31,517
So I think he's a purist.

192
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:40,015
I think when you're an artist you strive for some kind of truth and consistency.

193
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:52,995
The concept of beauty in traditional Japanese design is different from that in the West.

194
00:22:55,604 --> 00:23:01,819
subtle imperfections and signs of age or weathering are prized.

195
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:10,666
They inspire the viewer to contemplate the passage of time and the imperfect nature of life.

196
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,488
A truly beautiful object should inspire a feeling

197
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:26,316
of serene loneliness and quiet self reflection.

198
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:31,935
In Japanese, this aesthetic is called "wabi sabi".

199
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:41,246
Wabi Sabi is talking about beauty, talking about life.

200
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:45,774
There are many different kinds of beauty: antique beauty

201
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:50,302
rustic beauty, fresh beauty, young beauty.

202
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:56,223
It's very abstract and wide. It doesn't say just "this".

203
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:01,448
When I go to Japan, people say

204
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:07,299
"You came back during a bad season, there's rain. You can't go anywhere."

205
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:13,081
No, I designed it that way, so I could see the rainy days.

206
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,400
If you live there you don't notice;

207
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:20,186
you don't have to go anywhere on a rainy day

208
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:22,974
tomorrow may be a clear day.

209
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:30,357
But, wet temple, wet garden, and no people because of rain...

210
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:34,223
I think that's more beautiful.
