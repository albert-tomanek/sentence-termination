1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,200
It has recently come to the attention of the relevant departments that

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,760
the foreigner Chris Chappell

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,480
creator of the so-called "China Uncensored" program

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,740
has plans to spread his anti-China rhetoric around the world.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,180
It seems this person has plans to cause chaos in

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,740
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other places

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,660
all of which have undeniably been Chinese territory since ancient times.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,720
The aims of this so-called TV host are unclear,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,240
but YouTube viewers have asked him to stop spreading anti-China propaganda,

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,180
and many netizens have questioned whether he is funded by the CIA.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,240
Western media reporting on him should be clear-minded.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,740
and not ignorantly follow the declining influence of the United States,

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,900
such as by falsely referring to the so-called "China Uncensored"

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,440
as a "hilarious YouTube channel" or "informative."

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,980
Earlier this week,

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,540
the People's Liberation Army General Political Department

17
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,900
issued a notice and called on all friends of China

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,260
to put up this wanted poster

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,260
so that the world can see the true face of this so-called host.

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,860
The relevant departments have provided a link

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,980
to download this Wanted poster.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,740
Friends of China should print out this Wanted poster,

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,620
and post it on walls and other locations in their country.

24
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,740
All people should make great strides in spreading this message

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,060
and stopping the frenzied attacks by anti-China forces.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
Additionally, take a photograph of yourself with these posters and

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,780
email it to ChinaUncensored@gmail.com

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,580
to remind Chris Chappell that he is being watched,

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,960
and that he cannot fool the great people of China.

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,480
He has made serious mistakes,

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,220
and should make a self-examination and correction.
