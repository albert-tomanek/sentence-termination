1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,669
George Herbert Walker Bush,

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,660
the 41st president of the United States

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,800
Has been laid to rest.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,120
But his influence on US-China relations

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,260
is still being felt today.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,860
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,680
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,840
President George Bush, the original,

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,140
passed away in November at the age of 94.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,570
He’s the first president I remember as a
kid.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,750
In his years of service to the United States,

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,180
he accomplished a tremendous amount.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,260
And as a final accomplishment,

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,370
at his funeral,

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,780
he got Trump and Obama to shake hands

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,300
and sit practically next to each other.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,829
Hillary seems a little less than pleased.

18
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,180
I think she wanted Trump’s seat.

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,739
The funeral was touching,

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,940
especially the speech given by his son.

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,840
No, the one people liked.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,329
I said Dad I love you and you've been a wonderful
father.

23
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:59,180
And the last words he would ever say on earth
were,

24
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,500
I love you too.

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,420
To us he was close to perfect,

26
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,490
but not totally perfect.

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,580
His short game was lousy.

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,400
Wow, I think that’s the first time I’ve
ever seen people

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,470
laughing with him.

30
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,270
But George Bush Senior was many things to
many people.

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,680
A patriot who fought for his country in World
War II.

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,659
The leader of the CIA at the end of the Cold
War.

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,640
A president in a time of transition.

34
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,930
For others...he was a reptilian alien

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,080
...who secretly tried to have Reagan assassinated.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
So...you know, there’s a lot of views on
the guy.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,560
But since this is China Uncensored,

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,280
and not America Uncovered,

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
I’ll stick to the impact he had on US-China
relations,

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,409
which was huge.

41
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,210
So huge that on the sidelines of the recent
G20 summit,

42
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,250
Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he was

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,020
“greatly saddened” by Bush’s passing,

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,090
saying he was “someone who made important
contributions

45
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,490
to the China-US friendship and relationship
during his lifetime.”

46
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,040
Xi apparently even, “asked Trump to convey
a message of condolence.”

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
And let me just say,

48
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,759
it was a great condolence.

49
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,420
Trump has the best words.

50
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,340
So how did George H.W. Bush become China’s
“old friend?”

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,099
Bush served as the second Special Envoy to
China between 1974 and 75.

52
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,480
He was basically an unofficial ambassador,

53
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,590
since there was no official China-US embassy
at the time.

54
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,330
According to CNN, he was known in Beijing
as the bicycle-riding envoy.

55
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,330
But after a year,

56
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,980
Bush left the position to lead the CIA.

57
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,700
And that’s a whole ’nother story.

58
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,500
But Bush saw Asia, and in particular China,

59
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,550
as pivotal for the US.

60
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,550
So when he became president,

61
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,160
he carried on building the relationships he
had in China.

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
Here he is having a grand old time

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,270
in Tiananmen Square in February 1989.

64
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,500
Ah, Tiananmen Square,

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,010
where absolutely nothing would go wrong four
months later.

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,610
“Soldiers fired automatic weapons into crowds
of civilians,

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,040
and the casualties were staggering.

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,030
The Chinese Red Cross says at least 2,600
people were killed.”

69
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,330
Oops.

70
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,700
But before that happened,

71
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,180
there were hopes Bush would stand up for human
rights

72
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,660
and political change in China.

73
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,750
Two months earlier,

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,200
at a banquet in China,

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,959
Bush had invited two of China’s most famous
political dissidents

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,540
Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian.

77
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,980
But then the June 4th Tiananmen Square Massacre
happened,

78
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,260
and it created a real pickle for President
Bush.

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,620
The Chinese Communist Party became

80
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,840
an international pariah overnight.

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,550
And on the surface,

82
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,780
Bush took a hard stance.

83
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,430
His administration put heavy economic sanctions
on China.

84
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,430
At a news conference,

85
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,959
Bush said he was moved,

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,510
not only by Tank Man,

87
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,560
but also by the often overlooked tank driver.

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,959
“Seeing the tank driver exercise restraint,

89
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm convinced that the forces of democracy

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,049
are going to overcome these unfortunate events
in Tiananmen Square.”

91
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,830
Unfortunately that did not happen.

92
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,660
And Bush played a role in it not happening.

93
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,870
Because behind the scenes,

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,430
Bush sent a secret delegation to assure

95
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,339
the Communist leadership that, don’t worry,

96
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,949
the relationship would be fine.

97
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,009
Just a weeks after the massacre,

98
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,289
Bush sent National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft

99
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,449
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.
Eagleburger to China

100
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,409
to “keep open the lines of communication”.

101
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,099
I don’t know what’s more offensive:

102
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:39,300
the complete disregard for the lives of those
Chinese students,

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,520
or that there’s a guy named Eagleburger.

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,740
That’s like being named white rhino sandwich.

105
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,360
Anyway, according to this declassified US
State Department document,

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,719
Bush told the leadership in Beijing that he

107
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,319
“wants to manage short-term events in a
way

108
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,520
that will best assure a healthy relationship
over time.”

109
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,419
Basically he sent the message to the Communist
Party,

110
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:05,719
that no matter what a US President says in
public,

111
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,599
behind the scenes, he’ll be cooperative.

112
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,129
And that was a tradition future presidents
would follow.

113
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:16,249
Ultimately this caused a bit of a scandal
when it was discovered.

114
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,229
Bush defended his decision to the New York
Times

115
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,400
by saying China “is a billion-plus people.

116
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,050
They have a strategic position in the world
that is important to us...

117
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,309
I do not want to isolate the Chinese people.”

118
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,639
That was a policy that outlived Bush’s presidency—

119
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,449
that if the US keeps engaging with China,

120
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,789
things will get better.

121
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,689
But better doesn't always mean better for
everyone.

122
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:43,619
As China expert James Mann asked,

123
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:46,259
“Relationship...with which “China”?

124
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,030
Not with Chinese society as a whole, but with
the Party.

125
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,520
And not even with the official

126
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,039
Chinese Communist Party leadership of the
time,

127
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,990
headed by General Secretary Zhao Ziyang...

128
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,370
Back then, the United States found countless
ways

129
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,240
to show sympathy for reform elements

130
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,830
and dissidents in the Soviet Union—

131
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,090
but not in China.”

132
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,249
China scholar Perry Link told Hong Kong’s
Apple Daily,

133
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,979
“This constituted not only a lie to the
American people,

134
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,839
but also the greatest failure of American
policy toward China

135
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,469
after the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests.”

136
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,360
Despite international sanctions, the relationship
between

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,490
the US and Chinese governments thawed very
quickly.

138
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,569
By May 1990, the US had renewed

139
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,479
China’s Most Favored Nation trading status.

140
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,469
In November 1991,

141
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,050
Secretary of State James Baker visited China.

142
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,599
Human Rights were not big on the list of discussion
topics.

143
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:44,909
And then in 1992,

144
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:49,139
just three years after the bloody, bloody
massacre,

145
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,179
Chinese Premier Li Peng visited the US

146
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,759
and relations were basically restored.

147
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,139
And in 1994, Bush met Jiang Zemin.

148
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,750
Jiang was the next leader of China.

149
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,900
Also, as it eventually turned out,

150
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,139
Jiang was the next mass murderer of China—

151
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,270
but that’s another episode.

152
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,089
Now I don’t want to give you the impression

153
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:13,500
Bush’s actions towards China were all bad.

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,899
Bush was largely responsible

155
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,459
for the Chinese Student Protection Act of
1992.

156
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,750
It began as an executive order he signed in
1990,

157
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,189
and essentially granted asylum for Chinese
students

158
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:27,080
in the United States after the Tiananmen Square
massacre.

159
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,119
In fact, the reason we have Shelley on our
team

160
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,749
is because her parents got that.

161
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:36,389
But even after Bush’s presidency ended in
1993,

162
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,029
he was still pretty China focused.

163
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:43,469
Here he is in 2002 again with everyone’s
least favorite battletoad,

164
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,849
Jiang Zemin.

165
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,219
This was just three years after Jiang began

166
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,949
the bloody purge against Falun Gong practitioners,

167
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,550
a purge that’s killed way more people than
in Tiananmen Square.

168
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,729
Then in 2008, Bush visited Beijing for the
Olympics.

169
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,249
He said, “China was an important ‘friend’
and ‘supporter’ of the US.”

170
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,770
This was after the Communist Party had just
forcibly evicted

171
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,710
one and a half million people for the Games.

172
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,629
But, I mean if we keep engaging with the Communist
Party,

173
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:15,229
sooner or later they’ll have to get better!

174
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,629
That was also the same year Bush released
his China diaries.

175
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,020
In the forward he summed up his views of China:

176
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,460
“I love the Chinese people.

177
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,119
One of my dreams for our world is that

178
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:29,029
these two powerful giants will continue working
toward

179
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:30,699
a full partnership and friendship

180
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,089
that will bring peace and prosperity to people
everywhere.”

181
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:36,409
That’s a nice sentiment.

182
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,129
It’s just too bad that,

183
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:40,060
like many US politicians,

184
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,959
Bush confused supporting the Chinese people,

185
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,560
with supporting the Chinese Communist Party.

186
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,060
So what do you think about the China legacy

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,300
left behind by George HW Bush?

188
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,910
Leave your comments below.

189
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,300
And before we wrap up, now is the time

190
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,029
when I answer a question from a fan

191
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,560
who supports China Uncensored

192
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,920
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

193
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,120
Joakim Idland asks,

194
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
“Are there other Chinese politicians

195
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,000
that have been connected to other cartoon
characters

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,300
other than Winnie the Pooh aka Xi Jinping?

197
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,610
Ah, yes.

198
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,310
For those of you not in the know,

199
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,350
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been compared
to Winnie the Pooh.

200
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,560
And after this meeting with president Obama,

201
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,490
Chinese netizens began to notice some more
striking similarities.

202
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,899
And when Xi Jinping became president for life,

203
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,680
it happened again.

204
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,610
It became so much of a meme,

205
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,149
Winnie the Pooh has been occasionally banned
in China.

206
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,740
As for other Chinese officials,

207
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,110
while this is not a cartoon character, Jiang
Zemin,

208
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,920
in general, looks like a toad.

209
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,190
And that led to this giant inflatable toad
being censored.

210
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,190
Which is ridiculous.

211
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,940
The giant inflatable toad is much better looking.

212
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,000
Here at China Uncensored,

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,110
we’ve noticed a few more Chinese officials

214
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,980
who look like cartoons.

215
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,850
Like the perpetually sad Vice President Wang
Qishan

216
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,420
who looks like Eeyore.

217
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,420
And Zhou Yongkang,

218
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,149
who is a human version of the Thwomp

219
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,649
from Super Mario Brothers.

220
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,079
Chinese authorities are fully aware of

221
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,680
all the ways people make fun of them,

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,089
and they’re extremely sensitive.

223
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,140
And that’s why you probably won’t be seeing
Winnie the Pooh

224
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,880
at the Shanghai Disneyland.

225
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Oh bother.

226
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,199
Thanks for you question.

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,170
