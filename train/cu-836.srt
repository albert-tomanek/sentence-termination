bjbj,(,( On this episode of China Uncensored,
China doesn t have a military? Hi, welcome

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,390
to China Uncensored, I am Chris Chappell.
So China doesn t have a military. And I know

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,680
what you re thinking, now hold on there Chris,
it seems almost every day we hear about China

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,940
developing a new fighter jet, or aircraft
carrier, or threatening military action against

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,310
Japan. Okay, sure there was the time that
China s state run CCTV used footage from Top

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,170
gun and passed it off as a military drill.
And then there was a the time they also used

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,600
a map to describe troop movements between
Turkey, Iraq and Iran that looked an awful

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,620
lot like a map in the popular online video
game World of Warcraft. So perhaps China s

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,469
army is an army of dreamers, but China still
an army, right? Well, not really. China the

10
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,550
country doesn t have a military, the Chinese
Communist Party does. Same thing, right? Actually,

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,320
no, they are two very different things, and
this is almost never explained in the Western

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,270
media. For most of the beginning of the 20th
century, the Communist Party was trying to

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,479
takeover China from the Kuomintang Nationalist
Party. They weren t really making any pr ogress

14
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,899
until World War 2 when Japan invaded China.
Eventually the Japanese were expelled but

15
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:16,250
Kuomintang armies were ravaged. That s when
the Communist Party seized the country and

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,399
expelled the Kuomintang. It s actually a little
funny that the Chinese regime always stirs

17
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:26,020
up anti-Japanese sentiment because really,
they played a big part the Partys takeover.

18
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,889
Actually I think a party official did say
that once, what was his name again, snap snap

19
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:34,349
snap. Oh right. Chairman Mao. Japanese capitalist
and warlords have done a good deed for the

20
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,159
Communists, if ever we need to say thank you,
I would like to say Thank you to Japanese

21
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,039
war lords. So needless to say, not everyone
in China was very happy that this guerilla

22
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:49,329
army of Communists just seized control of
the government. So as Mao Zedong consolidated

23
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:54,369
his power, he famously said, All political
power comes from the barrel of a gun. The

24
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:59,319
communist party must command all the guns,
that way, no guns can ever be used to command

25
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,259
the party. In China, you can t own a gun.
The only one s with guns are the People s

26
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,459
Liberation Army and they are controlled directly
by the Chinese Communist Party, not the state

27
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,790
or government of China. That s three million
soldiers, the world s largest active military,

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,599
that pays allegiance directly to the Communist
Party, not to the Chinese government, and

29
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,329
they re certainly not there to defend the
Chinese people. There is no state military.

30
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,819
Only the hired guns of the Party. To put it
in a way that s easy to understand, imagine

31
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,799
that in the US, the Republican Party, or the
Democratic Party, choose your poison, seized

32
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:38,000
control of the government, dissolved the US
military and established their own personal

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,819
army and forced everyone to do what they say.
That s been China for the past 60 years. And

34
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:48,780
here s where it gets weird. China still has
a government. It s just that the Communist

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,901
Party has latched onto every level of it,
kind of like a parasite. So in China, you

36
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:58,019
have your government officials at the provincial
level, down to the city, county, township,

37
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,079
and village level. But then at each of those
levels, you also have what s called a Party

38
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:08,439
secretary. They re appointed by the Communist
Party and have absolute power, so even if

39
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,550
a village actually elects a leader, that leader
just has to follow along with whatever the

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,231
Party Secretary says and he gets his orders
from the top of the Party. China s National

41
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:22,079
People s Congress? The BBC calls it a rubber
stamp congress. Even though there are different

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,180
political parties involved, those parties
are just controlled by the Communist Party,

43
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,939
and everything they put forward is approved.
It s a sham. President Hu Jintao? President

44
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:35,450
Xi Jinping? China doesn t have a president.
They just made that up to trick people into

45
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,579
thinking that their brutal oppressive communist
regime is a democracy. The president of China

46
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,290
is really the head of the Communist Party.
There is no Presidential election. In reality,

47
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,260
China is in the grip of the Communist Party,
and they control all the guns. Thanks for
