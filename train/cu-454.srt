bjbj,(,( First Dead Pigs, Now Angry (Plague-Ridden)
Birds Visit Beautiful Shanghai! Hello and

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,880
welcome to China Uncensored, I m your host
and visionary shaman, Chris Chappell. The

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,550
gods are angry! At least, you d be forgiven
for believing that if you re, say, a Chinese

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:27,730
villager who lives somewhere near Shanghai.
First, tens of thousands of local pigs died

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,890
and fell into the Huangpu River under mysterious
circumstances. Then, you start hearing about

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:39,180
new cases of the dreaded bird flu, striking
dead four people in the region and two nearby.

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,200
But for sophisticated, middle class urban
types, it s a godsend Shanghai s finally catching

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
up in the rankings for top cities facing imminent
apocalyptic disaster! After all, for years

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,920
Asia biggest and most prosperous city was
Tokyo, where the city s most popular form

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,120
of recreation is watching itself be crushed
by space moths or decimated by bioengineered

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,539
pseudo-mystical cyborgs that are trying to
obliterate mankind. Or something like that.

12
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:11,100
That one went a little over my head, to be
honest. Anyway, in comparison, a river full

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,389
of pork and a new strain of deadly super influenza
seem almost mediocre. But China s authorities

14
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:21,029
don t seem to mind, they ve reported on both
stories, without even seeming to try for a

15
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:25,499
massive cover-up. The news coverage was a
little slow, and it lagged behind public reporting

16
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:30,590
on Weibo and other websites, but still; the
news actually reported something big, bad

17
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,100
and dangerous happening in China. That s like
Russian news agencies reporting that Vladimir

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,899
Putin throws like a girl. Of course, it s
worth looking at some historical context.

19
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:45,289
When the crisis over SARS hit in late 2002,
news was relentlessly suppressed until so

20
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,899
many had been infected that it would have
been very hard not to acknowledge the problem.

21
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:54,399
Eventually, thousands caught the disease and
hundreds died, and the failed cover-up gave

22
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,450
the Chinese regime a major publicity black
eye. This television station was one of the

23
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,809
very few media that initially broke news of
the SARS crisis. Now Chinese citizens using

24
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:10,009
Weibo and similar tools are also able to push
official media into reporting on some stories

25
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,040
but only the facts that they absolutely have
to. But when it comes to problems that no

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,069
one has publicized online, or that are totally
censored from the Internet, there s still

27
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,349
no guarantee the Communist Party will even
acknowledge their existence. For instance,

28
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:27,260
are there any unknown bird flu cases besides
those already reported? Did those pigs communicate

29
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,239
any diseases to humans? Who knows! So for
Shanghai residents, the best way to stay safe

30
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,319
might be to keep your cell-phone handy, take
pictures of any weird animal corpses you come

31
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,739
across, and try to get them online before
the black vans show up. As for those outside

32
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,140
China, why should we care about a few censored
epidemics here and there? After all, Shanghai

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,340
s so far away, and germs are really, really
small it seems VERY unlikely that they could

34
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,879
travel all the way to somewhere I d be affected.
Well, that s it for today! Hate to run, but

35
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,760
I ve got to get to the arrivals terminal at
JFK airport. hC~; [Content_Types].xml #!MB
