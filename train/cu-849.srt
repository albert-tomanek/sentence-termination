1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,800
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,560
nothing says celebrate Chinese culture...

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,740
like destroying everyone else’s culture.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,230
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,929
The Chinese Communist Party loves

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,490
all the 56 ethnic minorities of China.

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,230
For example, Tibetans.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,210
The Party liberated Tibet from the mean old
Dalai Lama

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,449
created a modern society by burning down temples,

11
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,169
mostly wiping out the language,

12
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:31,539
and let’s not forget,

13
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,200
making lots and lots of dead bodies.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,340
And since this strategy was so effective

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,480
at making Tibetans cooperative,

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,620
why not try it in other ethnic regions of
China?

17
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,300
Well that’s just what the Communist Party

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,050
has been doing in the Xinjiang Autonomous
region

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,710
and its ethnic Uighur population.

20
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,960
And it’s working just as well as you can
imagine.

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,730
I went down to Washington DC to speak with
Irade Kashgary,

22
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,670
a Uighur activist,

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,540
about the Chinese Communist Party’s cultural
genocide.

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,080
Thank you so much for joining us today.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,839
Thank you, I'm happy to be here.

26
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,860
So, why don't you tell us a little bit about
yourself.

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,540
Of course, I was born in East Turkestan in
1993.

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,420
My parent immigrated to the United States
in 1999 and,

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,550
I am a US citizen and ever since I was five
years old

30
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,910
I've been a Uighur human rights activist,

31
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,390
I've been going to protests since then,

32
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,350
complaining about what China's been doing
to Uighur's and,

33
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,620
now I operate on a care and education

34
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,050
which is a Uighur language school

35
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,840
in northern Virginia.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,049
Now I understand that some people

37
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,610
call East Turkestan a different name.

38
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,580
Yes, they do go by Xinjiang but,

39
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,490
just like my name for example which

40
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,820
my parents gave me the name Irade Gilel,

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,250
they change it to Eurita Gilelly.

42
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,250
Similar to what they're doing,

43
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,780
this all part of their sinicization,

44
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,410
their plans to try to completely suppress

45
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,520
and get rid of Uighurs in general and,

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,209
that's why they renamed East Turkestan as
Xinjiang.

47
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,569
That is the name that they wanna go by,

48
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,310
the second you say East Turkestan,

49
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,150
you're detained, you're sent away,

50
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,439
you're considered a separatist.

51
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,139
But that is the name given to us back in the
1800s.

52
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,609
One thing I don't get is,

53
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,599
I hear that all the ethnic minorities in China

54
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,319
love the communist party so,

55
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,159
surely the Uighurs also love the communist
party?

56
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,110
You hear that yes but, unfortunately that
is not the case,

57
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,620
that is false propaganda that they like to
spread.

58
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,700
Even before 2001, they used to say things
like,

59
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,630
"Uighurs are so happy here,

60
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,370
they love the communist party,

61
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,959
they're great, we get along great."

62
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,120
Just like the Tibetans.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,099
Just like the Tibetans. So no difference right,

64
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,969
we're not under any oppression so, the unhappiness

65
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,939
is because of that oppression because

66
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,200
even back in history in the 1900s

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,139
what would happen is Uighurs would get to

68
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,590
a certain part of their career

69
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,969
or they'd have caps there would be racism,

70
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,900
they would be capped off at a certain position,

71
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,220
they don't have any self determination,

72
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,450
even back then and,

73
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,530
that's where the unhappiness comes from.

74
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,879
So just for the audience who might not have

75
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,370
a super clear idea of the Uighur people,

76
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,309
can you tell us a little bit about the Uighur
identity.

77
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,709
Yeah, we're Turkic muslims,

78
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,290
we've been in existence for a very long time,

79
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,670
we've had our own country, we have our own
country,

80
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,269
currently oppressed, we're-

81
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,139
This feels so subversive, I love it.

82
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,500
Yeah, we have a lot going on and, we have
history,

83
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,389
we have culture, we're Turkic and,

84
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:58,609
we have a lot of Islamic points for example,

85
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:05,279
our text is arabic and, we've been in existence
for so long,

86
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,049
we used to be nomadic people and,

87
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,819
then we settles in the northwest

88
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,409
similar to Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan etc.

89
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,259
And in 1949 we were oppressed by the communist
party.

90
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,419
Oppressed or liberated?

91
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:21,419
Oppressed.

92
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,120
So, you see this in Tibet as well

93
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,770
as in Xinjiang or East Turkestan,

94
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:33,020
I'm using both so people know the same page
we're on.

95
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,870
Like Tibet, you see an eradication

96
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,110
of the traditional Tibetan culture.

97
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,110
That's happening in Xinjiang as well right?

98
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,590
That is correct, it's happening at an alarming
rate.

99
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,949
It started as I mentioned very early on but,

100
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,180
it's getting more and more severe now,

101
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,900
they're attacking children,

102
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,979
they're handling the generations differently
so,

103
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,509
while they're arresting the people like me,
my age and older

104
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,639
they are taking the younger kids

105
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,650
that are still developing their minds and,

106
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,560
they are teaching them to forget who they
are

107
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,370
and to consider themselves Han Chinese.

108
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,669
There are videos that have been released with
kids that

109
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,419
are Uighur saying that they are Han Chinese,
this is ridiculous.

110
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,620
How do you say that you're not one thing and,
that your another.

111
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
It's like ethnic genocide.

112
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,389
It's ethnic genocide and,

113
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,710
they're making sure that any of our ideologies,

114
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,530
any of our beliefs are completely being suppressed.

115
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,970
I hear, so on Ramadan,

116
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,210
which is traditional holiday where people
fast correct?

117
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,500
I hear they have even been giving Uighur children
candy to tempt them.

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,930
That's been going on for a while actually,

119
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,840
so even before the recent aggression,

120
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,330
rise of aggression, they had been purposefully
during Ramadan

121
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,020
bringing candy and cookies to schools so that
the kids

122
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,719
would be more tempted.

123
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:04,270
Now that's not even the case, you have to
eat,

124
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,780
you have to even drink alcohol, for adults
at least,

125
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,840
I don't wanna say-

126
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,490
They're not forcing it on the kids yet.

127
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,490
Not yet.

128
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,800
So, they're tempting them with candy.

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,479
It's like the communist party has reached

130
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,669
old child molester in a van kind of evil.

131
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,620
Exactly, it's getting ridiculous and at this
time

132
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,570
they're sending these kids to school

133
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,409
far away from their parents.

134
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,810
So, there's two parts to this, one part is
that kids

135
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,939
are being sent to orphanages because their
parents

136
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,110
are being sent to reeducation camps so,

137
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,520
they have no adult supervision so,

138
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,729
for those that aren't being left alone,

139
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,710
they are being sent to orphanages as if they
didn't have

140
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,090
living parents or living family members.

141
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,350
The other half whose parents may not have
been sent and,

142
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,790
that's a very very few,

143
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,789
they are being sent to boarding schools and,

144
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,710
this has been happening for a long time and,

145
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,699
I know a specific girl who was a student

146
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,150
here in the US and she thought

147
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,850
she wanted to go is it her parents,

148
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,599
two years ago and she thought,

149
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,139
she's very young so she's innocent,

150
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,440
she doesn't realize what's going on

151
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,009
because she grew up in Chinese education.

152
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,139
And, she went back and she was

153
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,020
immediately sent off to boarding school,

154
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,410
even though all of her stuff is here,

155
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,349
her education is here, in the United States
but,

156
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,750
the second she went back, off to boarding
school.

157
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,760
How old was the girl?

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,400
She was 14 years old.

159
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,129
She stayed with me at my families house and,

160
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,280
she was at a private school,

161
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,599
a very well because her parents were somewhat
well off and

162
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,189
were able to send her money.

163
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:34,780
Now we don't know,

164
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,560
last we heard she went off to boarding school
but,

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
we don't know.

166
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
So, how has the communist party changing the
face of Xinjiang,

167
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,930
East Turkestan?

168
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,060
Well, first and foremost

169
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,590
they've destroyed one of our oldest cities,

170
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,129
one of our oldest traditional cities, Kashgar.

171
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:53,999
My last name actually is a note to that so,
Kashgari,

172
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:59,499
Kashgar and, they completely demolished this
historic land

173
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,789
with all of our agent buildings

174
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,219
that contain a lot of history and,

175
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,610
rebuilt on it to sinocize it and,

176
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,229
to remove any sort of history that was there.

177
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,009
They destroyed books,

178
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:16,530
especially anything that contains religious
text but,

179
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,120
at this point having something like a small
term,

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,729
used once in the book means that they're gonna
destroy it.

181
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,960
They're not allowing the language to be used
at all.

182
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,590
The language is banned.

183
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,520
They're forcing people into the houses,

184
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,330
Chinese party representatives into houses

185
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,580
so that they can spy and,

186
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,200
make sure that these Uighur families are not

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,580
associating with their culture in any way.

188
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,910
And as I understand a lot of traditional beliefs

189
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,180
are also being discouraged,

190
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,610
to put it lightly.

191
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,640
Exactly, so the religious oppression is very
intense,

192
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,710
anything that we believe in,

193
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,320
we're not allowed to say or they're not allowed
to say,

194
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,870
you know god bless or anything like that.

195
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,410
They have to say Xi Jinping bless

196
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,750
or the Chinese communist party bless.

197
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,500
Really, I'm gonna start using that. Xi Jinping
bless.

198
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,730
I'm sure you could do a little hashtag

199
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,260
and make that run off real quick.

200
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,780
Some things should not become viral.

201
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I agree.

202
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,800
So, Xinjiang is becoming a surveillance state,

203
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,730
people are even being monitored in their homes.

204
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,510
What's the goal of all this?

205
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,970
To make sure that people aren't associating
themselves

206
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,070
with Uighur at all,

207
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,400
this is all part of their plan to completely

208
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,240
destroy the Uighur culture and, t

209
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,400
o make sure that they're not teaching their
kids for example or,

210
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,510
they're not keeping anything from the party.

211
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,700
This is all part of their,

212
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,750
you know they're talking about the surveillance
state.

213
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,730
This is 100% big brother esque level.

214
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,710
Big brother's great though.

215
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,660
Yeah I mean, what can go wrong when they're
watching your

216
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,220
every single move and they have your kids
and,

217
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,640
there's been proof that they're

218
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,900
asking the kids to tell on their parent

219
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
so if that's not 1984.

220
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,090
Just like in the cultural revolution.

221
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,270
Just like the cultural revolution.

222
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,880
So, how successful is the party at this cultural
genocide?

223
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,540
I think they are getting pretty successful,

224
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,030
I think it's been happening at alarming rates.

225
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,960
Earlier this year we were talking about people

226
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,290
being sent into these so called reeducation
camps.

227
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,980
Vocational training schools please.

228
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,570
Vocational training schools.

229
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,690
But really let's be honest they're a step
away

230
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,100
from being concentration camps.

231
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,210
They're being sent to these at alarming rates

232
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,950
because earlier this year

233
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,210
we were saying that there was around the hundred
thousands,

234
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,740
now we're saying up to three million people
and,

235
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,220
the UN even released a report on this as well.

236
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,680
So this is, they're being successful and,

237
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,340
we need to speak up or we need to do something

238
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,550
as soon as possible.

239
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,080
I know the US government had been more vocal

240
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,680
about the situation there.

241
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,520
What can the rest of the world do?

242
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,580
We can continue to be more and more vocal.

243
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,040
The US has been taking lead on it recently

244
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,990
there's been the Uighur human rights act that's
been released.

245
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,240
But, the international community,

246
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,470
the EU has spoken up as well but,

247
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,390
it's still speaking up is only the first step.

248
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,160
We need to actually create acts.

249
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,980
For example the US has to make Magnitsky act.

250
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,140
We need to implement that,

251
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,140
I think all countries need to implement it.

252
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,160
Can you just mention how that applies specifically
to Xinjiang.

253
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,500
Yeah there's many leaders like Chen Quanguo
that need

254
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,230
to be pinpointed that he needs to be sanctioned.

255
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,210
There needs to be sanctions happening,

256
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,110
we need to be able to say, "Look, you can't
do this."

257
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,360
And, here are specific people doing this

258
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,720
and they need pinpoint these leaders that
are behind all of it.

259
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,890
So, what happens to people who try and stand
up to this?

260
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,470
Inside of Xinjiang, East Turkestan?

261
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,270
There have been very small movements for example

262
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,140
in the sense of people stand up by you know,

263
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,470
we really value books and art and stuff like
that

264
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,500
and the second someone even tries to do something

265
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,070
like that they get imprisoned.

266
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,270
We have many many thought leaders, professors,

267
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,090
authors that have been detained

268
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,500
and sentenced to life in prison because what?

269
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,590
They released a book a couple of years ago?

270
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,570
They translated a religious text, for little
things

271
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,870
like that they're getting imprisoned.

272
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,030
For even studying abroad they're getting imprisoned.

273
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,280
There have been many people who studied abroad

274
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,350
that we haven't heard from, we don't know
where they are.

275
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,100
Any sort of dissent from the communist party
angers them,

276
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,540
they believe that they'll get success through
the sinocisation

277
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,230
of all cultures and Uighurs have a very strong
cultural identity and,

278
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,610
this makes them fro example

279
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,470
when they go out they don't say that they're
Chinese,

280
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,000
they say they're Uighur.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,230
This does not fall well with the communist
leaders.

282
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,480
Communist China is not okay with this.

283
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,330
They want everyone to be Han Chinese in one
sense,

284
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,630
they don't want anything that might divert
them from following,

285
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:25,200
feeling any sort of way about the communist
party besides, all hail.

286
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Well, that was very insightful,

287
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,180
thank you for joining us if the audience would
like to learn

288
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,300
more about you or what you're doing what can
they do?

289
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,510
What they can do is, they can visit many of
our websites,

290
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,390
we have UHRP.com, we have UAA.com, these are
all sources.

291
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,490
You can google Uighur's on google and,

292
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,240
you'll be able to learn a lot from there.

293
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,430
Besides that they can contact many of our
leaders and,

294
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,680
make sure that you know read on the Uighur
human rights act,

295
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,790
read on the act and see how

296
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,120
that's implementing right now in the government.

297
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,200
Well thank you for joining us, great to talk to you.

298
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,820
Alright, thank you!

299
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Well thank you very much for that fascinating interview.

300
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,860
Yeah, of course!

301
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,020
But there's actually so much more to talk about.

302
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,220
There is! I don't think we got to half of it.

303
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Not even half.

304
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,800
Fortunately, I spoke to Irade on the China Unscripted podcast...

305
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,660
where... it was amazing.

306
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,260
Yeah, it was amazing and we got to talk about more of the issues that are just so important.

307
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,800
And I've put a link below so check it out!
