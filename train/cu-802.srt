00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,200
Greta Thunberg calls out China\h
for their carbon emissions\h

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,280
China responds

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:16,840
by fat-shaming her

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
I know you remember Greta Thunberg,\h\h

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
the teenage activist who spoke at the\h
UN Action Climate Summit back in 2019.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,680
“People are suffering. People are dying.\h\h

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,520
Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are\h
in the beginning of a mass extinction,\h\h

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,840
and all you can talk about is money and fairy\h
tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!”

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,000
Whether you like her or not, there’s no doubt\h
she’s become one of the most influential people\h\h

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,560
of her generation. She’s the youngest\h
ever Time Magazine Person of the Year.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,440
But in her several years of climate\h
activism, she’s never talked publicly\h\h

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,400
about the world’s biggest carbon emitter: China.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,640
That is, until last month—when she Tweeted\h
a link to a CNN article, and wrote this:

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,440
“Yes, China is still categorized as a developing\h
nation by WTO, they manufacture a lot of our\h\h

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,520
products and so on. But that's of course no excuse\h
for ruining future and present living conditions.\h\h

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,800
We can't solve the climate crisis unless\h
China drastically changes course.”

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
She has a point. China emits 27%\h
of the world's greenhouse gases,\h\h

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,320
according to this 2019 chart by the Rhodium Group.\h
That’s more than all developed nations combined.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,120
So after years of climate activism,\h\h

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,200
the entirety of her criticism of China\h
is one tweet. Rehashing a CNN article.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,880
But the Chinese Communist Party is very sensitive.\h\h

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,920
Which is how you know\h
they’re strong and confident.

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,920
But even that one tweet was enough to make my\h
favorite Chinese state-run media The Global Times\h\h

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,160
move to attack her—by framing China as\h
unfairly bullied by the Western world.

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
They called Greta out on her silence over Japan’s\h\h

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,840
dumping of radioactive water, proposing that\h
“If [Thunberg] lashed out at Japan’s move,\h\h

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,120
it will not be consistent with Western\h
mainstream political posture. Therefore,\h\h

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,040
to cater to them, Thunberg has remained\h
silent in a bid to protect her own interests.”

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Yeah, how dare she not point out\h
Japan’s dumping of radioactive water.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,880
Except for that time she did.

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,040
And that other time she did.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,720
But maybe Chinese state-run media didn’t see\h
those tweets, because Twitter is banned in\h\h

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,840
China. Although that doesn’t stop The Global\h
Times from having its own Twitter account.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
But enough about Chinese state-run media’s\h\h

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
hypocrisy. This is about\h
Greta Thunberg’s hypocrisy!

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,320
The point is, she’s a\h
“double-standard environmentalist”\h\h

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,560
and a “puppet of Western politicians.”

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,000
You know, the one’s she routinely criticizes.

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,080
A few hours after that article, The Global\h
Times doubled down with another one—that\h\h

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,240
denies China’s carbon emissions, and belittles\h
Thunberg’s understanding of climate change.

42
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,000
“Thunberg, who at age 15 started skipping\h
school on Fridays for her climate protests,\h\h

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,120
is merely 18 years old this\h
year. She is short of sufficient\h\h

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,280
academic knowledge study, and lack of\h
sound self-judgment capability. Girl\h\h

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
like her is prone to be affected or even\h
manipulated by some political forces.”

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,360
“Academic knowledge study”? “Girl like her\h\h

47
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,080
is prone to be affected”? Sounds like the\h
translator also skipped school on Fridays.

48
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,160
And other Chinese state media\h
joined in on the group criticism.

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,440
China Daily called Greta Thunberg a\h
“Swedish Environmentalist Princess”\h\h

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,360
who “Should Reduce Her Own Carbon Emissions”.
Wait a minute, is that a fart joke?

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,560
“The princess had never planted a tree or\h
planted a piece of grass in the desert. Instead,\h\h

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,400
she ran around. She held a lot of protesting\h
cards, which polluted the environment.”

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,240
Yeah, unlike China, which has\h
planted 20 million trees in Xinjiang!

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes, the Communist Party is planting\h
trees in an area with almost no water,\h\h

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,960
attempting to transform desert into a forest!\h
See? China is a leader in climate change!

56
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,200
But China Daily continued\h
to attack Greta Thunberg.\h\h

57
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,200
They posted this unflattering photo of her,\h
saying “Although she claims to be vegan,\h\h

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,760
judging from how she looks, her carbon\h
emissions are not so low herself.”

59
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,960
Ohhh ok it’s not a fart joke, it’s a fat\h
joke. Stay classy, Chinese state-run media.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,560
This is a common tactic for the Chinese\h
regime. When they have trouble defending\h\h

61
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,800
themselves over what someone says, they\h
go on the offensive, and launch personal\h\h

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,360
attacks on whoever said the thing they’re mad\h
about. This is called “poisoning the well.”

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Here’s another example.\h\h

64
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,720
When female victims of Uyghur genocide spoke out\h
about rape used as a form of torture in Xinjiang,\h\h

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,640
Chinese foreign minstry spokesperson Wang Wenbin\h
didn’t try to prove their claims were false.

66
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,480
Instead, he held up their photos, and called\h
them liars; he said one was "morally depraved"\h\h

67
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,720
and of "inferior character",\h
and accused another of adultery.

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,280
Here’s another example of poisoning the well.\h
During Taiwan’s 2016 presidential elections,\h\h

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
Chinese officials did whatever\h
they could to criticize\h\h

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,760
Democratic Progressive Party\h
candidate Tsai Ing-wen.

71
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,120
But instead of pointing out flaws in her policy,\h\h

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,520
they claimed Tsai was incapable of\h
leading, because she’s an unmarried woman,\h\h

73
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,280
with “no emotional burdens of love, family\h
constraints, and no children’s concerns.”

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
So it’s no surprise that China’s\h
response to Greta Thunberg criticizing\h\h

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,200
China’s carbon emissions was... to fat-shame her.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,760
Unfortunately, when you fat-shame\h
someone, it often backfires.

77
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
Greta Thunberg just owned it.

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,160
“Being fat-shamed by Chinese state owned media is\h
a pretty weird experience even by my standards.\h\h

79
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
But it’s definitely going on my resume.”

80
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,800
And thanks to criticism from Chinese state-run\h
media, Greta Thunberg got a lot more attention\h\h

81
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,560
than she would have from her one original China\h
Tweet. Even people who don’t really like her\h\h

82
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
are now defending her from attacks by the\h
powerful machinery of an authoritarian state.

83
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,960
And this just makes her even more influential.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,920
To which I say, I’ve been criticising the\h
Chinese Communist Party for 8 years!!!\h\h

85
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,280
Where’s *my* Hulu documentary?! . Where’s *my*\h
three-part PBS series?! . Where’s *my* life size\h\h

86
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,960
bronze statue at a third tier British university!?
.

87
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
Look, I’m not jealous. I\h
just don’t like hypocrisy.

88
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,240
And now it’s time to answer a question\h
from you—my amazing viewers who support\h\h

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
China Uncensored through the\h
crowdfunding website Patreon.

90
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,280
Travis Friesen asks, "With China being a ‘near\h
Arctic nation’, do you think it will stake out\h\h

91
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,160
claims in the Arctic in the same way it tries\h
to claim the entirety of the South China Sea?"

92
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
Yes, Travis. Yes they will.

93
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
And I can predict this with confidence,\h
because it’s already been happening.China\h\h

94
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,840
might not be able to claim the Arctic has\h
been part of China since ancient times.\h\h

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,000
At least until they find a giant\h
panda frozen in an iceberg.

96
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,880
But they’ve been trying to insert\h
themselves into Arctic decision-making,\h\h

97
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,080
despite not being one of the eight\h
countries that borders the arctic.

98
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,480
In 2013, China joined the\h
Arctic Council as an observer.

99
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Five years later, China declared\h
itself a “near arctic state”.

100
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,520
And soon, China will claim it has a right\h
to make decisions in the region, because so\h\h

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,400
many Chinese ships go through the Arctic—now more\h
than ever, since the polar ice caps are melting.\h\h

102
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,920
Thanks to climate change. Which China is\h
totally not contributing to, so shut up, Greta!

103
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,840
