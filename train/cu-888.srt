00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,350
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,150
"Potato, potato, tomato, tomato.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,630
Oh let's call the whole thing off."

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,620
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,920
You know some people say neither, I say neither.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,210
Some say Diaoyu, others Senkaku.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,519
Let’s call the whole thing off.

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,300
Please?

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,019
Before we all get dragged into World War III?

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,599
Last Thursday, the Chinese regime decided

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,929
it just didn’t have enough on its hands

12
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,090
with territorial disputes in the South China
Sea.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,969
Why limit it to conflicts with Malaysia, Indonesia,
Brunei, Vietnam, and the Philippines

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,090
when you can anger Japan, too,

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,789
by sending your navy ships to the East China
Sea?

16
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,129
This lovely archipelago is at the center of
a rocky territorial dispute

17
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:53,460
between China and Japan.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,140
China calls them the Diaoyu Islands.

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,360
Japan—the Senkaku Islands.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,380
Tomato, tomato?

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,329
Not when exclusive oil, mineral and fishing
rights

22
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,939
in the surrounding waters are on the line.

23
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:09,810
And China just sent a military frigate through
what’s called Japan’s contiguous zone

24
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,640
that’s the area of sea between 12 and 24
nautical miles from the coast.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,070
Now China has been sending lots of ships

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,790
into the waters around the Diaoyu, Senkaku
Islands,

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,810
since Japan nationalized them in 2012.

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,780
But this is the first time an actual military
vessel was sent in.

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,710
And boy, Japan was fuming!

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,980
"We're deeply concerned that Chinese naval
ships entered the waters

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,180
contiguous to our Senkaku islands for the
first time,

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,360
and this behavior unilaterally escalates tensions."

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh, ok. They’re deeply concerned.

34
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,950
That doesn’t sound too bad, right?

35
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,350
“The consequences are impossible to underestimate.

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,250
I think tensions between the two countries
are greater now

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,110
than they’ve probably been in half a century.”

38
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,740
In half a century?

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,700
You mean like, since the countries were at
war with each other?

40
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,940
That’s probably not a good thing.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,000
For, like, anyone.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Especially the Chinese ambassador to Japan.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,069
Japan’s vice foreign minister reportedly
called him at 2 in the morning

44
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:19,379
to register an official complaint.

45
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,530
And you know, this might not have been the
smartest move for the Chinese regime.

46
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,680
China’s whole attitude in the past has been

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,930
“It’s our islands, we’ll sail where
we want!”

48
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,590
But that’s not what they did.

49
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,959
According to the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea,

50
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
a military vessel sailing through a contiguous
zone is perfectly legal.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,550
Japan really didn’t have grounds to issue
a formal complaint.

52
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,900
In fact that same night,

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,239
three Russian military ships did the exact
same thing.

54
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,150
And while the Japanese government is investigating
whether there’s a connection,

55
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,620
they didn’t protest the Russian ships.

56
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,870
Sure, it sounds impressive that China

57
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,849
sent a military frigate to the Senkaku Islands.

58
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,340
Wavin’ their flag in the air like they just
don’t care.

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,379
But it’s all bluster.

60
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,599
Because if they really didn’t care,

61
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,330
they would have sailed through territorial
waters.

62
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,310
That is, less than 12 nautical miles from
shore.

63
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,750
But that could result in an actual armed conflict
with Japan,

64
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,390
and by extension, the United States.

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,200
And if that happened,

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,830
it'd be hard to call the whole thing off.

67
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,720
Besides, at the end of the day...

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,530
“Both countries have much bigger stakes

69
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,390
than struggling over an uninhabited island in
the middle of nowhere.”

70
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,890
So let’s call the whole thing off, ok?

71
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,010
So what do you think is behind China

72
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,620
escalating tensions now in both the South
and East China Seas?

73
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,110
Leave your comments below.

74
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,360
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.
