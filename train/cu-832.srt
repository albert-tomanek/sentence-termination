1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,829
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,500
the CCP has been pushing farmers

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
to move to the cities.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,820
But let’s just say,

5
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,100
it’s not all going according to plan.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,700
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,230
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,539
China has a serious problem

9
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,830
with rural poverty.

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,390
Rural households on average

11
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,120
live off of only $4 a day.

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,100
This is a problem for the Chinese Communist
Party.

13
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,490
When you think of China,

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,220
they want you to think of rich cities

15
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,970
with glistening skylines.

16
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,599
But right now,

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,080
a lot of China looks more like this.

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,850
Oh, I’m sorry,

19
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,860
did I say, “China has a serious problem

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,260
with rural poverty”?

21
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,770
My favorite Party mouthpiece, Global Times

22
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,290
is here once again to correct

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,410
my misapprehensions.

24
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,570
What I meant to say was China

25
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,980
is enlightening the world

26
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,850
with ways to relieve rural poverty.

27
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,550
Here’s one way:

28
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,090
Change the definition of rural poverty!

29
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,250
While the average of $4 a day

30
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,880
might not sound like much,

31
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,520
it’s more than what the World Bank

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,280
defines as “extreme poverty.”

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,369
That line is set at $1.90 a day.

34
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,829
One thing China did to lift people

35
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,619
out of extreme poverty,

36
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,539
is lower the bar for what counts

37
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,960
as extreme poverty.

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,159
Instead of using the World Bank’s

39
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,259
dollar-and-ninety-cents-a-day metric,

40
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,400
China uses its own metric of just ninety cents.

41
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,539
And with just that change in definition,

42
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:25,280
the CCP has instantly lifted

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,789
tens of millions of people out of extreme
poverty!

44
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,899
Into less extreme but still really bad poverty!

45
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,869
They just...leave that second part out

46
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,509
when they gloat about poverty relief

47
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,520
in state-run media.

48
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,679
Of course, there’s still tens of millions
more

49
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,100
living on less than ninety cents per day.

50
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,750
But don’t worry.

51
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,649
Most of China isn’t in extreme poverty.

52
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,899
Most of China is just what you might call

53
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,509
pretty poor.

54
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,710
According to the Pew Research Center,

55
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,740
about 900 million Chinese people

56
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,149
live off between a dollar ninety

57
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,849
and ten dollars a day.

58
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,859
That’s two-thirds of the country

59
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,120
on less than 10 dollars a day.

60
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,259
But as the Global Times says,

61
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,759
the great and glorious CCP

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,119
is lifting people out of poverty.

63
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,180
Which by the way makes it

64
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,440
sound like the people aren't doing

65
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,570
anything themselves,

66
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,260
they're just being lifted.

67
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,450
Which is incredibly far from the truth.

68
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,120
This is all part of the CCP’s lofty aspirations

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,430
set in 2012 during the 18th National Party
Congress—

70
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,000
to create a Xiaokang society.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
A...moderately well-off society.

72
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,210
Yeah, you don’t want to set the bar too
high.

73
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,990
Moderately well-off society.

74
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,900
It’s all about setting realistic goals for
yourself.

75
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,770
It’s like making New Year's resolutions.

76
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,900
6-pack abs?!

77
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,190
Sounds like a lot of work.

78
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,650
I’ll settle for just being able to fit

79
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,210
back into my jeans.

80
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,470
Ok, my sweat pants.

81
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,550
But there’s another important way

82
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,020
the Chinese Communist Party is tackling

83
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,510
rural poverty:

84
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,520
Simply take the rural poor

85
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,070
and move them into cities.

86
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,710
By 2020,

87
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,110
the CCP wants 60% of the population

88
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,960
living in cities.

89
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,110
The CCP has set this as a top-down goal,

90
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,770
because they hope it will on one hand

91
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,160
alleviate poverty, and—

92
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,620
most importantly—

93
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,260
give people jobs so they can

94
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,490
make more money

95
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,650
and become active consumers.

96
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,270
The Chinese economy over the next decade

97
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,540
will rely more and more on domestic consumption,

98
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,010
rather than just exports.

99
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,980
That’s the only way to keep the Chinese
economy growing.

100
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,300
And a growing economy

101
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,370
is key for the CCP to stay in power.

102
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,500
So now you understand why they are very serious

103
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,550
about alleviating rural poverty.

104
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,060
So the CCP has given top-down directions

105
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,080
to local officials

106
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,090
that moving people into cities

107
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,390
is an important goal.

108
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,340
China already has 10 megacities

109
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,910
with more than 10 million urban residents.

110
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,050
The United States by comparison

111
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,640
has zero.

112
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,850
Even here in New York City

113
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,660
we have only 8-and-a-half million.

114
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,070
Unless you count commuters from New Jersey.

115
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,810
Which we don’t.

116
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,810
But in China,

117
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,890
life in the cities is better in a lot of ways.

118
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,030
You’ve got better public transportation,
for instance.

119
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,520
And more places to buy cheeseburgers.

120
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,370
Plus, the pollution makes for

121
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,830
really beautiful sunsets.

122
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,830
And in cities,

123
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,070
the average income is a whopping

124
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,319
12 dollars a day.

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,250
Take that, rural poverty!

126
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,430
Except, there are a few of problems

127
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,660
with this urbanization plan.

128
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,959
For one, as I mentioned,

129
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,370
the push to relocate people to cities

130
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,150
is a top-down government initiative.

131
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,130
It rewards local officials for meeting

132
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,160
certain migration targets,

133
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,580
but not necessarily for providing support

134
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,540
for the people once they’ve moved.

135
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,220
As one woman who moved from her village

136
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,410
to a big city told Financial Times,

137
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,900
“There’s no water there,

138
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
no jobs there,

139
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,370
nothing has been sorted out.

140
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,530
There wasn’t even water for flushing the
toilet.”

141
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,430
It turns out her government-subsidized home

142
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,000
in a town in Guizhou

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,870
was actually worse than rural poverty.

144
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,430
And she eventually moved back.

145
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,100
Plus, urban centers are more expensive,

146
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,480
and don’t have enough jobs,

147
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,400
especially for people from the countryside

148
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,300
whose job experience mainly

149
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,000
revolves around farming.

150
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,350
But that’s okay,

151
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,770
“Rural migrants mostly carried out dirty,

152
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,520
dangerous and demeaning jobs,

153
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,740
which urbanites were not willing to do.”

154
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,290
They’ll never be appreciated.

155
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,560
At least until Mike Rowe

156
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,880
does the China edition.

157
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
And even though public services

158
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,710
are better in the cities,

159
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,950
migrant workers don’t always get

160
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,140
access to them.

161
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,050
You see, China doesn’t have freedom of mobility

162
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,370
like the United States,

163
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,710
where someone from a farm in Nebraska

164
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,830
can move without any restrictions to,

165
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,030
say, Los Angeles to get a career in acting...

166
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,030
slash-bartending.

167
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,680
China has something called hukou—

168
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,250
the “household registration” system.

169
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,050
Basically it chains you to where you were
born.

170
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,600
If you have a rural hukou,

171
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,260
and you become a migrant worker in, say, Beijing,

172
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,419
you won’t be eligible to get certain jobs

173
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,020
or to send your kids to free urban public
schools

174
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,590
or receive healthcare benefits

175
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,680
that urban residents get.

176
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,919
The hukou system turns you into a sort of

177
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,830
illegal immigrant in your own country.

178
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,810
And 60% of the Chinese population has rural
hukous.

179
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,810
Many migrant workers

180
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,830
are forced to live wherever they can.

181
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,830
For example,

182
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,720
old underground bomb shelters.

183
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,110
Although, that might be turn out

184
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,470
to be a great place to live,

185
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,220
depending on how things go with North Korea.

186
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,860
There is a way to change your hukou,

187
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,240
buy you have to pay a huge fee.

188
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,900
The fee is larger and more difficult to obtain

189
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,730
for more desirable places like Beijing.

190
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,770
And keep in mind,

191
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,930
if this is a more desirable place to live,

192
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,990
you’ve got issues.

193
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,450
There are about 21 million people

194
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,120
living in Beijing.

195
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
According to Financial Times,

196
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,010
“At least 8 million of those residents

197
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,050
lack the coveted Beijing hukou.”

198
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,560
That’s a third of Beijing’s population.

199
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,490
And equivalent to the entire population

200
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,790
of New York City.

201
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,380
That’s why the central government’s urbanization
push

202
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,400
is not so popular in the nation’s capital.

203
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,210
Beijing is actually putting a cap on the population.

204
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,350
In fact, a recent essay by a Chinese blogger

205
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,550
critiquing the so-called

206
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,470
“fake lives of Beijingers,”

207
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,169
talks about migrant workers,

208
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,560
“[Striving] for over a decade

209
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,350
to get an apartment the size of a bird cage.”

210
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,360
In one night his essay got 5 million views.

211
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,430
Two days later,

212
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,430
censors had scrubbed it from the internet.

213
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,260
Presumably they hired a migrant worker

214
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,570
to do the scrubbing.

215
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,570
But wait!

216
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,950
Maybe access to better education

217
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,390
will at least help the children

218
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,390
of these rural migrants.

219
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,380
I mean, it’s got to be better

220
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,830
than that school in the Chinese countryside

221
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,700
that’s literally in a cave!

222
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,560
Well, not if you’re in Beijing.

223
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,340
The local government has been demolishing

224
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,240
migrant schools.

225
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,370
And overcrowding in cities

226
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,770
is making the major cities

227
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,100
unlivable for anyone.

228
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,230
The wealth gap is growing.

229
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,389
And real estate is getting so expensive,

230
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:46,520
many apartments sit empty.

231
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,750
Plus urban sprawl means,

232
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,020
“six-hour round-trip commutes

233
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,230
are not unknown.”

234
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,610
But I don’t want to give the impression

235
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,889
that this urbanization movement

236
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,139
is just making things worse in cities.

237
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,949
It’s also making things worse in the countryside.

238
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,210
One third of the children

239
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,970
still living in the countryside

240
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,210
are left-behind children.

241
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,400
That is, their parents are off

242
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,509
trying to make a better life in the cities,

243
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,090
and we know how well that’s going.

244
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,100
And now, those children might not even

245
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,530
get the benefit of cave schools!

246
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,979
Three quarters of rural schools

247
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,090
are being shut down.

248
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,340
And “Fewer than 10% of rural students

249
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,090
make it [to senior high school].”

250
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,160
But don’t worry,

251
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,290
it’s not like they don’t have anything
going for them.

252
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,680
Some are being trained as cage fighters.

253
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,860
So to sum up, the Chinese Communist Party

254
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,330
wants people to move to cities.

255
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,490
On one hand this is to alleviate poverty.

256
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,490
But more importantly

257
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,020
it’s to turn more Chinese citizens

258
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,610
into consumers.

259
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,899
Unfortunately, the top-down directive

260
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,560
is putting rural migrants into crummy situations

261
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,460
where they lack basic services

262
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,360
and find it hard to get good jobs.

263
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,710
You know, life in that cave school

264
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,670
is sounding pretty good.

265
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,660
So what do you think of China’s urbanization
plans?
