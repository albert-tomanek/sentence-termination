00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,740
Hey, Veritasium! Michael [Stevens] from Vsauce here, and we're gonna ask some important questions.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,260
Let's find some random bystanders...how about you?

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,480
Yes?

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,380
Michael: I don't believe you're scientifically literate.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,880
Okay.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,480
Michael: If a tomato is a fruit, does that mean ketchup is a smoothie?

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,940
John Green: So, can you name any of the cities in the Indus Valley civilization?

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,600
Are we talking about, like, Cairo?

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,060
John: (scoffs) Yeah, Cairo would not qualify as one of the cities in the Indus Valley civilisation.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,640
John: Cairo!...Cairo!

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,200
This is Brady Haran from Periodic Videos,

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,560
and Sixty Symbols,

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,960
and bibledex,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,700
and DeepSkyVideos,

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,020
and Numberphile,

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,540
and nottinghamscience,

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,480
and foodskey, and--

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,200
Alright, and I'm Derek from Veritasium.
and foodskey, and--

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,640
Alright, and I'm Derek from Veritasium.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,700
Brady: Wait, you only got one channel?

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,380
I know!

22
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,580
Brady: You call yourself a Youtuber?

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Vi Hart, uh, you want to ask me a question?

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,320
Vi: Triangle.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Um, that's not a question?

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,480
Vi: Triangle.

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,300
(laughs awkwardly)
Uh...ah-um...

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,560
John: In what year did the French Revolution began?

29
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,680
17...72?

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,980
John: You had the--the first two numbers were awesome!
(Derek chuckles)

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,980
Brady: We have a Veritasium exclusive right now.

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:24,120
We're gonna show you the first, unauthorized picture of CGP Grey, who's standing here right next to me.

33
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,120
Here's a question for--oh.

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,120
Hang on.

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,300
He was here a minute ago.

36
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,480
Henry Reich: Okay, so what I was thinking I might have you, uh, try to calculate here is some Feynman diagrams in curved spacetime.

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,460
But to start off with something a bit easier, uh, I think we should start off with the Christoffel symbol for the Schwartzchild metric.

38
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,380
Um, and in case you've forgotten I've written it, I've even written the metric here--

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,460
Derek: No, I know it--I know what it is. I don't need you to show me.
Henry: Okay.

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,040
Derek: No, I know it--I know what it is. I don't need you to show me.
Henry: So like--

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,540
Derek: No, I know it--I know what it is. I don't need you to show me.
Henry: I know.

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,680
Henry: You have something on your face.

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,820
Vi: Triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
Vi: Triangle, triangle, triangle...

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,800
I am actually quite concerned about what you're doing to my face.

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,120
Vi: (laughs) TRIANGLE!
I am actually quite concerned about what you're doing to my face.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,140
Right, so this is CGP Grey and Veritasium at the BrainSTEM Conference here in Canada and it's been a great couple of days.

48
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,200
You gonna come visit me Derek?

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
Definitely! I've always wanted to visit Great Britain.

50
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,360
(CGP Grey sighs)

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,500
I mean...the United Kingdom?

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,840
England?

53
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,740
Derek: The British Isles?
CGP Grey: Great.

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,620
CGP Grey: Great, yeah. I look forward to it.

55
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,140
Going through U.S. customs in, like, an hour.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,340
(Vi laughs)

57
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,460
I was expecting, like, 𝘢 triangle, but this is feeling like lots of triangles.

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,820
Vi: Well, they--they're happier in groups.

59
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,500
Right.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,280
Vi: Like, they're like sheep. They get sad and lonely by themselves.

61
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,880
Destin Sandlin: So, we're in the Corolla. I don't--I just met these guys.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,800
Henry: Look, look, there's like the Mennonite farms out there.

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,920
If this car crashes right now, like, all of science on YouTube is going down.

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,160
(everyone laughs)
