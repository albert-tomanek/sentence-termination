1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,080
[Applause]

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,500
Now —

3
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,260
No one saw that movie.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,160
Not only did I not know this was happening,

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,620
they changed their shirts in the time between
me opening that door and me on stage,

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,120
so I don't know how the hell that happened...

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,280
...but well done.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,760
[Applause]

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
And I must say that you're a very lucky audience
that you didn't see my gutty midriff then.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,680
[Laughter and a whoop from the audience]

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,940
And you may yet.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,320
Gutty Midriff sounds like the name of a burlesque star.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,400
[Laughter]

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,140
From Rotherham.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Funny you should say that...

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,740
GARY: That's my mother!

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,200
Ooh, now you're...

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,560
CHRIS and GARY: Ooooh!

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,260
Can I also give a quick shout out to the people
who brought their own TechDif merchandise?

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,740
MATT and GARY: What?!

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,120
TOM: There's five people in a row there with —

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,420
TOM: Seven... There's a lot of people
with different slogans on the T-shirts there.

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,100
GARY: That's fine. I'm cool with that.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
TOM: Which is just... that's...!

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,060
We should get a photo afterwards.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,000
We ought.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,840
Yes. Yes.
Right.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,760
Are we ready for the second show, gentlemen?

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,780
GARY: [Laughs]
MATT: Never.

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,620
Have to be.

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,380
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Matt, the door's open.

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,040
[Laughter]

33
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,340
GARY: [Hums theme from 'Chariots of Fire']

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,740
What I love about that shout is not just:
thank you, the door was open...

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,840
but also the fact that you called on Matt,
who is furthest away from the door...

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,660
[Laughter]

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,040
...to get the door.

38
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,940
Um... all right.

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,960
He's the only one with the professional
door-closing certificate, though.

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,160
Oh, that's true, actually. I'm not licensed for that.

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,480
We'd best open it again.

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,220
GARY: Union rules. We're all dead.

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,620
All right. Is everybody ready?

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,760
[Non-committal muttering]

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
Then, as we go into recording the second show,

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,580
can we have a big round of
applause as the show begins?

47
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,080
[Applause]
