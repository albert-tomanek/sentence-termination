00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,880
The First US China Meeting

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,960
Becomes a Propaganda Battlefield

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600
No use crying over spilt ramen

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,080
Last week, the Biden Administration\h
had its first high level talks\h\h

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
with the Chinese Communist Party.\h

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,520
They did not go well.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,840
A four-minute photo shoot “ended up lasting one\h
hour and 15 minutes due to a frothy exchange.”

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,160
Frothy—good in a cappuccino,\h
bad in diplomatic talks.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,600
We did a full rundown of the meeting on America\h
Uncovered. I’ll put a link to that episode below.\h

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,040
But now that it’s over, the Chinese\h
Communist Party is using the meeting\h\h

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,960
to attack the US. I know, surprised Pikachu face.\h

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
The Editor-in-Chief of my favorite\h
state-run media, the Global Times,\h\h

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
tweeted this gif of the meeting. Which\h
I can’t say is entirely inaccurate.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,840
And this China Daily reporter\h
compared the meeting to a treaty\h\h

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,320
Western powers forced the Qing Dynasty to\h
sign in 1901. That’s a bit less accurate.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,920
That 1901 meeting forced China to pay\h
for the costs of the Boxer Rebellion.\h\h

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,920
The treaty is considered part of China’s\h
century of humiliation, one of the Communist\h\h

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
Party’s favorite propaganda lines—the idea\h
that foreign powers try to humiliate China.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,280
That’s why Global Times has been running with\h
the line that the US is pushing white supremacy.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,760
Ahead of the meeting, National\h
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\h\h

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,560
said they would talk to China\h
from a position of strength.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,080
So state-run media is framing\h
that as the same thing as the 1901\h\h

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,560
Qing Dynasty treaty. As if the\h
US is trying to bully China.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
When the truth is, the Chinese\h
Communist Party is committing genocide,\h\h

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,720
and it’s been waging a war\h
against the US for decades.\h

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,040
I talked about that in this episode\h
about who started the New Cold War.\h

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,040
But perhaps the Chinese Communist\h
Party’s biggest propaganda win\h\h

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,000
from the meeting, involves instant noodles.\h

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,920
See, if you’re the Chinese Communist Party, you\h
spin anything into propaganda. It’s what you do.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
And the US China meeting was\h
full of opportunities for that.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,240
In particular, this moment, when 70-year\h
old Chinese Communist Party official Yang\h\h

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:36,160
Jiechi told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang\h
Yi that he had instant noodles for lunch.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,920
It went viral in China. “The topic was discussed\h
on Weibo [which is Chinese social media]\h\h

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
in multiple threads and under the\h
hashtags ‘Yang Jiechi Had Instant\h\h

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
Noodles for Lunch’ and ‘The Instant\h
Noodles Yang Jiechi Had for Lunch’.\h\h

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,280
The latter received 270 million\h
views on Weibo by Sunday evening.”

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,240
The “Yang Jiechi Had Instant Noodles for\h
Lunch” hashtag was started by Communist\h\h

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,320
Party mouthpiece the People’s Daily. And since\h
the original video was pushed by state-run CGTN\h\h

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,200
you know the Chinese Communist Party wants\h
Noodle Gate to be on everyone’s mind.

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,960
What’s the big deal about Yang\h
Jiechi eating instant noodles?

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
Because it’s supposedly a sign\h
of US disrespect for China.\h\h

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,400
Instead of hosting a banquet\h
to honor top Chinese officials,\h\h

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
poor 70-year old Yang Jiechi was forced\h
to choke down some instant noodles.

45
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,280
According to an Associate Professor\h
of Contemporary Chinese Studies\h\h

46
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
at University of Nottingham, “It\h
fits the narrative that the US\h\h

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,440
is inhospitable & disrespectful, incapable of\h
treating China as a power of equal standing.”

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That was the theme on Weibo as well. According\h
to the blog What’s on Weibo some netizens wrote,\h\h

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
“The American etiquette is unsatisfactory.”

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
“Let’s not pay attention to food,\h
they completely lack etiquette.”\h

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,080
“Jeez, these Americans don’t\h
even care about food.”\h

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
“It’s extremely insulting.”\h

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,160
“This is a superpower, their\h
strategy is despicable,\h\h

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,680
to send our diplomatic staff\h
off with a bucket of noodles!”\h

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,400
So was the Biden Administration really being\h
disrespectful of the Chinese delegation?

56
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,760
Well, according to George Washington\h
University Law Professor Donald Clarke,\h\h

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,000
there was no big joint banquet because of Covid\h
safety concerns. And China had agreed to that.

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,040
So why did Yang Jiechi choose to eat instant\h
noodles instead of getting a proper meal\h\h

59
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
from the hotel? Well, one reason might be\h
that Yang was expressing how hardworking\h\h

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
he was. He takes his job so seriously, he doesn’t\h
even take time to eat more than instant noodles.

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,880
Or maybe it was planned so that the “instant\h
noodles” comment could be overheard by Chinese\h\h

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,920
state-run media. Which could then run with\h
that and talk about how awful the US is.

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,600
Yes, the US is so awful...that Yang Jiechi sent\h
his daughter to Connecticut to attend Yale.

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,200
But maybe I’m being unfair to Yang Jiechi. Maybe\h
he just really likes instant noodles. After all,\h\h

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,800
instant noodles are a really popular\h
food for Chinese traveling abroad.\h\h

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
In fact, Chinese leader Xi Jinping\h
actually told Chinese tourists\h\h

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
to stop eating so many instant noodles,\h
because it was making China look bad.

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,320
So maybe the real Noodle Gate is the fact that\h
Yang Jiechi didn’t listen to Xi Jinping. Uh oh.\h

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,320
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,280
fans who support China Uncensored on\h
the crowd funding website Patreon.

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,960
Audun Johansen asks, “Hey, Chris.\h\h

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,680
Why is the US not giving Taiwan\h
nukes? For deterrence of course.”

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,280
Well that’s a very interesting question. Most\h
people don’t know this, but during the Cold War,\h\h

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,960
the US actually did deploy nuclear weapons\h
on Taiwan. It was part of the United States\h\h

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,160
Taiwan Defense Command. But in 1972,\h
the US President ordered their removal.

76
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,200
The timing is significant because that was\h
around the time the world gradually began\h\h

77
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,120
to recognize the People’s Republic of China\h
as China, while Taiwan was given the shaft.\h\h

78
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,960
Taiwan even lost its seat on the UN Security\h
Council when it was given to the PRC.\h

79
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,480
Now certainly, if Taiwan had nukes, that might\h
be a big deterrent to a Chinese invasion,\h\h

80
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,000
but it’s always been controversial. It would\h
be a big escalation for the US to give Taiwan\h\h

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,840
nukes. And so far no US administration has wanted\h
to irk the Chinese Communist Party that much.\h\h

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,920
But even inside Taiwan, it's controversial. And\h
not just nuclear weapons—even nuclear power.

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,440
“There is already a huge movement against\h
the use of nuclear power in Taiwan.\h\h

84
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,320
Indeed, until the recent round of referendums,\h
the DPP government was committed to shutting down\h\h

85
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,000
all of Taiwan’s nuclear power stations by 2025.”

86
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,800
Hope that answers your question Audun.

87
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
