1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,930
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,060
we are so close to war.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,870
Or not close at all.

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,320
Between aggressive threats and calls for peace,

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,200
it seems Chinese media can’t make up their
mind.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,079
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,429
You know, I admit,

8
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,989
I’ve been a bit worried about a war starting

9
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,929
over tensions in the South China Sea.

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,949
Mainly based on statements from Chinese state-run
media like,

11
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,750
“a US-China war is inevitable in the South
China Sea.”

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,620
Well, it’s easy to misinterpret that.

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,570
Sure, it seems like the Chinese language Global
Times

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,110
is in some way suggesting war between the
US and China

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,120
is inevitable in the South China Sea.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,490
But that was a year ago.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,490
Now, according to this more recent editorial

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,829
in the English language Global Times,

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,280
that simply isn’t the case.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,480
“China is a peace-loving country

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,790
and deals with foreign relations with discretion,”

22
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,660
and “hopes disputes can be resolved by talks.”

23
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,979
Whew, you could build an entire island on
my South China Sea relief.

24
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:11,640
I’m especially glad to hear about that,

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,590
“being willing to resolve things by talks”
bit.

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,819
Because next week,

27
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:20,289
a UN-backed tribunal in the Hague will be
doing just that!

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,990
It will rule on a territorial dispute between
China and the Philippines

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,079
over disputed territorial waters.

30
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,829
It’s great that China is so open to resolving
things by talks!

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,539
"China does not accept any dispute resolution
from a third party

32
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,219
and does not accept any dispute resolution
forced on China."

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,300
Oh, funny that, I guess the Chinese regime
isn’t really open to talks.

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,889
But China still only wants peace in the South
China Sea, right?

35
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:55,740
I guess I’m just getting a little confused,

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,049
since that English Global Times article says,

37
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,079
“China is a peace-loving country,”

38
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,889
but then later,

39
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,630
“China should speed up building its military
capabilities,”

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,330
and “let the US pay a cost it cannot stand

41
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,610
if it intervenes in the South China Sea.”

42
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,210
That sounds like a threat to me.

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,930
Now, you might be thinking,

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,040
“Yeah? Them and what army?”

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,930
This one.

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,710
China has started military exercises today
which will run until July 11…

47
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,030
vessels will be prohibited from the area.“

48
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,100
Yup, China’s People’s Liberation Army

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,350
has just cordoned off a huge chunk of the
South China Sea.

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,070
"The military drills are the Chinese navy's
routine drills

51
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,790
according to its annual plan."

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,960
Right. Those drills are “routine.”

53
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,360
Even though the Global Times

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,010
specifically wrote just a few days ago

55
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,800
that the drills are being held as a result
of the international arbitration case.

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,490
Next Tuesday, the Hague will issue its ruling

57
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,990
and it’s widely expected to rule in favor
of the Philippines.

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,760
So not only are this week’s drills happening

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,960
in disputed territorial waters which Vietnam
claims,

60
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,910
they’re also happening right next

61
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,350
to some of the busiest shipping lanes in the
South China Sea.

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,400
This is of course just the latest

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,930
in the very long saga of the South China Sea
territorial disputes.

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,000
China militarizes the region by, say, building
artificial islands.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,270
“China, in addition to building those islands,

66
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,320
is now militarizing them,

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,430
basing military aircraft, military warships
and missile systems

68
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,350
on those manufactured reefs.”

69
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,210
The United States then says,

70
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,040
no, those are international waters and international
airspace.

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,120
Then sends its military in to prove it.

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,540
Then Chinese state-run media criticizes the
US for militarizing the region.

73
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,260
China has criticized the militarization of
the region

74
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,020
by the US denouncing the show of strength
as miscalculated.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,480
Internet flame wars ensue.

76
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,240
Then I make an episode about it,

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,870
resulting in more internet flame wars.

78
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,400
It’s like a merry-go-round!

79
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,300
That’s on fire.

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,420
And it’s going way too fast to get off anymore.

81
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,030
Because all it takes is one little accident

82
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,580
for this whole thing to spiral out of everyone’s
control.

83
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,220
Think that will never happen?

84
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,139
July 1st, the 95th anniversary of the founding
of the Chinese Communist Party:

85
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:26,410
A Taiwanese patrol ship is doing training
drills

86
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,470
and accidentally fires a supersonic missile
in the direction of mainland China.

87
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,090
It hits another ship, killing the captain.

88
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,570
Now, it just so happens that ship was Taiwanese.

89
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,020
But imagine what would be happening right
now

90
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,600
if that freak accident

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,210
had hit a mainland Chinese boat and killed
a mainland Chinese captain.

92
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,380
We might be working towards a final answer

93
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,000
to that “One China Policy” question a
lot sooner than anyone anticipated.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,510
So as we approach the ruling by the Hague,

95
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,720
with tensions so high,

96
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,780
what do you think will happen next?

97
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,660
And what should be done?

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,040
Leave your comments below.

99
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,100
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

100
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,820
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

101
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,320
