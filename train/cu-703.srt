1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,520
well as you say it is very striking that just as\h
we talked earlier about the fact that uh in the us\h\h

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,400
the uk even some european countries uh australia\h
uh and others um there is this rethinking\h\h

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,880
going on and to varying degrees uh um at the same\h
time the vatican seems to have gone in precisely\h\h

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,320
the opposite direction at a time when we're\h
seeing the worst what many would say is the is\h\h

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,520
the most severe crackdown on human rights uh in in\h
general in china um since the tiananmen massacre\h\h

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,680
and probably the most severe crackdown on religion\h
uh since the cultural revolution i mean when the\h\h

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,880
vatican china agreement was was first\h
reached two years ago and it was\h\h

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,960
made as a provisional agreement for two years i\h
was critical of it at the time but i i at least\h\h

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,960
was willing to give uh the pope and the vatican\h
the benefit of the doubt i i didn't doubt that\h\h

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,560
that their motives were uh to um better protect\h
uh the freedoms of at least catholics and ideally\h\h

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
religious freedom more broadly and so i thought\h
although i was skeptical that this agreement would\h\h

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
in any way achieve that i i thought well let's see\h
what happens in the two years that it's in place\h\h

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,320
um my concern now with the renewal or at least the\h
likely renewal i think it technically it's it will\h\h

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,080
be renewed um uh shortly i know the vatican\h
has told beijing they want to renew it and\h\h

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,560
um strangely given that beijing's got everything\h
they want out of it um uh they my understanding\h\h

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,080
is beijing hasn't yet responded but let's assume\h
it is renewed which i think is a fair assumption\h\h

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,920
um firstly the text of the agreement is still two\h
years on a secret text we we know that it relates\h\h

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,840
to the appointment of bishops but the actual\h
detail of the agreement remains a confidential\h\h

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,200
text even cardinal zen who is basically the only\h
chinese cardinal um who's free to speak his mind\h\h

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:20,240
uh just about um uh he has has not seen the uh\h
text um so if it's such a good deal why can't\h\h

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,160
we all know about it why is it secret yeah the\h
vatican would keep secrets i mean unheard of\h\h

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,040
well well that's true that's true but but\h
generally these kind of agreements don't\h\h

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,400
shouldn't be secret unless there's really\h
something to hide so um but but also it has\h\h

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,640
clearly not achieved assuming the goal behind it\h
was to better protect uh catholics the situation\h\h

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,840
for catholics has worsened uh no catholic priest\h
that was in jail before the agreement was reached\h\h

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,160
has been released to my knowledge and quite a few\h
have been arrested or disappeared since then so\h\h

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,320
it hasn't led to any improvement we've seen um\h
not only what's happened in hong kong but also\h\h

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,280
what many would say uh may well be a genocide\h
uh facing the weakers um and this agreement\h\h

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,000
seems to have brought the pope silence we haven't\h
heard him say anything not even a prayer for hong\h\h

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,200
kong for christians in china uh for the uyghurs\h
uh for for any of these issues so it's uh\h\h

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,880
i mean i've written quite a lot about it\h
and um i'm probably not the vatican's i've\h\h

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,640
never been the ccp's favorite person but\h
i'm probably not the vatican's either now\h\h

33
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,800
um but it's it makes no sense to me uh the ccp\h
gets everything they want out of it in terms of\h\h

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:59,840
uh control and dominance and i don't see what\h
the vatican or the catholic church gains at all

35
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:03,520
you
