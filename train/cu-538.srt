1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,200
China has a plan for world domination

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,920
But that plan requires oil

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,440
And China has been getting some of it from Sudan

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,280
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,040
China is colonizing Africa, with\h
trade, aid and debt trap diplomacy.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
And this bad news, not just\h
for the people of Africa,

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
but for Europe and the United States as well.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,120
In many cases, these are brutal dictatorships the\h
Chinese Communist Party is supporting. It’s part\h\h

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,480
of what China calls the Belt and Road Initiative.\h
That’s a trillion dollar investment plan that\h\h

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,840
traps developing countries in debt, essentially\h
turning them into slaves of the Chinese regime.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
But the Belt and Road needs oil to chug along.\h\h

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,040
And for many years, that oil\h
has been coming from Sudan.\h

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,080
Sudan is making some democratic\h
reforms now, but it still isn’t exactly\h\h

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,280
a free country. For decades it was ruled\h
by an Islamist regime under Omar al-Bashir.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,920
In 2018, a nonviolent revolution began. And by\h
2019 it had managed to oust Bashir. One of the men\h\h

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,320
at the forefront of the revolution is Mohamed Nagi\h
Alassam, a 28 year old Sudanese medical doctor.\h\h

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,200
He led the longest doctors strikes in history.\h
He joins me today via Skype from Sudan to talk\h\h

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,160
about China’s influence in the changing Sudan\h
and the impact it has on the rest of the world.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,240
Thanks for joining me, Mohamed. So you were\h
at the forefront of a revolution to cast off\h\h

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,080
decades of Islamic dictatorship in Sudan. That\h
was a regime that received a lot of financial\h\h

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,240
and military support from China. How do people in\h
Sudan feel about the Chinese Communist Party now?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,320
Yeah. So the Chinese government has lent a very\h
helpful hand to the previous regime after the\h\h

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,760
sanctions put by the US, and after Sudan was put\h
in the terrorist list of countries supporting\h\h

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,880
terrorism. The only hand given to the previous\h
regime government was mainly from China. So they\h\h

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,840
would somehow bypass those sanctions, and had\h
given the previous regime a huge amount of loans\h\h

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,280
and support, even armed weapons\h
and all that kind of support. Yeah.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
And how did that influence Sudan?

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,840
So the previous regime just, especially\h
in the last 10 years or so from its life,\h\h

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:51,040
they just went on for anything they could have\h
help from. And they were on survival mode,\h\h

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,760
and that has actually impacted the Sudanese\h
economy in large. So now Sudan has $60 billion\h\h

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:08,480
plus million dollars, and that's largely due\h
to the previous regime’s actions that just\h\h

32
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,960
took money from anyone around the world just for\h
survival. And now we are really, really very,\h\h

33
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,720
very impacted by these loans, and by this\h
economic crisis that we are still living.

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
Are there Chinese companies, like\h
Huawei, that have a big presence there?

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,720
Yes, actually Huawei is the main telecommunication\h
company that is controlling the market here,\h\h

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:45,040
especially that they have no rivals in the market.\h
We have large networks in the market, and with\h\h

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:54,800
Huawei being there controlling the market mainly,\h
without any opposing other networks or companies.

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,160
Well, do you think Chinese investment\h
has benefited the people of Sudan?

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,360
I think it mainly helped\h
the previous regime survive\h\h

40
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,640
by giving them loans. And now we have to repay\h
those loans. We, all the time, during the days of\h\h

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,040
the previous regime, we would hear that they have\h
given the government so-and-so million dollars,\h\h

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,640
so-and-so billion dollars. But it's hardly\h
seen in the daily lives of the Sudanese people.

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,560
They had projects that they have helped establish,\h
like the Merowe Dam, which was a hydraulic\h\h

44
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:40,160
dam that generates power in Sudan. Yes, it\h
helped. But still, with the loans not paid yet,\h\h

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,200
we know now for sure that China has\h
two billion plus dollars in debts\h\h

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,400
for Sudan. This is the numbers that at least\h
I know, but we are not yet very sure about\h\h

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,680
how deeply they are rooted in the\h
Sudanese economy and their interest.

48
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Of course, China has its Belt and Road\h
Initiative, and the Red Sea is a major part of\h\h

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,560
that initiative. And their main interest in Sudan\h
is definitely economic interest, nothing other\h\h

50
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,600
than that. So we believe now after the change\h
has happened in Sudan, after the revolution,\h\h

51
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,760
that they may want Sudan to be stable, because\h
of that economic interest they have in Sudan,\h\h

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,040
and generally in Africa, of course. So for\h
us, we want it to be that way. We don't mind\h\h

53
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:39,840
them having an economic interest in Sudan, but\h
not without the benefit of the Sudanese people. We\h\h

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:49,200
don't want their bargains that would only benefit\h
China, and not benefiting the Sudanese people.

55
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
Did the investment create\h
jobs for the Sudanese people?

56
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
Another sector that China has\h
invested a lot in in Sudan is the\h\h

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,920
oil sector of course, especially\h
before the separation of South Sudan,\h\h

58
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,720
after the referendum of 2011. Those years\h
were definitely benefiting Sudanese people,\h\h

59
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,680
created a lot of jobs, as I said before,\h
especially with the sanctions put by the US.

60
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:24,640
China and India dominated the oil sector for years\h
until 2011. But of course, after 2011, the economy\h\h

61
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:32,320
itself has somehow reached a downfall because\h
Sudan lost its main revenue producing sector,\h\h

62
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,040
which was oil, before the separation of South\h
Sudan, that now has the majority of oil fields.

63
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,760
Well when South Sudan became\h
independent in 2011, how did that\h\h

64
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,840
affect Chinese investment in\h
Sudan, and then South Sudan?

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:58,640
Yeah. That was seen to have a huge effect on\h
even the Sudan-Chinese relationships after the\h\h

66
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,880
independence of South Sudan. The influence of\h
China has largely decreased in Sudan, because\h\h

67
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:15,680
they were the main importer of the Sudanese oil.\h
They were investing in the fields themselves,\h\h

68
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,000
and importing the oils from Sudan. So after\h
that, even the economic relationships between\h\h

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,960
Sudan and China decreased by and large after\h
the independence of South Sudan. And they are\h\h

70
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,720
mainly focused now in South Sudan, as investors.

71
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Is that affecting the relationship\h
between Sudan and South Sudan?

72
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,560
Yes. And in the years before the revolution,\h
it had a lot of tensions. A lot of tensions\h\h

73
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,800
happened between Sudan and South Sudan over the\h
issues of oil fields we have. Sudan has the pipes\h\h

74
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,200
that connects the production sites\h
to the Red Sea for all the exports.\h\h

75
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,120
And that has somehow issued a lot of\h
tensions between Sudan and South Sudan,\h\h

76
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,480
related to the prices of the\h
transport of this oil, and the prices\h\h

77
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,840
demanded by Sudan for their part and all of that.\h
And it has created a lot of tensions indeed.

78
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,240
So how has the Chinese regime dealt with the\h
fall of Sudan's dictator, Omar al-Bashir?

79
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah, they were given huge support for the\h
previous regime, and ironically, Sudan was ruled\h\h

80
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:44,880
by an Islamist regime that regarded the Communist\h
Parties or the Communist ideology in general as\h\h

81
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,600
forbidden. And the Communist Party, even in\h
Sudan, was forbidden from practicing politics.\h\h

82
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,800
But they had a very good relationship with\h
the Chinese Communist Party, even they had\h\h

83
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,880
direct meetings between the NCP, which is the\h
Islamist Party, which ruled Sudan for 30 years,\h\h

84
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,080
directly with the Chinese Communist\h
Party. And this is very ironic, actually.

85
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah. I'm curious. Since the Chinese Communist\h
Party is officially atheist, and has persecuted\h\h

86
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
Muslims in China, it seems strange that\h\h

87
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,840
an Islamist regime would be\h
allied with the Communist Party.

88
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,760
Yeah. I think it's just economic\h
interest. And it really shows how the\h\h

89
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,440
regime in Sudan, the ideology that they\h
used as Islamist was just fraught ideology.\h\h

90
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,080
They didn't even believe in what they\h
were saying or doing. So it was just\h\h

91
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,200
to buy their politics and their agendas to the\h
common Sudanese citizen. But in fact they had\h\h

92
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,840
a very good relationship with China and with the\h
Chinese Communist Party, although even in Sudan,\h\h

93
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,640
the Chinese Communist Party was forbidden\h
from practicing politics during their days.

94
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,080
I know Sudan has been called China's foothold\h
in Africa. What's China's goal in Africa?

95
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:20,560
I think Africa in general... It is now, and it\h
will increase in the coming days. It will be\h\h

96
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,920
the continent that the large powers in the world\h
will compete against each other on their influence\h\h

97
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:38,400
in general. And it's mainly economic interest\h
for these great powers. Russia, China, and\h\h

98
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,000
slightly the US has a greater influence in\h\h

99
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,040
Africa now, and this competition will\h
increase definitely in the coming days.

100
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Of course, China has its project, the Belt and\h
Road Initiative, that Africa is a huge part of,\h\h

101
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,920
and they want to make sure that this project\h
will have its foothold in Africa. And Sudan\h\h

102
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,720
is the connection between the Middle East, between\h
Asia, between the Arab world and Africa, and it's\h\h

103
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,240
strategic for any nation that wants to have an\h
influence and a foothold in Africa in general.

104
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,040
I know the Chinese regime\h
typically offers support to\h\h

105
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,640
questionable regimes that other countries don't\h
want to do business with, especially in Africa.\h\h

106
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
Does that make it harder for\h
these countries to reform?

107
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:44,800
Yes, definitely. The dictatorships, in general,\h
which are still in Africa, they want these sort of\h\h

108
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,360
just direct economic relationships without regard\h
to human rights or democracy, or citizen rights\h\h

109
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,800
or whatsoever. And China is one of the nations\h
in the world that provides that to dictatorships\h\h

110
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,040
in general. And that's why it still has a\h
very good relations with many African nations\h\h

111
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:12,160
that has dictatorships in them, and indeed,\h
they have supported the previous regime largely.

112
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:21,120
But on another hand, also the West or the West\h
nations, the nations that call for democracy and\h\h

113
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,120
human rights in the world, they have also\h
responsibility, and they are also part of\h\h

114
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,600
this Chinese increasing influence of China in\h
general, because they do not show the support\h\h

115
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:44,960
needed for the democratic nations in this desert\h
of dictatorships. And they also do not show the\h\h

116
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:52,880
support needed for the pro democracy movements\h
in general in Africa. And that gives a lot of\h\h

117
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,960
your chance for China and for other nations like\h
China, who just wants economic interest without\h\h

118
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,840
any regard to human rights, to increase their\h
influence and to strengthen their relationships.

119
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,880
So in 2017, the Trump administration lifted\h
almost two decades of sanctions on Sudan.\h\h

120
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
Has that made the US a competing power in Sudan?

121
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,200
The sanctions on Sudan are still there. Sudan\h
is still, even after more than a year after\h\h

122
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:31,440
its revolution and after transitional authority\h
was established, and after embracing the human\h\h

123
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,120
rights values, and working very hard to establish\h
a sustainable democracy in Sudan, Sudan is still\h\h

124
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,560
in the State-Sponsor of Terrorism list, and that\h
is affecting hardly the situation in Sudan. It\h\h

125
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,720
is hardly affecting the democratic transition in\h
Sudan. And it's preventing any chance, actually,\h\h

126
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:01,440
of economic reforms or economic makeup of\h
the very largely fallen economy in Sudan.

127
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,960
So that is the example that I\h
was telling you before that.\h\h

128
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,840
This lack of direct engagement\h
with democracies, or even\h\h

129
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,120
countries pulling through transition to democracy,\h
and that lack of support, actually hinders any\h\h

130
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,240
hope of democratic transition, and in Africa in\h
general, which is still full of dictatorships,\h\h

131
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,640
and also gives a larger chance for China and\h
other nations to engage with these countries, and\h\h

132
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,200
because they don't have any restrictions dealing\h
with whatsoever authority or whatsoever regime.

133
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,200
So what will it mean for the\h
rest of the world if China\h\h

134
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,320
continues to gain power and influence over Africa?

135
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,600
I think, for us, at least for Africa, for\h
African nations, I think we still do not see\h\h

136
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:07,440
the risk of the Chinese influence, or actually\h
the risk of any larger influence of any country\h\h

137
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:17,680
whatsoever on our continent. And I believe we\h
are entering a new era of colonization, if I may\h\h

138
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:26,000
say. By economic means, through loans and through\h
huge amount of debts, and African nations are\h\h

139
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,840
now struggling through that. That can hinder any\h
process of improvement in any nation whatsoever.

140
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,840
But again, I think we, as Africans, we\h
do not see that yet very clearly, because\h\h

141
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,600
the very bad situations we are\h
living in, economic situations,\h\h

142
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,240
do not allow us to see that. So\h
we still deal economically with\h\h

143
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,720
any country, any nation, that can lend a hand\h
of help, because we are in this deep crisis.

144
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,560
Well, great. Thank you so\h
much for joining me today.

145
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
Thank you. Thank you for having me. Thank you.

146
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
Thanks for watching. And a special\h
thank you to the Oslo Freedom Forum\h\h

147
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
for helping arrange this interview.\h

148
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,880
Every year, the Oslo Freedom Forum hosts\h
an event where activists from around the\h\h

149
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,000
world—like Mohamed Nagi Alassam—talk about\h
standing up to authoritarian regimes.

150
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:35,840
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell. See you next time.
