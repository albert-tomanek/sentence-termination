1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
China’s new missile is locked on to the
US

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,589
And could carry a nuclear warhead

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,040
As US-China Trade talks resume.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,560
This is China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560

episode.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,380
The People’s Liberation Army has just test-fired

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,080
a powerful new missile that can hit the US!

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,640
...territory of Guam.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640


14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
That’s still a big deal.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,480
The missiles can fly 3400 miles

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,880
and carry nuclear or conventional warheads.

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,220
Not that the Chinese Communist Party would
ever actually attack Guam.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,560
Mostly because it would be a tragedy

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,540
to destroy the last place on Earth where everyone
still loves Kmart.

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,680
But also because the Communist Party’s military
development

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,070
is only for peaceful purposes to defend its
sacred territorial integrity.

22
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,770
It’s just a coincidence the missile,

23
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,960
the DF-26

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,270
has also been dubbed “Guam Killer.”

25
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,600
It’s also a coincidence that Chinese state-run
media

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,360
released footage of the missile tests

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,930
shortly after the United States has been

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,299
sending in warships through the South China
Sea.

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,060
That’s part of freedom of navigation exercises

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,119
that challenge the Chinese regime’s perfectly
reasonable

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,619
territorial claims in the area.

32
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,690
Those territorial claims being all of the
area.

33
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,890
And at the start of the year,

34
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,820
the PLA put the new DF-26 in position

35
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,249
that could theoretically sink US warships
in those waters.

36
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,439
But CNN had the audacity

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,539
to question whether or not those missiles

38
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:35,100
could actually hit anything.

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,210
Now this missile has never actually been used
in combat

40
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,929
so we don't know it's true capabilities.

41
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,319
Well China may have built a missile,

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,850
but it’s CNN that’s throwing bombs!

43
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,069
So the Chinese state-run media apparatus

44
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:52,509
got underway to prove that CNN is just fake
news.

45
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,319
CCTV released this epic, stylish propaganda
video

46
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,359
showing that the DF-26 Guam Killer totally
works.

47
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,439
And my Shazam is telling me

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,430
that music is from the first Transformers
movie.

49
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,009
Now sure, the video doesn’t actually show

50
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,060
whether the missile can hit a moving target.

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,870
Or, really if it can hit anything.

52
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,350
Really, for all we know this is a standard
ballistic missile launch.

53
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,970
But I mean, when would Chinese state-run media
ever lie to us?

54
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,530
The Global Times even made a point of calling
out CNN’s fake news.

55
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,560
And tweeted the video at them.

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,620
CNN is going to need some ice for that burn.

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,650
Trade talks between the US and China have
resumed.

58
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,680
The two countries are in the middle

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,910
of a 90-day reprieve in the trade war,

60
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,620
where there’s a shot at working things out.

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,280
If no agreement is made, on March second,

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,780
the Trump administration will hit China

63
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,250
with an additional 25% tariff

64
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,640
on 200 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods.

65
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,120
So how are the talks going?

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,230
According to CNBC,

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,350
“People familiar with the talks and trade
experts watching them

68
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,320
say that, so far, there has been little indication

69
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,400
that Chinese officials are willing to address

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,950
core U.S. demands to protect American intellectual
property rights

71
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,200
and end policies that Washington says

72
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,610
force U.S. companies to transfer technology
to Chinese firms.”

73
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,910
But according to the Wall Street Journal,

74
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,370
“Chinese officials said

75
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,550
they have already taken concrete steps

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,350
toward reform, citing more liberal rules

77
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,050
for foreign competitors in sectors

78
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,680
such as autos and financial services,

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,290
and tougher enforcement of intellectual property.”

80
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,590
Although Chinese leaders have made promises
of reform before.

81
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,750
And on our recent podcast of China Unscripted,

82
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,080
we talked about how hard reform really is.

83
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,220
The way the Chinese Communist Party runs things,

84
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,370
even private companies have to follow its
political objectives.

85
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,900
So it’s next to impossible for the Communist
Party

86
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,060
to actually reform or deal with most of the
issues

87
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,820
the US is concerned about,

88
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,430
without giving up a lot of its own power.

89
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,840
To drive home that point,

90
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,930
FBI Director Christopher Wray,

91
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,660
at a US Senate committee hearing on Tuesday,

92
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,820
said the lines between

93
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,120
“the Chinese government and ostensibly private
companies”

94
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,510
are blurred if not totally erased and

95
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,640
“especially the lines between lawful behavior

96
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,420
and fair competition and lying and hacking
and cheating and stealing.”

97
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,940
Basically, we’re trying to play basketball,

98
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,820
and the Chinese regime is playing no-rules
jungle ball.

99
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,269
Speaking of private Chinese companies

100
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,620
that have to follow political objectives:

101
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,870
Huawei, China’s biggest telecom company.

102
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,430
In December, Canadian authorities arrested
Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou.

103
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,770
She faces extradition to the US for allegedly
violating US sanctions on Iran.

104
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,320
Well on Monday, the US announced 23 criminal
charges

105
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,229
against Meng and Huawei.

106
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,169
Meng was personally charged with bank fraud,
wire fraud,

107
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,889
and conspiracies to commit bank and wire fraud.

108
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,330
Plus, Huawei itself was charged with

109
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,620
technology theft, bank fraud, obstruction
of justice, and money laundering.

110
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,340
And right before the trade talks,

111
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,330
Meng made her first public appearance in more
than a month

112
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,629
in a Canadian court.

113
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,240
Canada now has a month to decide

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,509
whether the US’s formal extradition request
is strong enough.

115
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:06,639
During Tuesday’s hearing,

116
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,300
the judge delayed the next hearing by a month,
to March 6th.

117
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,419
I mean, why deal with something now,

118
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,080
when you can put it off till later?

119
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,539
But for a brief moment,

120
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,669
it looked like Canada may have been caving

121
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,449
to the Chinese regime on the Huawei case.

122
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,139
At least that was the impression given

123
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,249
by Canadian ambassador to China John McCallum.

124
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:30,590
“‘As I was saying, I think Ms. Meng has
quite a strong case.’

125
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,759
McCallum then laid out in some detail

126
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,129
why he believed a Canadian judge would reject
a US request to extradite Meng.”

127
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,740
And as Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia
Freeland said,

128
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,020
that’s a problem.

129
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,289
“Ambassador McCallum’s comments

130
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,510
were inconsistent with the position of the
government of Canada.

131
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,750
The first and foremost job of any ambassador
of our country

132
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,979
is to express accurately our government's
position.”

133
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,650
McCallum later apologized,

134
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,499
and told the Canadian newspaper The Star that
he misspoke.

135
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,979
But then right after, he opened up his mouth
again

136
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,219
and promptly inserted his foot.

137
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,689
“McCallum told a reporter that it would
be great for Canada

138
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:17,629
if the US dropped the extradition request

139
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,930
once again suggesting it would not be the
rule of law

140
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,370
that would decide the issue, but some political
horse trading.”

141
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,050
And then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

142
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,789
told Ambassador McCallum, “You’re fired.”

143
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,919
I think Trudeau just wanted to impress Donald
Trump.

144
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,349
Anyway, former Canadian ambassador to China,

145
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,039
David Mulroney, said McCallum’s comments
were “mind boggling.”

146
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,009
But this is what the Chinese Communist Party
is good at—elite capture.

147
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:45,759
That means getting influential foreigners

148
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,999
to support the Chinese regime’s approach
to issues,

149
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,919
and then push those agendas in their countries.

150
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,050
In fact, former Ambassador to China David
Mulroney

151
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,969
knows a lot about elite capture.

152
00:06:57,969 --> 00:06:59,900
In an email to the Star, Mulroney wrote

153
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,180
“China is amazingly successful at convincing
people,

154
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,860
including seasoned diplomats,

155
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,139
that the most important thing in the world

156
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,680
is maintaining good relations with China.”

157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,879
“By this they generally mean not commenting

158
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,099
or otherwise reacting to something egregious
that China has done.”

159
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,650
“They”—the Chinese regime—“persuade
people

160
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,629
by playing to their vanity,

161
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:23,039
making them believe that their unique understanding
of China

162
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,309
is evidenced by their ability to keep things
calm and untroubled.

163
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:29,930
They do this because it works — for China.”

164
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,939
That’s ridiculous.

165
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,050
I mean, I have a unique understanding of China.

166
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,419
I’m also vain!

167
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,089
Why hasn’t the Chinese regime tried to elite
capture me?

168
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,349
In McCallum’s case,

169
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,979
he apparently received more than 73,000 Canadian
dollars

170
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,219
worth of trips to China when he was a member
of parliament.

171
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,099
I guess that was a good investment.

172
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,069
Of course, my favorite Chinese state-run media,
the Global Times,

173
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,930
had its own unique take on the matter.

174
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,749
The real political interference

175
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,509
was McCallum getting fired

176
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,330
for saying there should be political interference
in Meng’s case.

177
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,719
“Ottawa is now as sensitive as a frightened
bird.”

178
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,809
A frightened bird?

179
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,900
Doesn’t the Global Times know he’s a shiny
pony?

180
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,479
“Justin Truuuuuuudeau!”

181
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,660
“He’s wearing liberal red, of course.

182
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,500
I call him the Shiny Pony.

183
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,830
He looks like he’s in some sort of zen yoga
trance.”

184
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,340
And it’s not just the Global Times spewing
hot air.

185
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,340
According to a new study,

186
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,800
China has not actually honored its commitment
to cut methane emissions.

187
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,320
The Communist Party not honoring its commitments!

188
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,820
I’m shocked!

189
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,089
Shocked I tell you!

190
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,899
In fact, “Not only were the reductions not
made,

191
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,500
but Chinese methane emissions actually increased

192
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,680
by 1.2 million tons per year during the five-year
period.”

193
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,000
So...I guess we now know the answer to this
question.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,040
If you’ve been watching the show,

195
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,899
you know my two great loves are anime...

196
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,250
and communism.

197
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,170
Well now, Chinese authorities have finally
combined

198
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,420
my two great loves into one single monstrosity!

199
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,160
A Chinese anime TV series about the life and
times...of Karl Marx.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,010
So young and handsome.

201
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,709
I would gladly redistribute all my capital
for a chance to see that!

202
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:34,490
And before we go, now is the time when I answer
questions from you,

203
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,290
my loyal 50-cent army

204
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,880
fans of the show who support what we do

205
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,970
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

206
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,870
Charlie Matsubara asks,

207
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,970
“Assuming CCP has learned its data fudging
lesson

208
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,890
from the Great Leap Forward.

209
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,480
What negative consequences might there be

210
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,519
for fudging GDP numbers?

211
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,740
Does China's tax revenue numbers give

212
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,430
an better idea of its real economic growth?”

213
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,139
Great question, Charlie.

214
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,040
China recently released its official GDP growth
figures

215
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,290
for the last quarter of 2018.

216
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:09,240
It was 6.4%, the lowest in 28 years.

217
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,950
But as even Chinese Premier Li Keqiang once
admitted,

218
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,780
Chinese GDP figures are manmade and therefore
unreliable.

219
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,019
So the GDP numbers are made up,

220
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,320
but you probably can’t get better insight

221
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,040
from China’s tax revenues, either.

222
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,410
Because those numbers are not made available

223
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,550
to the public or to reporters.

224
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,160
What a surprise.

225
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
So maybe China’s economy is doing okay.

226
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,610
Or maybe it’s on the verge of absolute collapse

227
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,480
and it’s going to take down the global economy
with it.

228
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
No one knows!

229
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,370
I mean, we can kind of guess,

230
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,670
but no one really knows.

231
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,740
But this is how the Communist Party functions.

232
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,620
It would rather cover up problems now, to
make it through the day.

233
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,750
What happens in the future, is a problem for
the future.

234
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,510
And that means: They really know how to live
in the present;

235
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,790
it’s a beautiful thing.

236
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,870
Thanks for you question, Charlie.

237
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,620
China Uncensored relies on your Patreon support

238
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,290
because a lot of advertisers don’t dare
to work

239
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,529
with a show that criticizes the Chinese Communist
Party.

240
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,870
So head over to patreon.com/chinauncensored

241
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,950
to learn how you can help keep China, uncensored.

242
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,100
And as a way of saying thanks,

243
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,340
I’ll answer your questions on the show...live.

244
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,680
Well, taped live.

245
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,389
It’s almost as good.

246
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,440
Thanks for watching.

247
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,500
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

248
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,520
See you next time.
