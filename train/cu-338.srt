1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,840
Canada’s parliament just accused China

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,200
Of committing genocide.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,560
But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:16,000
Doesn’t quite agree.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,640
Today we’re going to be talking about\h
genocide. And why it’s so hard to identify.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,560
It’s almost as if, when an authoritarian\h
regime purposely tries to destroy\h\h

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,480
a group of people, they also want to\h
hide the evidence and lie about it.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,760
Earlier this week, Canada’s parliament declared\h
China’s treatment of the Uyghurs genocide.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,360
That’s pretty significant,\h
making Canada the second country\h\h

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,120
after the US to officially use the G word.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,520
The motion was brought by Canada’s Conservative\h
Party. And Conservative Party leader Erin\h\h

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,080
O’Toole said it was needed to send a “clear and\h
unequivocal signal that we will stand up for human\h\h

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,640
rights and the dignity of human rights, even if\h
it means sacrificing some economic opportunity.”

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
And while standing up for human\h
rights shouldn’t be controversial,\h\h

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,680
it was very controversial. The motion\h
passed the House of Commons by 266 to 0.\h

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Ok, that doesn’t sound controversial.\h
But more than 70 MPs either abstained\h\h

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,440
or missed the vote. Including Prime Minister\h
Justin Trudeau and his entire Cabinet.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
“Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau\h
was the only cabinet minister present.\h\h

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,120
When it was his turn, he said he abstained\h
‘on behalf of the Government of Canada.’”

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
By the government of Canada,\h
he means the Prime Minister\h\h

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,480
and the Cabinet. What the US\h
would call the Executive branch.\h

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,320
Parliament was voting on a nonbinding resolution.\h
That means it officially recognized the genocide,\h\h

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,160
but it didn’t actually require the\h
government to do anything about it.\h\h

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,080
The House of Commons is just saying that\h
they recognize the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
is committing genocide. They’re also\h
calling on the IOC to move the Olympics\h\h

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,840
if it doesn’t stop, and for the Canadian\h
government to officially call it genocide.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,560
Yeah, I’m gonna say those last two\h
things are probably not going to happen.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,440
Ahead of the vote, Justin Trudeau had\h
called genocide an “extremely loaded” term.\h

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,640
And he said, “When it comes to the application of\h
the very specific word genocide, we simply need to\h\h

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,240
ensure that all the i’s are dotted and the t’s are\h
crossed before a determination like that is made.”

32
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,120
Sure, that sounds reasonable. But it’s not\h
like the House of Commons declared the Chinese\h\h

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,880
Communist Party’s actions against the Uyghurs\h
a genocide just because they felt like it.\h

34
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,000
Last October, a House of Commons subcommittee\h
on international human rights declared that\h\h

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,960
the “actions of the Chinese Communist Party\h
constitute genocide as laid out in the [UN]\h\h

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:20,000
Genocide Convention.” That was based on evidence\h
from hearings they held in 2018 and 2020.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,920
That evidence included dozens of hours of\h
testimony from academics, civil society,\h\h

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,840
and witnesses who survived\h
the atrocities in Xinjiang.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
So it sounds like they dotted some\h
i’s and crossed some t’s there.

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,280
Trudeau is right that genocide is a serious\h
accusation to make. And that’s because genocide\h\h

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,760
is an evil act. After the horrors of the\h
Holocaust, the world said Never Again.

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,040
But there’s a problem with Trudeau not using\h
the word genocide. I’ll explain after the break.

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,760
Welcome back. Justin Trudeau\h
doesn’t want to officially declare\h\h

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,240
that what the Chinese Communist Party\h
is doing to the Uyghurs is “genocide.”

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,440
But here’s the thing. It’s really hard to stop\h
authoritarian regimes from committing genocide.\h\h

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,320
So it’s up to the rest of the world to…*pretend*\h
those regimes are not committing genocide.

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,320
I like to call it Let’s Pretend\h
It Never Happens Again.\h

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,040
If you just gloss over a few words,\h
it’s almost like Never Again.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,920
Let’s call it Never dot dot dot Again, for short.

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,080
And some of Trudeau’s justifications for not\h
calling out the Chinese Communist Party’s genocide\h\h

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,360
sound like Never dot dot dot Again.

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,120
Like when he said that instead of\h
Canada calling it a genocide by itself,\h\h

53
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
the best way to move forward is multilaterally.

54
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Sure, multilateralism sounds good. But it\h
actually benefits the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,400
They love it, because they can just use\h
their influence over one of the countries\h\h

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,280
in your multilateral coalition to stop you\h
from doing anything. It’s their specialty.

57
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,680
Like they did when they got Greece to block\h
an EU statement on China’s human rights.\h

58
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,560
The other issue with waiting for multilateralism,\h
is that if every country waits to declare it a\h\h

59
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,600
genocide until other countries also declare it a\h
genocide, then no one ever declares it a genocide.

60
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,080
It’s like you say you want to work out with your\h
friends, except you decide that no one can go\h\h

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,680
to the gym unless everyone goes to the gym.\h
Guess what? No one will ever go to the gym.\h

62
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,440
But maybe that was your plan all along.\h
Because you hate going to the gym.\h\h

63
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
Just like a lot of governments hate\h
criticizing the Chinese Communist Party.

64
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,960
But speaking of multilateralism, the House of\h
Commons resolution actually addressed this issue.\h\h

65
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,280
They noted that Canada tries to work\h
with allies when recognizing genocide,\h\h

66
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,800
and then cited the fact that two\h
different US administrations have\h\h

67
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,280
agreed that the Chinese Communist\h
Party is committing genocide.

68
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,560
So if this is something Biden and Trump\h
can agree on, maybe Canada can as well.

69
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,480
That’s why the Canadian House of Commons used the\h
US declaration of genocide to back up their own.\h\h

70
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,600
And now that both the US and\h
Canada have called it a genocide,\h\h

71
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,720
it makes it easier for other\h
countries to do the same.

72
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
Maybe Australia will be next.

73
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,120
Or Great Britain.

74
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,600
Or Germa--never mind.

75
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,520
But what if multilateralism isn’t enough? Here’s\h
another great Never dot dot dot Again excuse:\h\h

76
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,000
We need to have an independent investigation\h
in China to look into those claims of genocide.

77
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,480
That’s basically what Canada’s Foreign\h
Affairs Minister Marc Garneau said.\h

78
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,000
He’s the guy who abstained from the genocide\h
vote on behalf of the Trudeau government.\h

79
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,680
“Garneau said the government takes\h
allegations against China ‘very seriously’\h\h

80
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,200
and has raised its concerns directly\h
with the Chinese government.”

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah, that’ll show ’em.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
“Garneau said Canada wants independent\h
investigators to go into China to document\h\h

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,640
abuses and is working with international\h
partners to gain access to the region.”

84
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,600
Hey, that’s a great idea. Maybe those\h
independent investigators can be sent by\h\h

85
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,840
some international body dedicated to human\h
rights, like the UN Human Rights Council!\h

86
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,800
I’m sure that China, which sits\h
on the Human Rights Council,\h\h

87
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,880
would definitely let that happen\h
in a totally independent way!

88
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,040
Look, I’m not saying there shouldn’t\h
be independent investigations\h\h

89
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,840
into the genocide of the Uyghurs. In fact,\h\h

90
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,200
the evidence of genocide has come from years of\h
investigations and research from journalists,\h\h

91
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,800
academics, and human rights advocates. And\h
especially from Uyghur activists themselves.

92
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,320
And we’ve covered that over\h
the years on this show.

93
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,360
But let’s get real. The Chinese Communist Party\h
is never going to let an actual independent\h\h

94
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,320
investigation happen in China. Even if\h
they let investigators into Xinjiang,\h\h

95
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,720
it would be exactly like the\h
show tour they gave to the BBC.

96
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,960
As hundreds of thousands of Muslims\h
disappear into giant secure facilities,\h\h

97
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:10,960
China has begun taking a few selected journalists\h
inside. This is what it wants the world to see.\h

98
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,720
See?! That’s not genocide! That’s\h
happy ethnic dancing! Case closed.

99
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
By the way, if you want to hear what it was\h
like to be given one of the Communist Party’s\h\h

100
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,480
show tours, check out this episode of our\h
podcast China Unscripted, where we talk to\h\h

101
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,360
an Albanian journalist who visited those\h
concentration camps. It’s a crazy story.

102
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,080
But the point is, if you’re going to wait\h
for an independent investigation in China\h\h

103
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,080
before you decide whether they’re committing\h
genocide, you’re never going to call it genocide.

104
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,400
But maybe that was your plan all along.

105
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Now a lot of these controversies also came up\h
when former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\h\h

106
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,280
declared what was happening in Xinjiang\h
both crimes against humanity and a genocide.

107
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Most recently, Foreign Policy published\h
an article about how State Department\h\h

108
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,680
lawyers concluded there was insufficient\h
evidence to prove genocide in China.

109
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,440
Basically, the State Department lawyers determined\h
that the Chinese Communist Party was definitely\h\h

110
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,440
committing crimes against humanity. And the\h
lawyers didn’t say that there wasn’t genocide,\h\h

111
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,920
but that legally speaking there may not be enough\h
evidence to prove there was genocide in court.\h

112
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
But the article goes on to\h
say that some legal experts\h\h

113
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,960
disagree with the narrow definition\h
used by the State Department lawyers,\h\h

114
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,360
and say there’s “ample evidence that\h
China has engaged in genocide.”\h

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,240
In any case, while the lawyers\h
can advise the Secretary of State,\h\h

116
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,800
he makes the final decision. And\h
Pompeo declared it a genocide.

117
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,440
During his confirmation hearing,\h\h

118
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,000
current Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\h
he stands by Pompeo’s designation of genocide.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
Although there are also reports\h
that the Biden administration\h\h

120
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
is currently reviewing that genocide designation.\h

121
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Both the State Department and the Canadian\h
parliament’s designation of genocide\h\h

122
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,480
rely on the UN Genocide Convention.

123
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,760
It says that genocide is any of the following\h
acts committed with intent to destroy,\h\h

124
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,680
in whole or in part, a national,\h
ethnical, racial, or religious group.\h

125
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,720
That includes “killing members of the group,\h
causing serious bodily or mental harm,\h\h

126
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,160
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions\h
of life calculated to bring about its physical\h\h

127
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,800
destruction, imposing measures intended\h
to prevent births within the group,\h\h

128
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
and forcibly transferring children\h
of the group to another group.”

129
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,680
When most people think of genocide, we think of\h
mass murder. Like what happened in Rwanda. But\h\h

130
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,840
according to the UN, it includes other\h
attempts to destroy a group as well.\h\h

131
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,560
And according to this definition,\h
the Chinese Communist Party’s\h\h

132
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,160
torture and brainwashing of Uyghurs, their\h
forced sterilization of Uyghur women,\h\h

133
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,880
their separation of Uyghur children from\h
their parents, would all count as genocide.\h

134
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,440
But maybe...it shouldn’t count as genocide.\h\h

135
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,360
That’s the incredibly brave argument\h
that the Economist is making.

136
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,920
Why is the Economist arguing that\h
we shouldn’t call it a genocide?\h\h

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
I’ll get to that after the break.

138
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,040
Welcome back.

139
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,680
The Economist argues that we shouldn’t\h
call China’s genocide a genocide.

140
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,320
You see, “Just as ‘homicide’ means killing a\h
person and ‘suicide’ means killing yourself,\h\h

141
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,680
‘genocide’ means killing a people.\h\h

142
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,120
China’s persecution of the Uyghurs is\h
horrific...But it is not slaughtering them.”

143
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,640
Ok, Economist. First of all, yes it is\h
slaughtering them. For their organs.

144
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,520
But continue with your argument. I\h
want to see where this is going.\h

145
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,920
“Until now, America’s State Department\h
had applied the ‘genocide’ label\h\h

146
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,880
only to mass slaughter, and even then it often\h
hesitated, for fear that uttering the term\h\h

147
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,520
would create an expectation\h
that it would intervene.\h\h

148
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,200
It did not call Rwanda’s genocide a\h
genocide until it was practically over.”

149
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,920
Hold on, I’m pretty sure it was a huge mistake for\h
the US not to call Rwanda’s genocide a genocide\h\h

150
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,960
until it was practically over. It’s not\h
an example of what we should keep doing!

151
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
But go on.

152
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,840
“By accusing China of genocide, [the US]\h
is sending the signal that its government\h\h

153
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,400
has committed the most heinous of\h
crimes. And yet at the same time\h\h

154
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,680
it is proposing to deal with it over\h
global warming, pandemics and trade.”

155
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,840
Yes, I agree this is a problem. But maybe\h
there’s another solution to this that\h\h

156
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,440
doesn’t involve *changing\h
the definition of genocide*.

157
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:33,440
Here’s the thing. In their truly despicable\h
article, the Economist makes a good point.\h\h

158
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
How can other countries accuse the\h
Chinese Communist Party of genocide\h\h

159
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
and still treat them like a normal government?

160
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
That’s the fundamental problem with\h
recognizing the Uyghur genocide.\h\h

161
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,800
If we start using the G word, then why\h
don’t we treat China like Rwanda or Sudan?

162
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,120
How can we have the Olympics there without\h
it turning into the Genocide Olympics?\h

163
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,360
How can we trade with China?\h
How can we have state visits?\h

164
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
How can we unleash the potential\h
of Chinese bonds?!  Don’t\h\h

165
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,840
we all become complicit in genocide?

166
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,280
Well, yes, we are all complicit in genocide.\h\h

167
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,840
The world has gone from Never Again to\h
Let’s Pretend It Never Happens Again.

168
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,680
But as long as governments can do the diplomatic\h
equivalent of shoving their fingers into their\h\h

169
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,520
ears and going lalalalalalalala, they will still\h
do business with the Chinese Communist Party.\h

170
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
But guess what? The genocide isn’t going to go\h\h

171
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,560
away just because we keep\h
doing business with them.

172
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
In fact, a new independent\h
tribunal has formed in the UK\h\h

173
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
to investigate whether the Chinese\h
Communist Party is committing genocide.

174
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
It’s chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice.

175
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,800
He’s the same guy who chaired the China Tribunal\h
on forced organ harvesting. That tribunal\h\h

176
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,480
determined that China had been killing prisoners\h
of conscience for their organs for years,\h\h

177
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,640
including both Falun Gong\h
practitioners and the Uyghurs.

178
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Forced organ harvesting by the\h
way, is a big elephant in the room\h\h

179
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,120
when it comes to the genocide designation. As more\h
governments acknowledge that the Chinese regime\h\h

180
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,880
is committing genocide, the evidence of\h
organ harvesting becomes harder to deny.

181
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,160
And as more evidence emerges that the\h
Chinese Communist Party is killing Uyghurs\h\h

182
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,000
for their organs, it will\h
get harder for the Economist\h\h

183
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,400
or Justin Trudeau to claim\h
there’s no mass killing going on.

184
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,840
And Western governments might have to actually ask\h
themselves: Should we be pumping money into China?

185
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,080
Which is why the Chinese\h
Communist Party absolutely hates\h\h

186
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,480
all of this genocide talk. Their state-run media\h
are trying to discredit it as much as possible.

187
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,160
And if Chinese state-run media wants\h
us to keep quiet about something,\h\h

188
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,880
you know it’s precisely something\h
we should all be talking about.

189
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,080
And now it’s time for me to answer a\h
question from a fan who supports the\h\h

190
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,600
show on the crowd funding website Patreon. Go\h
to Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored to learn more.\h

191
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,680
Weesh asks:
Chris and Team, are videos\h\h

192
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,360
of coerced confessions effective propaganda?\h\h
Are the Chinese people really fooled by them?\h

193
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,280
Well weesh, it depends what you\h
mean by “effective propaganda.”\h\h

194
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,800
Do Chinese people believe that these people are\h
making genuine confessions about their crimes?\h\h

195
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,360
I would say they probably generally\h
know these confessions are coerced.\h\h

196
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,440
Especially if they are older and have\h
lived through the Cultural Revolution.\h

197
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
But that doesn’t mean these forced\h
confessions aren’t effective.\h\h

198
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,400
Even if people don’t believe in\h
the content of the confessions,\h\h

199
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,520
they know that they don’t want to be the\h
one making a forced confession themselves.\h\h

200
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,440
Which means they don’t want to cross the Communist\h
Party. And that’s the most effective tool of all.

201
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,440
Thanks for your question, weesh.\h

202
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:27,840
And thank you for watching. Once again\h
I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
