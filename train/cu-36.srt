1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,799
China tells South Korea to stop dancing.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,940
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,009
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,679
Did you ever see The Sound of Music?

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,289
More like The Sound of Propaganda!

7
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:23,640
Here I think I'm watching a nice musical celebrating
Austrian culture...

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,619
when suddenly it turns into a story about
Nazi oppression.

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,830
Now clearly, the Third Reich is not one of
their favorite things.

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,660
But I mean, how dare they use art to make
people think?

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,180
Now speaking of artistic performances that
make people think: Shen Yun.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,860
It's a classical Chinese dance show run by
a nonprofit Chinese-American company.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,510
Apparently, the Chinese Communist Party considers
Shen Yun a major threat

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,670
including in South Korea.

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,370
Why is that? Well let's see.

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,760
According to the Shen Yun website,

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,900
It's "reviving 5,000 years of civilization."

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,400
It "features the world's foremost classically
trained dancers";

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,880
and it was "established by Falun Dafa practitioners
in 2006."

20
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,430
I feel like it's probably one of those three.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,980
And if you want some background

22
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:17,329
on why the Communist Party is so intent on
stopping Falun Dafa, a.k.a. Falun Gong,

23
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:19,060
watch this video here.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,920
Now Shen Yun tours around the world

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,020
in hundreds of cities.

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,689
I've watched it a few times at Lincoln Center
in New York.

27
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,960
Each show has about twenty dance and music
numbers.

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,759
Some of them depict historical things,

29
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,859
like the founding of a dynasty.

30
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,749
And a couple of them usually depict contemporary
issues,

31
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:40,329
like Falun Dafa meditators standing up the
to Communist Party's suppression.

32
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:42,130
Well apparently, in South Korea,

33
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,380
the use of the arts to make people think

34
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,079
about certain contemporary issues is a huge
threat

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,840
to the stability of the Chinese Communist
Party.

36
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,700
You see, KBS Hall in Seoul had signed a contract

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,590
with promotion company New Cosmos Media

38
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,649
to host Shen Yun performances here in May
2016.

39
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,520
But then on January 26, just a few weeks ago,

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,240
KBS suddenly canceled the contract.

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,640
Organizers suspect the Chinese Embassy was
behind it.

42
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,050
Now, I know that sounds like wild speculation.

43
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,970
But there are numerous, well-documented cases

44
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,470
of Chinese Embassies around the world trying

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,260
to stop Shen Yun.

46
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,580
Let's call it "diplomacy with Chinese characteristics."

47
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,940
They often tell theaters that hosting Shen
Yun

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,190
"may compromise relations" between China and
their country.

49
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,350
For example, according to Spain's biggest
newspaper,

50
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,100
in 2014 a Chinese diplomat tried to pressure
a theater in Barcelona

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,090
to cancel its contract with Shen Yun.

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,530
When the theater refused,

53
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,220
the Chinese official tried to pressure Spain's
Foreign Ministry instead.

54
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,010
Shen Yun performed anyway,

55
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,410
and it got rave reviews from Spanish media.

56
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,220
And when Shen Yun was scheduled to perform
in Berlin that same year,

57
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,310
the German Chinese Embassy's cultural attaché

58
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,050
met with the theater’s marketing and sales
manager, Jörg Seefeld,

59
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,060
telling him he had better cancel Shen Yun.

60
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,850
This German Newspaper reported on the incident,
saying,

61
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,190
“It sounds like something out of the Cold
War.”

62
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,600
Fortunately for Shen Yun,

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,750
Mr. Seefeld had been a prisoner during the
Cold War in communist East Germany.

64
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,500
He told the Chinese attaché to go pound sand.

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,690
And those are just two of literally dozens
of examples,

66
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,190
around the world, of Chinese diplomats

67
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,150
"diplomatically" trying to force theaters
to cancel Shen Yun.

68
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,100
And most of the time, their efforts have failed
because theater managers stand up to them.

69
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,050
So when getting theaters to cancel on Shen
Yun doesn't work,

70
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,020
they sometimes try a different approach.

71
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,660
Like trying to stop people from attending.

72
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,870
"Last week, Seattle City Council members received
a letter from the Chinese Consul in San Francisco

73
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,890
urging them not to promote or attend the show."

74
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,020
Or the year before:

75
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,450
"The Chinese government's been told to butt
out of local politics

76
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,210
after apparently asking city council members
to stay away from a dance show."

77
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,259
"Cathy Casey says the Consul-General's letter
is a breach of human rights."

78
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,959
"'China has its own laws. This is New Zealand.

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,539
We are a democracy. We have freedom of expression
and freedom of association.

80
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,159
And this breaks every rule in the book.'"

81
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:30,349
You know, I feel like there are more important
things the Chinese Embassies could be doing.

82
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,319
But anyway, back to Korea.

83
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,080
Shen Yun has tried to perform here every year
since 2008.

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,999
And almost every time, whether in Seoul, Busan,
or another city,

85
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:44,870
the theaters have told organizers they received
pressure from Chinese officials not to hold

86
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,180
the show.

87
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,280
In some cases, theater owners have withstood
the pressure and let Shen Yun perform.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,860
But in many cases,

89
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,520
the Korean theaters folded under pressure
like it's their first time at the poker table

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,050
claiming "Hey, it's not our fault! The Chinese
Embassy pressured us!"

91
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,740
But let’s not completely blame the victim.

92
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,360
I should point out that Chinese pressure on
Korea has been unusually severe.

93
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
You see, South Korea has a very tight relationship
with China.

94
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,610
China is South Korea's largest trading partner

95
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,009
a relationship worth more than 200 billion
dollars a year.

96
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,029
And Chinese money is critical to Korea's economic
development.

97
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,889
And that may be why KBS Hall broke Shen Yun's
contract and canceled this year's show.

98
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:36,129
Also, KBS Hall is owned by state-run Korean
TV broadcaster KBS.

99
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,749
And KBS has lots of reporters in China.

100
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:43,729
Reporters who need Chinese media visas.

101
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,240
And speaking of media,

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,090
guess who shares a building with KBS in Seoul?

103
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,790
Why, the local bureau of China Central Television!

104
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,680
But, you know, I don't want to make wild accusations

105
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,949
about what's behind KBS Hall's cancellation
of Shen Yun.

106
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,110
So I attempted to contact KBS for their side
of the story.

107
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,960
I sent a letter to their official email account,

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,249
but it was returned because of "an error in
the mail server."

109
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,360
I called several numbers for the relevant
departments,

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,169
but they all said something like this.

111
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,499
“The number you have dialed is temporarily
not in service."

112
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,300
Then we called their main phone number,

113
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,669
and asked to be transferred,

114
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:24,800
but the representative refused;

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,150
she insisted we send an email instead.

116
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,949
I did speak about the issue with Changsik
Lee,

117
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:33,389
who's promoting Shen Yun in South Korea.

118
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,050
”Shen Yun has been performing in Korea for
the last nine years

119
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:45,990
and 10,000 people every year have watched Shen Yun
and the response has been fantastic,

120
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,389
they like the show very much."

121
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:52,469
"Have you talked to anyone at KBS since they
canceled the contract?"

122
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:59,749
"Yes, yes we met with some people,

123
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:05,589
and they all know that the show has no problem
and the show is very famous worldwide."

124
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:07,960
"So why cancel the show?"

125
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,879
"They have no choice.

126
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,349
They just got ordered from the higher level."

127
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,689
"Did they say who the higher level is or why?"

128
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,909
"They cannot tell."

129
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:26,300
Mr. Lee also gave me a copy of KBS's official
termination notice for Shen Yun.

130
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,839
KBS wrote that, "there is concern that it
may damage our public corporation's image."

131
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,309
Hmmm.. Well that same concern didn't seem
to apply for this show,

132
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:39,919
which I saw rehearing at KBS Hall:

133
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,610
The "Korean Overseas Chinese Friendship Association
Lantern Festival Gala."

134
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,699
And it's sponsored by, you guessed it, the
Chinese government!

135
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,449
It's performing this week.

136
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:53,270
Oh, according to the program,

137
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,969
it features such traditional Chinese classics
as,

138
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:57,809
"I'm so sexy."

139
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:01,089
Which is apparently fine for KBS’s public
image.

140
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,930
It's just that, when you compare it to Shen
Yun...

141
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,589
Wait a second! I know what's going on!

142
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:11,240
It's like those off-brand LEGOs I kept seeing
in South Korea.

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,650
I guess KBS Hall only wants the cheap, Chinese
knockoff.

144
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,439
So what do you think?
