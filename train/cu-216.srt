1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,080
Would you mind joining me in a round of "Do You Hear the People Sing?"

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,560
Ah, Admiralty, Hong Kong...

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,240
I remember being here two years ago during the Umbrella Movement.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,540
In 2014, the people of Hong Kong -

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,060
mainly young people -

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,360
took to the streets for 79 days

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,700
to protest for their right to directly elect their leader -

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,920
Something Beijing promised under the One Country - Two Systems policy

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,400
but, spoiler alert: they lied.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,120
I remember it all so clearly.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,940
That's where I slept in a tent.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,220
Right where that BMW is driving by.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,940
Over there, that was the Lennon Wall.

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,420
I can almost see student leader, Joshua Wong, giving a rousing speech!

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,120
Oh wait... that is Joshua Wong!

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,860
Joshua!

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,800
Joshua!

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,820
Joshua! Joshua!

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,140
Hi - hi!

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,720
Do you mind if I get an interview with you?

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,780
Oh, of course - okay!

22
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,740
Awesome. Can we go somewhere quieter?

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,820
Yeah, that side is better.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,240
Alright, let's go - Okay!

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,060
Well, Joshua, thank you for agreeing to be interviewed.

26
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,800
What's it like for you to be back here at Admiralty?

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,120
It's the place, two years ago, we occupied and create

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,500
a miracle, or even the history of Hong Kong.

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,740
And it's also a place where now I work,

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,160
and because I'm already the assistant of legislator, Nathan Law.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,280
Do you think, some day, they'll build big statues of you?

32
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,420
Uh, it's a bit too far away, in fact.

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,680
You're being too modest.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,380
Would you consider another mass movement like the Umbrella?

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,300
Next year, March, will be the chief executive election.

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,160
I believe it will be a critical point for Hong Kongers

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,340
to have a massive social movement

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,840
to show our anger to the indifference of Beijing again.

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,500
How do you think that will be different from two years ago?

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,260
I would say that there's too much uncertainty.

41
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,300
After the Umbrella Movement ended,

42
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,480
with the bookseller incident happened,

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,080
kidnapped from Hong Kong to China,

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,480
how I've been detained in Bangkok airport

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,300
because the Thai government hoped to remain in good relations with China.

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,160
And how disqualified two pro-independence legislators.

47
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,780
It seems we already faced the failure of One Country - Two Systems,

48
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,920
And the road to a high degree of autonomy,

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,240
the path of Hong Kong to a democracy

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,920
is really far away, in fact.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,460
Do you think there's any hope of maintaining One Coutry - Two Systems with the Communist Party?

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,100
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,780
It's a long-term battle.

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,620
I can see the hope from people. But I can't see the hope from Communist Party.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,600
The people are always the trigger pull to create a miracle.

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
That's why it will be a motivator for me to continue to fight.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,020
I still have hope for Hong Kongers.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,100
And you co-founded a new party, Demosistō.

59
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,780
What are the goals of that party?

60
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,820
What we hope is to push for South determination movement.

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,440
We believe Hong Kong has gained the right of self-determination.

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,360
To have a democratic procedure or even referendum

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,480
to decide the constitution,

64
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,440
and sovereignty of Hong Kong after the end of

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,500
15 years unchanged policy,

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,160
in 2047.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,920
And what does Demosistō think of Hong Kong independence?

68
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,380
Is that different from self-determination?

69
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,900
In fact, in the policy platform of Demosistō, we do not advocate independence.

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,440
But what we do believe is the sovereignty of Hong Kong should be decided

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,100
by people in Hong Kong.

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,360
Of course, the pro-Beijing force would hope to turn One Country - Two System

73
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,020
into One Country - One system.

74
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,780
But in the referendum, no matter One Country - One System,

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,280
One Country - Two System,

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,600
complete autonomy or independence,

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,040
they can be possible options to let Hong Kongers decide their future.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,560
And in the Demosistō manifesto, it says people should rise up.

79
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,760
Are you sure that's a good idea?

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,420
I would say that,

81
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,700
Now Hong Kongers are facing the largest communist regime in the world.

82
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,740
It will be a long term battle,

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,700
after the Umbrella Movement ended, we may feel downhearted

84
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,640
and depressed.

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,760
But after the legislative election,

86
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,880
and with the positive result of new generation,

87
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,120
and a civil society force to enter the institution,

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,860
It proved that we need to continue the fight.

89
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,780
And in America, there's a feeling that young people don't care about politics.

90
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,500
Why is Hong Kong making America look bad?

91
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,220
I would say that,

92
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
just like the presidential election,

93
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,020
of course it's hard for the majority

94
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,100
young generation or university student

95
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,640
to involve or support those mainstream candidates.

96
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,360
But how they're involved in the crowdfunding campaign of Bernie Sanders

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,780
and already proved that, young people, they may be

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,040
dissatisfied with the old or existing

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,600
institution, traditional politician.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
But they will still hope to gain the new voices and to

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,520
get the change to the system.

102
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,200
It's also the reason for me to

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,380
found the political party after the end of the Umbrella Movement.

104
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,300
It's necessary for us to keep the momentum and let

105
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,200
people in Hong Kong and the world know that

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,300
young generation in Hong Kong will still continue to strike on the street,

107
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,760
but also enter the institution to be the legislator.

108
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,900
So recently, you met with politicians in the US.

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,020
What's your hopes for the US getting involved?

110
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,520
The threat of China is not just only affecting people in Hong Kong, China, or Taiwan.

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,840
It affects the whole of Southeast Asia or Asia-Pacific.

112
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,040
Just like I've been blacklisted by Malaysia,

113
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,660
and Thai government detained me -

114
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,340
all because they hope to maintain

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,540
foreign relationship with China and Beijing government!

116
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,160
So I would say that,

117
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,460
I just urge the international community

118
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,040
to keep their eyes in Hong Kong.

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,120
And just like how Senators Rubio and Cotton

120
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,000
have raised the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,660
to show the support of the international community

122
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,040
on the democracy movement in Hong Kong.

123
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,560
It will be a positive trend in the future.

124
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,300
Now you and I have both been accused of being in the CIA.

125
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,560
Are you a part of the CIA?

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,520
Of course not!

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,340
Yeah, they were saying I'm a CIA agent.

128
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,900
And also, claim that I've been controlled,

129
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,000
that I've been receiving training from US Marines...

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,060
I just remember the comment of my peers,

131
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,920
"Comparing your body size to Tom Cruise, of course you're not a CIA agent!"

132
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,640
Well, that's exactly what a CIA agent would say.

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,100
So what's your view on Yau Wai-ching and Baggio Leung's oath-taking?

134
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,440
I would say that I disagree with using this kind of racist term

135
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,860
to do it for the message in the oath.

136
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,460
If they support Hong Kong independence, they can directly voice out the slogan of,

137
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,160
they can demand Hong Kong independence instead of using this kind of

138
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,020
terms, or words to elaborate on their political stance.

139
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,540
But I would say that the disqualified

140
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,620
by Beijing is just

141
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,380
proving how Beijing

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,800
betrayed and ignored their promise in the joint declaration.

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,620
Especially on how they

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,500
would try to override the judicial system and legislature.

145
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,940
And the whole of the system is just for viewing the interests of Beijing.

146
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,600
And just to clarify for the audience,

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,640
When you mentioned the slur, it was the specific use of

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,140
the term, "Chee-na,"

149
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,000
Which is what the Japanese used to refer to the Chinese during World War II,

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,580
which has become somewhat of a racial slur.

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
You were refused entry to both Thailand and Malaysia.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,680
Are there other countries that you're banned from visiting?

153
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,540
Of course! Mainland China.

154
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,140
Yeah, and I've been invited by the activist group

155
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,740
in Singapore that supports Amos Yee

156
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,640
but because, due to my personal safety,

157
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,160
I just suggested to have a Skype conference with them

158
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,180
because I don't want to be detained

159
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,160
in Bangkok, in a detention cell again.

160
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,420
Are you concerned for your safety? I know you've gotten

161
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,100
beaten up, bloodied.

162
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,080
It's really inconvenient, being Hong Kongist.

163
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,800
I have been blacklisted by most Southeast Asia countries already.

164
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,200
So no matter,

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,520
in the holiday, if I hope to get a trip

166
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,720
overseas, my options are quite limited.

167
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,260
And I know when you were just 18,

168
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,800
Fortune Magazine listed you as one of the greatest leaders in the world.

169
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,040
Do you have any advice for other inspiring great leaders? I'm asking for a friend.

170
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,460
I would say that,

171
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,360
Fortune Magazine in 1997

172
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,060
had a cover story with the title, "The Death of Hong Kong."

173
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,040
But 18 years later, they chose me to be the

174
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,620
"10 Greatest Leaders in the World."

175
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,540
I'm not saying I'm the greatest leader in the world. I actually disagree on this.

176
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,980
But I think it just proves to the world

177
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,860
if you guys think Hong Kong is already dead,

178
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,840
it's wrong.

179
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,800
We face the death of One Country - Two System.

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,200
We face the failure of high degree autonomy.

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,020
But it's not the death of Hong Kong.

182
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,420
Because Hong Kongers are still passionate,

183
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,220
and have our courage, and will fight for democracy.

184
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,380
One more question:

185
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,880
Would you mind joining me in a round of "Do You Hear the People Sing?"

186
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,360
Do you hear the people sing, 
Sing the song of angry men?

187
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,860
It's the music of the people who will not be slaves again!

188
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,060
When the beating of your heart
Echoes the beating of the drums

189
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:11,940
There is a life about to start
When tomorrow comes.

190
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,080
Yeah, I love your YouTube channel.

191
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,700
We got that on camera!

192
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,660
Great! Thanks, Josh.
