00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,320
we make a trip to the farm!

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,260
Hi, Chris Chappell here in New Zealand.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,570
You might be surprised to learn that

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,990
the rolling hills of green behind me

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,500
are actually rolling hills of milk.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,220
Dairy is big business here.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,140
That’s one reason why New Zealand

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,109
is buttering up to China.

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,090
Dairy is New Zealand’s biggest export

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,030
and makes up about 6 billion dollars

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,160
of the country’s GDP.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,140
And since China is New Zealand’s biggest
trading partner,

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,940
a lot of that dairy ends up in China.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,210
So, there's a big demand in Chinese markets

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,570
for New Zealand milk?

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,250
There is.

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,250
Yeah.

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,530
I think in the last financial year

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,660
that the interim results came out,

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,690
about a quarter of New Zealand's milk

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,010
goes into China.

23
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,010
Wow!

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,070
New Zealand Dairy farmer Chris Falconer

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,070
gave us a tour of his farm!

26
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,810
I should not have worn a suit.

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,060
Someday, you'll be a tasty steak.

28
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,180
Chinese consumers want to buy New Zealand
products

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,140
because they trust the provenance of the raw
products.

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,270
The milk that we produce,

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,950
they know that it's produced like this.

32
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,070
They know that the processing standards are
very high.

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,060
The manufacturing standards are very high...

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,869
I think that they're willing to pay

35
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,250
a little bit more than they would

36
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,060
for a product from another country

37
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,630
just because of the quality standards that
we have.

38
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,060
And Chris gave me a good idea

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,490
of just what goes into a glass of New Zealand
dairy.

40
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,390
So, how often do you have to rotate the fields?

41
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,549
Basically, you understand how fast the grass
is growing.

42
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,600
That dictates the speed of the rotation.

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,549
So, you want the grass to go from A to B

44
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,460
in the time it takes to get around the paddocks.

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,920
So in Spring that can be 20 days,

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,040
and in Winter that can be 80 days.

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,750
This is, by and large,

48
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,580
a pretty sustainable deal you've got here?

49
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,870
Well, yeah.

50
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,810
We don't ...

51
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,909
we operate on the basis that the land can
sustain the animals...

52
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,200
So, all these cows stay grass-fed their whole
lives?

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Oh, yeah!

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Yup.

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
They're never inside.

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,769
The only time they get a roof over their heads

57
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,940
is when they're a baby calf

58
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,690
and they get put in the shed to be reared.

59
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,760
When they go in to get milked,

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,750
there's a roof over the cowshed...

61
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,059
Do you think that affects the quality of the
dairy?

62
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,239
It absolutely does.

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,239
Yeah.

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,939
So, there's been a lot of work done

65
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,989
on the contents of pasture-fed milk.

66
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,779
Again, there's all these people taking omega
three pills.

67
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:48,900
Grass-fed beef and grass-fed milk is high
in omega threes,

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,150
high in complex linoleic acids, high in antioxidants.

69
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,040
So, it contains a lot of those things that
people

70
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,859
are supplementing themselves with... so, they-

71
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,459
I think I need to get a jar of raw milk from
you before I leave.

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,870
I think we can organize that.

73
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,790
I think we can organize that.

74
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,790
Yeah.

75
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,609
It’s that kind of quality that appeals to
Chinese consumers.

76
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,180
In 2008, China was rocked by a scandal involving
Sanlu—

77
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,469
a Chinese dairy company that added a toxic
chemical

78
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,889
called melamine to its milk powder.

79
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:24,409
Melamine made the milk’s protein content

80
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,950
appear higher in tests.

81
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,309
But it also made more than 300,000 sick

82
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,159
and killed at least 6 babies.

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,689
So a lot of Chinese consumers started looking
overseas

84
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,379
for dairy they could trust.

85
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,229
It’s cows like these that provide China

86
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,099
with the lactose they tolerate.

87
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,819
How long has this one been around?

88
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,499
Well, I think she's about five or six years
old.

89
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,790
That cow.

90
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,040
So in her life, how much milk will this cow
produce?

91
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,169
She'll produce about 350 kilos of milk solids
a year,

92
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,079
which is the equivalent of about 4000 liters
of milk per year.

93
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,079
Wow.

94
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,879
So 4000 liters of milk is at

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,709
the low end of the production scale

96
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,049
in most parts of the world,

97
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:15,909
but it's high in fat and protein so it's got
[inaudible] choice.

98
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,109
So a little less production, but higher quality.

99
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,989
Higher quality, less production,

100
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,340
and most importantly, less cost.

101
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
Less cost.

102
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,169
So how much will that be worth?

103
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,169
That cow?

104
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,270
Well, the cow and the liquid gold that comes
...

105
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,159
Well, she produces as I say,

106
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:39,300
about 350 kilos of milk solids a year

107
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,470
and they're worth six dollars a kilo,

108
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,210
so you're about 2000 dollars worth of milk.

109
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,169
And she's probably worth about 15 or 16 hundred
dollars.

110
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:54,230
So she produces more than her value in milk
every year.

111
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,340
And also manure too, right?

112
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,220
Yeah, that's just part of the recycling system
that we run here.

113
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
So, yeah.

114
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,580
The sun provides energy here

115
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,240
and she converts the energy in her rumen into
milk.

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
About how many cows do you have on the farm?

117
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Roughly 500.

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
It varies from season to season, but roughly
500.

119
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Chris Falconer works with

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,270
New Zealand’s biggest dairy co-op, Fonterra.

121
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,760
Fonterra is the world’s largest dairy exporter.

122
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,830
It gets its milk products from more than

123
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,340
10,000 New Zealand dairy farmers,

124
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,900
who also own shares in the company.

125
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,789
In 2015, Fonterra invested in

126
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,699
a Chinese company called BeingMate.

127
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,770
This is their logo,

128
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,000
so you know I’m not making that name up.

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,830
Fonterra paid nearly half a billion dollars

130
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,970
for an 18 percent stake.

131
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,270
But BeingMate was run...badly.

132
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,210
Beingmate’s share price has dropped dramatically

133
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,849
since July 2017.

134
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,300
And that means Fonterra has lost big.

135
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,680
So, how do you feel about Fonterra's investment

136
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
with the Chinese company Beingmate?

137
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,009
Well not tremendously happy.

138
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,159
424 million that was written off

139
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:07,509
in the last set of results is there for all
to see.

140
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,009
It's not something you can hide from.

141
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,849
Certainly, the management aren't hiding from
it.

142
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:14,849
They're disappointed.

143
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,300
They thought they had done a very good job
on diligence

144
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,100
and they'd gone through the process

145
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,979
as well as they could, but ...

146
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,190
You know, that's a difficult place to operate.

147
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,259
And you have to remember also,

148
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,610
that as big as stake as it sounds,

149
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,639
it was only 18 percent of the company.

150
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,639
You're a minor shareholder.

151
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,389
So, the company will continue to do

152
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,690
what the company will continue to do.

153
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,000
We can only influence so much.

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,349
Having said that,

155
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,080
I think it would be fair to say,

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,379
there was a degree of naivete thinking that

157
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,819
everything that was disclosed to you

158
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:55,169
was all that there was.

159
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,069
It's never been that easy a place

160
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,629
to do business for New Zealanders

161
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,499
and I just think maybe they should have taken

162
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,990
a slightly more cautionary approach to the
investment.

163
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,909
What do you think the long term effect

164
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,229
will be on New Zealand dairy farmers?

165
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,360
It's hard to know.

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,539
They're working with the management from Beingmate

167
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,669
to improve the business returns

168
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,860
and to put it on a stable footing

169
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,750
so it does what it's meant to do for New Zealand
farmers,

170
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,240
which is to provide an avenue for markets
and branding.

171
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,539
So, I think, FrieslandCampina, for example,

172
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,219
the Dutch cooperative, have stake in our company
in China,

173
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,699
and they just wrote the whole lot off.

174
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,699
They're gone.

175
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,699
They just walked away from it.

176
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,680
Do you think that's an option for Fonterra?

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,150
Well, I think that you shouldn't hold onto
a mistake

178
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,279
just because it took you a long time to make
it.

179
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,449
So, I think time will tell.

180
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,240
I think, at the moment we're being told

181
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,270
is that they're looking to help the company
improve returns.

182
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,270
So I guess that's where they're gonna go,

183
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,680
but I don't think there'll be much tolerance

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,599
from shareholders for any further losses.

185
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,039
I think the next director elections

186
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,020
could be very interesting for some people.

187
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Yeah.

188
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,430
Especially since the CEO of Fonterra

189
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,120
is the highest paid CEO in New Zealand, right?

190
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
That is true.

191
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
That is true.

192
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,260
And there's a bit of talk about that as well.

193
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,899
I can imagine.

194
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,229
The BeingMate loss was not Fonterra’s

195
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,860
first rocky investment in China.

196
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,659
Before the melamine scandal broke in 2008,

197
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,870
Fonterra owned a 43 percent stake in Sanlu.

198
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,089
Oops.

199
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,290
But since China is such a huge market for
New Zealand milk,

200
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,490
Fonterra is still in it for the long haul.

201
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,949
And here in New Zealand,

202
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,760
the milk will still flow.

203
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,440
This is where the cows get milked.

204
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,220
So, 40 cows each side.

205
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,610
They come in.

206
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,660
They line up with their rump here, on an angle.

207
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,639
And we come along and we put the cups on them

208
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,110
and by the time this row is finished

209
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,449
the other side is rolled in

210
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,050
and we just basically switch them over to
the other side.

211
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,610
Repeat until all the cows are gone.

212
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,709
We're milking about eight rows at the moment.

213
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:19,709
Okay.

214
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,709
How do the cows like it?

215
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,779
They're very happy.

216
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,130
And do you ever take a little bit off the
top for yourself or your kids?

217
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,980
I've been known to regularly, yes.

218
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,220
I usually have a pint every morning.

219
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,200
A pint.

220
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,680
Do you want to try some milk?

221
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,540
I'd love it, cheers!

222
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,560
Let's get some milk.

223
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,660
So that should be enough.

224
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,160
Alright.

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,280
Oh, that looks thick.

226
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,780
Try it.

227
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,560
That's the best milk I've ever had in my life.

228
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,080
Really?

229
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,580
It's fresh.

230
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,940
Oh, it's fresh alright.

231
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,279
Yeah.

232
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,279
Yep.

233
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,279
You can almost taste the grass.

234
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,460
So now we know how milk goes from grass to
cow to Chris!

235
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,380
Which is why I’m drinking as much New Zealand
milk now as I can.

236
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,620
It’s going to be a deeply unpleasant flight
back to New York.

237
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,480
Chug chug chug chug!
