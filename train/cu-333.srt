1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,799
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,140
oh there’s nothing comic about this.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored; I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,990
You know, my mama always said

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,700
you should never talk about religion or politics
over the dinner table.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,380
Well, I would add to that one more highly
sensitive topic—comic books.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,230
More specifically, movie adaptations of comic
books.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,040
Nothing is more certain to generate a hellstorm
on Internet forums

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,430
than minor changes made to beloved characters.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,510
Or the occasional flaming train wreck.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,230
But the most recent atrocity to befall comic
bookdom

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,149
was the decision to change the Ancient One,

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,600
a Tibetan male sorcerer in Doctor Strange,

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,430
to a white woman in the upcoming movie.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,570
The movie’s creators have been lambasted

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,270
for what’s being called another example
of Hollywood “whitewashing.”

17
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,059
But earlier this month, actress Tilda Swinton,

18
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:04,350
who has been cast as the Ancient One,

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,299
said there were “very great reasons” for
the changes.

20
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,840
The greatest reason of all, it turns out,
may have been money.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,549
On the Double Toasted podcast,

22
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:16,400
Doctor Strange movie writer C. Robert Cargill

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,200
explained why Tilda Swinton was cast as the
Ancient One.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
And the answer is

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,060
to make sure the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t
ban their movie.

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,620
The Thing with the Ancient Once is it is Marvel’s
Kobayashi Maru.

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,580
Hey, now, I don’t believe in no-win scenarios!

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,820
But please, carry on.

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,640
“He originates from Tibet,

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,740
so if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place
and that he’s Tibetan,

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,240
you...risk the Chinese government going,

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,290
‘Hey, you know one of the biggest film-watching
countries in the world?

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,340
We’re not going to show your movie because
you decided to get political.’”

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,460
OK, I’m pretty sure the CCP is not arguing
that Tibet doesn’t exist.

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,680
In fact, according to state-run media,

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,540
“Tibetans now live a free, prosperous and
civilized life,

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,760
and with the loving care and efforts of the
Central Government.”

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,200
Just look at how happy she is!

39
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,159
And besides, Cargill later hit Control-Z on
that interview,

40
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,819
saying he wasn’t representing Marvel when
he said that.

41
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,329
But the problem is that Tibet is still a very
politically sensitive issue.

42
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,919
And if you mention it in your very expensive
movie,

43
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,739
you run the risk of being denied access

44
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,169
to one of the world’s most lucrative movie
markets.

45
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:33,719
Brad Pitt still has trouble getting his movies
shown in China

46
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,139
because he was in 7 Years in Tibet almost
20 years ago.

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,699
The Communist Party only allows 34 foreign
films a year

48
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,169
and they have to get approval from censors.

49
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,229
Specifically, the State Administration of
Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television,

50
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,580
or SAPPRFT.

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,020
I'm starting to see a pattern here.

52
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,999
So it makes sense Marvel would alter their
movie

53
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,569
about a hero standing up to evil...

54
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,459
by appeasing a tyrannical government.

55
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,839
And if this is Marvel kowtowing to the Chinese
government,

56
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,749
it wouldn’t be the first time.

57
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:09,629
For example, do you remember this scene from
Iron Man 3?

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,080
No, of course you don’t.

59
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:13,879
It was only in the Chinese version.

60
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,249
See, Iron Man 3 was a co-production with a
Chinese studio,

61
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:21,839
which means it didn't have to compete with
other foreign films

62
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,069
for one of those coveted 34 film slots a year.

63
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,609
And you can make more money this way.

64
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:33,729
A foreign film studio can only get 25% of
box office profits from China,

65
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:35,109
but in a co-production,

66
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:38,669
the foreign studio can keep almost 50%.

67
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,309
But that also means you have to shoot part
of your film in China,

68
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,919
cast Chinese actors, have Chinese investors,

69
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,879
or show "positive Chinese images."

70
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,790
And that's why Marvel added several totally
unnecessary scenes to the Chinese version

71
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,119
of Iron Man 3,

72
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,719
featuring famous Chinese actors,

73
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,819
and famous Chinese product placement.

74
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,510
And to appease Chinese censors,

75
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,459
Marvel allowed censors to vet the script for
the entire film.

76
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,540
And it worked! Iron Man 3 got into China

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,849
and made an extra 95 million dollars there!

78
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,779
Other movies have done it, too.

79
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:16,840
In the film Looper,

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,980
they changed the idealistic future from Paris
to Shanghai.

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,780
Because what could be more ideal

82
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,740
than another 60-plus years of Communist Party
rule?

83
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,180
And in the 2012 Red Dawn remake,

84
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,040
the enemy that attacked America was China....

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,819
when they shot it.

86
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,860
But after being criticized by a Chinese newspaper,

87
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,319
they reportedly spent a million dollars to
digitally change the baddie in post-production

88
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,930
to North Korea.

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,080
So for Doctor Strange,

90
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,180
Marvel had a real conundrum.

91
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,979
And they solved it by casting the spiritual
teacher as a white woman.

92
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,319
Who’s Celtic.

93
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,449
A group known for their love of Asian temples
and martial arts.

94
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:03,389
I mean, they could have cast a famous Chinese
actor...as...a...Tibetan.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,700
Ok, that’s also pretty racist

96
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,340
that whole all-Asians-look-the-same thing.

97
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,430
Hmm...ok.

98
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,400
Hey, I got it! If you’re going to change
it to a Celtic woman,

99
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,650
why not just change the character from Tibetan
to Han Chinese.

100
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,250
Knows kung fu, qigong, mystic powers

101
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,300
hey the CCP would probably actually love that!

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,419
Oh, but then Dr. Strange is still the white
hero goes to Asia for enlightenment

103
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,949
and then becomes the best trope.

104
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,329
Which is still a bad stereotype.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,640
And I guess the mystic powers might be a little
much,

106
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,170
since censors don't want to promote "superstition"
either.

107
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,940
Actually, in that case...

108
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,069
Doctor Strange may have a hard time getting
into China

109
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,860
even without Tibetan monks.

110
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,409
Wow, I guess this really is a no-win scenario.

111
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:55,650
Especially when you have filmmakers unabashedly
kowtowing to China.

112
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,909
Of course, Marvel did sort of solve this issue
in Iron Man 3.

113
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:03,550
The villain The Mandarin was played by Sir
Ben Kingsley,

114
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,710
who is...not Mandarin.

115
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,909
Marvel walked the edge of the whitewashing/racist
Fu Manchu villain issue

116
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,800
by writing the Mandarin as an unemployed actor

117
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,080
who was just a front for the real villain.

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,860
So I suppose there's a chance that Marvel
could pull something off

119
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,319
that adequately explains why a Celtic mystic
is living in the Himalayas.

120
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,580
So what do you think of Marvel’s decision
to change the Ancient One from a Tibetan dude

121
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,069
to a Celtic woman?

122
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,700
Leave your comments below. Once again I’m
Chris Chappell, see you next time.
