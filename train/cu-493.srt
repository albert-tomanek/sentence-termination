1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,730
On today's China Uncensored

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,840
the most racist thing you'll see on YouTube.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,360
Today.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,380
Probably.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,780
Hello and welcome to China Uncensored, I'm
your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,940
First, a warning.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,340
What you're about to see next

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,840
is one of the most painfully awkward things
we've ever shown you.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,710
Including that time former Chinese leader
and human hypnotoad Jiang Zemin

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,200
dance-yelled at Hong Kong reporters for asking
him a question.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,460
Former Miss Oregon USA and Apprentice contestant
Jennifer Murphy

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,820
released a video on Youtube of her performing
a song

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,280
for the pink carpet launch of her business,
Jennifer Murphy Beds.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Hmm, you know what?

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,120
Maybe I too could be ninja.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,320
I want to be ninja!

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,800
I want to be neenja!

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,800
I want to chop, chop, chop chow down

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,960
Take chow down to Chinatown.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,160
I want to be NEENJA!!

21
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:19,959
And it goes on for an excruciatingly long
4 minutes and 29 seconds.

22
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,310
It's about as cringeworthy as Rebecca Black's
Friday video,

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,800
but at least that company didn't produce something
this racist.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,920
I love Chinese food!

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,600
Yeah!

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,320
You know that it's true.

27
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,789
I stand corrected.

28
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,639
I don't know what, uh, inspired, Jennifer
Murphy

29
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:47,189
to pen her ode to wanting to be a Neenja.

30
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,369
Maybe she's a fan of Breakfast at Tiffany's,

31
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,569
or bad Kirsten Dunst cover songs.

32
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:56,989
I think I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese, I really think so.

33
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,810
But I do want to address some of the factual
inaccuracies in Jennifer Murphyâ€™s song.

34
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,259
Neenjas, by which I assume she means Ninjas,
are Japanese.

35
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,899
But they don't do karate moves.

36
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,230
And are therefore unlikely to chop people
down to Chinatown.

37
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,200
Which is Chinese.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,120
And as a practitioner of Shanxi Seven Star
Praying Mantis kung fu,

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,239
let me just clarify that it is possible to
learn Asian martial arts

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,260
without also learning a racist Asian accent.

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,989
When I shuo zhong wen,

42
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:30,980
I'm not making fun of Chinese people.

43
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,530
That's my own authentically bad Chinese pronunciation.

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,390
Which I apologize for.

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,420
Now, I don't think we should pile on Jennifer
Murphy, here.

46
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,030
Don't hate, educate.

47
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,579
Or something.

48
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,909
But it does show the extremely simplistic
way that many people view Asia.

49
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,799
There are so many countries in Asia with such
rich cultures,

50
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,159
that shouldn't be mashed up into one big chop-suey
stereotype.

51
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,810
That would be like reducing America to some
kind of giant machine-gun filled Disneyland.

52
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,689
I stand corrected.

53
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,099
You know, my favorite part of that website

54
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,640
is that they're proud sponsors of the Boy
Scouts of America.

55
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,930
But back the point.

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,379
Yes, Asian cultures are different and cool.

57
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,629
But we should learn about them instead of
stereotyping them.

58
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,750
Look, I put actual effort into my fascination
with Chinese culture.

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,260
Did Jennifer Murphy read Dream of the Red
Chamber?

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,420
Or Romance of the Three Kingdoms?

61
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,810
I don't think so.

62
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,960
Hmmm, Cao Cao looks a little different in
that version.

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,200
For more on this topic,

64
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,319
we go to China Uncensored humor ninja, Shelley
Zhang.

65
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,439
Greetings, Chris-san.

66
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,780
Uh, greetings. What's that on your face?

67
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,799
It's my ninja mask.

68
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,299
That's not a ninja mask, that's a facekini.

69
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,849
Well now it's not a ninja mask, after you
told everyone.

70
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:59,299
Should I...not tell them?

71
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,749
Isn't that educating the Jennifer Murphys
of the world?

72
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,560
Yes, exactly.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,450
Chris, the Jennifer Murphys of this world
don't want to be educated.

74
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,870
It's like Confucius said,

75
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,739
"Everything has its beauty, but not everyone
sees it."

76
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,450
So...they should just go on mixing up all
of their Asian stereotypes?

77
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,860
As Sima Qian said,

78
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,970
"History is not what it seems."

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,280
It's all mixed up already.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,380
Take ninjas.

81
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,630
The original ninjas weren't some guys sneaking
around

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,690
in black costumes killing people with throwing
stars.

83
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,410
They were more like undercover agents

84
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,530
who dressed up as farmers to blend in and
get information.

85
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,190
It's like being in the CIA.

86
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,060
How many CIA agents have desk jobs, right?

87
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,640
Yeah, I can relate to that.

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,320
The \hWestern idea of ninja assassins came
from a mix of Japanese legends,

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,280
a James Bond movie,

90
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
and Hong Kong martial arts flicks.

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,530
But like Mencius said,

92
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,010
"Once you know the truth, it's not fun anymore."

93
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,390
No one wants to dress like this for Halloween.

94
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,730
I guess that's true.

95
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:05,940
What's with all of the...Asian stuff you're
doing?

96
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,810
This?

97
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,100
Oh I'm just getting ready for the opening
of my new business venture Chris.

98
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,540
Madame Ming's Oriental Emporium and Opium
Den Restaurant.

99
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,450
Don't worry, it's not real opium.

100
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,990
Madame Ming?

101
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,700
Alliteration.

102
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,750
Plus no one can pronounce my last name correctly.

103
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,960
Why would you let people use your culture
as window dressing?

104
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,090
Chris, from the time I had to change my name
in kindergarten

105
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,940
so the other kids would stop pulling their
eyelids back and making ching chong noises,

106
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,470
I knew that people would only make fun of
my culture

107
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,250
or use it as decoration.

108
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,690
Why shouldn't I use that to my advantage?

109
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,680
I see it as part of my heritage.

110
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,740
Really?

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,560
Yes, my American heritage.

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,040
Just like our founding fathers reclaimed Yankee
Doodle

113
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,440
and made an insult into a patriotic song,

114
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,590
I'm reclaiming all of this Asian stereotype
stuff.

115
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,050
Someone called me a chink broad the other
day on the internet.

116
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,390
10 years ago, I would have been really hurt.

117
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,270
Now, I'm still hurt,

118
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,190
but you know what?

119
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,040
Chink broads is a great name.

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,530
That's what I'm calling my new podcast.

121
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,790
As Sun Tzu said,

122
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,680
"Don't get mad, get even."

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,050
Wow good for you.

124
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,590
Wait, Sun Tzu didn't say that.

125
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,240
No kidding.

126
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
Wait have all of your quotes been fake?

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,160
Yep.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,960
So you're basically trolling people.

129
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,880
Trolling is such a crude, Western, surface-level
word, Chris.

130
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,830
I am giving them the chance to enlighten themselves

131
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,110
to the subtle and mysterious wisdom of the
East.

132
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,000
Ok, but the people you're "enlightening" won't
get it.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,030
That's true, Chris.

134
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,580
But as Laozi once said,

135
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,560
"The Dao that can be told is not the eternal
Dao;

136
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,580
The name that can be named is not the eternal
name."

137
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,770
Is thatâ€¦

138
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,260
Yeah, that one's real.

139
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,420
Ok, but what does it mean?

140
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,780
Yeah, no idea.

141
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,640
Wow, youâ€™re right!

142
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,960
I think I prefer the fake

143
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
but easy to digest versions better.

144
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,660
Thanks, Shelley.

145
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,020
Wow, cool!!!!

146
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,420
What do you think of the ninja song?

147
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,600
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

148
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,980
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell, see you next time.
