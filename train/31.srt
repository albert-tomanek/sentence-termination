00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,580
Today's show is sponsored by
Simon Cowell's Owl Towels!

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,820
Made with real owls.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,280
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,560
I have an almost randomly selected article

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,500
from everybody's favorite
reliable source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,660
and these folks can't see it.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,480
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,920
And there's a special prize
for particularly good answers, which is:

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,980
Oh my!

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,280
And today we are talking about...
The Arctic Winter Games.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Oh ho ho ho *ho* ho!

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,460
What the hell was that?

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,360
That's one of the events.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,860
Yeah!

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,300
Best chuckle.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,000
In a cold environment.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,860
It's probably gonna be pretty parky out,

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,340
so I'd imagine your outdoor events
would be pretty quick, really.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,100
You need a hearty chuckle to warm you up.

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,180
You would; a hearty, belly chuckle.

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,580
Who's he?

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,000
He's the Chuckle Brother!

23
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,860
You're right, though, it is very cold.

24
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,700
Do you know where it's being hosted this year?

25
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,360
— Errr... the Arctic.
— The Arctic.

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,900
GARY: You made this mistake...
CHRIS: Twice in as many shows.

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,940
It's actually not in the Arctic this year.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,460
Well, that's a load of balls then!

29
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,500
Is it in the Antarctic?

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,260
No.

31
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,040
Oh. Are we talking, it's not in the Arctic
but on some kind of technicality, the nearest place?

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,660
It's just below the Arctic.

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,640
GARY: Yeaaah, right.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,360
Is that the old name for the Winter Olympics,
and is it in Sochi?

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,760
— No, it's not.
— Okay.

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,500
— No, not at all.
— Oh, good shout though. Good shout.

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,320
Svalbard!

38
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,460
These are entirely different games.

39
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,240
What could be so different that you can't do...?

40
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,460
I imagine this is crazy stuff
like hollowing out your own canoe.

41
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,760
We'll get to games in a minute.
First, where is it?

42
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,260
Tromsø? Alaska?

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,260
CHRIS: Greenland?
TOM: Fairbanks, Alaska. Point to you. [DING]

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,120
Oookay.

45
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,120
And you asked who was going to be involved in this...

46
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,520
Well, the catch here is that it's not for the world, it's for...

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,860
...Inuit and other indigenous peoples only.

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,720
Point. It's for all the cultures around the Arctic. [DING]

49
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,060
Ahh.

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
Can someone tell me any of the contingents,

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,220
rather than countries,
that are coming from all around the world...?

52
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,420
So the people that live in Greenland, and all the...

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,800
Yeah. Greenland is a contingent, yep. Point. [DING]

54
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,960
And Canada?

55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
Northwest Territories, yep, another point. [DING]

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
Finland, Lapland?

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,540
— The Sami people.
— Yes. Finland.

58
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,840
— So the general area up there, yeah. [DING]
— Yes.

59
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,440
The Yukon's coming up from Canada...

60
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,260
The Yamalo-Nenets from Russia.

61
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,660
MATT: That is a lovely word.
CHRIS: Cool.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,160
It is. I say, it's...

63
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,560
It's like I'm saying,
'Oh yes, the Wiltshire Yamalo-Nenets.'

64
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
'I know them... didn't they own most of Cheshire?'

65
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,960
This from the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.

66
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,460
Okr... aw, you can't have 'Yamalo-Nenets'
and then tip it off with 'Okrug' on the end.

67
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,020
I've got an ok-rug in my hall.

68
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,540
[Laughter]

69
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,920
So, we may as well get to this, then:

70
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,200
What kind of events are being played
at the Arctic Winter Games?

71
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,740
That aren't — I mean, there's the obvious ones, yes.

72
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,240
There's alpine skiing, and there's figure skating,

73
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,980
there's ice hockey and the games to do with that.

74
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,700
What are the ones you wouldn't find at the Olympics?

75
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,000
So is it speed snow structure building?
Out of snow bricks?

76
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,180
Speed-gloo!

77
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Ooh. It's a good idea, but no.

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,460
Iditarod? Dog sled racing?

79
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,700
Yes! Dog mushing. [DING]

80
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,140
Erm... snowmobile racing.

81
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,240
Ohh!

82
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,820
Ooh. Now that'd be lovely...
There is no mechanically assisted ones in here.

83
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,400
There's biathlon, in which you have
a gun to mechanically assist...

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,620
Is there a Flintstones-style snowmobile?
[Laughter]

85
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,920
That's called alpine skiing,
and I'm giving you a point for it. [DING]

86
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,500
That'd be great, though.
Snowmobile racing would look brilliant.

87
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
Well, X Games, they do it, don't they? Winter X Games?

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah. There are a couple you wouldn't expect in here,

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,420
which are very much more...

90
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,920
Elementary rocketry.

91
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,620
...indoor sport.

92
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,120
Squash.

93
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,120
— Erm... close...
— Yes.

94
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
— Badminton.
— Point! [DING] Thank you.

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,180
What! F*** off!
I say 'elementary rocketry' — not right.

96
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,480
— He says 'badminton'...
— Yup.

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,520
At least that's a sport!
[Laughter]

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,960
CHRIS: True, that's true...
GARY: Are you telling me rocketry is not a sport?

99
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,500
It's not in the X Games yet.

100
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,840
Eh, it should be.

101
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,180
I don't know if they have, like,
a Double X Games, for the...

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,640
— Or Triple X Games, I was just thinking that...
— Triple X Games!

103
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,540
Now that I would pay to see.

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,660
MATT: You'd probably have to pay.
GARY: You probably would have to, yes!

105
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,040
In fact, I'm fairly certain,
should any of our viewers Google that,

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,060
you will in fact be able to pay to see that.

107
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,460
Now, there's one here
which you're never going to get the name of,

108
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,860
which is called 'Dene Games', D-E-N-E.

109
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,020
I may be pronouncing that wrong; it may be Dené.
[NB: It is.]

110
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
And there is no reference to this anywhere on Wikipedia,

111
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,240
so before we started, I went out
and had a look at what these are.

112
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,600
And these are traditional forms of competition
of the Northern cultures.

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
Okay.

114
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,800
Do you want to guess what they are?

115
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,080
Because they are interesting, to say the least.

116
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,480
Are they sports?

117
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Is this where you end up with
weird things like toe-wrestling and...

118
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Oh! You know, you're pretty damn close.

119
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,500
— Yeah.
— It's that kind of thing.

120
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
Thumb wars, that kind of thing.

121
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,620
So I'm going to give you the names,

122
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,620
if you can tell me what this involves...

123
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,200
Stick Pull.

124
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,500
Is that where you try...

125
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Oh... two guys holding a greased stick, isn't it?

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,600
Something like that, pulling against each other?

127
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,880
It's not greased, but yeah.
It's the one who ends up with the stick wins,

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,040
Or the one who drags
the other person's hand past them.

129
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,600
Oh, all right, okay...

130
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,560
Yeah, because I've seen that. I think they do that
up on one of the northern Scottish isles as well.

131
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh, right.

132
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,140
Because that culture feeds in
from Nordic and things as well.

133
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
— Yes, it will, yeah...
— So I think I've seen that one.

134
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,120
How about Finger Pull?

135
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,880
Pull my finger!

136
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,620
Well, you could — I mean...

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,300
You know what? Point. [DING]

138
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
Is it who pulls the finger and farts loudest?
Seriously, tell me.

139
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,980
— No. No it's not.
— Oh, come on...

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,700
Is it like a game of peanuts?

141
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,980
Have you each got hold of
the other person's one finger and...

142
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
— Yep.
— First one to scream out loses?

143
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,320
It's not first one to scream out.
I'm giving you the point... [DING]

144
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,820
It's the first one to —
well, they take turns defensive and offensive.

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,240
It's the first person to straighten the other person's finger.

146
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,680
— Ohhh!
— Ohhh!

147
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,200
And according to the thing I'm looking at,
they have buckets of ice water on hand...

148
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,140
There is a judge who's making sure
you're not doing jerking motions

149
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,980
that will dislocate something, but other than that...

150
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,760
CHRIS: It's a smooth sort of...
TOM: Yeah.

151
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,160
Woooh.

152
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,000
That sounds quite painful, actually.

153
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,900
It almost... well, right, I'll, er...
I'll happily try...

154
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,320
— Everybody... it's live Finger Pull.
— Do you want to make sure we're in shot here?

155
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,820
Hang on, we need to commentate.

156
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,440
Hold on. Right, let me see how this goes.

157
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
I can't even see because of...!

158
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,860
I think... I wrap my finger round like that...

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
— Tom Scott, wrapping his...
— (There we go. And now I have to try...)

160
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
— Tom Scott is going for an offensive...
— (Ugh!)

161
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,200
— Who's offensive, who's defensive?
— I'm offensive!

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
GARY: Tom Scott is offensive. We all knew this anyway.
CHRIS: I do find him offensive.

163
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Erm, he's pulling very hard on Matt Gray's finger...

164
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,780
That's actually surprisingly difficult.

165
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,080
— Let's try it the other way.
— Okay, yeah. Go.

166
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,620
Okay, and Matt Gray now offensive...

167
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,380
— Aagh!
— Ah! Well, that lasted.

168
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Okay! Matt is better at this game than I am.
[Laughter]

169
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,620
Quite easy, really.

170
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,760
Does anyone want to make a comment
about the strength of Matt Gray's right hand?

171
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,000
Anyone?

172
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,060
Not me, at the moment...
[Laughter]

173
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
...sit here and be a little bit
disappointed in myself...

174
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Well, everybody...
Matt, we've found where you're going next.

175
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,800
It's the Ice Games for you.

176
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,420
As Britain's representative in the Finger Pull.

177
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,640
[Laughter]

178
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,720
Can you imagine,
you're the country's champion finger-puller?

179
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,540
How many fetes and stuff are you ever gonna open?

180
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,560
Pull my finger?
[Laughter]

181
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,740
Oh, that's a sponsorship, if ever there was one.

182
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,880
Erm... Pole Push.

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,880
— Do you push a pole?
— Is it where you push a pole?

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
You do, but I'm going to need more than that...

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,820
Have you got two teams
trying to hold it up or something?

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,980
— I'm going to give you the point there, Gary.
— Oh, wow, okay.

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,060
It's basically reverse tug-of-war. [DING]

188
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,560
— In that, rather than trying to pull the team past...
— Okay yeah, you're trying to drive the other team...

189
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
You're trying to drive the other team past...

190
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,440
A back marker rather than a centre marker.

191
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,460
I like the idea of people who play these games

192
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,920
going to see a tug-of-war contest
and yelling that 'You're doing it wrong!'

193
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
'Wrong way, you fools!'

194
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,340
There are two more in this category.

195
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
One is Hand Games.

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,100
And this is the simplest damn thing,

197
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,860
and I can play it right now if there is,
er, something around here... here we go.

198
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,040
We can literally play Hand Games right now...

199
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,240
Tom's opened his wallet. Bloody hell.

200
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
TOM: Which hand?
MATT: Right hand.
GARY: Left.

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,400
Therefore, one of us wins.

202
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,900
Matt Gray wins! Point. [DING]

203
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,320
Seriously?
[Laughter]

204
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,940
That is the Hand Games.

205
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,740
And there are all sorts of regulations
on what you can and cannot do as a distraction.

206
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,200
Like have a live fish in your hand when you open it.

207
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,040
— Yeah.
— Magic.

208
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,940
I want to see that in a stadium
of eighty thousand people.

209
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,960
Yeah!

210
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,160
All I'm seeing is a slightly more interesting
version of watching Derren Brown.

211
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,340
Aw, he'd be banned outright, wouldn't he,
the wizard. The sorcerer.

212
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,640
He'd have in one hand, no coin,
and in the other hand,

213
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,760
a coin that then disappears
and reappears in the other.

214
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,660
Magicians.

215
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,040
The last one is the wonderfully titled Snow Snake.

216
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,100
Heh heh, right.

217
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,640
That's not a cock joke, Gary.

218
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Oh, I think you'll find it is.
[Laughter]

219
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,560
Please tell me it's a spitting cobra covered in snow.

220
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,700
No.

221
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,320
Crawl as far as you can in the snow, on your belly.

222
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,520
You're not crawling, yourself.

223
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,640
— No, I'm not. I'm sat in a chair.
— Your wife.

224
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,460
Drag someone through the snow,
make it look like they're crawling.

225
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,140
No, you're definitely...
You're getting an object to move through the snow.

226
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,500
A snake.

227
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,560
— No.
— A rock.

228
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Stick?

229
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,520
Cocktail stick.

230
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm going to let you have 'stick'. Spear. [DING].

231
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,080
Oh, all right. Okay, yeah.

232
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
Er, so you've got...

233
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,860
Do you glide it along the ground?

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,780
Underhand spear slide sort of affair.

235
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,220
And a point for underhand. [DING]

236
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,980
— Ah!
— Exactly right. That is Snow Snake.

237
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,560
GARY: Well, it couldn't be overarm, could it.
MATT: It's like long curling.

238
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,600
That's spearing.

239
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,960
Thunk! 'Oh, no.'

240
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,460
You have an icy surface,
and you see how far you can send your spear.

241
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,380
Cool!

242
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
There is another set of games...

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,700
So you have the Arctic Winter Games,
you have the Winter Olympics,

244
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,820
and then you also have
the World Eskimo Indian Olympics, WEIO...

245
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,320
which is held in July or August.

246
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,300
Ah?

247
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,920
Which is 'games rooted in ancestral
hunting and survival techniques'.

248
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,000
Does anyone want to take a guess
on a couple of the events that are...

249
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,680
Laugh at Bear Grylls.

250
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Real Life Canoe Battleship.

251
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,340
— Wait, what?
— 'F-3!'

252
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,140
Yeah! Lob a rock.

253
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,640
Just a big tarpaulin hung over the middle,
with a little, I dunno...

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,300
a little ice pool or something,
and bunging rocks over the side, yeah.

255
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
— Are either of us right?
— No!

256
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,060
Not even close.

257
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,280
There is a game called Drop The Bomb.

258
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,340
Is that where you go s*** in someone's front yard?

259
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Because on ice, you would need the grip and everything

260
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,520
to be able to get away with that, wouldn't you.
[Laughter]

261
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,780
Not leaving footprints and stuff that can be traced.

262
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,040
Er, Drop the Bomb.
No, it's, erm...

263
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,720
A person kind of lying face down,
arms outstretched as a cross...

264
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,000
— Right...
— Three spotters position them,

265
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,620
Participant tightens all their muscles,
the spotters lift the body...

266
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,780
and have to carry them as far as possible
before their arms sag

267
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,880
and they can't hold themselves in that position any more.

268
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,020
MATT: Ah... I think we did that at school.
GARY: We are trying this *now*.

269
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
We also have the Ear Pull.

270
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,260
Does anyone want to take a guess how that works?

271
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,220
Er, that's...!

272
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Is it something a bit like that?

273
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,660
It is, isn't it?

274
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,120
...point. [DING]

275
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,780
Not strictly. There are two people
sitting down facing each other,

276
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,040
with twine looped around each other's ears.

277
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,840
GARY: Ooo.
CHRIS: Oh yeah, I've seen this one as well, actually.

278
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,760
MATT: Yes, I've seen that.
CHRIS: Yeah and you pull away like that.

279
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,820
TOM: Yeah.
CHRIS: Yeah, I've seen this one on the telly as well.

280
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,640
How's it work then? So...

281
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,380
It's just a loop of string that
hooks round the back of your ears,

282
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,260
and you just pull away.

283
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
And it says here, it is 'stamina to pain'.

284
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,740
— Yeah.
— Yeah.

285
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,780
That is all it is. It's an endurance competition
rather than speed or agility.

286
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,380
You see, and they all laughed
when you got that dodgy Sky subscription

287
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,180
to the Indigenous Peoples' Satellite Network.

288
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,220
I don't know how I've seen all these things!
But several of them I've seen, yeah.

289
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,920
You just — at one point, have you got
a 'lost week' or something?

290
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
More than one.
[Laughter]

291
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,160
Now the photograph's going to come up
of you competing in the events.

292
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,060
I don't remember any of this!
I've got all these medals, though...

293
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,520
'He is from the South.
He is known as Joel of the Sun.'

294
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,140
Put this on late at night,
around about half eleven, post-pub.

295
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,440
Just after the pubs have...

296
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,260
We would all enjoy watching men trying to pull each other's ears off.

297
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
See, that's what they could do on BBC Three.

298
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,260
Yeah! Just toe wrestling and gut barging

299
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,920
and stuff like that as well, give it a proper international...

300
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,300
Cheese rolling once a year...

301
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,520
I don't get that.

302
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,940
What, cheese rolling?

303
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,860
It's just running downhill, innit?

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,900
It just — well, it's downhill...

305
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,360
With a cheese that can kill you.

306
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,000
It's more so rag-dolling down a hill...

307
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,340
...with a cheese that can kill you.

308
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,040
As long as there's an already dubbed-on 'boing!'
for every time someone hits the floor.

309
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,860
I've got 'Too Much Cheese Can Kill You'
going round my head.

310
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
CHRIS: Too much...! [Laughs]

311
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,540
GARY: [singing] '...cheese can kill you!'

312
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,420
'If you can't make up your mind...'

313
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,560
[Laughter]

314
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,540
'Torn between the Edam
and the Gouda you left behind...'

315
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,180
— Yes!
— Heyyy!

316
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,480
'You're heading for disaster
'cos you didn't see the rind...'

317
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
— Ohhh.
— Yes!

318
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,380
'Too much cheese will kill you...'

319
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
ALL: '...every time.'

320
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
On that note...
You know, I keep doing this, but...

321
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,240
Gary, congratulations, you win the show!
[Laughter and applause]

322
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,260
— You've won the Freedom of the City.
— Ah!

323
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,820
No, sorry, you've won the Free Dom of the City.
So do enjoy him.

324
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,040
Ohh.

325
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,400
Yes, sir.

326
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,460
— Until then, that's been Matt Gray...
— Bye-bye!

327
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,680
That's been Gary Brannan...

328
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
That's been Chris Joel...

329
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,720
I've been Tom Scott, and we'll see you next time!

330
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
That was our season finale. Thanks for watching!

331
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,380
If you've liked the series, then do let us know.

332
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,240
