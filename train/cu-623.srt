00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,190
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,150
sticky rice and subverting state power in
China.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,099
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:13,940
As you can see,

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,189
I'm back in Cici Li’s kitchen.

6
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:17,779
And you know what that means!

7
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:20,760
Another long-winded talk about Chinese culture
from me

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,349
before you get the link to delicious food.

9
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,900
Unless you just go ahead and click the link
below,

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,380
but I know you wouldn't do that.

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,980
You won’t, because I’m about to tell you
how the origins of this

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,370
—zongzi—

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,270
could undermine the rule of the Chinese Communist
Party.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,320
You know, I don’t feel China Uncensored
is really that unique.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,079
If anything, I just view myself as one in
a long line

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,899
of Confucian gentleman scholars who criticize
the ruling regime.

17
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,039
Now wait!

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,899
Isn’t Confucianism that lame old philosophy

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,420
that says you should do whatever the ruler says?

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,120
Oh ho ho, no my friend.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,859
Confucianism actually has a long tradition

22
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,970
of the lonely scholar standing up to the ruler
for what’s right.

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,090
Take my main man, Qū Yuán.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,810
Qu Yuan lived in one of the bloodiest, craziest
periods of Chinese history,

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,750
the Warring States period.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,050
A bunch of feudal states, uh,

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,180
warring as they tried to conquer each other.

28
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,450
Qu Yuan was an advisor in the state of Chu.

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,090
Their neighbor was the state of Qín.

30
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,760
That’s Qin as in the one that about a hundred
years later

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,380
will conquer its neighbors and set up the
first dynasty to rule all of China.

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,810
Anyway, the ruler of Qin contacts the king
of Chu.

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,280
He offers the king an “alliance”

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,580
that will totally not result in conquest and
assassination.

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,420
Qu Yuan, who’s an adviser to the king, is
all like,

36
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,950
“Your majesty, this alliance is a really
bad idea.”

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,410
But the king is like, “You're banished.”

38
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,200
While in exile,

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Qu Yuan learns of Qin’s sudden but predictable
betrayal

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,260
and the complete destruction of Chu.

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,480
He writes one of China’s most influential
and epic poetic works

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,979
called the Lí Sāo, or Encountering Sorrow.

43
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,810
And then he drowns himself in a river.

44
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,470
And though Qu Yuan was not a Confucian himself,

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,570
for thousands of years,

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,260
Confucian scholar officials looked to him
as an exemplar

47
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,970
known for fierce loyalty to his king,

48
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,580
but also, paradoxically,

49
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,500
his individualism and absolute commitment
to his values.

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,920
Interestingly, the Chinese Communist Party
in its early days

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
promoted Qu Yuan as a model of patriotism.

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,000
They even used his whole “criticizing those
in power” philosophy

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,900
to criticize the ruling Nationalist Party.

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,180
But once the CCP took over and became the
ruling power themselves,

55
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,780
things were a little different.

56
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,430
Actually, Mao Zedong often talked about modeling
himself

57
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,000
after his favorite historical emperor, Qin
Shihuang.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,510
Yes, that’s the guy who united China under
the Qin Dynasty.

59
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,480
And Qin Shihuang famously burned books with
competing ideologies,

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,120
including books from the state of Chu.

61
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,680
But fairly recently, ancient bamboo scrolls
from the state of Chu were discovered.

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
And guess what?

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,000
They talk about a form of Confucianism

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,760
that believes officials should be chosen by
merit.

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,810
They even suggest the ruler should be chosen
based on merit

66
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,860
instead of the hereditary system that came
to dominate China’s dynasties later on.

67
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,200
In other words, unlike what the Communist
Party says today,

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,819
the Chinese might have been ready for an early
form of democracy

69
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,500
or at least genuine meritocracy 2,500 years
ago.

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,080
If you’d like to learn more about Qu Yuan
and his impact,

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,880
I highly recommend the book “Madman of Ch'u”
by Laurence A. Schneider.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,000
Anyway, Qu Yuan has been honored for generations.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,010
One way is the annual Dragon Boat Festival.

74
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,550
It’s celebrated with dragon boat racing
and a steamed sticky rice dish called zongzi.

75
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,500
What does that have to do with Qu Yuan?

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,680
As the story goes,

77
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,569
after Qu Yuan threw himself into the river
to commit suicide,

78
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,250
local villagers raced out in boats to recover
his body.

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,459
When they couldn’t find it,

80
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,209
they began throwing zongzi into the river

81
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,480
so the fish would eat that instead of Qu Yuan’s
body.

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,500
In other words, the Dragon Boat Festival

83
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,250
celebrates a man who believed that people
should stand up to authority

84
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,690
in order to do what’s right.

85
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,820
And in the eyes of the current Communist Party,

86
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,940
isn’t that subversion of state power?

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
So today, I’ll be joining Cici from Food
Paradise

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
to show you how to make zongzi!

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,300
Cici? Cici?

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Yes Chris? Oh, I didn’t want to listen to your
long conversation,

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
so I went ahead and clicked on the link.

92
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,900
Boy, those zongzi were tasty!

93
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,639
You ate them without me?

94
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,850
Sorry, you seemed busy.

95
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,350
Hey guys! Well if you want to learn to say the name zongzi in Chinese

96
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,200
and also the names of other Chinese snacks

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,720
and as well as general useful Chinese words and phrases,

98
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,460
check out my channel, Learn Chinese Now.

99
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,350
And if you want to see me whoop Ben and Chris’s
butts making zongzi,

100
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,680
check out our video on Off the Great Wall.

101
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,169
Yeah, that’s not how it’s gonna go down.

102
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,969
Anyway, I’m Chris Chappell.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,900
And I’ll see you...

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,100
in all three of those videos.
