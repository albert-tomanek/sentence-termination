1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,360
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,780
Joining me today, he reads books you know,
it's Chris Joel.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,260
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,200
"All I'm gonna tell you is the whole thing will need ripping out, burning, and starting again, Vicar."

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,180
And the bounciest man on the Internet, Matt Gray

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,780
Insert soliloquy here...

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,960
Thanks Matt.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,840
In front of me I've got an article from 
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,660
Every fact they get right is a a point and a ding [DING].

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,120
And there's a special prize for
particularly good answers which is

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,940
And today was are talking about
Camille Flammarion.

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,140
Hello foreign parts.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,240
-Yes... absolutely.
-Hello.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,680
Any guesses as to which foreign part?

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,560
"France"?

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,960
Point. Straight off the bat. [DING] Yes.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,860
And the wheel spins
and lands on France!

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,860
Again!

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,360
The wheel is 50% France.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,380
"France... rest of the world."

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,420
Flammarion?

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,300
Flammarion.

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,380
OK, we are going to need an occupation here.

24
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,660
Yeah, we are. Astronomer and author.

25
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,740
It's a long article, so I'm happy to give you that.

26
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,640
Astr-author?

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,860
Astr-author. Yes, he was a-str-author.

28
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,340
So he wrote books about astronomy, 
that were either fact or fiction.

29
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,120
Well that's the thing. They were both. 
I'm going to give you a point. [DING]

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,900
"Faction!"

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,220
Isn't that just lies?

32
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,480
Oh! Faction is already a word.

33
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,780
He wrote both science fiction and popular science

34
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,400
God, I hope he didn't get those two mixed up.

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
Ah! Yes, well, funny you should mention that, Gary.

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,240
"I have the manuscripts here of my
important scientific work...

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,180
"and my one here about men with 
bum-faces from Venus.

38
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,520
"But they both went to the same printer
 on the same day, in the same envelope!"

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,660
"We can completely agree with Professor whatever..."

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,400
-Flammarion!
-Flammarion.

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,860
He was not a professor.

42
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,580
"...on gravitational waves, but the bum faced goats from Mars, are a completely different concept."

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, I'm not going to give you
 bum faced aliens from Mars

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
-But I will...
-Well, there's a first!

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,700
I am going to give you a point for Mars [DING]
He was one of the people who...

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,080
Canals on Mars?

47
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,860
-Point! [DING] Absolutely right.
-There we go!

48
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,360
Percival Lowell in America, was the
 one who came up with the theory.

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,380
But yes, he thought there were artificial canals on Mars.

50
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,840
What? For boating?

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeah! Big, big canal boating system.

52
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,220
Big recreational holiday market out there, to be honest.

53
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,220
Go to Mars. Get a narrowboat.

54
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,260
Pootle along the canals of Mars.

55
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,400
At a gentle four miles per Mars hour.

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,320
The canals on Mars were actually what?

57
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,300
Motorways.

58
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,140
Just rain covered motorways. When they looked at them through the telescope, the light glinted off them.

59
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,560
-It was an easy mistake. Anyone could have made it.
-Swans landing on it, all the time.

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
All the bloody time.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
Cobwebs on the telescope?

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,760
Erm... not quite.

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,060
Not quite.

64
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,020
They were natural formations, weren't they?

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,940
No!

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,860
No, not at all. 
And they weren't artificial formations either.

67
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,980
So they weren't formations at all!

68
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,980
I will give you a point. [DING]

69
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,140
Can you explain what they were?

70
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,740
No!

71
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,580
I was just being a pedant about what you'd said.

72
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,580
There are two possible explanations for the canals.

73
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,380
-One...
-They're canals!

74
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,720
OK, there are three...

75
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,080
But one of them was definitely wrong.
 There are still two, that are... possibly...

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,320
One is that there was a formation... 
something they saw, they misinterpreted.

77
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,180
The other...

78
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,540
is an optical illusion.

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,960
Like the one when you go to the fair and you walk in and the mirror makes you look all small and fat?

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,780
Yeah, that it made a load of...

81
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,880
Watch it! Watch it, watch it... 
Watch it!

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,860
It made a load of points look like lines that
connected up, through a slightly dodgy telescope.

83
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,520
But! Why canals?

84
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,820
It could have been rivers or...

85
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,260
-They were straight lines.
-They were very straight.

86
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,780
So they looked more like canals than rivers.

87
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,560
So they looked like irrigation canals.

88
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,600
You know what? If I had the ability to do
one gigantic s***-stirring effort

89
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,240
I would now transport myself to Mars...
with a canal boat!

90
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,300
Just be there waving.

91
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,920
No. Put it out on Mars and half bury it, 
like it's been there a long time.

92
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,400
When the next Mars rover comes over the hill.
"Holy s***!"

93
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,100
I suppose the Curiosity rover's the size of a big car.

94
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah!

95
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,760
So if you make it shorter and longer, 
it's a narrowboat rover.

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,460
If you just put, I don't know, some...

97
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,380
expanding foam sealant around the windows and doors. I'm sure it would be airtight enough.

98
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,500
I mean let's face it, the moon lander was
 made of tin foil. A canal boat's way stronger!

99
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,020
Hello NASA?

100
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,460
Yes, it's Matt Gray.

101
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,380
Put narrowboats on Mars.

102
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,840
They've gone.

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,200
See, this is how the world gets sorted.

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,160
Yeah! Matt Gray.

105
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,940
"Hello World Organisation, it is Matt Gray!"

106
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,840
So... Flammarion was...

107
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,140
I'm going to try...
I'm going to try.

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm not even off tangent. 
We're talking about canals on Mars.

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,340
Yeah, yeah!

110
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,620
Oh yeah!

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,540
This is perfectly on stream!

112
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,220
How did we stay relevant?!

113
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,980
It's a skill!

114
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,840
I dunno? Six years later, how are we still relevant?

115
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,100
Flammarion was both scientist and...
 very much not a scientist.

116
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,380
So he was exposed to
two very different lines of thought.

117
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,840
One of them was very much scientific method.
Who in his era would have been

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,120
the person, standing at the front of,
"this is science against religion"?

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
The chief scientist?

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Darwin!

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
Point. [DING] Exactly right. 
And then on the other hand,

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,660
the rising popularity of what
less scientific movement?

123
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,580
Roller skating?

124
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,180
Not really... 
I mean, it is a movement!

125
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,240
Very movement! Straight line,
forwards or backwards. Yes.

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,220
Bowel?

127
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,940
Not a bowel movement! No, we're not having...

128
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,360
Chris, save us!

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,140
Cubism?

130
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,540
Way too early.

131
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,080
I don't know!

132
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,440
Spiritualism.

133
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,380
-The idea that...
-"Knock three times...."

134
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,320
Yes, the idea that you could talk to the dead.

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,380
So he was astronomer, mystic and story teller.
In a time when...

136
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,080
Liar, liar... and liar!

137
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,760
No, astronomer!

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,740
This is the thing. This is where astronomy and astrology
hadn't quite sorted each other out yet.

139
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,760
Diverged, yeah.

140
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,480
So in 1907, he wrote that dwellers on Mars
had tried to communicate with the Earth.

141
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,420
Naturally.

142
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,340
And also that what was heading towards Earth?

143
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
-Cylinders...
-Following cylinders!

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,500
No one would have believed in the last
 years of the nineteenth century

145
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,740
that canals on Mars were being observed...

146
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,460
No. Not in this case.
Something from a little bit further out.

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
Asteroid?

148
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,860
Asteroid.

149
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,880
Aste... Uranus?!

150
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
You're very close with asteroid.

151
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Comet?

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,540
Point! [DING] for that. Comet is absolutely right.

153
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,760
A seven tailed comet.

154
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,200
Are you sure that's not just a very
 badly focused telescope again?

155
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,460
Well that was the thing, yes!

156
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,540
It seems to be swirling in a spiral!

157
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,860
A small comet's seen, it did not have seven tails.

158
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,840
"He's using the kaleidoscope again, isn't he?"

159
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,800
They are in a formation, where there
 is one at the top, one on each side...

160
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,680
and there is an upside down one at the bottom.

161
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,280
Oh ****ing hell! Giant spiders in space!

162
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,980
Along those lines, 1910, what
astronomical event revisited us?

163
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,760
Halley's.

164
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,860
Yeah, you got there first again, have a point. [DING]

165
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,660
He caused a bit of a fuss, did Flammarion.

166
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,440
Earth was actually going to pass through
 the tail of Halley's comet. For the first time.

167
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,340
And we also, for the first time, had
spectroscopic data on what it was composed of.

168
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,920
So they looked at the light coming
out of it, to find out what...

169
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,600
To find out what elements and what stuff
was in the tail, that Earth was going to pass through.

170
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,740
I'm surprised they could do that then.

171
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,860
Yep! 1910.

172
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,480
It's the first time they were able to do it.
 So it was a close approach.

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,220
We were passing through the tail.
What did Flammarion say...

174
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,740
"We're all going to die!"

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,700
Point! [DING]

176
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,160
But how?

177
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,380
Bearing in mind they now knew what the tail was composed of and what some of the stuff...

178
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,040
Poisoning! Asphyxiation!

179
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,540
Yes! Absolutely right. Poison gas.
 [DING]

180
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,520
There was a cyanogen, which is (CN)₂.
There are brackets there, so it's 2 of each.

181
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,480
Colourless, toxic gas.

182
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,380
And apparently he thought
"well that's in the tail of the comet."

183
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,380
"We're going to pass through the tail of the comet."

184
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,480
"WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!"

185
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,780
He was wrong.

186
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,300
Hello!

187
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,640
No way! Really?

188
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,600
He said it would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet.

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,760
Did he use the words 'snuff out'?

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,360
Erm, I...

191
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,380
-I hope so.
-Being French...

192
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,760
"Ze snuff."

193
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,400
I would have thought he would have done that in French.

194
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,820
I believe that is a translation.

195
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,980
"C'est buggered!"

196
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
What did it cause?

197
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,340
PANIC!

198
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,400
To a certain extent. I'll give you a point. [DING]

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,740
MILD DISQUIET!

200
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,220
Witty headlines!

201
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,340
A jump in sale of wine.

202
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,880
A jump in the sale of something.

203
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,760
Lifeboats?

204
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,480
Umbrellas?

205
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Wills?

206
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,500
Gas masks?

207
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,880
Point.
[DING]

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,560
Absolutely right. So in 1910, he essentially
caused a slight panic buy of gas masks.

209
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,120
Could be handy a few years later, eh?

210
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,260
-I refrained from making that joke.
-That's not unfair...

211
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,600
But yes, that was one of the things.
Then he wrote a series of science fiction books.

212
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,160
One of which was called 'Real and Imaginary Worlds'.

213
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,600
-I'm going to guess it was more imaginary than real.
-I can only think of one real one he knew anything about.

214
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,180
And he was also wrong.

215
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,680
Now we have talked about psychics,
 mediums and all this before

216
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,520
Several times.

217
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,960
Several times, but the approach 
here was somewhat different.

218
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,880
So are we looking for the scientific analysis of ghosts?

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,600
Point. [DING]

220
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,140
Yes, he was looking at it from the scientific method.

221
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,280
And... for the time...  was remarkably skeptical.

222
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,880
OK.

223
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,060
There is a wonderful quote here.

224
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,500
"It is infinitely to be regretted that we cannot trust the loyalty of mediums. They almost always cheat."

225
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,160
How very dare he.

226
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,640
That doesn't mean he didn't believe it.

227
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,040
But he was certainly very skeptical about it.

228
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,360
He thought they were doing it the wrong way?

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,740
He thought it might be possible, but...

230
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,120
What he needed wasn't a medium.

231
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
And I know it would be very hard to find in France,

232
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
but he needed a well done.

233
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,780
I'm not biscuiting that! I'm just... I'm not!

234
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,920
Oh come on, that's beautiful.

235
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,080
That's good stuff.

236
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,300
It's a rare thing in France.

237
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,140
Have I mentioned before
I've actually been to a spiritualist service?

238
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,240
-Is that like a church service?
-Yeah.

239
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,820
No, no, he just took his spiritualist in for a tune up(!)

240
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,320
No... no!

241
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
-I actually meant...
-"The readings are a bit off. They need..."

242
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,920
-I meant this as a valid question.
-Yeah, as in...

243
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,640
I went to be serviced by a spiritualist?

244
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
No, no, I had a day...

245
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,420
That's very different, Matt!

246
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,220
I can tell you now, that's not what happened!

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,660
No, no. I'd been out with a friend of mine.
I'd had a few. I will admit this. And I walked past.

248
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,920
And there is a Spiritualist church, near where I lived.
 And there was a sign in the window saying...

249
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,280
"Display of Mediumship Tonight".

250
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,700
And I thought... in for a laugh!

251
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,620
Yeah, OK.

252
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,540
So I snuck in. I went up, and in the first
 row of this building. It was like this... church!

253
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,800
They had fitted it out with pews
 and a pulpit and an altar and the lot!

254
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,560
And this bloke was stood in the pulpit, doing...

255
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,180
effectively, live spiritualist... this was the big religion of the early 20th century.

256
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,280
This even took in Rudyard Kipling
 after his son was killed.

257
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,180
There were thousands. People were really
 into it and it still hangs on in certain parts.

258
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,260
Is this like the American stuff?

259
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,480
Yeah, exactly the same, yeah.
But he's doing live. It was...

260
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,720
s***!

261
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,140
I can't put it any different, it was ####!

262
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,620
I was expecting any other word there.

263
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,440
I walked in. I thought, "OK, I'm... You know, there's lots of older ladies in there". And I thought, well, as the new...

264
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,220
bloke in the room...

265
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,200
if he wants to show off...

266
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,500
he's going to pick on me.

267
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,180
He could... I'd had a few. I'm open to anything,
 and if he could pick something out that...

268
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,740
he doesn't know, I'll be genuinely impressed.
If nothing else, in his skill at cold reading.

269
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,980
He just stood there, and this is a
mill town in the north of England...

270
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,520
right, and goes... "Now, I'm... I'm getting the vision of someone... who worked... in a factory."

271
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,420
"Maybe on some kind of cloth... machine?"

272
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,880
"They were called... Edith."

273
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,980
And at one point, someone would go "Oh yeah! Yeah, that's my sister's friend, when I was younger."

274
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,880
That...  far away...  a link!

275
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,580
"Now! He's saying something about money."

276
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,580
I mean... I could do this s***!

277
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,660
"Is there a problem with..."
There was one were he said something like

278
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,580
"Is there a problem with a child?"

279
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,360
And she's kinda, "No!"

280
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,220
"Erm? Oh, the readings are very fuzzy
 from the other side."

281
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,380
"Is there a problem with children or young people at all?"

282
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,540
"No?"

283
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,840
"It's for the future!"

284
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,820
Oh yes!

285
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,540
And that's how you do it!

286
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,240
At that point, I gave an audible "HA!" from the back.

287
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,460
It was terrible. I could do it.

288
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,660
Stand in front of a room. Say some old people's
 names. And if you get it wrong, just go

289
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,120
"Oh, it'll make sense one day." and carry on!

290
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
Is this a religion?

291
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,240
Yeah! They sang hymns and everything at the end.

292
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,540
Then had a glass of orange squash. wobbled out and got a samosa butty on the way home.

293
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,280
And got what?

294
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,180
A samosa butty.

295
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,040
How northern is that phrase?

296
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,100
It's a deep fried pastry, with spiced meat inside.

297
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,880
The Empire...

298
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,180
In a bap!

299
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,680
Yeah!

300
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,020
-Bread roll, for those...
-In a bread roll, with a bit of mint sauce.

301
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,060
The Empire made it to the north.

302
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,340
That sounds nice. I want to try that now.

303
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,360
It's beautiful!

304
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
Don't!  No... that's... no, that's double carbs, which I...

305
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,560
Chip butty!

306
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,520
Burrito.

307
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,400
Yeah, never mind.

308
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,900
Yeah!

309
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,820
-It's three!
-I withdraw my objection.

310
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,980
The number of times I've come back, with a big
 splodge of yogurt sauce down my front after one.

311
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm sorry, what?

312
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,300
-At least that's what I told the rest of you.
-After he'd been serviced by the Spiritualist.

313
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,660
Seriously, Flammarion was simultaneously
 quite a believer and quite a skeptic.

314
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,780
He was sure there was something.

315
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,500
But, as he looked at it, he kept finding
 it can't be that, it can't be that.

316
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,520
Martians!

317
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,160
Or... or Martians!

318
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
Martian canal boat dwellers.

319
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,120
Beaming their thoughts down.

320
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,580
Buy me a new pot plant or one of
 those nicely painted watering cans...

321
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,520
Gonna say that.

322
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,580
With a... with a plant in it.

323
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
That's obviously from the north of Mars.

324
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,920
Every planet has a north!
What can I tell you?

325
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,960
It's kinda sad really, because he seems to
have had the scientific method and really...

326
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,180
both wants to prove it properly. Scientifically.

327
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,440
And also really wants to believe, and is going,

328
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,720
"I'm just... there must be something there!"

329
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,640
And I'm going really high pitched. But you know?

330
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,620
Yep, that's absolutely the case.

331
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,140
Had a massive influence on a number of people.

332
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,340
And has quite a few things named after him.

333
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,500
Any ideas?

334
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
Stars?

335
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,460
- No...
- Comets?

336
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,840
-Er... Asteroids?
-Yes! [DING]

337
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,680
A ghost?!

338
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,400
Ah...

339
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,500
Well...

340
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,220
His own ghost?!

341
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,720
Yeah!

342
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,420
It was incredibly convenient.

343
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,200
Asteroids also named after his sister,
his niece, perhaps his first wife.

344
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
Did he name them?

345
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,100
Er... No!

346
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh!

347
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,340
No he's just very well respected for what he did for astronomy and for science.

348
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,440
And also, not canals on Mars,
what else is named on Mars?

349
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,100
Mountains?

350
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,300
Volcanoes?

351
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,620
-The opposite...
-Valleys?

352
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,100
-There's a word...
-Craters?

353
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,720
-Point [DING] Craters. Absolutely right.
-Holes!

354
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,640
Upside down hills.

355
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
-Holes!
-Oh yes.

356
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,780
Oh yes.

357
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,800
As we Martians... I've said too much already!

358
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,980
With that, congratulations Matt.
 You win this week's show.

359
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,060
Yeah!

360
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,640
You win a highly expensive summary
of the life of an American horror actor.

361
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,440
It's Vincent Price's very pricey précis.

362
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,100
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel.

363
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,220
Gary Brannan.

364
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,720
Matt Gray.

365
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,440
I've been Tom Scott and we'll see you next time.

366
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,580
Just hit myself in the face.

367
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,600
Worth it.

368
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,380
Whole day, worth it for that!

369
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,380
