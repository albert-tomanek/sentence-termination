1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,210
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,240
"I love China!"

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,480
Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has a special
relationship with China.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,830
"I love the Chinese people."

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,499
And they love him back...

8
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:20,939
"People from China, they love me."

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,919
"What do the Chinese most want?

10
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,410
One of the 10 things:

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,609
Anything Trump.

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,759
Sort of like how,

13
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:28,900
when I was in middle school,

14
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,779
I loved Connie Cody and she loved me back.

15
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:33,750
I mean, she once called me Chad,

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,160
which is...pretty close to Chris.

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
This is what happened last fall,

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,090
when a CBS reporter in Beijing asked for people's
opinions on Trump.

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,070
"Jeb Bush?"

20
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,810
"No, this is not Jeb Bush.

21
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,720
But while it's too late for me and Connie,

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,240
Trump got a second chance with China.

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,510
Here's CBS again, earlier this week.

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,770
"Do you know this man?"

25
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,680
"Trump."

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,410
"Trump."

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,020
"A little bit crazy."

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,830
I guess they know who he is now.

29
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,640
And let's just say,

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
much like in the US,

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,929
opinions of him in China vary.

32
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:09,240
Some admire Trump's outspokenness and persona.

33
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,299
Wait, Trump isn't polarizing?

34
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,789
I thought that's why everyone spends so much
time talking about him.

35
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,229
Including me, apparently.

36
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,810
Anyway, there are also some negative nellys
out there.

37
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,149
In a country that doesn't have national elections,

38
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,280
many Chinese are paying close attention to
the US presidential race.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
And according to Quartz,

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,260
some prefer Trump to Hillary Clinton because
they believe Clinton would be tougher on China.

41
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,360
After all, Trump did say this about the Tiananmen
Square massacre...

42
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,210
"That is a strong powerful government that
put it down with strength.

43
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,979
They kept down the riot."

44
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,609
Wait, riot?

45
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:49,289
Is that what we're calling a gathering of
unarmed protesters now?

46
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,900
Wow, I guess I narrowly escaped death in Hong
Kong.

47
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,060
Anyway, after Trump's comments,

48
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,269
a bunch of Chinese human rights lawyers released
this open letter.

49
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,909
They criticized Trump for his

50
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,650
"envy of the brutal regime that caused such
a horrific massacre."

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,210
What do Chinese state-run media say about
Trump?

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,520
Earlier this month,

53
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,040
several media published this slideshow called

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,370
"The Erratic Trump is actually a winner in
life,"

55
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,700
which started off by calling Trump a "fuerdai".

56
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,670
That's slang for "second-generation rich",

57
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,989
the offspring of Communist Party leaders and
other wealthy elite

58
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,180
who are pretty hated in China.

59
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,970
As Bloomberg puts it,

60
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,190
fuerdai are seen as more tasteless versions of
Paris Hilton.

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,860
That's a low blow.

62
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,420
But not the worst.

63
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,280
Who else is criticizing Trump,

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,849
without the slightest hint of irony?

65
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,610
Why it's my favorite state-run media, Global
Times!

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,409
Yes, Chinese media is calling Donald Trump,

67
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,069
"A racist and extremist," "Big-mouthed," and
"anti-traditional?"

68
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,329
Wait, the CCP

69
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:09,010
the ones who did this

70
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,489
are using "anti-traditional" as a slur?

71
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,230
But anyway, don't get me wrong.

72
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,439
The Communist Party doesn't actually hate
Donald Trump.

73
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,110
They love Trump.

74
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,790
In the same very specific way Trump loves
China.

75
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,099
"I love China!"

76
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,019
"China is ripping us on trade,

77
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,950
they're devaluing their currency,

78
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,829
and they're killing our companies."

79
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,659
Trump loves China,

80
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,769
because China is the perfect boogeyman in
US election politics.

81
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,290
Likewise, for Chinese media,

82
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,230
Trump is the perfect way to attack the evil
American boogeyman:

83
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,129
democracy.

84
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,019
For years, the Communist Party has taken the
line that

85
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,400
Chinese people simply aren't ready for democracy.

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,989
Which is why they should be under an authoritarian
rule instead.

87
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,849
And now, the Communist Party is using Trump
to make their point.

88
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,340
They highlight fistfights at Trump rallies
as proof

89
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,959
that democracy is chaotic, messy, and sometimes
even violent.

90
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,510
And that's un-good.

91
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,829
Which is why you need the strong hand of big
brother

92
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,870
to choose the leaders of your loving government
for you.

93
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,700
And, as the Global Times points out,

94
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,989
"Mussolini and Hitler came to power through
elections."

95
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,870
Which is a good example of how Chinese state-run
media twist facts

96
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,580
because Hitler was never actually elected.

97
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,530
But anyway, Nazis are bad and the Communist
Party is good.

98
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,509
So there.

99
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,830
Plus, why bother with democracy when it doesn't
even work?

100
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,110
So really, all you Chinese democracy advocates out there

101
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,699
just don't know what you're talking about.

102
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,460
You should be in prison for stirring up trouble!

103
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,750
Ahhh, everything's as it should be.

104
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,880
So in many ways, Trump's presidential run
is a huge boon to the Chinese Communist Party.

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,430
They use him, and the chaos of this US election
cycle,

106
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,979
as proof that grass isn't really greener on
the other side.

107
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,750
And considering China's pollution, that's
saying something.

108
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,840
So now that you know what Chinese media and
the Chinese people are saying about Trump,

109
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,979
wouldn't you like to know what the rest of
the world thinks, too?

110
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,710
Check out this video from our friends over
at TestTube News.

111
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,410
"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said
of the candidate

112
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,610
that he is 'a brilliant and talented person,'

113
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,800
and that 'he is the absolute leader in the
presidential race.'"

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,880
So what do you think of China's take on Trump's
presidential run?

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,090
I look forward to reading your thoughtful,
completely civil discourse below.

116
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,900
Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. See you next
time.
