00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,849
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:05,060
A bakery hurts the feelings of the Chinese
people.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,589
I blame gluten.

4
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,750
A buddhist temple did what?

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,970
And finally, you say potato, I say re-education
camp.

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,220
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,920
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,660
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,140
In our top story, check out these guns!

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,900
Wait, zoom out.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,290
THESE guns!

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,900
That was on board the USS Iowa, back in 2015.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,940
And now, the Trump administration has

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,050
the Chinese Communist Party in its sights.

15
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,900
The CIA has said the US and China are in a
cold war.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,690
And so it’s apparently time to bring back
some Cold War missiles.

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,469
This week Trump signed into law the 716 billion
dollar defense budget

18
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,910
we first told you about when Congress passed
it two weeks ago.

19
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,760
There’s a lot in there that seems to be
directly targeting China.

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,360
Perhaps literally.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,460
One of the things the defense bill

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,280
focuses on is cruise missile defense,

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,990
and it names the threat from China as a reason.

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,329
You see, after the Cold War ended,

25
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,700
the US stopped making long-range ship sinking
missiles.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,759
I mean, the Soviet Union fell.

27
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,289
Why would you ever need them?

28
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:20,130
Well, today, China has several supersonic
missiles

29
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,259
that have a range of 240 miles.

30
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,909
The US Navy's Harpoon missile has a range
of only about 80 miles.

31
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,549
But now the US Navy has gotten the green light
to

32
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,869
“stick it to China with game-changing new
missiles”.

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,939
The US Tomahawk missile has a range of 1,000
miles,

34
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,229
but in its current state,

35
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,829
it’s only designed for land targets.

36
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,479
But now, the Navy wants to repurpose it

37
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,209
into an anti-ship cruise missile.

38
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,209
And with a range of 1,000 miles—compared
to China’s 240—

39
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:55,819
the Tomahawk missile would be a game changer.

40
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,090
The new US defense budget also focuses on

41
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,009
strengthening military cooperation with India,

42
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,560
China’s largest rival in the region.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,179
And it calls for a public report on the Chinese
regime’s

44
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:09,820
aggressive actions in the South China Sea
and Indian Ocean.

45
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,450
But that wasn’t the only bombshell...or...missile
shell?...

46
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,900
that the new defense budget dropped.

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,380
It also called for strengthening

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,340
the military and defense relationship with
Taiwan—

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,920
the country that everyone has to pretend is
not a country.

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,420
Needless to say, the Chinese Communist Party
isn’t happy.

51
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,930
Strongly dissatisfied, in fact.

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,650
You know, with all the times the Chinese regime

53
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,530
has said it has hurt feelings…

54
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,850
...I’m really beginning to wonder

55
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,800
if it’s really just a self-esteem issue.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,850
Speaking of Taiwan, Taiwan’s president Tsai
Ing-wen

57
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,940
visited the United States this week,

58
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,170
on her way to Latin America.

59
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,990
She had a short stopover in Los Angeles,

60
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,290
where she gave a speech and met with US officials.

61
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,860
And stopped to drink a boba tea at a local
Taiwanese owned bakery,

62
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,940
as you do when you’re president.

63
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,570
The visit is a sign of warming ties between
the US and Taiwan...

64
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,220
if you ask American state-run media.

65
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,330
But if you ask Chinese state-run media,

66
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,510
well they don’t have much to say.

67
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,100
I guess they don’t want to give much attention
to her visit.

68
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,340
But a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson

69
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,900
had earlier expressed concern,

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,360
urging the US, quote

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,760
“not to allow the transit by the so-called
Taiwan leader.”

72
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,569
But in a move that’s not petty at all,

73
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:31,290
you know that Taiwanese bakery President Tsai
stopped at?

74
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,770
Well, it has stores in mainland China, too.

75
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,720
And now Chinese state-run media are sort of
suggesting

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,380
people boycott all 538 of them.

77
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,160
As you do when you’re Chinese state-run
media.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,980
So faced with a possibly boycott, the bakery
released a statement

79
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,450
saying that they of course support the 1992
consensus

80
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,530
that lays out the One China policy.

81
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,130
You know, where both China and Taiwan

82
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,310
both agree there’s only one China,

83
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,810
but just don’t talk about which China that
is.

84
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,420
And of course then everyone stopped being
angry.

85
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,940
Just kidding.

86
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,970
Previously the 85-degrees bakery

87
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,310
was famous for its sea salt flavored coffee.

88
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,130
Now they’re just famous for hurting

89
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,800
the feelings of the Chinese people.

90
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,620
I just want to stop and say that we live in
a world where a bakery

91
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,779
has to declare that there’s only one China.

92
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,949
What is the point of satire anymore?

93
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,289
Speaking of Chinese propaganda, the Confucius
Institute.

94
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,550
The Confucius Institute is a world-wide education
program

95
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,580
that teaches the Mandarin language,

96
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,969
with a dash of communist propaganda.

97
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:42,560
That’s because it’s run by the Communist
Party’s United Front.

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,240
And it’s paid for mostly by the Chinese
government.

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,360
Well, guess who won’t be adding funding
from now on?

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
The Pentagon.

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,759
This new ban on funding Confucius Institutes

102
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,340
on US college campuses is, weirdly,

103
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,610
under the same defense bill as those new missiles.

104
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,990
Now to be clear,

105
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,639
the Pentagon never actually funded Confucius
Institutes.

106
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,680
The Pentagon funds its own language programs
at US universities.

107
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,210
But then Arizona State University,

108
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,710
which has both a Confucius Institute

109
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,910
and a Pentagon-funded language program,

110
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,960
had a great idea.

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,539
Officials at the university “bragged about
mixing

112
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,629
the school’s Pentagon-funded Chinese language
programs

113
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,349
and its Chinese Communist Party-funded Confucius
Institute.”

114
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,069
One Arizona State University official also
said that

115
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,010
since the Pentagon was funding its Confucius
Institute,

116
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,521
that proved that the US government didn’t
see

117
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:38,819
the Confucius Institutes as a national security
threat.

118
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,120
Which was not true.

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,500
Oops.

120
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,059
That claim got picked up by Chinese state-run
media and...

121
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,520
I think you can see what happened from there.

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,189
So now US universities have to choose between

123
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,909
a Pentagon-funded program and a Confucius
Institute.

124
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,909
If they want to have both, they have to apply
for a waiver.

125
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,639
And they can’t mix the funds.

126
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,379
One issue is that there are more than

127
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,150
100 Confucius Institutes in the US.

128
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,360
But only 12 universities have Pentagon-funded
programs in Chinese.

129
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,809
So if the US government wants to counter

130
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:13,819
Chinese Communist Party-sponsored language
programs,

131
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:16,559
it’s got a long way to go.

132
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,010
Speaking of propaganda, the Communist Party

133
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,249
has been rebuilding a lot of the old Buddhist
temples across China—

134
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,080
including some of the ones it destroyed in
the 1960s.

135
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,040
It doesn’t mean the Communist Party is ok
with religion now.

136
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
It’s not.

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,150
It never was.

138
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,969
But, boy do tourist attractions sure make
money!

139
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:39,410
So why not invest in rebuilding some temples!

140
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,629
Of course, all the old monks with their “traditional”
ways of thinking

141
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,240
have been kicked out, or they died, or were
killed.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,939
And now they’ve been replaced by younger
monks

143
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,490
who really understand how integrate modern
communist thought

144
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,690
into those stuffy old Buddhist teachings.

145
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,169
Like the monks at a Yuantong temple in southern
China.

146
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,669
They totally get it.

147
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,120
That’s why, “For an additional 73 dollars,

148
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,229
monks at the temple [would] perform rituals
to guarantee

149
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,369
that the deceased will be reincarnated in
the United States.”

150
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:16,060
Now you might be wondering, why charge so
little money?

151
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,550
Millions of people want to leave China.

152
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,969
They could have charged thousands of dollars!

153
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,210
I guess the catch with reincarnation is,

154
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,330
you have to die first.

155
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,650
Of course, the Yuantong temple totally denies

156
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,490
that it ever offered this service.

157
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,869
And I believe them,

158
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,759
because I read it in The Global Times.

159
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,169
Speaking of religion,

160
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,180
there’s about 10 million people

161
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,069
in the Autonomous Region of Xinjiang

162
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,479
who belong to the Uighur ethnic group,

163
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
and they’re largely Muslim.

164
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,979
Well, at least they have a generations-old
culture

165
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,599
of Muslim customs and traditions and holidays.

166
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,930
But believing in Allah, that’s very dangerous,

167
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,509
according to the Communist Party.

168
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,740
And that’s why over the last year or so,

169
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,759
Chinese authorities have rounded up as many
as 10% of all Uighurs—

170
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,210
I’m talking about potentially a million
people here—

171
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,409
and put them into re-education centers.

172
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:08,680
And according to one former inmate,

173
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,779
they were forced to drink alcohol and eat
pork.

174
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,090
That’s because pork and alcohol are forbidden
for Muslims.

175
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,680
But really, bacon and whisky in prison doesn’t
sound that bad—

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,879
compared to the ideological re-education,

177
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,080
physical torture,

178
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,930
and mysterious deaths in custody.

179
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,680
But don’t worry!

180
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,039
According to a Chinese delegation to Geneva,

181
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,930
there are “no such things as re-education
centers.”

182
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,990
No, no!

183
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,440
These places are actually

184
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,150
“vocational education and employment training
centers.”

185
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,350
But somehow, I feel like maybe they’re spinning
that story.

186
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,780
Because there’s another description

187
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,770
of these totally-not-reeducation camps—

188
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,730
this time, from the Communist Party Youth
League.

189
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,500
They claimed that they’re actually hospitals...

190
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,150
treating people infected with religious extremism.

191
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,370
Which is very thoughtful,

192
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,900
since almost no one else in China gets free
healthcare.

193
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,901
And before we go, normally this is the time
I answer a question

194
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,950
from a fan who supports China Uncensored through
Patreon.

195
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,660
But there are other ways to support China
Uncensored, too.

196
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,860
So this time, I want to tell you a story about
something amazing

197
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,370
that a fan in Indonesia did.

198
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,410
His name is J.

199
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,150
Ok, it’s not really J,

200
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,630
but he didn’t want me to use his real name

201
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,020
because Indonesia is not exactly a free country.

202
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,400
So last week, J messaged us on Facebook

203
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,870
about why the China Uncensored YouTube channel

204
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,310
was no longer available in Indonesia.

205
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,090
And I was like, “Wait... what?”

206
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,250
It turned out that Indonesia’s biggest mobile
phone telecom company

207
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,470
Telkomsel was blocking China Uncensored.

208
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,500
Here’s what our channel looks like normally,

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,900
and here’s what it looked like for users
on Telkomsel.

210
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,020
And this isn’t a small issue.

211
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,600
Telkomsel serves half of Indonesia,

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
which is the fourth largest country in the
world.

213
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,600
So more than 100 million people were being
blocked

214
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,780
from watching China Uncensored on their phones.

215
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,370
And that’s a big deal,

216
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,920
because Indonesia doesn’t have a good

217
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,590
wired internet access in most places,

218
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,310
so most people watch YouTube on their mobile
phones.

219
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,330
So I told J, “I want to do an episode about
how Indonesia

220
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,770
is blocking China Uncensored.”

221
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,430
And then he told me that this has recently
been an issue

222
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,110
affecting lots of YouTube channels there.

223
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,690
There’s apparently been a big effort

224
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,140
by the Indonesian government

225
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,420
to block online content related to violence,

226
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,420
pornography,

227
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,670
and “negative content”—whatever that
is.

228
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,130
So I asked J to contact Telkomsel

229
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,690
and ask them which of their terms of use

230
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,900
China Uncensored might be violating.

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,010
And it turned out—surprise!—

232
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,640
it was none of them.

233
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,220
But here’s the bigger surprise: Literally
the next day,

234
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,730
Telkomsel had unblocked the China Uncensored
YouTube channel.

235
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,780
In other words,

236
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,490
it seems that one phone call from a viewer
accomplished something

237
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,000
that helped more than 100 million people

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,610
get access to China Uncensored again.

239
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,710
So J: My sincerest thank you.

240
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,660
You are truly a member of the China Uncensored
50-Cent Army.

241
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,120
And that’s it for this episode of China
Uncensored.

242
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,540
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

243
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,520
See you next time.

244
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,840
The Chinese Communist Party is buying up influence
around the world!

245
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,200
That’s why this is an urgent call to our
fans.

246
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,950

247
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,350
