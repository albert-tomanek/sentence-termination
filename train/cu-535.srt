00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,170
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,319
as trade disputes between China and the US
continue,

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,260
China looks for more friends.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,940
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,690
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,070
As China and the US edge closer to a full-on
trade war,

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,779
the Chinese Communist Party is looking to
turn

8
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,599
America’s allies against it.

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,680
And at the top of that list is the European
Union.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,410
The EU and the US are China’s biggest trading
partners.

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,510
Many Western countries,

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,660
like France and Germany,

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,360
have complained about the Chinese Communist
Party’s

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,390
unfair trade practices.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,390
For example, stealing technology and manipulating

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,640
Chinese currency to keep exports cheap.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,260
But now trade relations are getting worse.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,710
A few weeks ago President Donald Trump

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,280
threatened to impose tariffs

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,560
on a total of $150 billion dollars worth of
Chinese exports.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,430
It’s in response to the Chinese regime’s
unfair industrial subsidies

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,810
and the theft of American intellectual property.

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,960
According to the Intellectual Property Commission,

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,970
theft of intellectual property costs the US
economy

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,990
$600 billion dollars a year.

26
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,650
And—surprise, surprise—

27
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,780
China is the biggest culprit.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,940
And that’s only the direct impact of IP
theft.

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,000
If you factor in the long-term impact

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,140
of lost future revenue from innovation and
jobs,

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,920
the loss could be as much as $5 trillion a
year,

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,970
according to one expert.

33
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,580
Of course, the Chinese Communist Party

34
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,220
doesn’t think they’re doing anything wrong

35
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,210
by stealing intellectual property.

36
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,390
I mean, the Party literally wrote intellectual
property theft

37
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,220
into their latest five-year economic plan.

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,100
They’re just upset that the chickens

39
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,290
are finally coming home to roost.

40
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,450
So they’re retaliating by threatening to
implement

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,540
their own tariffs on US goods.

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,920
And now the Party is upping the ante.

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,490
They’re trying to drive a wedge between
the US and Europe.

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,040
China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called
on the European Union

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,900
to “stand up together” against American
protectionism

46
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,569
“and uphold the rules-based multilateral
order.”

47
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:12,099
I’m sorry, but Chinese Communist Party

48
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,630
wants to “uphold the rules-based multilateral
order”?

49
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,510
That’s coming from the same regime

50
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,160
that’s been accused of violating World Trade
Organization rules

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,910
41 times in the past 17 years.

52
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,230
And that for years forced foreign companies
to share

53
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,670
their technology and profits with local Chinese
partners

54
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,560
as a condition of doing business.

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,920
And that buys up key assets like seaports
in smaller nations,

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,730
and then uses economic leverage

57
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,480
to interfere with that country’s politics.

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,500
So I think what the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,830
actually meant was,

60
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,030
“Could we all please just uphold the status
quo?”

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,580
Anyway, last week, Beijing’s top trade official,

62
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,709
Fu Ziying, went on a diplomatic charm offensive
in Europe.

63
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,810
His goal: to convince long-time US allies

64
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,370
to side with China if there’s a trade war
with the US.

65
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,300
According to a senior European diplomat

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
who didn’t want to be identified,

67
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,739
the message was that the EU

68
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:15,819
must “stand together against US protectionism

69
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,599
in favor of free trade.”

70
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,940
And another diplomat said that the Chinese
official

71
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,000
used “subliminal threats” about bad things

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,710
that could happen to foreign companies.

73
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,629
Subliminal threats, huh?

74
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,840
Like how you might want to break down your
trade barriers

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,410
before Joey over here breaks them for you.

76
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,400
He’s gonna increase the size of your trade
deficit

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,709
if you know what I’m saying.

78
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,140
No wonder those European diplomats

79
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,970
wanted to remain anonymous.

80
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,700
See, this potential trade war with the US

81
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,450
is putting the Chinese Communist Party in
a tough spot.

82
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,950
To survive a trade war with the US,

83
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,150
they have to make sure Europe keeps its markets
open.

84
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,100
That’s according to Yukon Huang,

85
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,830
an expert on China's economy at the Carnegie
Endowment for Peace.

86
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,709
But all the attention the Chinese Communist
Party

87
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,659
is lavishing on the EU

88
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,800
means that although they talk tough,

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,870
Trump’s tariff offensive is setting them
edge.

90
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,690
China’s move “smacks of desperation

91
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,030
because China knows that the EU

92
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,859
is not going to confront its biggest ally”—

93
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,000
which is the United States.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,210
And then, just to drive the point home,

95
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,130
a few days after trade representative

96
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,760
Fu Ziying’s European tour wrapped up,

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,150
27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors to
China

98
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,190
co-signed a report criticizing Xi Jinping’s
flagship

99
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,000
One Belt One Road Initiative.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,810
One Belt One Road is the trillion dollar infrastructure
plan

101
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,750
that builds trade corridors linking China
with the rest of the world,

102
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,220
including Europe.

103
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,270
But many denounce the scheme as a way for
China

104
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,400
to gain the upper hand in trade and to meddle
in other countries.

105
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,580
And EU leaders seem to agree.

106
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,000
The European ambassadors say One Belt One
Road

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,800
is designed to restrict free trade

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,860
and favor Chinese companies.

109
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,210
One German newspaper got hold of the EU ambassadors’
signed report.

110
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,070
It supposedly says One Belt One Road

111
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,380
“runs counter to the EU agenda for liberalizing
trade

112
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,130
and pushes the balance of power

113
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,780
in favor of subsidized Chinese companies.”

114
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,780
Hmmmm.

115
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,990
That makes it a bit harder for the Chinese
regime

116
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,060
to claim the high ground of defending free
trade.

117
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,070
A senior European diplomat told Reuters the
EU

118
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,610
was “not in the business of taking sides”
in a trade war,

119
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,250
and that its goal is “to get the multilateral
process back on track.”

120
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,340
In other words,

121
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,240
get China and the US to work together

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,800
and with other countries,

123
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,610
to resolve their dispute through the World
Trade Organization.

124
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,530
Ultimately it looks like the EU agrees with
the US

125
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,280
that the Chinese regime is not playing by
the rules,

126
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,570
but they don’t really like how the US is
dealing with it.

127
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,160
So, do you think the US and Europe will remain
pals?

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,410
Or will the Chinese regime manage to drive
a wedge between them?
