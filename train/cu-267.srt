00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,569
Hi welcome to China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,129
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,540
The China Uncensored crew was recently at

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,690
the Oslo Freedom Forum,

5
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,210
one of the largest human rights conferences
in the world.

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,360
We met up with Mu Sochua,

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,620
a former member of the Cambodian Parliament,

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,459
now turned rights activist.

9
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,049
She sat down with Shelley Zhang to discuss

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,970
the Chinese Communist Party’s growing influence
in Cambodia.

11
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,970
Thanks for watching.

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,970
We were able to do this interview thanks to
support

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,970
from the Oslo Freedom Forum.

14
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,970
They’d invited me to speak at the conference,

15
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,970
and also helped us arrange interviews.

16
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,970
We also rely on support from viewers—

17
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,970
fans who contribute to China Uncensored through
Patreon.

19
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,970
Thank you so much for joining us Sochua.

20
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,970
So you're one of the leaders of

21
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,560
the opposition party in Cambodia,

22
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,579
and although we're mostly going be

23
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,090
talking about China and Cambodia,

24
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,280
could you just give us a brief look at what's
happening

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,260
right now with the Cambodian government?

26
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,420
I want to start by saying that democracy is
dead in Cambodia...

27
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,809
the Prime Minister of Cambodia,

28
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,410
Mr. Hun Sen is a former Khmer Rouge,

29
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,000
so we still live through the legacy of Khmer
Rouge.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,449
So, Mr. Hun Sen, what he wants,

31
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,649
is to continue his power,

32
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,109
and has been in power for over thirty-four
years.

33
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,840
So in order to stay in power,

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,800
he has to eliminate all forces that are for
democracy,

35
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,620
including civil society, independent media,

36
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,200
even international organizations like the
National Democratic Institute.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,780
Then, he turned on us the Opposition,

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,030
the Cambodian National Rescue Party,

39
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:41,210
and the party now is dissolved as of last
November.

40
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,640
What's the relationship between Hun Sen

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,460
and the Chinese government?

42
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,100
Mr. Hun Sen, his only concern is how to keep
power.

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,500
And every time he is confronting us,

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
confronting the people,

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,030
there is a crisis in Cambodia,

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,570
he goes straight to China.

47
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,060
And every time he goes there,

48
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,940
he comes back with gifts from China.

49
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,920
What are the gifts?

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,150
Millions of dollars, more roads, more bridges.

51
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,200
And also more port, and also more military
equipment.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,049
And we know that some of the tanks,

53
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:28,829
some of these barbed wires have the equipment

54
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,750
that are worn--

55
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,610
these uniforms used by the anti-riot police

56
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,840
that crack down on us,

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,890
come from China.

58
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,280
Hun Sen knows if he keeps the Opposition alive,

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,290
to compete with him in the July election,

60
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,760
he will lose again.

61
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,200
We have gained over forty-four percent of
the vote,

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,239
half of the country.

63
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,550
And half of the people in Cambodia are still
angry.

64
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,159
Angry because they wake up,

65
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,980
our farmers wake up and the land is gone.

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:10,079
The land is given to Chinese companies by
the prime minister.

67
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,499
In the so-called policy of economic land concessions.

68
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:19,939
So what are they giving the land for?

69
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:28,430
In the province of Koh Kong in the south,
the land--

70
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,989
tens and thousands of hectares of land--

71
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,540
communities that used to belong to the indigenous
communities,

72
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,519
given to Chinese--

73
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,379
one company to build a golf course.

74
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,450
Cambodia, especially our farmers,

75
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,180
do not need a golf course,

76
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,310
we don't need more resort where

77
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,219
Cambodian local people cannot afford,

78
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,219
not even a room,

79
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,959
but even a glass of water.

80
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,659
So the resorts are built for whom?

81
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,659
We don't know.

82
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,029
See the problem is these land concessions
given

83
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,870
to Chinese companies are given by the prime
minister

84
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,840
and there's no transparency whatsoever.

85
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,440
The only way we know is that the people are

86
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,390
forced out of their land,

87
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,760
like our fishermen, our farmers,

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,860
forced out of the land and put in jail if
they protest.

89
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,890
So let's talk a little bit about the port
that you mentioned.

90
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,590
So there's a Chinese company, Union Development,

91
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,390
that was given a ninety-nine year lease

92
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,790
on twenty percent of Cambodia's coastline.

93
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,690
Were there no Cambodian companies that wanted

94
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,730
to develop the port or what happened?

95
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,980
Again, under the name of Development,

96
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,770
Cambodia is either for sale or given for free...

97
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,770
Why?

98
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,830
What is happening inside,

99
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,860
what is gone, like especially the port.

100
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,030
Outside independent experts cannot go in,

101
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,920
not at all.

102
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,380
And then the so-called environmental assessment,

103
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,150
evaluation, is never done independently,

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,510
or with any sense of transparency or accountability.

105
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,870
One Belt One Road,

106
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,300
goes from the north of Cambodia

107
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,530
all the way to the south where the port is.

108
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,370
So everything can be taken out of Cambodia

109
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,830
to go out of Cambodia to China.

110
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,980
And the problem today is that the Opposition,

111
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,450
the civil society, the human rights organizations

112
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,500
are no longer allowed to follow,

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,210
as we are not even inside Cambodia.

114
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:01,140
We are in exile, our seats as parliamentarians

115
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,810
have been taken away from us,

116
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,970
our party is dissolved.

117
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,370
So who's looking after Cambodia?

118
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,510
No one.

119
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,860
So how is China keeping Hun Sen in power?

120
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,910
Hun Sen now is saying,

121
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:30,560
“The Opposition is under the U.S.,

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,090
the revolution that the Opposition is organizing

123
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,960
is actually funded by the U.S."

124
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,560
That's the theory of Mr. Hun Sen.

125
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,100
Therefore he must go to China...

126
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,590
Mr. Hun Sen chooses to go to China

127
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,310
because there is no check and balance required,

128
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,210
because there is no protection of human rights

129
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,440
required by China.

130
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,170
That's true, the Chinese government

131
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,650
doesn't care if he oppresses his people.

132
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,460
But we care.

133
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,690
We care.

134
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,630
And to us, the only way to be friend with
China

135
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,470
on a equal term, equal footing,

136
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,400
is for us to be able to grow and economically

137
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:29,470
sustain these growth with a economically sound
policy...

138
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,220
Another thing that we are very concerned about

139
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,350
is that another port area, Kampong Som, Sihanoukville,

140
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,780
now has twenty casinos.

141
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,050
Twenty casinos build by China.

142
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,160
Who's going to the casinos?

143
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Chinese.

144
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,810
Because the local people

145
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,870
cannot legally enter a casino.

146
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,870
And these are the companies,

147
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,090
the Chinese companies they don't really

148
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,350
care about local quality of life?

149
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,380
Not at all...

150
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,970
And then you have the Chinese mafia along
the coast,

151
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,950
even the governor himself has written

152
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,580
a report to Mr. Hun Sen and say,

153
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,180
"Mr. Prime Minister, I cannot control my province
anymore.

154
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,810
It's out of control."

155
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,080
And Mr. Hun Sen say, "Don't talk about it."...

156
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,090
And not only that, the Chinese there are creating
chaos.

157
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,550
They can beat up the local people, and the
local police,

158
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,779
our police, cannot protect our people because
they're

159
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,860
afraid of the Chinese mafia company,

160
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,579
and because Mr. Hun Sen's boss is China.

161
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,790
So there are actually a lot of Chinese Cambodians
in Cambodia.

162
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,110
Is the problem with the current Chinese government

163
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,490
causing tensions between the Chinese in Cambodia,

164
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,370
and Cambodians?

165
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:13,740
What we are saying is that it's not China
as a country

166
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,450
that we are afraid of because like me, I'm
half Chinese.

167
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,410
The Chinese people are our friends.

168
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,500
It's the policy of China today,

169
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,100
vis a vis the global world,

170
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,560
and its policy of taking over,

171
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,610
controlling the world,

172
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,360
that makes us want to rise up,

173
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,509
not against the Chinese people.

174
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:46,940
We have Chinese people.

175
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,100
We have ethnic Chinese, about 10%.

176
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,510
I speak Chinese.

177
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,410
My grandfather came from China.

178
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,779
But, China then is not China now.

179
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,139
We didn't lose our land

180
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:08,860
and there was cultural interaction into marriages.

181
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,319
But today because of what China is doing to
us,

182
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:19,709
there is friction growing and that's not what
we want.

183
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,629
So, is there anything that the Cambodian people

184
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,649
can do about this?

185
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:30,130
We are not giving up.

186
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,430
We must protect our land.

187
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,699
We must protect Cambodia...

188
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:42,040
We are about less than two months before election

189
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,050
and this is key...

190
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,079
If we leave Cambodia as it is,

191
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,430
Cambodia is a liability to the region.

192
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,580
It will go and turn into economic,

193
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,790
social and political instability.

194
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,970
This is a security issue,

195
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,370
a regional security issue and we need to solve
it now.

196
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,370
Coming from Cambodia,

197
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,470
a place where all this is happening,

198
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,990
do you have something to say to the rest of
the world

199
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,139
about dealing with the Chinese government?

200
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:24,050
Here I am at the Oslo Freedom Forum.

201
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,560
Before coming here I was saying,

202
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,040
"What should we do?"

203
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,500
This is ... We're going to lose our people,

204
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,579
people who are still inside?

205
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:41,899
Our leader, who is in jail.

206
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,740
By coming here to the Oslo Freedom Forum ,

207
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,559
and hearing how other countries

208
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,699
who have been damaged by dictators,

209
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,569
dictators who need the support of China.

210
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,730
I feel this unity.

211
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,880
I feel that we're speaking one language,

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,839
the language of freedom of liberty and democracy,

213
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:23,369
and we have to say to the countries that believe
in democracy,

214
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:27,639
don't give up on us.

215
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,759
There are institutions,

216
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,450
there are mechanisms like the UN.

217
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:38,230
Use it, use it to put pressure.

218
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,920
You put pressure,

219
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,889
the measures that can be taken

220
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,829
such as economic sanctions,

221
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,629
such as targeted sanctions.

222
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:57,769
Like visa ban on those officials close to
even Mr. Hun Sen.

223
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,300
Why should he be allowed to go to the United
States?

224
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,930
To France, to Norway, to any country.

225
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,769
To any country that was part of the Schengen.

226
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:11,430
Stop it.

227
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:18,920
We can together talk about freezing of assets.

228
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:29,170
I am very inspired by the Global Magnitsky
Act

229
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:36,170
adopted in the United States and it is being
applied now...

230
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,560
Now I think there is hope,

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:47,529
but we have to use the international mechanism

232
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,339
to deal with these dictators.

233
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,579
At the end of the day,

234
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:58,360
I think Mr. Hun Sen needs legacy, to be…

235
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,110
He needs legacy.

236
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,829
Mr. Hun Sen wants to travel to New York

237
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,889
to the UN General Assembly session.

238
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,800
It is there,

239
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,079
it is that mechanism that dictators like Mr.
Hun Sen

240
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,050
must go and face the people of the world,

241
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,869
and that's why international community

242
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:31,259
should not abandon each other,

243
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,860
get on the same wagon and that's how we deal
with China.

244
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,020
Thank you so much.

245
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,900
Thank you.

246
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,280
Thanks for watching.

247
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,400
We were able to do this interview thanks to support from the Oslo Freedom Forum.

248
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,200
They’d invited me to speak at the conference, and also helped us arrange interviews.

249
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,140
We also rely on support from viewers—

250
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,580
fans who contribute to China Uncensored through Patreon.
