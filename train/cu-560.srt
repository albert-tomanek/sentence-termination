00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,420
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,059
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,960
You know, nothing says ideal communist utopia

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,320
where everyone is equal...

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,109
like modern China.

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,949
It became clear after the death of Chairman
Mao

7
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,539
that killing all the rich people and taking
their stuff

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,070
was not a great long-term strategy for economic
growth.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,660
Because you eventually run out of rich people.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,530
So the next leader, Deng Xiaoping,

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,150
came up with a new theory:

12
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,160
“Let some people get rich first.”

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,060
That’s not a joke.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,260
That’s actually what he said.

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,300
And since then,

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,860
China has seen decades of stunning economic
growth.

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,230
This is Shanghai in 1987.

18
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,280
And this is Shanghai in 2013.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,640
So who are the people who got rich first?

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,000
Why, it was the proletariat—

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,200
the backbone of the revolution— who...

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Just kidding.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,450
It was the communist officials.

24
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,519
They didn’t have to pretend to live frugally
anymore.

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,280
They were free to take big profits

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,770
from state-owned companies,

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,940
or to kick peasant farmers off of the land

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,500
and sell the rights for development

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,220
while getting kickbacks.

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,060
You know, the traditional way to make money.

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,430
But soon there were others getting rich, too.

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,250
Millions of everyday people started small
businesses,

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,860
and a few of them pulled themselves up by
the bootstraps.

34
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,360
Whatever bootstraps are.

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,310
I’m talking about people like Alibaba founder
Jack Ma.

36
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,200
His first job out of college in 1988 was teaching
English...

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,780
for $12 a month.

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,670
Then, he started several small businesses,

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,860
which all failed.

40
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,060
Eventually, he started the e-commerce company
Alibaba,

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,610
which did not fail.

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,240
And now he’s worth 40 billion dollars.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,299
And Jack Ma is not alone.

44
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:55,010
According to the latest annual Hurun report,

45
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,430
there are 777 billionaires

46
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,860
in the People’s Republic of China.

47
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,130
And it just so happens that 104 of them

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,080
are Communist Party officials.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,460
I’m sure that’s just a coincidence.

50
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,239
The US, by contrast, has only 571 billionaires.

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,340
And most of them aren’t in government positions.

52
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,519
OK, there are exceptions.

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,969
But Trump’s counterpart in China is also
super wealthy.

54
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:23,410
Xi Jinping may not live an extravagant lifestyle
himself,

55
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,849
but together with his relatives

56
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,969
he’s worth at least a quarter billion.

57
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,609
Anyway, China has more billionaires

58
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,609
than any other country.

59
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,609
By far.

60
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,060
And while Alibaba founder Jack Ma may live
humbly...

61
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,469
Well, other than doing stuff like producing
and starring in

62
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:41,109
his own short film where he’s somehow a
kung fu master.

63
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:43,389
I guess that’s just what crazy rich people
do.

64
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:46,010
I mean, star in your own martial arts movie?

65
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,329
Who wouldn’t do that?

66
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,299
But while Jack Ma may be crazy rich,

67
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,329
at least he isn’t crazy and rich,

68
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,889
like Chinese entrepreneur Chen Guangbiao.

69
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,939
The guy who once hosted a fancy lunch

70
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:00,010
for homeless people in New York City

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,090
to highlight how bad America’s homeless
problem is,

72
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,489
and how he could fix it.

73
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,730
Starting with his promise to give out $300
in cash

74
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,890
to every homeless person in attendance.

75
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,040
And then, in a bizarre twist,

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,950
he took all the money back.

77
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,120
He also faked the ice bucket challenge by
pretending

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,669
to sit in ice water for half an hour.

79
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,090
Chinese people would call Chen Guangbiao a
total tu hao,

80
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,790
or nouveau riche.

81
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,500
But there’s not a lot of old money in mainland
China,

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,870
because of the whole,

83
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,199
killing rich people and taking their stuff
policy under Mao.

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,100
Which is why rich Chinese are taking etiquette
classes.

85
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,120
“Many people ask why pay 100,000 RMB ($16,000)

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
to learn how to cut a banana?

87
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,580
Don’t think about it like that.

88
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,420
What we teach is more than that.

89
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,120
It’s about the spirit of etiquette.”

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
As well as yacht-buying classes.

91
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,580
There’s an advanced electrical toilet on
the yacht.

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,200
And when I go sailing next time,

93
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,140
I can discharge it on the open sea.

94
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,879
They’re already rich,

95
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,079
but now they’re learning how to act wealthy.

96
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,889
But if you think that’s crazy behavior

97
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:23,430
for the crazy rich people of China,

98
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,050
wait until you hear about their kids.

99
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,569
There’s even a term in Chinese for rich
people’s kids:

100
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:29,729
Fu er dai.

101
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,110
Or “rich second generation.”

102
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,940
And some of these fu er dai are seriously...extra.

103
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,599
Like this Instagrammer, Sian Vivi X.

104
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,199
Showing off her apartment with a

105
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,200
slightly above average view of Hong Kong

106
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,220
Her humble automobile, probably a Toyota Camry.

107
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,330
A normal, everyday breakfast/

108
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,470
An afternoon out on the ol’ fishin’ boat.

109
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,390
And of course a totally unstaged photo where
she and her “baes”

110
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,670
depict what I assume always happens at girls’
slumber parties.

111
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,460
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

112
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,770
It does?!

113
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,900
Wow.

114
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,060
Now perhaps it seems a bit tone deaf

115
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,949
to show off your luxury lifestyle

116
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,990
in a country where most people are still living

117
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,430
on less than $10 a day.

118
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,150
But on the plus side, your average Chinese
peasant farmer

119
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,610
isn’t looking at Instagram.

120
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,099
Because first, you need to own a smartphone.

121
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,939
Also, Instagram is blocked in China

122
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,650
and you have to use a VPN to access it.

123
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,840
But there’s nothing wrong with being rich.

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,020
Even if you use that money to buy your dog
eight iPhones.

125
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,360
Although that is kind of ridiculous.

126
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,389
I mean, why would a dog would need more than
four iPhones?

127
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:36,870
One for each cute little paw, obviously,

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,569
but what are the other ones for?

129
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,419
But if the crazy rich fu er dai of Instragram
want to buy

130
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,490
an excessive number of backup iPhones for
their dogs, fine.

131
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,000
Or if they want to show off their helicopters,

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,289
I have no problem with that.

133
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,069
If her parents earned that money fair and
square,

134
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,650
and she benefits from it,

135
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,440
I’m happy for her.

136
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,939
Even if the Internet points out that when
riding a camel,

137
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,599
you should really wear long pants.

138
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,590
I mean, chafing, hello!

139
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,419
But it’s not the horse-cuddling,

140
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,659
baby-elephant-feeding fu er dai that mainstream
Chinese people

141
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,139
are all worked up about.

142
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,199
Besides, there are rich Instagrammers in every
country

143
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,319
who are “hashtag living the dream.”

144
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,789
But it’s the crazy rich Chinese fu er dai

145
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:22,040
who think they’re above the law who drive
people...crazy.

146
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,780
Like the college student who snapped a photo
of herself

147
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,990
literally burning money.

148
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,370
Although I suppose it could have been

149
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,240
an anti-Mao political statement.

150
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,669
But it wasn’t.

151
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,210
Or there’s the crazy rich daughter of a
Chinese official

152
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,819
who refused to put her 20-thousand-dollar
handbag

153
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,979
through the x-ray machine at a Shanghai subway
station.

154
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,419
And the security guards were like,

155
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,430
“Well then we won’t let you through.”

156
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,650
And then she was all like,

157
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,870
“Well then my daddy’s going to kill you.”

158
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,189
That’s not a joke.

159
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:51,720
That’s what she said.

160
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,620
I feel there should be some kind of solution

161
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,259
in between not getting on a train and killing
people.

162
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,560
Speaking of killing people, this fu er dai.

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,599
He was driving drunk outside a university
in northeast China,

164
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,650
when he ran his car into two girls,

165
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,060
killing one of them.

166
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,409
He started driving away,

167
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,380
and when students and security guards tried
to stop him,

168
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,169
he yelled: “Go ahead, sue me if you dare.

169
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,699
My father is Li Gang!”

170
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,620
Li Gang was the deputy director

171
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,349
of the local Public Security Bureau,

172
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:24,550
which is like the police, but with more authority.

173
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,370
So maybe not super rich,

174
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,900
but certainly super powerful.

175
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,009
That is, until the phrase “My father is
Li Gang”

176
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,410
became an online meme,

177
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,250
and a metaphor for abuse of power

178
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,689
that’s fairly standard across China.

179
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,840
And then when the Communist Party

180
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,180
realized they couldn’t cover it up,

181
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,729
they told the court to put Li Gang’s son
in prison.

182
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,280
He was sentenced to 6 years.

183
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,310
And these cases are just a few that illustrate

184
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,590
a much larger problem in China.

185
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,310
A lot of Communist Party officials,

186
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,539
as well as their kids,

187
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,259
feel like they are above the law.

188
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,650
And a lot of regular rich people in China

189
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,759
feel they’re above the law, too—

190
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,599
because many people who became billionaires

191
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,800
have strong connections to Communist Party
officials.

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,270
Since having strong ties with the Communist
Party

193
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,009
makes it so much easier to accumulate wealth
in the first place.

194
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,639
In fact, in the People’s Republic of China,

195
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,810
the Communist Party itself is outside the
law.

196
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,449
The constitution is even written that way.

197
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,590
So don’t be too surprised when

198
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,780
some of the crazy rich people in China act
out.

199
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,780
On the plus side,

200
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,630
if you go see Crazy Rich Asians this weekend,

201
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,090
you’ll think Nick’s family are just the
nicest folks.

202
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,360
And before we go, it’s time to answer another
fan question

203
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,540
from one of our supporters on the crowdfunding
website Patreon.

204
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,730
Cha Cha China fan asks:

205
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,230
“Being watched all the time with surveillance
cameras

206
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,200
must be nerve-wracking for your average Chinese.

207
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,720
Or do they know?”

208
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,220
Good question.

209
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,850
There are 200 million surveillance cameras
across China,

210
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,850
and they have plans to build several hundred
million more—

211
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,800
making China a world leader...

212
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,050
in spying on its own citizens.

213
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,520
Based on what I’ve read and people I’ve
talked to,

214
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,000
everyone there is aware of the surveillance
in a general sense,

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,400
but the average Chinese citizen doesn’t
consider it a big deal

216
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,480
the way we Americans do.

217
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,230
Now while that might seem crazy,

218
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,100
remember that even before the era

219
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,530
of mass camera surveillance in China,

220
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,860
there were other types of surveillance.

221
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,320
Since the communist revolution,

222
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,940
there have been vast networks of spies and
informants—

223
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,500
in every neighborhood, every school, and every
work unit—

224
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,550
ready to report even the slightest deviation
from the Party line.

225
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,290
That’s just how the Communist Party operates.

226
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,770
So the current era of mass camera surveillance

227
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,790
is just a digital extension of that.

228
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,790
And in some ways,

229
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,950
it may seem even less intrusive.

230
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,520
People who’ve grown up their entire lives
under communism

231
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,150
don’t have the expectation of privacy

232
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,280
the same way people in free countries do.

233
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,670
And that allows the Communist Party

234
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,610
to keep extending its surveillance

235
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,800
without a lot of public pushback.

236
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,780
Also, anyone who pushes back

237
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,500
will be caught on surveillance,

238
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,440
so...I guess that also explains it.

239
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,830
Thanks for your question.

240
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,970
