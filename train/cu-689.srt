00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,430
On this episode of China Uncensored, the US
sends a navy Destroyer past disputed islands

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,060
in the South China Sea.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,420
So... like, does this mean war?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:17,039
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,400
You know, a wise man once saidâ€¦

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,259
"You fell victim to one of the classic blunders!

7
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:25,300
The most famous is: Never get involved in
a land war in Asia."

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,140
But a sea war in Asia--that's a totally different
matter!

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,220
"Tonight, Beijing is firing a rhetorical shot
across the bow.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,230
After a US destroyer sailed right through
waters claimed by China.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,940
A newspaper closely tied to the Chinese Communist
Party encouraging the government to convince

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,650
Washington that China is, quote, 'Not frightened
to fight a war with the US in the region.'"

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,030
Yes, a rhetorical shot across the bow in the
metaphorical nightmare that is the South China

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,260
Sea.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,320
According to international law, the area 12
nautical miles around a country's coastline

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
is part of that country's territory.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,780
And on Tuesday this week, the US guided missile
destroyer, the USS Lassen, sailed within 12

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,400
nautical miles of Chinese territory--as long
as you consider artificial islands built on

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,820
submerged reefs part of China's territory,
which no besides China does.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,150
Recently, China has claimed a huge part of
the South China Sea, a region rich in natural

21
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,120
resources and one of the busiest shipping
lanes in the world.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,500
These are very legitimate claims based on
very legitimate ancient maps.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,800
As long as you don't actually look at those
ancient maps.

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,670
So earlier this month, Beijing had threatened
a "decisive response" if the US navy were

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,280
to sail through its made-up territorial waters.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,680
But the US Navy did sail through there on
Tuesday, and judging by the fact that we're

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,490
still not at war, Beijing didn't exactly take
a whole lot of "decisive action."

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,170
Well, the Foreign Ministry did speak some
decisive words:

29
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:05,560
"China will resolutely respond to any country's
deliberate provocations."

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,069
And I guess the spokesman's words counts as
China's resolute response.

31
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,730
Which makes sense, because the US was never
trying to provoke China in the first place.

32
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,099
"To sail a ship through international waters
is not a provocative act in any way whatsoever,

33
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,890
and should not be taken as a provocative act."

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,890
Surrrree.

35
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,890
(Wink)

36
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,689
Just like when the US flew a surveillance
plane over the islands in May that the Chinese

37
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,799
regime said it absolutely wouldn't tolerate.

38
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,349
Or when the US Military did the same thing
in the newly established Air Defense Zone

39
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,720
China created over the East China Sea at the
end of 2013.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,569
And besides some saber rattling, also nothing
happened.

41
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,079
Now despite building artificial islands in
disputed waters and then building military

42
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,239
facilities on said islands, the Chinese regime
claims these are for peaceful purposes, like

43
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,120
providing better weather forecasts, or better
service for international ships sailing through,

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,950
or don't blame them, they were been bullied
into it!

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,409
Of course none of these excuses has actually
resolved anything, but neither has anything

46
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:08,529
else.

47
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:13,260
China won't stop building, and the US is not
going to respect made-up territorial claims

48
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,450
in a region that affects so many of its allies.

49
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,640
So the US will probably keep testing the water,
and China will probably keep having its foreign

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,230
ministry say some decisive things.

51
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,719
So what do you think of what the US did in
the South China Sea?

52
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,719
Will there be war?
