Yeah, have a point.

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,179
Have a point for that straight away.

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,920
- Do they play football?
- Is it about their... aagh!

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,940
Yeah, but American football.

18

00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Yes.

25
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,860
Yes, Sark is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,870
Okay, fair enough.

27
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,350
What are the Channel Islands?

28
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,140
Let’s start really, really far out.

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,740
Are they... some islands...
in the English Channel, Tom?

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,440
Yeah, you’re not getting a point for that.

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
- What?
- What?

32
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,600
You’re not getting a point
when I gave you the title!

33
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,000
I don’t understand the question, then.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,790
There’s something special about, sort of,
how they…

35
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,260
Oh, are you asking me what they’re called?

36
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,580
Oh, Jesus f***.

37
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,540
There’s one called Jersey,
there’s one called Guernsey,

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,740
- Go on.
- ...and there’s one called St Helen’s?

39
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
No.

40
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,520
- No.
- St Helen’s is near Wigan!

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,620
You’re thinking of St Helena, and that’s
on the other side of the planet.

42
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,620
Okay, yes...

43
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
Alderney.

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
Alderney is the other one, yes.

45
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,380
Does one of them have a capital
of St Helena of Guernsey?

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Yes.

I’m getting something right.

49
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,380
That’s my job!

50
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,520
And the thing is, you’re wrong,
it’s Saint Helier.

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,580
When you say, “What are the Channel Islands?”

52
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,060
my standard answer is usually,
“Occupied France.”

53
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,920
Yes, and have a point.

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
Absolutely, they were the only bit…

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,630
Did you just give a point for that?

56
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,320
Well, that’s one of the questions I was
going to ask.

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,590
They were the only bit of the United Kingdom,
well, UK territory,

58
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,000
that was actually taken by Germany in the
Second World War.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,320
They were invaded in 1940, or ’41.

60
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,480
I forget the year.

61
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,460
I wasn’t there, why the f*** am I like that?
Honestly.

62
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,320
In 1940, but in terms of Britain,
what are they?

63
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,330
Crown territory.

64
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,330
Yes.

65
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,260
Have the point, they are a crown dependency,

66
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,800
but they are not part of the United Kingdom.

Is Sark the one where you don’t have any
motor vehicles?

72
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,220
Is it still bicycles and horses and carts?

73
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,420
Oh, yes, absolutely right.

74
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,850

78
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,270
I need some slides...

79
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,810
So was that just, “And this is not a car,
and this is not a car, and this is not a car...

Yes.

Oh, cracking, want one.

He’s on home turf here, come on.

91
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,400
Obscure crown territory facts, bring it on.

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,800
It was considered the last feudal state in
Europe until 2008,

93
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,920
when they reformed it, but yes, that will...

94
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,150
You own the island, therefore
you own the people.

95
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,420
Yeah, pretty much.

96
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,410
Oh, please say they had a Communist revolution.

97
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,060
I know they didn’t but, you know?

98
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,100
- The horses.
- A horsey uprising!

99
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,560
'The Reform', it’s referred to...

100
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,790
That sounds more ominous than it
ought t'be, really, doesn’t it?

101
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,790
'The Reform.'

102
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,050
It is all capitalised.

103
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,490
And if you didn’t like the idea,
would that be Sark snark?

104

Jesus.

105
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,490
Yes?

106
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,940
No, it’s sark-asm.

107
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,640
When you’re negative about it.

108
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,890
Oh, guys, that deserved more,
sark-asm, it really did.

109
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,650
There are a lot of old laws still in place.

110
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,560
They didn’t have divorce until 2003.

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,250
Was it separation of bed and table?

112
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,819
I don’t know what that is.

113
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,310
That is the way you could organise a form
of divorce pre-divorce being allowed.

114
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,900
You were allowed to live apart
by the church courts.

115
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,370
Mensa et thoro.

116
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,840
Oh yeah, come on, it’s all in here somewhere!

117
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,300
I mean, I'm...

118
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,340
Because you’ve just basically told me the
entire first paragraph of a completely different

119
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,979
Wikipedia article I haven't loaded.

120
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:33,979
So, yes.

121
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,099
Third time in three shows, by the way.

122
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,509
But how can you now get divorced on Sark?

123
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,590
You can murder the other person.

124
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,900
Not technically a divorce.

125
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,580
I reckon that was always an option,
you know, mate.

126
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,480
Oh! Leave.
Get divorced, come back.

127
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,420
Yes.

128
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,960
You can now get divorced in Guernsey
and come back to Sark.

129
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,080
“Those liberal Guernsey b******s,”
they probably think.

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,229
Having been out on islands like that,

131
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,650
when I was on holidays a few years ago
I went out to one of the Hebridean islands.

132
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,639
I went to Coll, which is a similar kind of thing,
very small island.

133
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,180
They have a very slightly larger neighbour,
Tiree, who they see as being stuck up,

134
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,860
because A, they have the Co-op,
and B, they have the policeman.

135
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,259
And what happens is when the policeman gets
on the boat to come over,

136
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,759
they phone up the island, and everyone hides
their non-registered cars and stuff

137
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,330
until the policeman has left.

138
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,789
And now you’ve just ratted all of them out.

139
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,060
Yeah! Get over there,
policeman from Tiree, come on!

140
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,200
But by the time he’s got there, they’ll
have hidden them again.

141
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,560
Hidden the cars, yes.

142
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Somewhere on that island, the phone's just...

143
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,400
“Oh, we said not to tell anyone!”

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,300
“Gary, we told you...!”

145
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,240
We briefly mentioned the economy, what is
Sark’s economy driven by?

146
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,700
Horses!

147
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,080
Sarcasm.

148
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,380
Tourism.

149
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,580
Yes, and you also said that earlier,
financial services.

150
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,280
Eh, kids?

151
00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:00,500
It has... a low amount of tax,
let’s say that.

152
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,669
How long do you have to live there?

153
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,020
It’s got to be over a number of years, probably.

154
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,040
I’m guessing owning a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny
fraction of a bit of land counts as living there.

155
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,919
Three months in a tax year.

156
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:11,919
Okay, fair enough.

157
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,180
If you’re there for 91 days, you’re good.

158
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,600
You’re a resident,

159
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,620
you get their tax laws if you want them.

160
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,361
Don’t do this, I’m really crap at tax stuff.

161
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,361
Do they have to be...

162
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:20,500
I’m rapidly figuring out if I can do this,

163
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,870
the answer is almost certainly no,
but I’m thick as mince.

164
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,360
Don’t let me near this.

165
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,710
Just a sec.

166
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,719
This means all your tax savings could be spent
on getting a hovercraft there,

167
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:30,930
and then you could get a hovercraft there,

168
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,280
and that would be fun, because it’s a hovercraft.

169
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,900
It is quite a long way away.

170
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,279
Tom, Tom, Tom, please can I have
a go on a hovercraft?

171
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,089
What we’re saying is we all want a go on
a hovercraft.

172
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,380
And I think I can arrange that, but...

173
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,380
Ooh!

174
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,960
Smash cut to...

175
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,569
I’m more worried about Matt’s tax advice
system here, which is

176
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,820
- “Yes, we can save you money for a hovercraft.”
- Hovercraft, hovercraft, hovercraft.

177
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,939
Like, it’s not the worst tax advice
I’ve ever heard, but…

178
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,260
If we did, we could do a show on a hovercraft,
it would be ‘on air’, because it’s…

179
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,320
It’s a golf clap. It’s a golf clap.

180
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
It's a good four.

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,420
I’m not biscuiting that.

182
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,680
The legal system on Sark
also has something called...

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
er, I’m going to try and pronounce French
again here, which is never great.

184
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh great.

185
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,930
The Clameur de haro.

186
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,930
Clammy arrows?

187
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,009
Is that along the lines of the hue and cry
for a criminal, or something like that?

188
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:25,509
Oh, it’s connected to hue and cry.

189
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,300
I’ll absolutely give you a point for that.

190
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,249
Yes, for apprehending a felon,
or something like that, no?

191
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,600
Ah, not in this case, but
what is the hue and cry?

192
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,189
Hue and cry is an ancient thing where in a
community

193
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:37,339
you would be responsible for raising the hue
and cry if someone had committed a crime

194
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,720
and was passing through your community.

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,610
It’s, “All pile on,” basically, in a
legal term.

196
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,729
Right, so it's like the law,

197
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,360
but on a small island where the law operates
like American football.

198
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
This is not on Sark.

199
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,419
I should point out for a hue and cry,

200
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,449
all able-bodied men, upon hearing the shouts,
were obliged to assist.

201
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,780
Oh, that sounds like so much fun.

202
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,500
This is the hue and cry, though, this is not
Clameur de haro.

203
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,140
A-r-r-o-w?

204
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,580
No, h-a-r-o.

205
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Oh.

206
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,039
This is kind of the opposite.

207
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,130
This is not going to catch someone,
this is to stop someone.

208
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,130
Ignore someone.

209
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,550
I was going to say, professionally ignoring
crimes.

210
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,580
Wait, tax haven!

211
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,020
“Hovercraft, what hovercraft?”

212
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,849
“It’s disguised as a barn, officer!”

213
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,860
No, it’s disguised as a load of money.

214
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,620
Is that a formal way of saying,

215
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,120
“Geroff my land!”?

216
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,140
Yeah, go on.

217
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:39,680
It’s not, “Get off my land,” but yes,
it is a formal Thing that you Do.

218
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,650
This is annoying me, because I half know this.

219
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,300
It’s some kind of judicial process where

220
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,620
you effectively bring someone
in front of the king

221
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,720
to adjudge on a land case or
something like that, isn’t it?

222
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,940
It is, it's a very specific process.

223
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,300
The procedure is performed on one’s knees.

224
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,780
Steady everyone.

225
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,980
Before at least two witnesses,

226
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,060
in the presence of the wrongdoer,

227
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,760
and in the location of the offence.

228
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,700
All right?

229
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,490
The Criant, the person complaining,

230
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,920
with his hand in the air must call out,

231
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,779
“Hear me, hear me, hear me.

232
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,170
“Come to my aid, my prince,
for someone does me wrong.”

233
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,040
- Yes.
- That’s a hell of a safe word.

234
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,670
Try speaking that through the orange, yeah!

235
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,990
Followed by reciting what well-known thing
in French?

236
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,060
Lord’s prayer.

237
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Yes, absolutely right.

238
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
It’s been done recently, this.

239
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,480
- Yes it has.
- This is why I’ve heard of it,

240
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,240
it’s because it’s in
some kind of land dispute,

241
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,400
and it’s something like a hedge or a garage
or something like that,

242
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,680
and the guy is basically on the verge of 
losing the case,

243
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,029
and as one final, basically, legal dick move
just dropped to his knees and did that.

244
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,850
And everyone went,
“Oh, s***, that’s still enforced.”

245
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,850
That kind of thing.

246
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,149
What happens after the
Lord’s prayer is recited?

247
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:00,540
What does the person they are challenging
need to do?

248
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,410
Based on what’s already gone before, presumably
adopt a backwards crab position,

249
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,370
walk in a circle on a full moon,

250
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,660
but any other time of the year, you have to
go completely rectilinear,

251
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,290
and shout something, yeah,
let’s go with Latin.

252
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,440
It is significantly simpler than that.

253
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,020
Most things are!

254
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,760
There are people in this room with doctoral
theses that were easier to complete than that.

255
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,500
Do they just go, “Right”?

256
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,250
Yes, that’s basically it.

257
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,690
They just have to stop what they’re doing.

258
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,500
Regardless of whether they are legally entitled
to do it or not,

259
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,680
if that is used they have to stop
and it goes to adjudication.

260
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,400
Wouldn’t you if someone got on their knees
and did all of that?

261
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Yes, to be fair, yes.

262
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,540
Yeah, but only to watch!

263
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,449
As the bulldozer rumbled towards them, yes.

264
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:49,850
And if you call without a valid reason,
you pay a fine.

265
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,850
If you call and, er...

266
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,110
How much is the fine?

267
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,060
I’m going to say this, is it one that’s
been set a long time ago?

268
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
Yeah, two guineas!

269
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,360
It’s either ludicrously cheap,
or ludicrously expensive.

270
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,620
It doesn’t actually say.

271
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,800
It just says, “a penalty”.

272
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Oh.

273
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,060
You just have to take a free kick.

274
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,959
Hang on, didn’t we start on
the football team, like, 20 minutes ago?

275
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,959
Yes.

276
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,709
Where I was going to bring this back to in
a little while,

277
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,700
but we got onto the legal system of Sark at
some point, so.

278
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,860
Hold your horses!

279
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,720
Yes!

280
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Thank you.

281
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,579
What, they have to take a set of penalties,
and it’s best of six or something?

282
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,879
Yes, I’m going to pass it to you.

283
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,410
Every time the other team scores,
the entire Sark team does that.

284
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,029
Well, that would be quite difficult.

285
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,709
What’s the population of Sark, roughly?

286
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,800
Don’t forget some of them are only there
91 days of the year.

287
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,110
Well this is what I’m trying to
factor in here.

288
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,160
Though they probably send the butler
to play for them.

289
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,540
I was going to say something like 150, but
when you count actual residents,

290
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,139
if it’s so easy, it could be in the thousands.

291
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,810
It’s about 600 people.

292
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:53,519
So, as you can imagine, the Sark football
team does not have a lot of people who are

293
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,209
highly qualified to play football.

294
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,080
- Correct.
- Are any of them horses?

295
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,060
The Sark football team are all human.

296
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,980
Starting at base principles here.

297
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,490
Who do they play against?

298
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,490
Other football teams.

299
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,490
Yes.

300
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,490
I’m not giving you a point for that.

301
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,490
(F*** you!)

302
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,570
Oh, is it the Channel League?

303
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,600
Anyone who wants to come over and play them.

304
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Hang on a minute.

305
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,720
Hang on chaps, do we know seven other people?

306
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,880
I’m getting an idea here.

307
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,040
Yes, same.

308
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
Hovercraft?

309
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,300
From what I’ve heard of this team, do we
need another 11-minus-4 people?

310
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,020
Ah, good idea.

311
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,060
You’re absolutely right, I’m going to
give you a point for islands as well,

312
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,889
because their international matches were in
2003.

313
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,130
There's four of them listed here.

314
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,850
They’ve done international matches?

315
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,600
Against Gibraltar, the Isle of Wight, Greenland,
and a place...

316
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,149
I’m going to mispronounce the vowel in this,
called Frøya.

317
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,709
Frozen yoghurt?

318
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,310
That’s ‘froyo’...!

319
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,400
They lost 2-1!

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,430
They lost to Sorbet United.

321
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,310
Absolutely done over by Yop, yeah.

322
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,850
So they had these four matches in 2003.

323
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,970
How did they do?

324
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,649
All conclusive losses.

325
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,649
Yes.

326
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:00,649
Boom.

327
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,649
How conclusive?

328
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:02,649
Very.

329
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,649
Yes, I'm going to...

330
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,769
Like, double digits.

331
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:05,940
Yes.

332
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,880
Was it because Gibraltar
are a full nation now?

333
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,650
So Gibraltar must have pasted at least 20,
or something like that.

334
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,930
19-0, I’ll give you a point for that.

335
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,020
It was 20-0 against the Isle of Wight.

336
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,080
20!

337
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,140
Full FIFA member, Isle of Wight, love it.

338
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,440
Greenland, 16-0 against Sark.

339
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,420
Frøya, 15-0 against Sark.

340
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,529
They still tried!

341
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:27,529
Lads...

342
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,720
“No, no, we’re going to do it today.”

343
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
They still turned up.

344
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,140
Which is more than the England side do(!)

345
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,139
Lads, we could do this.

346
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,640
I’m sorry, we could be the first team to
go over and get beaten by Sark.

347
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Yes!

348
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,420
Yeah. Goes on the list.

349
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,000
- Yep.
- We would get in all of the Sark papers(!)

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,520
- We would.
- We would.

351
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,540
Dibs on goal.

352
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,019
Oh, no, I’m ex-keeper.

353
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,460
- Yeah, Gary is, actually...
- I don’t care, I called dibs first.

354
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,019
Well, that’s fair.

355
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,019
For one thing, we don’t want an ex-keeper.

356
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,260
We want somebody who’s not going to bother
in goal so they win!

357
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,839
Pull me up front!

358
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,340
To be fair, that is how it also works in the
England team.

359
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,420
“Dibs keeper”!

360
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,860
Right, I’ll book the hovercraft.

361
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,480
We can, no, I am genuinely up for this s***.

362
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
I will do this.

363
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Put it on the list.

364
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,690
I would love to have that, as the first team
to lose profe...

365
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,490
We’re not from an island,
that’s the only problem.

366
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,260
We’ll go and stand on
that one in Peasholm Park,

367
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,980
put up a flag, take a picture and...

368
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Oh, yeah!

369
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,379
Do you have a phone number for...

370
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,379
Sark?

371
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,420
I reckon they have more than one phone,
you know?

372
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,709
Shall we ring them now?

373
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,709
“Lads, lads, the phone’s ringing!”

374
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,100
Entire town.

375
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
“Yes?!”

376
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
What happens is, he takes the message,

377
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,629
sounds a bugle for the lord to come down and
be read the proclamation.

378
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,160
“Hue and cry!
The mainland have challenged us to football.”

379
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,149
“A duel of footer, you say?”

380
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,120
He says, in his big chair in his hall, as
I imagine he still has.

381
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,389
Shall I ring Sark now?

382
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,580
- Yes!
- Yes.

383
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,300
- Do it.
- There’s no signal, there’s no signal.

384
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,840
It’s a genuine thing, right?

385
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,340
You’ve been playing good people,
it hasn’t worked out.

386
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,430
We’re s***, right?

387
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,019
And we know we are!

388
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,240
Yeah!
♪ We're... ♪

389
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,060
We’re Peasholm Park United, take it on.

390
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,040
And on that, congratulations, Gary, you win
the show.

391
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,960
Whoo-ah!

392
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,820
You win a bright orange thing for a large
mustelid to bounce on in isolation.

393
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,379
It’s a tangerine wolverine quarantine trampoline.

394
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,280
So, do enjoy that.

395
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,680
With that, we say thank you to Chris Joel.

396
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,699
Oh! Yeah.

397
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
To Gary Brannan.

398
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,420
To Matt Gray.

399
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,660
Good-bye-bye YouTube.

400
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,260
I’ve been Tom Scott,
we’ll see you next time.
