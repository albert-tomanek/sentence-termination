00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,280
the exceptionally dangerous thing China is
doing that could accidentally kill millions

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,519
of people...

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,769
and not just inside China.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,759
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,630
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,730
Bacteria.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,480
Basically the bad guys from the Matrix.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,619
Only real.

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,230
And everywhere.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,640
A hundred years ago,

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,499
outbreaks of infectious disease were fairly
common.

13
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:33,540
But then better sanitation and the discovery
of antibiotics changed that.

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,870
Which is how we can have a world as connected
as it is today,

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,899
without this happening.

16
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,100
"The most optimistic projection that USAMRIID
is willing to make for the spread of the virus

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,340
is this.

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,870
24 hours.

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,399
36 hours.

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,930
48 hours."

21
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,219
OK, I know the movie Outbreak was about a
virus,

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,250
and I'm talking about bacteria.

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,420
But they can both kill people following the
same terrible pattern.

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,289
Anyway, antibiotics have saved a lot of lives.

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,220
But there's a problem.

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,730
Over time, bacteria can evolve resistance
to antibiotics.

27
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,420
Which means you have to use stronger antibiotics.

28
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,800
And when the bacteria become immune to that,

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,790
you have to use stronger antibiotics.

30
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,860
And so on.

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,820
It's like that episode of the Simpsons where
Springfield solves its pigeon problem with

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,050
lizards that eat the pigeons.

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,840
"What happens when we're overrun with lizards?"

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,130
"No problem, we just release Chinese lizard
snakes.

35
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,540
They'll wipe out the lizards."

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,510
"But aren't the snakes even worse?"

37
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,390
"Yes, but we're prepared for that.

38
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,590
We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla
that thrives on snake meat."

39
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,390
"But then we're stuck with gorillas!"

40
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,080
"No, that's the beautiful part.

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,290
When wintertime rolls around the gorillas
simply freeze to death."

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,500
But what happens when you don't have the snake-eating
gorilla version of an antibiotic?

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,940
Well, the world enters what scientists call
"the post-antibiotic era."

44
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,580
It's a time when bacteria have evolved resistance
to all forms of antibiotics.

45
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,670
The BBC says this "could plunge medicine back
into the dark ages."

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,950
Which is why I've come up with "Dr." Chappell's
Live Leeches.

47
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,030
Guaranteed to suck out all the bad humors.

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,769
So unless you're in the leech business,

49
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,489
this is something you really, really don't
want to happen.

50
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,620
Well, haha, it's happening.

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,540
"The very last line of defense,

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,180
the last drug doctors used when all other
antibiotics failed,

53
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,489
no longer works because bacteria have become
resistant to it

54
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,249
things like surgery will no longer be effective."

55
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:36,450
The drug he's talking about

56
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,819
the last line of defense

57
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,680
is called colistin.

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,370
It was first introduced in 1959,

59
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,909
but hardly ever used,

60
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,060
even though it's really effective against
bacteria.

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,390
That's because it's also really effective
at destroying your kidneys.

62
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,629
But it's still useful in those rare cases
where all other antibiotics failed.

63
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,209
Fortunately, since Colistin wasn't used much,

64
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,670
it also meant bacteria hadn't built up resistance
to Colistin.

65
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,790
Did you notice how I said all that in the
past tense?

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,200
It turns out, Chinese farmers have been feeding
Colistin to farm animals for more than a decade.

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,579
You see, low levels of antibiotics can help
fatten animals up,

68
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:26,060
plus keep them alive in the really, really
unsanitary conditions of a factory farm.

69
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,969
This unnecessary use of antibiotics is a very
short-sighted way of doing things,

70
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,840
but it's done all over the world

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,420
usually with other antibiotics.

72
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,279
But because almost no one else uses Colistin,

73
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,970
it also means it's cheap.

74
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,489
Perfect for the poorly regulated pig farms
of China.

75
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,040
Except, according to a report in the Lancet
Infectious Disease journal,

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,239
this has led to a gene that grants immunity
to "the last line of defense."

77
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,700
Researchers first discovered it in 2013 when
they found E. coli bacteria that couldn't

78
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,739
be killed with Colistin in a pig on a farm
near Shanghai.

79
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:09,180
Then, they found bacteria with colistin resistance
in supermarkets and slaughterhouses,

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,049
and even in hospital patients.

81
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,489
That's right, it's already spread to humans.

82
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:22,510
And this new resistant gene discovered in
China is not in the bacteria's chromosomes.

83
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,380
It's in the bacteria's plasmid

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:32,230
which means it can be easily passed around
to other species of bacteria.

85
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,600
The transfer rate has been called "ridiculously
high."

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,440
In fact, this resistant gene already been
discovered in Malaysia, Laos, and now, Europe.

87
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,310
The fear is this new gene will get passed
around along with other antibiotic resistant

88
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,560
genes.

89
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,840
That could eventually create a pan-drug resistant
bacteria.

90
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,610
In other words, a bacteria that can't be killed
by anything we throw at it.

91
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,200
According to the authors of this report,

92
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,560
"pan-drug resistance is inevitable and will
ultimately become global."

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,870
Doctors will "face increasing numbers of patients
for whom we will need to say,

94
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,620
'Sorry, there is nothing I can do to cure
your infection.'"

95
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,800
Now you might be asking,

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,680
well why don't we just make new, more powerful
antibiotics?

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,260
Surely there's some kind of gorilla-eating
shark,

98
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,420
or shark-crushing meteor we can use, right?

99
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,960
Well it turns out,

100
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,440
making a new antibiotic is extraordinarily
difficult.

101
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,400
It's been 30 years since the last antibiotic
was created.

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,670
Early this year,

103
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,490
researchers at the Northeastern University
in Boston said they may have at last discovered

104
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,480
a new one that could help push back the post-antibiotic
era.

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,010
But it hasn't gone through human trials yet.

106
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,900
And it can only push back the inevitable.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,710
Every year bacteria become more resistant
to the antibiotics we have.

108
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,490
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimates that by 2050,

109
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,500
antibiotic resistant bacteria will kill 10
million people.

110
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,630
Worst case scenario?

111
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,240
A global epidemic that can't be stopped by
any form of antibiotics.

112
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,550
On the bright side though,

113
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,790
this isn't the first time something like this
has happened.

114
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,840
In the early 2000s,

115
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,330
a strain of staph infection developed an immunity
to an antibiotic similar to Colistin,

116
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,420
and the gene was also on its plasmid.

117
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,660
Scientists then had the same fears.

118
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,300
In 15 years, there's only been 14 infections
in the US.

119
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,540
The difference, though, is that this time,

120
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,730
the resistant gene could spread more quickly
because of Colistin's widespread use on Chinese

121
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,660
pig farms.

122
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,190
One piece of good news is that the US doesn't
import pork from China.

123
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,520
In fact, you're most likely to eat tilapia
imported from China.

124
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,350
Which is safe, right?

125
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,270
What, what's that, Shelley?

126
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,150
Tilapia feed premixed with colistin?!

127
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,500
So what do you think?

128
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,330
Is this the start of the post-antibiotic era?
