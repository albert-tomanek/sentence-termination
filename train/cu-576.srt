00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
Thousands of students protest in China

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,720
Facing off with riot police

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Did they actually win?

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,240
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,440
Massive protests happened in China last week.\h
There’s something you don’t hear every day.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Thousands of students clashed with police\h
last week across several universities.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Walls of student protesters met a wall\h
of police at a university in Nanjing.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,560
Police surged into the university.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,080
And hauled off protesters.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
That’s one way to graduate.

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
The Party has been terrified of\h
Chinese students ever since the\h\h

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,080
student-led protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,680
The Party sent in tanks to crush those protests\h
on June 4th. This is known in the West as the\h\h

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,720
Tiananmen Square Massacre, and in China as\h
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,080
So yeah, the Chinese Communist Party\h
doesn’t deal well with student protests.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,960
And since this series of student protests began\h
on June 4th, the Party was less than thrilled.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
So why did these students protest last\h
week? Was it about freedom and democracy?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
Actually, it was about college mergers.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,200
The Chinese Ministry of Education is trying to\h
merge private colleges with vocational schools.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,280
Which led to this. These students feel very\h
strongly about academic administration.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,680
Let me explain. Chinese society\h
today is ultra competitive.
 \h

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,280
“China is expected to have a record nine\h
million university graduates this year.”

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,160
That’s a lot of people competing for a very\h
small number of good jobs. So everyone is\h\h

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,800
looking for an edge. If students don’t get into a\h
university, some turn to private colleges instead.

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,160
They charge higher tuition, but you\h
can graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\h\h

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,600
A bachelor’s degree is seen as more prestigious\h
than a vocational degree. But the Communist Party\h\h

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,080
has now ordered private colleges\h
to merge with vocational schools.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,360
So students at private colleges are now\h
paying more money and getting a worse degree.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
They were not happy with that plan.

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,520
At Nanjing Normal University, where\h
over a thousand students protested,\h\h

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,840
Chinese police said students held\h
their 55 year old principal hostage.

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,520
“But students said on social media platforms\h
that [the principal] was protesting together\h\h

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,960
with students by sitting on the ground in front of\h
a lecture hall. Students provided [the principal]\h\h

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,920
with water, food, a cellphone charger, and\h
tissues, according to social media posts.”

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Wait, are you saying that Chinese police would lie\h
about the students to justify their own actions?\h\h

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Hard to believe.

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,840
The backlash got so bad, some provinces\h
suspended the college merger plan.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,680
Though the protesters who camped\h
out at Nanjing Normal University\h\h

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,120
weren’t told about that until *after* police\h
attacked them with batons and pepper spray.

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,960
So on the surface, the students have won.\h
The college merger plan has been suspended,\h\h

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,680
for now. But, it’s likely that Chinese\h
officials just don’t want any trouble\h\h

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
ahead of the Communist Party’s\h
100-year anniversary in July.

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,120
Once that’s over, the Party’s retaliation against\h
these student protesters will likely begin.

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,600
Now the interesting thing about this\h
story is that all these students\h\h

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,280
have gone through decades of what\h
China calls patriotic education.\h\h

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,480
It was a systematic brainwashing\h
campaign led by the Communist Party\h\h

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,640
after the Tiananmen Square Massacre to ensure that\h
students of all ages don’t question the Party.

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,160
I’m sure most of these students never even\h
heard of the Tiananmen Square Massacre\h\h

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,720
and were completely oblivious to the\h
anniversary they unintentionally commemorated.\h

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,720
So it must have been a shock to\h
them when their reasonable concerns\h\h

51
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
were met with violence from the police.

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,800
The Communist Party gave the\h
Chinese people a Faustian bargain.\h\h

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,960
If you don’t criticize our regime, you can\h
have freedom to...make money. But that’s it.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,760
If you’re not happy about it,\h\h

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,120
there’s nothing you can do. In fact, if you\h
do protest, you’re branded as a troublemaker.

56
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,440
So when the Communist Party cracks\h
down on a person, or a group,\h\h

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,680
the general reaction is, well that group did\h
something wrong. They brought it on themselves.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
Until, like these students,\h\h

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,120
you find yourself in the group that’s\h
being repressed for a “reasonable” concern.

60
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Remember, in a communist\h
regime, everyone’s a target.

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,040
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,760
fans who support us and our efforts to expose\h
the truth about the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,240
by contributing through crowd\h
funding website Patreon.

64
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,160
Balthamus195 asks, “China has\h
threatened anyone who tries to boycott\h\h

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,800
the 2022 Beijing Olympics but nobody\h
is even allowed into the country,\h\h

66
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,560
unless they've taken a Chinese vaccine. I doubt\h
many athletes care that much about the boycott\h\h

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
but I don't think they’d be willing to get\h
the Chinese vaccine (especially if they've\h\h

68
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,680
already been vaccinated). So will China\h
back down on this requirement for entry?”

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,600
That’s a really interesting question. The Olympics\h
really matter to the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,520
That’s why they’re freaked out by any\h
international calls for a boycott.

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,280
But China is also using the\h
Olympics for its vaccine diplomacy.\h\h

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,440
They’ve offered Chinese vaccines for this year's\h
Tokyo Olympics and next year’s Beijing Olympics.

73
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,720
And the International Olympics Committee was\h
like, thank you so much! That’s such a great idea!

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Japan, however, said no thank you.

75
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,720
But for the Beijing Olympics in 2022, can China\h
force Olympic athletes to take Chinese vaccines?\h\h

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,720
Earlier this year, China did say\h
that only foreigners who took\h\h

77
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
Chinese vaccines would be\h
allowed into the country.

78
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,160
But according to an embassy statement\h
in April, US citizens who have taken\h\h

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
US vaccines can now enter China as well.

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,440
So while I’m sure the Chinese regime will make\h
every effort to make a deal with the IOC to push\h\h

81
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,040
Chinese vaccines, the Communist Party’s priority\h
is making sure the Olympics happen without a\h\h

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,000
hitch. So I don’t think athletes would be banned\h
if they haven’t taken the Chinese vaccines.

83
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Thanks for your question and\h
