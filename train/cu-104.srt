1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,720
China’s military is on the rise

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,480
Deadly new weapons could destroy Taiwan

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:15,920
And the US is helping China build them

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,760
You can help us continue to uncensor China by\h
joining what I call the China Uncensored 50\h\h

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,600
Cent Army. All it takes is as little as a dollar\h
per episode on the crowd funding website Patreon.\h\h

Check out all the cool perks you\h
get on Patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,040
China has a secret weapon. One so devastating,\h
it could even make an invasion of Taiwan\h\h

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,560
possible. What is this secret weapon? American\h
greed. And stupidity. Don’t forget stupidity.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,200
Ok, technically that’s two secret weapons.\h

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,200
China is building advanced weapons\h
systems using American technology.\h\h

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,120
And the Americans who are profiting\h
are looking the other way.

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,320
China is using American microchips\h
to build hypersonic weapons.\h\h

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,440
Hypersonic missiles can travel\h
more than five times the speed of\h\h

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,320
sound. Current missile defense systems\h
are next to useless against them.

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,400
With these weapons, China could target US Navy\h
ships or US bases in the Pacific. Or even Taiwan.\h\h

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,640
Which China has promised to invade.\h
Chinese hypersonic missiles launched\h\h

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
from the Chinese mainland could\h
reach Taiwan in just minutes.

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
It looks like China’s military tested\h
one of these hypersonic missiles\h\h

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,440
during a recent military drill.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,720
These are not easy weapons to develop, though.\h
They require complex testing using supercomputers.\h\h

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,080
Supercomputers require semiconductors, basically\h
the brains of these computers. And semiconductors,\h\h

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,600
“are now China’s top import, valued\h
at more than $300 billion a year,\h\h

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,080
and a major priority in China’s latest\h
Five-Year Plan for national development.”

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,400
The US has long restricted companies from selling\h
sensitive technology to the Chinese military.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,520
But what about selling US technology\h
*private* Chinese companies? That’s legal.

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
And that’s where Phytium Technology comes in.

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,880
It’s a private Chinese company,\h
founded in 2014 as a joint venture\h\h

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,800
of the state-owned conglomerate\h
China Electronic Corporation,\h\h

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,240
the National Supercomputing Center in\h
Tianjin, and the Tianjin municipal government.

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
That...doesn’t sound private to me.

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,640
But who owns Phytium now? Well, according to\h
public records, “Phytium’s ownership has changed\h\h

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,920
hands over the years, but its shareholders\h
often have links to the [Chinese military].”

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,040
That doesn’t sound private to me!

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,280
Currently, Phytium has partnered with the China\h
Aerodynamics Research and Development Center.\h\h

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,840
Together they’re doing research on hypersonic\h
missiles. Oh, by the way the China Aerodynamics\h\h

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Research and Development Center,\h
“is run by a PLA major general”.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,880
That doesn’t sound private to me!!!

39
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,240
In fact, the China Aerodynamics\h
Research and Development Center,\h\h

40
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,320
“has been on the U.S. trade\h
blacklist — called the “entity list”—\h\h

41
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,240
since 1999 for contributing to\h
‘the proliferation of missiles.’”\h

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,680
And in 2016, the US Commerce Department\h
put even more restrictions on it.

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,240
These connections are all in publicly available\h
documents. And yet, several American companies\h\h

44
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,800
work with Phytium, because it’s technically a\h
private Chinese company. And if you’re technically\h\h

45
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,800
*allowed* to sell them sensitive technology\h
and make money from it, what’s wrong with that?

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,240
According to Eric Lee of\h
the Project 2049 Institute,\h\h

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,160
“Phytium acts like an independent commercial\h
company. Its executives wear civilian clothes,\h\h

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,880
but they are mostly former military\h
officers from [a military university].”

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,480
That military university is the National\h
University of Defense Technology,\h\h

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,400
or NUDT. We’ve talked about it several times\h
on the show. Think of it like the MIT of the\h\h

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,760
People’s Liberation Army. We did a whole\h
episode about how Australian tax dollars\h\h

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,520
are funding these Chinese military\h
universities, even on nuclear weapons testing.

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,760
Thanks, Australia. No, seriously. It’s nice\h
to know it’s not just the US being stupid.\h\h

54
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,040
And greedy.\h

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,480
And if it makes you feel better,\h
even Taiwan is being stupid.

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,120
A lot of Taiwanese companies rely on the China\h
market. 35% of Taiwan’s trade is with China—a\h\h

57
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,480
country that has promised to invade them!\h
Talk about sleeping with the enemy.\h

58
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,280
Taiwan now makes some of the most advanced\h
semiconductors in the world. Especially the Taiwan\h\h

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,840
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. They make\h
microprocessors for Phytium. Which is using that\h\h

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,680
technology to run tests on hypersonic missiles\h
that could be used against Taiwanese troops.

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,440
There are other Taiwanese\h
companies involved as well.\h\h

62
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
But whether it’s Taiwanese or American\h
companies, they all say the same thing—their\h\h

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,680
technology is not going to the Chinese\h
military because Phytium is a private company.\h

64
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,520
This is crazy! The Chinese Communist Party is even\h
open about what they call Military-Civil Fusion.\h\h

65
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,200
The State Department has\h
said it’s a way for the CCP\h\h

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:00,640
“to ensure that new innovations simultaneously\h
advance economic and military development.”

67
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,720
And the Military-Civil Fusion\h
program is personally overseen\h\h

68
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Who\h
is also the head of the military.

69
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
THAT DOESN’T SOUND LIKE IT’S PRIVATE TO ME!

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
In the final days of the Trump Administration,\h
Phytium and a few other Chinese companies were\h\h

71
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,440
going to be placed on an export black\h
list. But they ran out of time to do it.\h

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,080
But there’s good news! This past week, the\h
Biden administration officially added Phytium,\h\h

73
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,520
along with six other Chinese\h
companies, to that blacklist.

74
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,920
It’s nice to know that the Trump and\h
Biden administrations can agree on\h\h

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,200
not selling US technology to companies literally\h
making missiles to be used against the US.\h

76
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
Maybe there’s hope after all.\h

77
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,000
And now it’s time for me to respond to a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 cent army,\h\h

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,840
fans who support the show on Patreon.

79
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,240
davidKansasCity says, “It's past time\h
for the Philippians to take ownership of\h\h

80
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,040
all the cool stuff China built for them on\h
the islands in the Philippians territory…”

81
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
Ahh, it would be something if the\h
Philippines managed to take all those\h\h

82
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,400
nice man-made islands the Chinese Communist\h
Party built. But that won’t be so easy to do.\h

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,040
For one, several of those islands have missile\h
launchers on them. And are heavily militarized,\h\h

84
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,520
despite the Chinese Communist Party’s\h
promise to...not militarize them.\h

85
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,560
Chinese leader Xi Jinping made that pledge during\h
a press conference with President Obama in 2015.

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,640
But hey, it depends on what your definition\h
of “militarized” is. Am I right?\h

87
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
At this point, the Philippines, along with\h
other countries like Vietnam, are having a\h\h

88
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,720
hard time just preventing China from taking\h
over more territory in the South China Sea.\h

89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,480
You see, China sends out a fleet of *private*\h
fishing boats into disputed territorial waters.\h\h

90
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,320
Those *private* fishing\h
can number in the hundreds.

91
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,560
But these *private* fishing boats are actually\h
part of what the CCP calls the maritime militia.\h\h

92
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,760
Except when the Chinese embassy denies they exist.

93
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,240
And wherever China’s maritime militia\h
goes, the Chinese coast guard is close by.

94
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,000
During a recent surge, the Philippines counted,\h\h

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,160
“254 [Chinese] ships as well as four\h
Chinese warships that day in the Spratlys”.

96
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,520
So if another country were to fire on\h
the quote unquote civilian fishermen,\h\h

97
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,600
the Chinese Coast guard can rush\h
to their defense and be the hero.

98
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,360
In fact, China recently passed the Coast\h
Guard Law that allows for just that.

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,840
The law allows the Chinese Coast Guard to\h
“‘use all necessary measures including weapons’\h\h

100
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,520
when China’s ‘national sovereignty,\h
sovereign rights, and jurisdiction\h\h

101
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,720
are being illegally infringed by foreign\h
organizations and individuals at sea.’”

102
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,920
Think of it like Military Fishing Fusion.

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
There are other issues holding back the\h
Philippines and all the other countries\h\h

104
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,960
in territorial disputes with the Chinese\h
Communist Party. China plays a big role in\h\h

105
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,720
their economies. And the coronavirus has given\h
the CCP yet another weapon in their arsenal.\h

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
“Access to vaccines has become\h
a key concern for Duterte:\h\h

107
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Metro Manila was locked down again last week\h
amid the nation’s worst coronavirus surge\h\h

108
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,120
and the Philippines currently sources\h
most of its supply from China’s Sinovac.”

109
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,800
But unless something is done to actually\h
stop the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

110
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,280
they will keep steadily expanding their\h
reach until they control everything.\h

111
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,240
Thanks for your support, davidKansasCity.

contribute a dollar or more per episode.\h\h

114
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,320
Your support is a big part of how\h
we can afford to make this show.
