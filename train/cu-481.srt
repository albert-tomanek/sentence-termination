00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,220
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,020
now you can eat like Mao Zedong!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,740
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,590
Now you might be wondering...where’s Chris?!

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,520
Why isn’t he in his studio?!

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,630
And why isn’t he wearing a tie!

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,240
Well, today, I thought I’d try something
a little different.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,980
Recently I asked viewers to fill out a survey.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,140
And one thing 41.8% of you told me is that
you’re interested in Chinese cooking!

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,850
So today, I’m going to teach you how to
cook a famous Chinese dish!

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,490
And by that, I mean I’m going to let someone

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,980
who actually knows what they’re doing teach you.

13
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,889
This is Cici Li, host of Food Paradise.

14
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:46,709
Hi!

15
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:54,159
Today Cici and I are making a type of Hongshao
Rou, or Red Braised Pork Belly.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,850
Hongshao Rou was the favorite dish of the
Great Helmsman himself—Chairman Mao Zedong.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,739
Even as 30 million of his people were starving
to death during the Great Famine

18
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:04,969
he helped cause,

19
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:08,310
Mao managed to enjoy the best food out there,

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,390
and that’s Hongshao Rou.

21
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,109
Not just because it’s delicious,

22
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:14,950
but also because Mao never brushed his teeth

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,020
and by the time he was older they were so
rotten he could only eat soft foods.

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,210
Incidentally, when Mao’s doctor expressed
concern about his dental hygiene,

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,850
Mao replied, “A tiger never brushes his
teeth.”

26
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,640
Which I fact-checked.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,729
And it turns out tigers do sometimes clean
their own teeth.

28
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:35,309
But anyway,

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,240
there’s a lot of regional varieties of Hongshao
rou out there.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,049
And all of them are soft and delicious.

31
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,819
Mao Zedong was from Hunan province,

32
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,200
so he liked the spicy style Hongshao rou.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,840
But today, Cici and I are going to cook a
different style

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,719
an even more delicious style.

35
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,679
It’s from Zhejiang province.

36
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,359
And here’s the story behind it.

37
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,850
During the Song Dynasty,

38
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,370
there was a famous poet named Su Dongpo.

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,539
In China, he’s known for creating the bold
and unconstrained style of poetry

40
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:11,069
known as Háofàng, or “heroic abandon.”

41
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:11,750
But in the West,

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,040
if he’s known at all,

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,129
it’s for his bold and unconstrained style
of pork belly known as Dongpo rou.

44
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,470
Now like most famous Chinese poets,

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,830
Su Dongpo liked to drink.

46
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,390
A lot.

47
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,760
And as one among many versions of the story
goes,

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,150
one day Su Dongpo told his chef that he wanted
a bit of meat and a bit of wine.

49
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,030
But the chef misunderstood,

50
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,920
combining the wine and pork before cooking
the hongshou rou.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,930
It was a weird mistake to make, but it turned
out to be a delicious one.

52
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,159
And so this dish became a thing,

53
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,340
and it was eventually named in Su Dongpo’s
honor.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,500
Of course, it’s impossible to verify this
story.

55
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,100
But it would be awesome if today we’re enjoying
the fruits of a drunken poet’s mistake

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,780
900 years ago.

57
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,159
So anyway, today Cici and I going to show
you how to make Dongpo rou—or Dongpo style

58
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,760
braised pork belly.
