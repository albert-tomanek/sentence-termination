1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,810
Trump Administration Defends Chinese Muslims?

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,749
Why This Navy SEAL Fears China

3
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:06,850
How China’s Leaders Plan to Live Forever

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,960
And President Trump’s Defense of Chinese
Muslims

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,960
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,500
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,580
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,940
This week’s China news headlines!

9
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,000
Navy SEALS are some of the toughest guys in
the world.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,300
And retired Admiral William McRaven is probably
one of the top.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,460
He oversaw the raid that got Osama bin Laden
in 2011.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,480
So when something scares Admiral McRaven,

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,610
you...should be terrified.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,260
Well, at a Council on Foreing Relations meeting
this week,

15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,580
McRaven said China and the Chinese Communist
Party’s military

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,840
is catching up—and in some cases surpassing—the
US.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,100
It’s what he called a holy...something...

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,370
well I’m not sure what since someone

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,330
seems to have lost part of the word.

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,370
But it’s a serious moment for the US.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,260
The Chinese Communist Party is closing the
gap

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,810
with the US on the technological battlefront.

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,450
According to a new report by the Council on
Foreign Relations,

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,520
even though China is not a match for the US
across the board,

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,970
China could soon rival the US in fields like
AI,

26
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,460
robotics, 5G, and possibly biotechnology.

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,750
Biotechnology?

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,490
I think I know where this is headed.

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,340
When they say “president for life”,

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,280
they mean, for life.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,380
And in that vein, an ad for Beijing’s 301
Hospital—

32
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,369
the top rated hospital in China,

33
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,390
where all the Communist leaders go—

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,329
says they’re working on a health project

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,520
that will help leaders live to 150.

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,549
The ad, which was taken down after a public
backlash in China,

37
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,020
bragged about organ function regeneration.

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,030
It’s a new technology where they give healthy
organs to rich people,

39
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,930
by taking them from Chinese dissidents who
don’t need them anymore.

40
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,039
Donald Trump—defender of the world’s Muslims.

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,039
Umm.

42
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,149
Yep, that’s no mistake.

43
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:02,149
The Trump Administration

44
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:05,560
is planning to confront China at a UN meeting
next week

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,359
over the Communist Party’s persecution

46
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,360
of the mostly Muslim Uighur ethnic minority.

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,459
Ok, so Trump himself won’t be doing it.

48
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,159
But definitely the people he’s appointed
will.

49
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,430
And this wouldn’t be new for the Trump Administration.

50
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,290
Vice President Mike Pence has specifically
called out

51
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,860
the internment camps in China

52
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,209
where more than a million Chinese Muslims

53
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,000
endure around the clock brainwashing.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
And yet, no matter how much Chinese authorities

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,050
try to whitewash the issue,

56
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,340
according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,

57
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,829
the persecution of Uighurs is the “stain
of the century.”

58
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,190
As opposed to the stain of the last century,

59
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,989
which involved Bill Clinton...

60
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,200
getting China into the WTO.

61
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,720
Getting the UN to move against China’s wishes
is not easy.

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,220
China holds a permanent seat on the UN Security
Council.

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,349
That gives it tremendous potential veto power.

64
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,420
This week, however, the UN overcame that veto
threat

65
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,980
to renew a UN political mission in Afghanistan.

66
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,480
China was upset there was no mention

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,890
of the Belt and Road Initiative.

68
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,010
That’s China’s giant global infrastructure
investment plan

69
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,340
that basically gives China tremendous political
influence

70
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,290
over whatever country it invests in.

71
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,910
And for the past three years,

72
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,170
the UN Afghanistan mission

73
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,430
basically sang the praises of the Belt and
Road.

74
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,069
Coincidentally, that also coincides with China

75
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,819
expanding its footprint in Afghanistan.

76
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,550
Officially, the relationship is for

77
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,980
mineral and energy exploration.

78
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,720
But also, there’s military cooperation.

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,379
So no wonder other UN council members

80
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,159
wanted to take the Belt and Road

81
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,640
out of the UN’s political mission in Afghanistan.

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,599
A speech last week from a US State Department
official

83
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,180
called out Chinese Tech giants for being

84
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,330
de facto tools of the Chinese Communist Party.

85
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,021
Christopher Ford, the assistant secretary
of state

86
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,920
for international security and non-proliferation
said,

87
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,180
“The Chinese technology giants are not purely
private actors,

88
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,999
but instead function as at least de facto
tools

89
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:03,390
of the Chinese Communist Party when it matters
most.”

90
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,170
He specifically mentioned Baidu,

91
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,569
Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, and Tencent.

92
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,689
The Chinese Communist Party has created new
laws

93
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:14,450
to aid what they call civil military fusion.

94
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,609
That basically forces even privately owned
Chinese companies

95
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,130
to cooperate with the government and Party.

96
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,010
“Firms such as Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, Alibaba,
and Baidu

97
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,770
have no meaningful ability to tell the Chinese
Communist Party ‘no’

98
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,360
if officials decide to ask for their assistance.”

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,220
So much for no means no.

100
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,789
Huawei is also running into more and more
problems

101
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,870
as countries around the world begin

102
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,979
full or partial bans on Huawei equipment,

103
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,640
usually over national security concerns.

104
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,169
The latest country is Estonia, located,

105
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,150
uhhh, right...there.

106
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,150
Sure.

107
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,150
There.

108
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,699
Estonia is restricting government use of Huawei

109
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,020
over national security concerns.

110
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,340
A Chinese couple has been accused of stealing
trade secrets

111
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,039
from a US Children’s Hospital.

112
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,360
Authorities say the couple set up their own
company in China

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,550
using stolen treatments for things like child
liver cancer.

114
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,560
Nothing like profiting off the misery of children.

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,650
Just like mall Santas.

116
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,370
Bad news for Taiwan.

117
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,660
China has managed to poach yet another one
of

118
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,130
the few remaining countries that recognized
the island nation:

119
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,030
The Solomon Islands.

120
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,030
Now there are only 16 countries left that
still have

121
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,000
official diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,120
Now, the US is reconsidering aid to Solomon
Islands.

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,500
And according to Reuters,

124
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,020
Mike Pence has called off a meeting

125
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,509
with the country’s prime minister.

126
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,630
Not that the US officially recognizes Taiwan,
either.

127
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,740
But the US does sell weapons to Taiwan.

128
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,400
Lots of weapons.

129
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,740
And at the end of the day,

130
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,340
isn’t that the truest form of recognition?

131
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,560
Behold, the Lotus Tower,

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,030
the tallest building in Sri Lanka.

133
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,180
Truly a magnificent sight.

134
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,419
Also magnificent:

135
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,860
How the Chinese state-owned contractor that
built it

136
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,270
managed to steal 11 million dollars

137
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,420
of Sri Lankan state money through graft.

138
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,849
That’s at least according to the current
Sri Lankan president.

139
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,289
He blames the previous president,

140
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,900
who was in power when the theft allegedly
occurred.

141
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,120
Of course, that previous president

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,509
called the accusations a horrendous insult...to
China.

143
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,970
Yeah, how dare people ask where the money
went!

144
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,290
And if you’re wondering—

145
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,580
didn’t the Chinese Communist Party

146
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,949
ever learn than stealing was wrong?

147
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,169
Well, obviously the answer is no.

148
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,020
But now we know why.

149
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,289
According to Fox News,

150
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,289
the Communist Party has been replacing the
10 Commandments

151
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,840
with quotes from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

152
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,380
It’s not longer just the Good Book.

153
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,210
It’s the Party Mandated book.

154
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,250
And that’s it for this week’s China news
headlines!

155
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,030
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

156
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,139
a fan who support China Uncensored

157
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,561
with a dollar or more per episode,

158
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:55,330
by contributing through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

159
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,440
Largezo asks,

160
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,190
“How do you pronounce chinese names and
places?

161
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,530
Do you use some guide and if so, why?

162
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,979
Ah, good question.

163
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,100
In the 1950s,

164
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,650
the Chinese government made a push to have

165
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,150
a single official romanized system for Chinese
characters.

166
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,379
There have been several romanized systems
of Chinese

167
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,379
over the centuries.

168
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,710
But the Communist Party revived a specific
one called Pinyin.

169
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,669
That’s why the name Peking

170
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,520
was officially changed to Beijing in English—

171
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,620
even though the Chinese pronunciation didn’t
change.

172
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,650
Pinyin is what most people use these days

173
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,210
to pronounce Chinese names and places.

174
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,210
It makes it easier.

175
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,190
But it’s still not easy.

176
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,659
Thanks for your question.

177
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,659
And if you have a question for me

178
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,480
you want to hear answered on the show,

179
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,199
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

180
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,000
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

182
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,319
we would have to shut down the show if it
weren’t for your support.

183
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,259
And to everyone, thanks for watching!

184
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,759
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

185
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,700
See you next time.
