00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,020
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,930
a surprise upset in Malaysia’s elections—

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,460
and how Chinese money played a big role.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,200
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,900
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,020
A striking election upset in Malaysia.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,030
Hailed as a triumph of democracy.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,110
A miracle even.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,152
“It’s like a miracle, really—

10
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:25,560
a dream come true.”

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,160
The kind that has all the makings of

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,500
a Hollywood political fiction blockbuster.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,800
A 92-year-old former prime minister

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,640
comes out of retirement and—

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,370
against all odds—

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,300
defeats his former protégé,

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,080
ending six decades of one-party rule in Malaysia.

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,800
“So we have in fact achieved a very substantial
majority,

19
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,660
not just a few votes, not just a few seats,

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,260
but a very substantial majority.”

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,820
That’s Mahathir Mohamad.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,260
He was elected on May 9.

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,200
He’s now the oldest elected leader in the
world.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,760
It’d be like Jimmy Carter,

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,650
who’s now 93,

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,920
running as an independent in the next election

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,639
and winning against both Democrats and Republicans.

28
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:12,539
And having people across the country wonder,

29
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,439
“Wait, that guy’s still alive?”

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,400
This is to say,

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,720
Mahathir’s win was a big surprise to everyone—

32
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,359
reminding the world that you never know

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
what’s going to happen in a democracy.

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,850
Not that the world need reminding.

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,709
One of the key issues that propelled Mahathir
back into office

36
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:33,130
is China’s growing influence on Malaysia.

37
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,029
Malaysia is pretty close to China.

38
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:38,670
Especially if you accept the Chinese regime’s
Nine-Dash Line—

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,920
which Malaysia does not.

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,500
Malaysia is also pretty close to China economically.

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,710
It’s one of the biggest recipients of Chinese
investment.

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,170
They’ve secured $34 billion dollars worth
of

43
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,329
Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure projects.

44
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,649
The Belt and Road Initiative—

45
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,609
also called One Belt One Road—

46
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,599
is a trillion-dollar spending spree

47
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,329
by the Chinese regime.

48
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,729
It’s designed to project its power across
the globe

49
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,310
and put strategic infrastructure in foreign
countries—

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,420
infrastructure that can be controlled by the
Chinese Communist Party.

51
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,790
There’s been concern in some Belt and Road
host countries,

52
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,030
like Sri Lanka and Pakistan,

53
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,360
about these kinds of projects resulting in
huge debts

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,680
owed to Chinese state-owned banks.

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,790
Malaysia is concerned about this, too.

56
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,329
And these concerns came out during the election
campaign.

57
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,579
A popular grievance was that Chinese development
projects

58
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:36,060
were really just a way for rich Chinese to
buy up

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,099
the most attractive parts of Malaysia.

60
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,269
For example, Forest City.

61
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,969
It’s a $100 billion dollar development project,

62
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,439
presumably called Forest City

63
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,530
because all the buildings are growing moss.

64
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,700
Chinese nationals account for 70% of apartment
buyers there,

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,010
and most local Malaysians have been priced
out.

66
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,790
And we’re not talking about Chinese Malaysians
here.

67
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,620
About a quarter of Malaysians are ethnically
Chinese,

68
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,080
and ethnically Chinese families have been

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,549
a part of Malaysian society for centuries.

70
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,989
But what’s happening now is that new waves

71
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,670
of Chinese nationals are coming in with big
money,

72
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,360
and pricing locals out.

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,780
Another pain point is that Malaysia’s strategic
infrastructure

74
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,269
is falling under the control of big Chinese
companies.

75
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,939
Near Kuantan, a sleepy coastal town with tropical
beaches,

76
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,730
a Chinese state-owned company bought a 40%
stake

77
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,420
in a deep-water shipping port.

78
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,420
And it bought a 49% stake in this

79
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,439
depressing-looking 3,000-acre industrial park.

80
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,579
It comes complete with Chinese workers,

81
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,060
a heavy dependence on Chinese materials,

82
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,829
and not very many opportunities for local
Malaysian companies.

83
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,560
All this led the 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,359
to make Chinese influence a key issue in his
campaign.

85
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,610
“None of our people are employed as workers.

86
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,500
None of our companies are used for designing

87
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,569
and planning and supervising, et cetera.

88
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,459
We gain nothing.”

89
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,700
He accused the now-former prime minister Najib
Razak

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
of selling out to China.

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,060
He also accused Najib of a lot of other things

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,660
unrelated to China, like corruption.

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,650
Including possibly stealing 700 million dollars

94
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,430
of Malaysian government money

95
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,160
in a development scandal.

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,380
Anyway, Mahathir campaigned on a promise

97
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,050
not only to fight corruption,

98
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,570
but also to quote unquote “review”

99
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,410
Malaysia’s bad deals with China.

100
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,950
In a note to investors,

101
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,410
major financial institution Credit Suisse

102
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,800
said that Mahathir’s win

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,970
“puts into question the future of Chinese
investment

104
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,290
in the infrastructure sector.”

105
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,130
Malaysia isn’t alone in its concerns

106
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,790
over Chinese investment.

107
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,880
The US and Europe have both taken steps

108
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,490
to limit Chinese investment in strategic sectors.

109
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,600
So the question is whether a similar pattern
of resistance

110
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,610
will start to take shape across Asia.

111
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,260
But my favorite Chinese state-run media The
Global Times

112
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,500
says they’re not worried at all.

113
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,750
Which means they’re definitely worried.

114
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,200
So what do you think about Malaysia’s staggering
election upset,

115
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,930
and do you see it as part of a bigger trend
of resistance

116
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,810
to Chinese influence?

117
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,860
Leave your comments below.

118
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,740
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

119
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,060
See you next time.

120
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,640
It’s time for another fan question!

121
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,960
This one comes from David Michael White.

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,380
Patreon supporter David Michael White asks:
“Chris, what was the worst natural disaster

123
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,010
that you have ever experienced?”

124
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,700
I guess that question was in response to our
recent episode

125
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,630
about why the Chinese Communist Party

126
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,040
loves natural disasters.

127
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,730
The worst natural disaster I was in:

128
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,760
Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,100
I was living in New Jersey at the time.

130
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,690
My roommate fled before it hit

131
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,720
and when I told him I was staying,

132
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,020
he looked at me with tears in his eyes

133
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,620
like he would never see me again.

134
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,910
And it was pretty bad.

135
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,440
I lived at the bottom of a hill

136
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,970
so when the hurricane hit,

137
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,130
the nearby hudson river rose up

138
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,820
and flooded my whole area.

139
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,570
As the water level was rising,

140
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,850
all the cars parked outside started shorting
out—

141
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,600
their alarms started blaring and unfortunately,

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,650
the windows all rolled down,

143
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,340
so they all started floating away.

144
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,740
I took some video of the aftermath.

145
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,640
Link is below.

146
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,660
Thanks for your question David!

147
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,870
