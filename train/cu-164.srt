00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,950
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,440
two Chinas for the price of one!

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,730
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,370
And I’ve got a great idea

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,750
for all you countries out there

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,680
that need a little extra spending money.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,230
First, establish formal diplomatic ties

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,880
with Taiwan.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,060
This will anger mainland China.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,560
Then, establish ties with mainland China

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,340
and agree to break off ties with Taiwan,

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,500
in exchange for millions of dollars.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,880
That would never work, you say?

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
Well, just ask Panama.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,390
A big win for China

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,760
and a major blow to Taiwan.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,260
Beijing on Tuesday welcoming

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,290
formal ties with Panama,

20
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,920
after the Central American nation

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,910
ditched relations with Taipei,

22
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,840
saying it now only recognizes one China

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,120
and Taiwan is part of it.”

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,100
For those of you who need some background,

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,550
once upon a time,

26
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,010
that time being 1912,

27
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,110
there was a country called

28
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,739
the Republic of China

29
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,850
that was in mainland China.

30
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,049
But then in 1949,

31
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,630
the Chinese Communist Party

32
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,159
seized control of mainland China

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,330
and created the People’s Republic of China.

34
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,340
So the Republic of China government

35
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,100
fled to the island of Taiwan,

36
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,000
creating two Chinas.

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,660
Ultimately, the two sides came to an agreement

38
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,880
called the One China Policy.

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,280
That’s where both sides agree

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,620
there’s only one China,

41
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,100
they just also avoid saying

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,920
which one is the one China.

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Which is all very normal

44
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,820
and makes total sense.

45
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,090
It's almost like each China

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,329
exists in its own separate reality

47
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,090
where they are the only China.

48
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,090
And then they made

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,429
the rest of the countries in the world

50
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,109
choose which reality

51
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,380
they wanted to live in.

52
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,620
Confusing,

53
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,920
but it could be worse.

54
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,000
There could be 52 Chinas.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,940
But lately, the One China policy

56
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,990
hasn’t been working out

57
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,740
too well for Taiwan.

58
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,160
Sure, at first most countries

59
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,579
chose their reality.

60
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,060
But then in 1971,

61
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,140
the United Nations formally recognized

62
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,099
the Communist Party’s People’s Republic
of China

63
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,880
instead of Taiwan.

64
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
And ever since,

65
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
more and more countries

66
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,340
have been following suit.

67
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,220
Panama was one of Taiwan’s oldest allies.

68
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,150
It’s recognized the Republic of China

69
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,490
since 1912—

70
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,510
basically from its founding.

71
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,970
But now Panama has found a shiny new ally.

72
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,340
It’s kind of like how in middle school y

73
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,790
ou suddenly decided that instead of

74
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,340
hanging out with Chris C.,

75
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,950
your best friend since preschool,

76
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,950
you were going to hang out

77
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,280
with that jerk Chris R.

78
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,620
just because he had an N64.

79
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,140
Whatever.

80
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,210
Anyway, now that Panama has dumped Taiwan,

81
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,180
China’s gonna treat them right!

82
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,880
With millions of dollars of infrastructure
investments.

83
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,280
The Chinese regime pulls this all the time

84
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,780
with developing nations,

85
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,780
especially those still allied with Taiwan.

86
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,000
In the mid-90s,

87
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,680
Taiwan was recognized by as many as

88
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,290
30 countries.

89
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,960
Now it’s down to just 20.

90
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,400
When Costa Rica decided to make the switch,

91
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,620
they were rewarded with this delightful new

92
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,200
$100 million dollar stadium.

93
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,010
Are you not entertained?

94
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,160
Some countries even pit both Chinas

95
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,760
against each other/itself

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,420
for more lucrative deals.

97
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,170
Take St. Lucia.

98
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,840
No, the tiny Caribbean island named after her

99
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,800
that you’ve probably never heard of.

100
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,910
It used to recognize Taiwan.

101
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,300
But in 1997,

102
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,690
it decided to switch allegiances

103
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,150
to the Chinese Communist Party.

104
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,150
That came with funding

105
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,380
for large infrastructure projects.

106
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,940
But in 2007,

107
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,230
St Lucia switched back to Taiwan,

108
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,240
because “the foreign minister at the time

109
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
is reported to have suggested

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
that one should

111
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,810
‘support those who give you the most.’”

112
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,800
Which in this case

113
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,540
meant a national tennis center.

114
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,000
But then in 2011,

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,560
St Lucia switched allegiances yet again.

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,140
The Prime Minister of Burkina Faso,

117
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,960
a small African nation allied with Taiwan,

118
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,010
told Bloomberg,

119
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,840
“We get outrageous proposals telling us,

120
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,270
‘if you sign with Beijing

121
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,200
we’ll offer you $50 billion

122
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,610
or even more.’”

123
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,640
This doesn’t mean Taiwan

124
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,040
is on its own though—

125
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,060
just because 9 out of every 10 nations

126
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,540
don’t have formal diplomatic ties with it.

127
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,600
For example, the United States recognizes

128
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,630
the People’s Republic of China,

129
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,810
but also keeps up diplomatic ties with Taiwan

130
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,240
in some roundabout ways.

131
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,660
Following the split with Panama,

132
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,360
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

133
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,620
said the US was committed to both

134
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,360
the One China Policy,

135
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,860
and to Taiwan.

136
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,130
So we can have our pork bun

137
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,780
and eat it too.

138
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,880
In the US, and in many other countries,

139
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,300
you can visit the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office.

140
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,260
What’s that?

141
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,980
Well, I’m sure you might get some idea

142
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,150
from their website,

143
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,240
which you can visit

144
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,600
at Taiwan Embassy dot org.

145
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,560
Of course, the Communist Party is no fool.

146
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,030
They’ve been tricking people for ages.

147
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,240
That’s why Fiji just happened

148
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,910
to close their Taiwan trade office,

149
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,350
just as Prime Minister Frank Ban...

150
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,230
Baini...Frankie B...

151
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,670
traveled to China.

152
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,580
It was for for Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road
Forum.

153
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,760
The Chinese regime has also just been trying

154
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,320
to get the name Taiwan

155
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,440
off of these “trade offices.”

156
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,500
Right, “Trade offices.”

157
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,280
Some countries even go a step further.

158
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
At the start of the year,

159
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,000
two Chinese companies announced

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,650
they’re going to build the world’s

161
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,040
tallest towers in Cambodia.

162
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
A month later,

163
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,580
the Cambodian Prime Minister

164
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,240
decided to ban Tibetan and Taiwanese flags

165
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,550
out of, you know,

166
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,800
respect for China’s sovereignty.

167
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
And we know which China

168
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,900
they’re talking about.

169
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Just for fun,

170
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,930
imagine if the Chinese Communist Party

171
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,340
cared about more than just countries.

172
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,510
Imagine if they tried to bribe

173
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,810
individual people who recognize

174
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,080
the Republic of China

175
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
as the one true China.

176
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,430
Of course, that would be ridiculous.

177
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,580
So what do you think of Panama

178
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,240
breaking off ties with Taiwan

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,080
and the Chinese regime trying to bribe

180
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,680
other countries to do the same?

181
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,010
Leave your comments below.

182
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,010
Once again,

183
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,310
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

184
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,660
See you next time.

185
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,480
You know, Shelley.

186
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,470
I cannot believe the lengths the Chinese regime

187
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,400
will go to to stop Taiwan from-

188
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,100
Hello?

189
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,020
Oh, Ambassador Cui!

190
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,280
