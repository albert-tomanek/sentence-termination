00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:02,730
Indian and Chinese troops clash

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,189
and China builds secret villages

3
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:07,340
in disputed territory

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:15,599
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chapell.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,590
Remember to like this episode to support the
show, it really helps us with YouTube’s

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,980
algorithm.\h

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,810
Last week, there was another border clash
between Indian and Chinese troops.

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,460
Which is surprising.

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,030
Not because of the clash, but because of the
weather.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,390
You may remember that last summer there were
several big clashes between Indian and Chinese

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,050
troops at the disputed border between the
two countries, known as the Line of Actual

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,640
Control.\h

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,800
But there haven’t been any clashes so far
this winter.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,780
Partly because both sides are trying to deescalate
the conflict.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,359
And partly because it’s really, really cold.

16
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:02,930
“Troops [along the border] remain deployed
at 15,000 to 18,000 feet in temperatures that

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,860
drop to minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit.”

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,440
How cold is that?

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,320
Cold enough to turn boiling water into snow.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,020
Remind me to visit the Line of Actual Control
in June and not in January.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,000
Details of the latest border clash are sparse.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,300
We do know that it happened on January 20th.\h

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,890
The Wall Street Journal quotes an unnamed
Indian security official as saying “the

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,710
incident happened while the Chinese forces
were patrolling the area and tried to enter

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,650
the Indian territory.”

26
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,960
The Washington Post also spoke to two anonymous
Indian officials.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,780
One said that “minor injuries were suffered
on both sides.”\h

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,950
And the other described the clash as “hand-to-hand
combat.”

29
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,550
Two more Indian security officials told the
Associated Press that there were clashes with

30
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,770
sticks and stones.

31
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,120
I hope no one broke any bones.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,600
And at least there weren’t any nail-studded
rods, like what Chinese soldiers used during

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,509
a brawl along the border back in June.

34
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:14,090
That clash in June was the deadliest one last
year, with at least 20 casualties on the Indian

35
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,780
side, and an unknown number of casualties
on the Chinese side.\h

36
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,110
Since then, both sides have kept a buildup
of soldiers along the border, even during

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,110
the winter.

38
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,590
“As many as 100,000 troops from the Indian
and Chinese armies are now facing off across

39
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,400
inhospitable mountain passes in subzero temperatures
in the Ladakh region alone.”

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
But this latest border skirmish was not in
Ladakh.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,950
It was about 750 miles away, at the Naku La
area in Sikkim.

42
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,520
Most of the border clashes last year happened
in Ladakh.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,020
But an early one back in May was in Sikkim.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,360
One reason for that might be that in Sikkim,
Indian troops outnumber Chinese troops.

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,050
But so far, both India and China are trying
to downplay this latest incident.

46
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,900
The Indian Army called it a “minor faceoff”
and said that the situation “was resolved

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,300
by local commanders as per established protocols.”

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,860
Meanwhile, the editor-in-chief of my favorite
Chinese state-run media, the Global Times,

49
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,610
called the reports of a border clash fake
news.

50
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,390
That of course means that it’s definitely
not fake news.\h

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:35,560
One reason both sides may be trying to minimize
the incident is that just days after it happened,

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,751
India and China army commanders held another
round of talks on the border dispute, which

53
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,710
both sides said was positive.

54
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:48,459
“The two sides agreed to push for an early
disengagement of the front-line troops.”

55
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,850
But just because both sides say they’re
going to push for disengaging troops, doesn’t

56
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,690
mean they’re actually going to disengage
any troops.

57
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,540
I’ll tell you why after this short break.

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,380
Welcome back.

59
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,630
Both China and India say they want to disengage
front-line troops.

60
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,860
But will they actually do it?

61
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,370
This has happened before.

62
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,100
After the clashes back in May and June, both
India and China agreed to disengage their

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,850
troops from the region.\h

64
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,410
But India then accused China of not actually
disengaging.

65
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,340
Which is part of what led to another border
clash in August.\h

66
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,540
And the Chinese Communist Party has promised
to disengage from disputed territory before,

67
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,070
and then just...ignored that promise.

68
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,220
It happened back in 2012, when the Philippines
and China had a standoff over the Scarborough

69
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,700
Shoal in the South China Sea.

70
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,190
“The Philippine forces left as part of an
American-mediated deal in which both sides

71
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,820
were to pull back while the dispute was negotiated.

72
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,620
Chinese forces remained, however, and gained
control.”

73
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,650
Yet another reminder that you can’t trust
the Chinese Communist Party.

74
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,070
But somehow, people keep forgetting.

75
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,950
Do I need to put it on a t-shirt or something?\h

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,100
Anyway, the Scarborough Shoal situation is
not the only way in which the China-India

77
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,160
border dispute is similar to China’s slow
takeover of the South China Sea.

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,660
We’ve talked before about the Chinese regime’s
salami slicing strategy, where they take over

79
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,110
a little bit of territory at a time until
they control the whole area.

80
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,230
That’s something they’ve used in the South
China Sea and on the Indian border.

81
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,350
And salami slicing works.

82
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,870
“China may now control as much as 400 square
miles of territory that India considers its

83
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,870
own.”

84
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,810
But once you’re done slicing the salami,
you’ve got to...occupy the salami.\h

85
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,710
Which is why the Chinese Communist Party is
now building secret villages in the disputed

86
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,560
territory of Arunachal Pradesh.\h

87
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,540
“Two Indian government officials in Arunachal
said the Chinese had recently built villages

88
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,680
in disputed areas along the border in places
that used to have just a few remote military

89
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
posts.”

90
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,860
This satellite image shows one of the villages,
which was built at some point between August

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,640
2019 and November 2020.

92
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,840
Arunachal Pradesh is yet another region of
the disputed border, far away from Ladakh

93
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
and Sikkim.

94
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,220
When you look at this map, it becomes clear
how challenging this is for India.

95
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,700
The border with China stretches for over 2,000
miles.

96
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,560
A lot of that covers sparsely populated, mountainous
regions.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,460
It’s a huge challenge to keep an eye on
the entire border to make sure that the Chinese

98
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,680
Communist Party isn’t slicing any of your
salami.

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,460
The area where the villages were built has
been effectively controlled by China since

100
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,460
1959.

101
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,850
But\h according to local Arunachal officials,
there’s a whole lot of new salami slicing

102
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,990
going on.\h

103
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,860
“China has engaged in a flurry of construction
projects along the border and rendered areas

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,139
that used to be accessible to people on the
Indian side now inaccessible.”

105
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:17,310
The same thing is happening almost 2,000 miles
away, at the other end of the border in Ladakh.

106
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,430
“According to Ladakh leaders, China has
stepped up construction projects along the

107
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:29,229
frontier with India...The result is that China
can move troops—and civilians—to the borderlands

108
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,880
much faster than India.”

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,010
India has tried to counter that with more
construction of their own.

110
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,580
But in some cases, Chinese troops and civilians
are using the Indian roads to trespass on

111
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,720
Indian territory as well.\h

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,320
Still, the Chinese Communist Party has been
building roads or even military outposts in

113
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,009
the disputed region for decades.

114
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,389
But building civilian villages is a new escalation.

115
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,880
And it’s similar to what the Party did in
the South China Sea, where they built artificial

116
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,910
islands as military bases, but also established
a civilian presence on the islands.\h

117
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,880
A prime example of this is Sansha City, which
was established back in 2012 on the Paracel

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,139
Islands, and now has a population of almost
2,000 people.

119
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:25,040
Having a large civilian population on that
island means there’s almost no way for any

120
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,300
other country that also claims the Paracel
Islands to take them back.

121
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,810
China has occupied the salami.

122
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,319
And it looks like they’re trying the same
tactic on the Indian border.

123
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:43,050
The villages that we know about so far are
being built in areas that the Chinese Communist

124
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,279
Party has controlled for decades.\h

125
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,199
But it wouldn’t be surprising if the Party
started doing the same thing in more recently

126
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,699
taken territory.

127
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:56,499
That way it becomes harder for India to push
back.\h

128
00:08:56,499 --> 00:09:01,449
So how does the Party explain the villages
they built in Arunachal Pradesh?

129
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,850
That’s easy!

130
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,760
It’s just part of China’ poverty alleviation
scheme.

131
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,929
A source close to the Chinese military told
the South China Morning Post that the village

132
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:18,769
was a “good opportunity to build houses
for local Tibetans using poverty relief money.”

133
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:24,319
Can you really blame the Chinese Communist
Party for lifting people out of poverty?

134
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:29,589
Of course, the poverty alleviation scheme
in Tibet is also about resettling nomadic

135
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,959
herders and forcing them off their lands,
but that’s a topic for a different China

136
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,230
Uncensored episode.\h

137
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,740
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 cent

138
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
army.

139
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,949
They’re viewers like you who contribute
as little as a dollar an episode on the crowd

140
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:46,949
funding website Patreon.

141
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,819
That’s patreon.com/ChinaUncensored.

142
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:57,529
Jesper sjøholm asks, GREAT SHOW BUT HOW CAN
I BUY THE SOCIALISM MONOPOLY..???!

143
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,570
Ah, yes.

144
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,699
Jesper is referring to the latest episode
of our podcast China Unscripted, in which

145
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:09,300
Matt, Shelley, and I played Monopoly Socialism,
the board game.

146
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,820
Which is a real thing that you can buy.

147
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,100
And it was definitely more fun than actual
socialism.

148
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,600
Because you can stop playing at any time.\h

149
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,429
Shelley and Matt actually got me Monopoly
Socialism for Christmas.

150
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:26,839
If you’re in the US, the game is available
from capitalist running dogs like Amazon,

151
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,430
Walmart, and eBay.\h

152
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,819
I’ve put a link to the game below on Amazon.

153
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,339
If you buy the game through that link, it
helps support the show.

154
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,429
Thanks for your question Jesper.

155
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,819
Enjoy the game.\h

156
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:41,899
And thank you for watching.
