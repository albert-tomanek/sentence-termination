00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,480
This Chinese film director

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,680
Just won an Oscar

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,280
But now Chinese media has canceled her.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,560
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.
We talk a lot on this show about censorship in\h\h

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
China. But censorship can be a\h
tricky thing—especially when it\h\h

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,920
comes to Chinese state-run media. One day\h
they might promote something. The next day\h\h

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,280
they might say it undermines China.\h
It’s state-sponsored cancel culture.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,680
For example, China officially\h
loved American basketball.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,560
Until they canceled the NBA\h
because the Houston Rockets manager\h\h

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,520
posted a tweet supporting Hong Kong protests.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,560
The Chinese government welcomed\h
Tesla to do business in China.

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,920
And then one day, Chinese media suddenly\h
criticized Tesla for being ‘arrogant’.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,240
Chinese state-run media changes its mind so fast,\h\h

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,480
it’s almost not worth getting positive\h
media attention there in the first place.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
And it’s also confusing for the people\h
of China to know how they’re supposed\h\h

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,480
to feel about current events. Because if\h
they feel the wrong way about something,\h\h

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,760
and they say so, they could get cancelled too.\h

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
This is the case for Chloé Zhao She’s\h
a Beijing-born film director who now\h\h

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,840
lives in America. She won Best Director at\h
the Academy Awards last week for her film,\h\h

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,600
Nomadland. It’s a story that follows a middle-aged\h
woman living out of her van in the American West.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
“Nomadland” has made movie\h
history, and so has Chloé Zhao.\h\h

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,440
Zhao is the first Asian woman and only the second\h
woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
Her film also won Best Drama\h
at the Golden Globe awards . 
 \h

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,640
Back in March, Chloé Zhao’s stepmother, who is\h
a Chinese comedian and actress named Song Dandan\h\h

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,480
publicly congratulated Zhao on Weibo, China’s\h
version of Twitter for her Golden Globes win.\h

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,040
The post reads, “My baby:\h
Big congratulations to you!\h\h

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,760
Your achievements exceed our imagination...\h
You are the legend of our family,\h\h

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,240
and I believe that your story will also\h
inspire countless Chinese children~”.\h

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Also in March, the Chinese state-run Global\h
Times published this article, calling Zhao\h\h

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,160
the pride of China for her accomplishment.
Everything seemed great! That was until\h\h

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
Chloé Zhao became censored overnight.
Chinese state-run media suddenly didn’t\h\h

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,960
want anything to do with Chloé Zhao. They were\h
almost silent when she won her Oscar in April.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,080
Nomadland was originally scheduled to be\h
released in Chinese theaters on April 23—at\h\h

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,240
least according to the Global Times back in March.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,280
But Nomadland has still not\h
been shown in mainland theaters.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,000
On Chinese social media platform,\h
Weibo, this hashtag that reads\h\h

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
“Chloé Zhao won Best Director\h
at the Oscars” was censored.

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,080
Users can’t even search the hashtag\h
for #93rd Academy Awards ceremony\h

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
No one seemed to know why any discussion\h
about Zhao or her film ‘Nomadland’\h\h

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,240
has come under state censorship.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:26,080
“To evade censorship, some social media users\h
resorted to using ‘ZT’ and ‘WYZD,’ the initials\h\h

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
of Zhao’s Chinese name and her film’s\h
Chinese title (无依之地), to post about her.”\h

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,880
“‘Why did WYZD and ZT get blocked?\h\h

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,600
Her win was supposed to be a moment of\h
pride for all Asians around the world.\h\h

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,560
But the censorship made her look like she filmed\h
something that she should be ashamed of.’”

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,760
But these posts still ended up\h
being wiped off of social media,\h\h

47
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
along with any mention of her\h
acceptance speech at the Oscars.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,440
If you’re thinking that she must have said\h
something in her speech that got her blacklisted.\h\h

49
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Well, it doesn’t seem that way at all.

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,080
When I was growing up in China, my dad and I\h
would play this game. We would memorize classic\h\h

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,320
Chinese poems and texts, and we would recite it\h
together and try to finish each other’s sentences.\h\h

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,680
And there’s one that I remember so dearly,\h
and it’s called the Three Character Classics.\h\h

53
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,480
And the first phrase goes “人之初性本善” .\h\h

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,960
People at birth are inherently good.

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,200
This speech was not only\h
apolitical, but it was powerful.\h\h

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Zhao shared fond memories of classical\h
Chinese poems with a Western audience.\h\h

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,320
That’s promoting Chinese culture. And\h
it’s a big soft power win for China.

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
So why has Chinese media canceled Chloé Zhao?

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,480
I’ll tell you, right after the break.

60
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,120
Welcome back. The Chinese Communist\h
Party has deliberately censored\h\h

61
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,800
this year’s Oscars. That’s not\h
just because of Chloé Zhao.

62
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,000
A documentary on the 2019 Hong Kong protests\h
called Do Not Split was also up for an award.

63
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,880
It didn’t win an Oscar, but on the bright side,\h
Beijing’s ban gave the film some real publicity.

64
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
But Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win was\h
also a sensitive topic in China.\h\h

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
“Two state media reporters told The Wall\h
Street Journal that they had received\h\h

66
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,200
orders from China’s propaganda ministry not\h
to report on Ms. Zhao’s victory, despite\h\h

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,120
what they described as her status as a Chinese\h
national, because of ‘previous public opinion.’”

68
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Previous public opinion? That’s a weird way to\h
put it. More like current Communist Party opinion.

69
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,480
The controversy began after Chinese netizens\h
fished out this article from 2013—when\h\h

70
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Chloé Zhao was interviewed in Filmmakers Magazine.

71
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,720
In it, Zhao talks about why she\h
chose to pursue film as a career.

72
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,520
“It goes back to when I was a teenager in China,\h
being in a place where there are lies everywhere.\h\h

73
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,720
You felt like you were never\h
going to be able to get out.”

74
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,840
This line from nearly a decade ago hurt\h
the feelings of the Chinese people.\h\h

75
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,040
That is, the feelings of\h
the Chinese Communist Party.

76
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,000
And once Chinese netizens fished it out,\h\h

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,400
the Chinese state apparatus\h
suddenly decided to cancel Zhao.

78
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,920
And it’s especially strange, because just\h
a month earlier Chinese state-run media\h\h

79
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,640
celebrated her as “the pride of China!”

80
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
But now, they’re treating\h
Zhao as if she’s a lying,\h\h

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,520
China-hating traitor—and silencing her completely.

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,880
Which is to say, for Chinese state-run media,\h
silence can be just another type of propaganda.

83
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,640
Now Chloé Zhao comes from a fairly privileged\h
background. Like I said, her stepmother is a\h\h

84
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,720
well-known actress. Her father is a top executive.\h
Her family sent her to boarding school in the UK\h\h

85
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,680
and then the US. It’s likely that her family is\h
well-connected. But none of that protected her.

86
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,040
But I wouldn’t want you to think that Chinese\h
state-run media completely ignored Chloé\h\h

87
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Zhao’s Oscar win. Sure, they didn’t talk\h
about it much in Chinese. But in English,\h\h

88
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,000
my favorite state-run media the Global\h
Times was happy to use Zhao’s win\h\h

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
to slam America for its\h
deep-rooted racism and sexism.

90
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
So what is the future for\h
the de-personed Chloé Zhao?\h\h

91
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Well, there are some concerns\h
over her next directed film,\h\h

92
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,760
“The Eternals”. That’s a big-budget superhero\h
Marvel movie set to release later this year.

93
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,280
In China, Marvel movies have been hugely\h
profitable for their parent company Disney.

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,640
“Experts say that while Ms. Zhao’s background\h
would likely have been a major selling point\h\h

95
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:11,040
for ‘The Eternals’ in China, it could now become\h
an Achilles’ heel—a potentially devastating blow\h\h

96
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,480
for the film and for Marvel, which has\h
reaped huge rewards in the Chinese market\h\h

97
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,840
with movies like ‘Avengers: Endgame.’”
In other words, the Chinese Communist\h\h

98
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,920
Party could cause problems for a completely\h
unrelated Hollywood film because its director\h\h

99
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,160
said something 8 years ago about\h
her childhood experience in China.

100
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Never trust the Chinese Communist Party, people!

101
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
It’s almost like China is “a\h
place where there are lies\h\h

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,600
everywhere.” And those lies\h
come from the top down.

103
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,680
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army—fans\h\h

104
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,080
who support the show through the\h
crowd funding website Patreon.

105
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,440
BlueCal1033 asks: “If we go to war\h
with China, likely over Taiwan,\h\h

106
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,520
should we seize all China owned property in the\h
US and cancel all China owned US debt and call it\h\h

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,160
war reparations? I mean you know they\h
are going to seize our stuff in China...”

108
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
Good question, BlueCal. You’re\h
probably right that the Chinese\h\h

109
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Communist Party would try to seize American\h
property inside China if we go to war.

110
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
But that doesn’t mean the US\h
should retaliate by doing the same.\h\h

111
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,680
I know your question said “China-owned” property,\h
not “Chinese-owned” property. But it can be hard\h\h

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,240
to draw the distinction sometimes. What if it’s\h
an organization or a company privately owned by\h\h

113
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,760
Chinese people living in the US, but secretly\h
influenced by the Chinese Communist Party?\h\h

114
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,560
How would you know? Where do you draw the line?\h
We definitely don’t want to target two-and-a-half\h\h

115
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,400
million Chinese immigrants. Many of them are\h
actually Chinese dissidents who escaped China.

116
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
We don’t want to repeat what the US did\h
to Japanese Americans during World War II.

117
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,120
As for canceling all China-owned US debt, that’s\h
a more feasible idea—because that debt is held\h\h

118
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
directly by China’s central bank.
Thanks for your question.
