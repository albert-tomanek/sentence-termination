1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,640
Chinese telecom company Huawei

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,460
has been charged with racketeering

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,380
and stealing U.S. trade secrets.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,960
But how serious is Huawei’s threat to America?

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,460
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,970
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,970
Huawei.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,490
The Chinese telecom company that brings us
together.

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,300
Because both Trump and Obama

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,000
agreed that it was a threat to the US.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,369
The Justice Department has just charged Huawei

12
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,570
with racketeering and stealing trade secrets.

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,580
But despite warnings from US intelligence
agencies,

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,550
some of America’s allies still want to make
deals with Huawei.

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,350
Is the Huawei threat really that serious?

16
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,489
I sat down to talk about Huawei with economic
expert

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,230
and Policy Director with America First Policies
Curtis Ellis.

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,790
He was also a Senior Policy Advisor

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,740
to Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,240
Thank you for joining me today.

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,310
Yeah, it's great to be here.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,310
Thanks for having me.

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,310
Sure.

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,890
So I know you've called Huawei,

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,299
essentially “the espionage arm of the Chinese
Communist Party

26
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,780
masquerading as a telecom company.”

27
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,030
What are you basing that on?

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,630
Well, they have back doors built into all
of their equipment

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,579
so that the Chinese government, the Chinese
military,

30
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,609
the Chinese Communist Party, can basically
tap into all of the data

31
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:27,369
and information that flows over Huawei networks.

32
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:31,509
So if you have an internet or a telecom network
using Huawei equipment,

33
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:37,639
you can be sure that the Chinese government
can tap into it at will.

34
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,579
That's espionage, that cyber espionage.

35
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,770
So it's that simple and there is no other
way to put it

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,659
to look at it any other way is just delusional.

37
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,939
We know that the Chinese government has a
law,

38
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,579
the civil military fusion law that requires
any Chinese company

39
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,229
to cooperate with the Chinese military.

40
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,209
This is a communist dictatorship, they call
it socialist if you want,

41
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:10,040
socialists with Chinese characteristics,

42
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,190
they want complete control over everything.

43
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,680
There is no such thing as an independent business
entity in China.

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
No such thing.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,640
Well, so I know the NSA has been accused of

46
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,050
asking US telecom companies to build back
doors.

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,290
How is what China is doing with Huawei different
from that?

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,060
Well, one big difference is the United States
government

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,570
is not the Chinese Communist Party.

50
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,350
The Chinese Communist Party has a far different
agenda

51
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,750
than the US government.

52
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,640
The US government still at its best,

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,400
adheres to the ideals of Western values,

54
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,070
individual liberty, privacy, freedom of speech,
freedom of religion.

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,930
At its worst, the US government aspires to
those ideals.

56
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,520
The Chinese Communist Party has no desire
and no illusion

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,010
about even recognizing those ideals.

58
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,180
So you're looking in an organization,

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,910
the Chinese Communist Party that is intent
on staying in power,

60
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,090
accruing, acquiring and holding on to

61
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,450
as much power in its own hands as it can

62
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,630
and it aspires to ideals of the collective
above the individual.

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,630
No such thing as private property,

64
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,610
no such thing as individual liberty or individual
aspiration.

65
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,940
Those are the people who are going to be having
access

66
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,510
to all the information that flows over Huawei
networks.

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,590
Is what Huawei is doing, is that typical for
other Chinese companies?

68
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,240
Well, as I said, the Chinese law says that
all Chinese companies

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,730
must accede to the demands of the Chinese
government.

70
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,700
So if the Chinese government asks,

71
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,670
let's say a Chinese bank to turn over

72
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,170
the financial records of its customers,

73
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,940
it must do so.

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
It can't say no.

75
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,280
I got to get out of that Chinese bank.

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,780
Yeah, there you go.

77
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,139
And let's look at it further.

78
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,350
Every Chinese, we're told that the Chinese
government

79
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,939
or its industrial espionage outfits are stealing

80
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,779
hundreds of millions of dollars

81
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:34,760
of American intellectual property every year.

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,360
So how many of these companies are essentially
selling stolen goods?

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,210
These Chinese companies are selling stolen
goods.

84
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,830
And now the US justice department has just
charged Huawei

85
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,009
with racketeering and stealing trade secrets.

86
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,810
Practically speaking, what does that mean?

87
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,220
Well, it means that if your Cisco and you're
building internet routers,

88
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,439
Huawei is stealing your designs,

89
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,460
copying your designs,

90
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,400
building its own routers using your research,

91
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,900
using the fruits of your intellectual exploration,

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,650
making copies of it and selling it probably
for less money.

93
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,719
Because it didn't have to go through all the
expense,

94
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:30,430
blood sweat, and toil of designing it

95
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,499
and coming up with these designs on its own.

96
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:38,360
So, plus it's receiving government subsidies

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,439
so it can underbid legitimate companies like
Cisco

98
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,240
and it can sell that router for less and obtain
contracts.

99
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
So will this charge affect US policy towards
Huawei?

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,199
Well, it certainly has already begun affecting
US policy towards Huawei.

101
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,819
We are asking our allies not to use Huawei
equipment

102
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:05,550
as they build out their 5G networks.

103
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,389
We are looking at limiting sales of component
parts to Huawei.

104
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:19,139
We don't want to enable this company to carry
out its malicious activities.

105
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,210
So while everybody's focused on the trade
deals

106
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,919
and selling soybeans to China,

107
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:33,650
there's a vast spectrum of activities that
the US government

108
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,759
is looking at, a vast spectrum of interrelations
with China

109
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,270
that we're re-examining.

110
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,870
A lot of the premises that underlie our current
relationships with China

111
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,379
are now really, I'd say called into question
to put it euphemistically.

112
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,970
There is always this premise that the more
we engage with China,

113
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,800
the more they would become like us.

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,069
They would become more like us,

115
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,210
they would respect liberty,

116
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,800
they would respect private property,

117
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,469
they would open up their system,

118
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,430
they would become more peaceful.

119
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,960
What we've seen instead is they become more
prosperous

120
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,849
and acquire more Western technology.

121
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,349
They're moving in the opposite direction,

122
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,389
they're becoming a techno totalitarian state,

123
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,580
they're militarizing, they're stealing everything

124
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,750
that they can't buy or that we don't give
them.

125
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,800
So under the phase one deal,

126
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,999
they're supposed to address some of these

127
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,740
intellectual property theft issues

128
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,289
and they're supposed to purchase

129
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,979
more American goods and services,

130
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,279
but there's a whole lot of other stuff

131
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,110
going on outside the realm of trade,

132
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,590
which we're looking at.

133
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,029
For example, Huawei, for example,

134
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:45,089
the FBI says it has 1000 investigations

135
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,340
open across the country

136
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,339
of Chinese espionage.

137
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,509
Every field agency of the FBI in America has
investigations

138
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,490
into Chinese espionage activities.

139
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,649
So that's not going to be covered by any trade
agreement.

140
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,379
And the administration has made it very clear

141
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,599
that they're not linking the two.

142
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,070
We can do business with China,

143
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,930
they can buy our soybeans,

144
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,930
we can sell them certain goods of a non-military
sensitive nature,

145
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,770
but we're not going to say, well,

146
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,339
now we're going to play nice and make believe
that

147
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:24,339
you're not doing something wrong over here.

148
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,399
We did business with the Soviet Union throughout
the Cold War.

149
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,360
They had nuclear missiles pointed at us, we
knew they had spies

150
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,690
trying to infiltrate and influence

151
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,180
and plant moles and all kinds of things.

152
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,810
We still would sell them wheat and we'd still
do

153
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,380
all kinds of other business with them.

154
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,040
Occidental Petroleum, Armand Hammer,

155
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,040
was a famous industrialist who famously did
business with Russia.

156
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,840
The fact that we knew they were spying on
us and wanted to,

157
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,510
as Nikita Khrushchev said, we will bury you.

158
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,950
We knew they wanted to bury us, but we said,
okay,

159
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,450
well, we'll still take their money.

160
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,050
So the US both the Trump administration

161
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,250
and the Obama administration have warned about
Huawei.

162
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,490
Do you think that's been taken seriously?

163
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,120
It's being taken more seriously now than ever.

164
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,510
I really had questions about the Obama administration

165
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,160
taking this stuff seriously.

166
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,580
Look, so many of the apparatchiks in Washington
in both parties

167
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,870
have been compromised one way or another-

168
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,150
100%.

169
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,620
By the Chinese influence operations.

170
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,750
I'm not saying that they signed up for the
Chinese Communist Party,

171
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,870
they don't even know how they'd been compromised.

172
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,510
They're buying off Americans on both sides
of the aisle,

173
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,850
Albright Associates, Madeline Albright,

174
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,210
former secretary of state,

175
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,340
her company's made just tens of millions of
dollars advising companies

176
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,010
on how to move to China and how to do business
in China.

177
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,330
Dianne Feinstein's driver was a Chinese spy.

178
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,420
Her husband has made money investing in China.

179
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,770
You just go down the line, Henry Kissinger,

180
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,390
you've got all these Wall Street guys that
have made fortunes

181
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,870
investing in China, directing investment into
China,

182
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,770
and now it's, you've heard the stories,

183
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,950
it's gone down the line of it's infiltrated
so far

184
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,500
that now pension funds, the California state
pension funds.

185
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,640
And so you think this has held back

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,870
even though the Obama administration and the
Trump administration

187
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,260
have been pushing warnings about Huawei,

188
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,470
that attitude has blocked.

189
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,860
There's bureaucratic inertia.

190
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,800
Look, there's basic human nature

191
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,610
nobody wants to admit they're wrong, right?

192
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,370
Oh man, I was so wrong about that.

193
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,780
But the basic human nature of not wanting
to admit they're wrong,

194
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,910
close their eyes, well,

195
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,660
let's keep doing things the way we were doing

196
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,830
because I don't want to admit

197
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,510
that I believe the Chinese Communist Party.

198
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,040
They were lying to me for all these years

199
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,760
and I was a fool to believe it,

200
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,120
nobody wants to say that.

201
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,300
In addition, you have bureaucratic inertia.

202
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,480
There's huge bureaucracies in the Pentagon
and elsewhere,

203
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,680
other agencies of the US government,

204
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,770
that are still proceeding along those old
premises that,

205
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,070
as we get closer to China, as they develop
and become more prosperous,

206
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,460
they will become more American,

207
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,140
they will become more Western.

208
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Absolutely.

209
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,040
If we give money to a totalitarian communist
regime,

210
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,010
they'll become a democracy.

211
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,390
Right.

212
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,900
I mean you hear the truncated version of this
is,

213
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,530
countries that trade with each other don't
go to war with each other.

214
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,500
Well, tell that to the Ukraines, Ukrainia,

215
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,860
Ukraine and Russia were the two largest trading
partners

216
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,310
before World War 1 France and Germany

217
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,590
were the two largest trading partners.

218
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,970
They went to war,

219
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,240
and this is like this economic reductionism,

220
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,200
this economism that human nature

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,830
can be reduced to dollars and cents on a spreadsheet.

222
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,480
It's a lot more complicated than that.

223
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,470
A lot of people say, we are trading,

224
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,080
the US is trading with China.

225
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,730
But still many of their actions

226
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,050
can only be described as a type of warfare.

227
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,860
Well, in the Chinese military strategy,

228
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,760
warfare goes beyond the battlefield.

229
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,720
The doctrine is the best general defeats the
enemy

230
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,880
without taking the battlefield.

231
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,120
They see the economic crippling of America

232
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,720
and acquiring the productive assets,

233
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,930
the technology and the factories of America,

234
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,300
acquiring them, moving them to China,

235
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,060
that is a form of warfare.

236
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,220
And Huawei is a part of this?

237
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,160
And Huawei is definitely a part of this.

238
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,200
Look, if a Chinese army invaded America, went
to Silicon Valley

239
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,620
and took all the factories,

240
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,020
took all the research labs and took the people

241
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,650
and moved them to Mongolia or moved them to
Manchuria

242
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,330
and set those factories up,

243
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,240
we would recognize that as an act of war and
the looting of America.

244
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,150
If you get, if Chinese capital

245
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,430
and Chinese influence gets Wall Street

246
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,770
to counsel Silicon Valley to move its research
operations into China

247
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:35,470
and to handover its innovation research and
technology to Chinese partners.

248
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,840
The goal, the end result is the same.

249
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,310
And we just make some money off of it.

250
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,810
And Wall Streets' made some money, they'd
been bought off,

251
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,220
China gets the capital

252
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,740
and you've got Think Tanks like the Cato Institute
saying,

253
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,840
oh, this is wonderful, it's free trade, it's
free market operations,

254
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,450
so therefore it's good.

255
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,490
Because you see, again, you have this ideology

256
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,900
that says all that matters is the money,

257
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,930
there are no such thing as nation States,

258
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,570
there's no such thing as culture,

259
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,220
there's no such thing as values, cultural
values.

260
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,400
It just all comes down to how many widgets
can we make?

261
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,110
How many widgets can we consume?

262
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,050
How many widgets can we acquire?

263
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,230
And that's all that matters.

264
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,980
And it's a very reductionist way of looking
at life,

265
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,250
it's devoid of humanity and the things that
I would hold say,

266
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,610
make living worthwhile.

267
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,200
So what does it mean for the US if its allies
like the UK

268
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,020
or other European countries use Huawei

269
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,320
to build parts of its telecom or 5G networks?

270
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,540
Well, unfortunately too many people in positions
in government

271
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,360
don't understand how technology works.

272
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,220
And that if Huawei equipment is in any part
of the network,

273
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,140
it will have access to all parts of the network.

274
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,910
So if Huawei equipment, if our allies use
Huawei equipment,

275
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,040
they're basically all of the information that
flows

276
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,850
over those networks and in the 5G network,

277
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,260
that's basically everything will be,

278
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:15,310
could be spied on, monitored, influenced by
someone in Beijing.

279
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,870
Now look, 5G networks are going to link devices,

280
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:26,250
power plants, electrical grids, ATM machines,

281
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,500
not just telephones, everything.

282
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,160
So what if you shut down the power grid?

283
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,180
What if, let's say China moves in, the Beijing
sends,

284
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,070
decides to move on Taiwan, right?

285
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,529
And simultaneously somebody gets a message
in Washington,

286
00:15:49,529 --> 00:16:00,480
you can let this happen or you will lose power
in East Los Angeles,

287
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,450
North Philadelphia, Atlanta and Dade County.

288
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,720
And it'll happen on the first of the month

289
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,361
when the food stamp benefits are electronically
delivered.

290
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:19,220
The SNAP, the supplemental nutrition,

291
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,440
no longer stamps anymore,

292
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,440
it's an electronic card that automatically
are replenished.

293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,340
They won't be replenished so there will be
no power,

294
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,020
there will be no food and what do you think
is going to happen

295
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,440
in your inner cities on that day?

296
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,750
Right?

297
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,300
Or there will be no power to hospitals,

298
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,370
there'll be no power to the emergency room,

299
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,860
to the intensive care unit.

300
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,490
And so having the UK have parts of its system,
5G system,

301
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,380
built by Huawei could have that effect on
the US?

302
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,550
Well, no, I'm saying if we were to have Huawei
equipment inside the US

303
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,000
that that ultimatum could be delivered.

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,680
But okay.

305
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,939
Germany's looking at this like how vulnerable
will we be

306
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,100
if we have Huawei equipment here?

307
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,620
They haven't made the decision yet.

308
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,400
The British, maybe their health system is
so bad already

309
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,860
that they don't care.

310
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,590
I suppose you would take it to the point of,

311
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,310
well do you want to see this?

312
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,440
The United States would be given this ultimatum,

313
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,100
we'll destabilize all of Europe,

314
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,410
the British banking system,

315
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,660
the City of London will go down and all of
the finance flows

316
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,790
that goes through the City of London

317
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,300
will be effected and that will have a ripple
effect

318
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,260
through Wall Street and around the world.

319
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,840
Well, some people argue that the US

320
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,140
is certainly not offering any 5G alternatives.

321
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,720
So for many people that feels like, well,

322
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,190
it's Huawei or the highway.

323
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,870
No, it's Huawei or Nokia and Ericsson.

324
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,850
Nokia and Ericsson have 5G alternatives.

325
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,090
And it's very interesting:

326
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,900
why are the British not going for Nokia and
Ericsson?

327
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:22,910
Why are the Germans not going for the Swedes
and the Danes, right?

328
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,910
This is, and now the United States government

329
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,510
is saying maybe we should invest some money
into Nokia and Ericsson

330
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,330
to develop the 5G alternative to Huawei.

331
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,550
You get the impression that the Swedes are
sitting there and saying,

332
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,470
hey, I'm here, look at me, what are you saying
there's no alternative?

333
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm sitting right here.

334
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,050
What's going on with that?

335
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,590
Some people make the argument that the only
reason

336
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,121
the US is going after Huawei is because

337
00:18:55,121 --> 00:19:00,120
it's seen as a major rival to US tech in telecom
companies.

338
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,610
What would you say to that argument?

339
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,000
Well, we just said that the United States
amazingly

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,100
has no alternative for 5G.

341
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,160
There is no American company that can, producing
5G equipment.

342
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,940
So for anybody to say we're going after Huawei

343
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:26,200
because it's a competitor to America that
just is false right there.

344
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,920
The alternative to Huawei is Nokia and Ericsson.

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,640
The problem with Huawei is not that there's
an American competitor,

346
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,880
the problem with Huawei is that it's the espionage
arm

347
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,130
of the people's liberation army.

348
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,780
They're entirely compromised,

349
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,180
we know they have back doors in their equipment
that

350
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,360
can funnel all the information that passes
over its networks to Beijing.

351
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,040
And that they have been blatantly stealing
intellectual property,

352
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,660
buying off engineer's from rival competitors,
doubling,

353
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,170
tripling their salary, come work for us,

354
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,420
and then violate the nondisclosure agreement

355
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,410
that you signed with your previous employer,

356
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,040
not to disclose their trade secrets.

357
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,910
That's what's the matter with Huawei.

358
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,710
And final question, do you think with the
US putting

359
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,350
so much pressure on Huawei,

360
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,970
the Chinese communist party will try to retaliate.

361
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,380
The Chinese Communist Party takes nothing
lying down.

362
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,490
They've threatened Germany, they've told German
companies,

363
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,800
well, they've told BMW well,

364
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,220
that's a nice factory you have outside of
Shanghai

365
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,290
hate to see something bad happen to it.

366
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,260
Maybe ought to have your government buy Huawei
equipment.

367
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:48,370
So yes, they're already flashing the dagger,

368
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:55,040
threatening retaliation against anyone who
doesn't toe the line.

369
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,840
You have to wonder, they've got their equipment
in place

370
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,920
in various countries around the world in the
developing world.

371
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,890
What kind of goods do they have on the leaders

372
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,420
of some of these kleptocracies in Africa?

373
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:17,270
What kind of goods do they have on a high
officials or bankers,

374
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:23,550
high government officials or high industry
officials in places like Ethiopia,

375
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,360
I'm just pulling this out of my head,

376
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,730
I don't know if they even have their equipment
installed in Ethiopia.

377
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:37,170
This blackmail that could be going on that
we don't even know about.

378
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:45,050
And think about this, no American company
ever voluntarily,

379
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,380
unless it's forced to even discloses when
it's hacked, very rare.

380
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,900
I mean we've heard about Experian,

381
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,260
we heard about Marriott, heard about a couple
other breaches,

382
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,730
but virtually every American company that's
been reported,

383
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,500
has been hacked, has been the victim of a
cyber attack,

384
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,370
they generally don't release this information.

385
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,530
Because it materially affects their earnings,

386
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,420
they could have a bad impact on their stock
price,

387
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,290
makes the executives look bad.

388
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,140
It's like you didn't have the systems in place
to guard against this,

389
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,420
what the hell are you doing?

390
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Right.

391
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,600
So they don't reveal this all the time.

392
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,290
You have to wonder,

393
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,929
what kind of goods does the Chinese Communist
Party have

394
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,960
on how many executives and how many companies?

395
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,240
So retaliation?

396
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,470
The retaliation could be going on already

397
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,840
in the form of extortion or blackmail.

398
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,340
All right.

399
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,440
Thank you very much for joining me today

400
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,040
and telling us about Huawei.

401
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,020
Thank you.
