1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,400
Nicaragua!

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,810
You probably haven’t heard about how crazy
things have gotten

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,100
And China has a hand in it

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,200
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,540
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,570
So, I interviewed my first terrorist.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,870
At least, that’s what the dictator of Nicaragua,

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,040
Daniel Ortega calls him.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,220
At the Oslo Freedom Forum,

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,080
I sat down with Felix Maradiaga.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,790
He’s an academic and political activist
in Nicaragua.

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,150
Back in September 2018,

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:36,690
he spoke at the UN Security Council about
how the Ortega regime

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,650
brutally represses Nicaragua’s people.

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,300
Afterwards, the Ortega regime issued a warrant
for Maradiaga’s arrest.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,350
They accused him “organized crime and financing
of terrorism.”

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,810
Riiiight.

18
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,380
In fact, Maradiaga was attacked by a mob of
50 Ortega supporters—

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,550
and had to be hospitalized.

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,430
Now I’m betting a lot of you watching

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,850
probably don’t know much about the situation
in Nicaragua.

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,950
The country rarely makes it into the US news.

23
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,250
But there is one country that really cares
about Nicaragua—

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,660
and that’s China.

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,360
The Chinese Communist Party has its fingerprints
all over Nicaragua.

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,250
And Felix Maradiaga joined me in Oslo to give
the rundown.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,600
Thank you for joining us today, Felix.

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,909
Thank you for the invitation.

29
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:23,909
Absolutely.

30
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,869
So, for those watching who don't really know
much about Nicaragua,

31
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,479
can you tell us what the political situation
is like there?

32
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,760
It's very complex at this point.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,100
The Daniel Ortega regime

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,350
has closed any possibility for peaceful protest.

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,040
There are about 400 people in prison,

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,050
just for exercising their constitutional right
to protest.

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,460
Basically, we live in a police state.

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,520
But isn't he a president?

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,240
Doesn't that mean it's a Democracy?

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,049
Well, that's the problem with dictatorships.

41
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,549
I call them dictatorships 2.0;

42
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:00,180
because they have been able,

43
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,180
many of them,

44
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,450
to bend the rules,

45
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,280
which have been developed for Democracy,

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,960
to pretend they are Democratic Regimes.

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,750
And Daniel Ortega came to power in 2007 again,

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,450
due to a very strange reform in the Constitution,

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,030
that allowed him to be elected.

50
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,030
But in any case,

51
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,530
in 2011 he was re-elected against the Constitution.

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,850
So, our argument,

53
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,000
as we have presented to the organization of
American states,

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,750
is that he is not a legitimate president under
our Constitution.

55
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,060
Well, I coined a term that I use to describe
the leader of China.

56
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,940
Not quite a president, not quite a dictator.

57
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
A “presitator”.

58
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,950
So, if you would like to use “presitator”
to describe Ortega,

59
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,770
I'm perfectly happy with you using [crosstalk]

60
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,340
I think it works perfectly,

61
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,060
and that should be a red flag for Democracies
around the world.

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,849
I like to use the painful situation of Nicaragua

63
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,390
to make a case for Democracies around the
world.

64
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,550
That when Democracies do not really deliver

65
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,900
what the average citizen wants,

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,070
it opens a door;

67
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,459
an opportunity for authoritarian regimes to
emerge.

68
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,010
So, what's China's role in Nicaragua?

69
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,020
The situation in Nicaragua is quite strange,

70
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,040
in terms of the relationship with China.

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,390
Nicaragua is one of the very few countries
around

72
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,739
the world that actually has diplomatic relationship
with Taiwan,

73
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,000
not with China.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,380
On the other hand, at the political level,

75
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,400
it's well known that Nicaragua has ties with
China.

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,460
And, in fact, the flagship project,

77
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,110
as Daniel Ortega argues,

78
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,030
in terms of foreign investment;

79
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,780
it's a canal that is supposed to connect both
of the oceans.

80
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,670
And that is not an investment from Taiwan,

81
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,670
but actually from China.

82
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,730
Which, once again, is strange,

83
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,170
because we do not have, as a country,

84
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,599
a formal relationship with the People's Republic
of China.

85
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:05,340
It is clearly a move by the Chinese regime
as well,

86
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,989
because a project of such size could not be
pursued

87
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,620
without the support of the Chinese government.

88
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,739
They're using, at this point,

89
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,739
a company registered in Hong Kong to pursue
the project.

90
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,790
So, you think China may be trying to “woo”
Nicaragua?

91
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,749
To abandon Taiwan in favor of the Communist
Party?

92
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,770
I think that, ideologically,

93
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,110
that has been a long term project of the Sandinista
party.

94
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,180
Ideologically, the Sandinista party and China,

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,909
they've always had a lot in common.

96
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,439
When Democracy was re-established in Nicaragua
in 1990,

97
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,759
during the sixteen years of Democratic transition
that we had,

98
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,680
Nicaragua developed a close relationship with
Taiwan.

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,569
But I have to say that, unfortunately, even
Taiwan,

100
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,050
at least in relationship with Nicaragua,

101
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,139
has behaved in a very unfortunate way;

102
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,889
in the sense that Taiwan,

103
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,669
despite many requests,

104
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:06,840
is one of the very few countries

105
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,879
that continues to openly support the Daniel
Ortega regime.

106
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,830
So, we are seeing China and Taiwan

107
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,940
competing for Daniel Ortegas' attention.

108
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,059
How is the Sandinista party ideologically
aligned with China?

109
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,090
Well, as you know,

110
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,279
the Sandinista party emerged as a classical
Marxist party in the 1960s.

111
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,960
And in 1979, it became a successful,

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,860
political military movement that defeated
the dictatorship of Somoza.

113
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,029
Now, the new version of the Sandinista party,

114
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:45,800
that came back into power under Daniel Ortega
in 2007,

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,620
continues to have the rhetoric of Marxism
and Socialism;

116
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,960
but in practice, is a very pragmatic regime.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,990
It's just one more authoritarian regime

118
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,879
that will use rhetoric and one side just to
attract allies,

119
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,169
but will basically use any tools, any ally,

120
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,289
to pursue its objectives.

121
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,610
Well, it's interesting you say that;

122
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,149
because I know the, sort of,

123
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:12,080
Marxist or Communist rhetoric is often used
in Latin America,

124
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,050
where there is a lot of promises made,

125
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,139
but it always seems to end in authoritarianism.

126
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,270
Why does that line of reasoning still keep
getting used?

127
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,800
That's a very interesting question.

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,719
But I think that a big component of that line,

129
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,759
as you clearly define it,

130
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,460
is that there is sort of romanticism;

131
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,449
Utopia of socialism being closely tied to
egalitarian principles.

132
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,009
And we have to be very candid in saying that
Latin America

133
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:47,789
has been one of the most unequal regions of
the world.

134
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,509
There is a big issue of poverty.

135
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,839
There is a big issue of class struggle in
Latin America.

136
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,189
And of course,

137
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:01,569
the narrative of Marxism continues to be very
compelling,

138
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,069
at the narrative level.

139
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,479
But in practice, it's a system of dominance

140
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,649
that doesn't really provide freedoms for the
individuals.

141
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:16,330
And in countries where levels of education
are so low,

142
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,869
that type of populistic rhetoric becomes really
dangerous.

143
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,240
So, I think that, in the case of Nicaragua,

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,279
as in many other underdeveloped parts of the
world,

145
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,379
the only tool to fight that kind of lines
is through education.

146
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,639
When people are well informed,

147
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,449
and when people have the basic tools

148
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:39,050
to pursue employment and health and basic
rights,

149
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,289
populism, and particularly Marxism, doesn't
have any chances.

150
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,360
So it's basically,

151
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,139
in Latin America it's still a fertile ecosystem

152
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,289
for this type of narrative,

153
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,319
because of our inequality and low levels of
education.

154
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,530
Well, so with the Nicaragua canal,

155
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,729
I know that seems to have stopped.

156
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,729
Correct?

157
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:01,729
Yes.

158
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:08,239
We have seen that many of the initial parts
of the projects,

159
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:12,629
such as, for example the environmental impact
studies,

160
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,300
the meteorological studies as well.

161
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,460
And some other engineering studies,

162
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,610
they have been stopped at all.

163
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,310
Many environmental activists argued,

164
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,239
from the very beginning when the project

165
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,439
was first mentioned about five years ago,

166
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,610
is that this project was never an authentic,

167
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,240
legitimate investment.

168
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,950
It was always a project that had something
fishy,

169
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,510
for example, money laundering.

170
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,370
For example, something that is quite clear;

171
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,140
a project designed to, basically,

172
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,360
take away land from indigenous communities,

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,620
and from the farmers and the campesino communities
of Nicaragua.

174
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,550
In fact, what we see today in Nicaragua,

175
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,540
it is closely connected to what is known as
The Campesino Movement;

176
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,200
which are the land owners that mobilized in
2013, 2014,

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,300
against the Chinese project.

178
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,940
This movement that emerged,

179
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,459
as a land right movement,

180
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,190
is closely connected to the peaceful protests

181
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,959
that we see in Nicaragua today.

182
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,920
So, the Chinese investment in the canal.

183
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,490
That didn't do anything to benefit the people
of Nicaragua?

184
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,870
No, not at all.

185
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,910
Not at all.

186
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,750
And if you read the law that was approved
in record time,

187
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,899
so it took very few hours to approve.

188
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,790
One of the strangest laws, in terms of investments.

189
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,920
The Canal Law has been elevated to the rank
of a constitutional law

190
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,060
in order to create, almost, a state within
a state.

191
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,930
So, let's assume that the project will evolve.

192
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,889
Basically, the canal area would have been

193
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:07,670
outside of the tax authorities of Nicaragua.

194
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,089
It would be outside of the judicial authorities
of Nicaragua.

195
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:14,829
So clearly, the Daniel Ortega regime

196
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,730
was trying to develop something with the Chinese

197
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:24,350
that went beyond a normal investment.

198
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,940
And the land owners actually perceived that,

199
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,189
as that's the reason why they mobilized.

200
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:32,470
This project never benefited Nicaraguans.

201
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,810
It actually affected and destroyed

202
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,700
many of the environmental areas of our country.

203
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,800
Well, now that it's been stopped,

204
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,139
does that benefit the people of Nicaragua?

205
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,519
Well, the people of Nicaragua have always
said that

206
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,010
we are a country that has open arms to foreign
investment,

207
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,279
as long as these investments are clean,

208
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,649
are legitimate, are under the rule of law,

209
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:03,199
are based on the principles of fair trade
and free markets.

210
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,260
That's what the Nicaraguan people believe.

211
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,690
I mean, we are a country of entrepreneurs,

212
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,570
and a country that has suffered many wars,

213
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,629
and we understand that investments are important.

214
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:20,839
However, the experience with the Chinese has
been very unfortunate.

215
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,590
The way in which some teams of Chinese engineers

216
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,279
have intervened in private property rights,

217
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,020
the way in which the project has been developed

218
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,970
with complete lack of transparency,

219
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,529
is something that raises a lot of flags.

220
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,189
So as we have argued,

221
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,680
together with many environmental activists

222
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,590
and grassroots leaders and local communities,

223
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,570
is that the way this project was designed,

224
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,450
it's far from a project that could bring development
to Nicaragua.

225
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,480
So, is there concern about debt trap diplomacy?

226
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes.

227
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Yes.

228
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,560
And it's also a concern of a project that
was assigned,

229
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,970
as many other projects in Nicaragua

230
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,220
that have been developed with Russian money,

231
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,810
with Venezuelan money from either the period
of Hugo Chavez,

232
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,810
or Nicolas Maduro.

233
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,759
It's just another project to enrich a family.

234
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,420
Another project just to enrich an authoritarian
regime

235
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,980
that has amassed money as no other regimes
in previous times.

236
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,949
So, it's not a project aimed at developing
the country

237
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,249
in terms of attracting employment,

238
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,139
and other types of clean investments.

239
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,680
Does China provide any military equipment
or training?

240
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,529
As I said, Nicaragua is a country

241
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,339
that does not have a formal relationship with
China.

242
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:54,129
So, at least officially, the Chinese are not
working;

243
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:59,319
in terms of bringing official corporations

244
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,360
to the military or to the police.

245
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,749
There are unofficial accounts,

246
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:08,029
and we have strong suspicions

247
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,100
that there are some relationships in terms,

248
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,130
for example, of espionage,

249
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,089
and in terms of collaboration with the regime.

250
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,949
But it has been very hard to actually document

251
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,890
and prove those suspicions.

252
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,890
Okay.

253
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,180
What about things like censorship and surveillance?

254
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,449
I know there's been, sort of,

255
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,860
a push for more internet censorship,

256
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,430
more surveillance, facial recognition technology.

257
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,100
Is any of that coming from China?

258
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,759
It's part of the conversation.

259
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:43,920
In fact, prior to the canal investment project

260
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,639
coming into the public eye,

261
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,439
there was discussion of a satellite

262
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:51,120
of private investors from Hong Kong;

263
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,759
which are closely connected to the same group
of people

264
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,399
who are investors around this very strange
character,

265
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,430
Mr. Wang Jing.

266
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,699
Who, based on independent media research,

267
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,399
is someone who has been, for years,

268
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,199
connected to the Chinese military.

269
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,759
We have raised this issue to the international
community,

270
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,129
and it's quite sad that Nicaragua

271
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:21,730
has not been able to attract international
attention.

272
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,920
What is happening in Nicaragua,

273
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,430
with the Chinese presses and with the Russian
presses.

274
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,360
And just to make a comparison,

275
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,079
when we first raise a flag above the Russians,

276
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,260
very few people believed it.

277
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,279
And now there is a very big Russian presence
in Nicaragua,

278
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,009
and it started just as the Chinese.

279
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,339
Just as rumors;

280
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,699
as something that was not very easy to prove.

281
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,990
And suddenly, the Russian presence in Nicaragua

282
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,990
is deeply ingrained in the political system.

283
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,850
So, we want to continue to insist that,

284
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,410
despite the fact that we're not seeing concrete
Chinese presence

285
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,499
in terms of massive investments,

286
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:04,600
or presence in terms of surveillance technology,

287
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,360
it is something that is not farfetched at
all.

288
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,559
So, this is something that could be

289
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,420
a National Security Interest for the United
States?

290
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
Absolutely.

291
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,519
And so you, as an opposition leader,

292
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,330
how does all of this affect you?

293
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,999
Well, not as an opposition leader,

294
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:19,999
as a citizen,

295
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,220
as a human rights defender.

296
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,999
Many years ago, back in 2006,

297
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:29,889
I'd published a paper called China's Side
Principle.

298
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:32,499
My argument at that time,

299
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:39,869
based on reviewing many documents from China

300
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:42,480
on how the Chinese government trains their
military,

301
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,209
their intelligence officials, their diplomats,

302
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:49,839
is that China is not willing to face the United
States directly,

303
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,839
but through the sides;

304
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:53,640
using what I would call the side principle.

305
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,069
And this was back in 2006,

306
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:02,470
looking at the way that China is strengthening
its presence at that time,

307
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,910
in countries such as Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador;

308
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,389
and Nicaragua is just part of that strategy.

309
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:11,649
What really concerns me is the lack of attention

310
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,800
that this issue has in Washington.

311
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,529
I think that, with all due respect,

312
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,620
Washington experts on Latin America

313
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,100
are probably too consumed

314
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,629
and too focused on many other important issues.

315
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,319
But China is a direct threat,

316
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,960
not only to the safety of citizens like myself,

317
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,329
who believe in free press and who believe
in private property

318
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,959
and who believe in human rights,

319
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,430
but also to any other individual in the hemisphere

320
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,759
who believes in Democracy.

321
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,589
And this, sort of, lack of foresight on the
part of Washington.

322
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,600
That goes back several administrations?

323
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,499
It's not just the Trump administration?

324
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,619
It was Obama, Bush, Clinton?

325
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:55,170
It's been going on a while?

326
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,999
It's been going a while.

327
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,680
And what I believe,

328
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,529
from the perspective of what we do in Nicaragua,

329
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,740
in addition to my political,

330
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
my human rights work,

331
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,810
we have been working for over 16 years in
public policy.

332
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,480
And we have developed several papers on this
particular issue,

333
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,169
and we have arrived to the conclusion

334
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:17,049
that the Chinese mindset is a long term mindset.

335
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,459
I mean China looks at public policy in terms
of 50, 60, 70,

336
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,929
even 100 years from now.

337
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,720
And the Western perspective,

338
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,140
it's not only a US problem,

339
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,799
it's a problem of the West.

340
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,550
We see a public policy in terms of presidential
terms, you know?

341
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,370
So, it's important that those of us in the
Western Hemisphere,

342
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,510
who believe in the fundamental principles
of Democracy:

343
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,820
Freedom of the press,

344
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,890
freedom of speech,

345
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,980
and in general the Declaration of Human Rights,

346
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,159
need to understand that China is not a traditional
threat,

347
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,059
from the perspective of the Cold War,

348
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:00,270
or anything like that.

349
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,590
But it's a threat to freedom,

350
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,559
because China is supporting authoritarian
movements

351
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,779
and authoritarian regimes that actually threaten

352
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:09,630
the principles of the Western Hemisphere.

353
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,039
So, what hope is there for people of a country
like Nicaragua,

354
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,840
where their authoritarian dictator is being
backed

355
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,250
by an even more powerful authoritarian regime?

356
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,510
Well, our hope is that democracies around
the world

357
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,970
could work together and strengthen our common
values,

358
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,640
or also our common strategy in protecting
human rights.

359
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,220
Last year, September 5th, 2018,

360
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,600
I was able to present the case of Nicaragua

361
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,200
in front of the U.S. Security Council.

362
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,880
It was very unfortunate that, clearly,

363
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,270
Russia and China were completely opposed to

364
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,580
what we suggested at the U.S. Security Council;

365
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,190
when we presented that the issues that are
happening in Nicaragua,

366
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,010
with the close ties of Ortega with Venezuela,

367
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,100
with Russia and China,

368
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,900
are also a threat that is not only domestic
or national in Nicaragua;

369
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,010
but it's a threat to the stability of Central
America.

370
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,370
What we are seeing is a pattern

371
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,470
in which authoritarian regimes around the
world

372
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,340
are closely working together.

373
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,669
You see China and Russia collaborating.

374
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,910
We have seen the presence of Iran in Latin
America,

375
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,400
[crosstalk] very close to Nicaragua.

376
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,490
We see Venezuela.

377
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,430
And we expect that the democracies around
the world,

378
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,940
and particularly the United States,

379
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,909
as the most solid democracy of the industrial
world,

380
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,990
actually take the leadership that is expected
from the U.S.

381
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,320
So, its hard to get support in the U.N.

382
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,190
when Russia and China play such a large role
in it.

383
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,190
Indeed.

384
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,549
And that is a problem in which the U.S. system
has been designed.

385
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,549
Once again,

386
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:44,289
it comes back to the basic principle of human
rights;

387
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,860
when farmers in Nicaragua have been displaced

388
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,440
because of Chinese investments,

389
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,730
when indigenous communities in Nicaragua

390
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,850
are being displaced of threatened in their
community rights

391
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,640
because of the Chinese presence.

392
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,520
These are not only a problem

393
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,520
related to local grassroots communities of
Nicaragua.

394
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,050
It's actually a threat to the stability of
a region,

395
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,910
and to the fundamental principles

396
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,880
that have been developed within the Western
Hemisphere,

397
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,270
particularly on the democratic charter of
the O.A.S.

398
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,559
This is something that we are also elevating
to the O.A.S.

399
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,920
And we are expecting the leadership of the
U.S. to also be present,

400
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,830
not only at the U.N., but at the original
forum,

401
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,120
such as the O.A.S.

402
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,990
So, what happens if China is left unopposed
in Latin America?

403
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,570
I think that that is the same question,

404
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,840
and not to exaggerate,

405
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,120
it would be the same question that many people
asked many,

406
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,529
many decades ago;

407
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,549
when Germany was not seen as a problem

408
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,060
during the first years of the Nazi regime.

409
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,960
We have seen that when any authoritarian regime

410
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
that has resources, power,

411
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,100
global presence are left without a balance
of power,

412
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,880
democracies are challenged,

413
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,070
and human beings pay a huge price.

414
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,070
So, I hope that not only the United States,
but the world,

415
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,620
would understand that having such a massive
global power

416
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,159
that is not a democracy is a problem.

417
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,390
Not only for my country,

418
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,580
which is a small country in Central America,

419
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,010
it's actually a problem for the world.

420
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,669
Have we seen a case in which two major global
powers

421
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:25,710
can cooperate if one of those powers is not
a democracy?

422
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,910
I think that's the biggest question.

423
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,300
This is not only an issue of Nicaragua,

424
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,400
it's an issue for the global stability of
Earth.

425
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
All right.

426
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,909
Thank you very much for joining me.

427
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:34,909
Thank you.

428
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:35,909
Thank you.

429
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:37,090
I'm glad that we spoke about something

430
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,730
that is not very much addressed.

431
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,730
Unfortunately.

432
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,730
Once again, thank you very much.

433
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,730
It's been a pleasure, okay.

434
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,460
Absolutely.
