00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,360
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,600
what goes up must come down…

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,880
…HARD.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,240
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,349
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,349
Space:

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,180
The final frontier.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,320
Unless you’re China’s Tiangong-1 space
station.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,320
In which case,

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,460
your final frontier is about to be a crash
landing on Earth.

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,240
This is China’s Tiangong-1 space station.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,630
It means “Heavenly Palace”...1.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,110
And it’s a “showcase of China’s growing
prowess in space.”

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,250
The Tiangong-1 launch in 2011

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,750
was a great moment for China’s budding space
program.

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,970
It came a mere four decades after

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,510
Russia launched the first space station in
1971,

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,330
and America launched its first space station
in 1973.

19
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,730
1973 was also the year

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,180
Elton John’s “Crocodile Rock” became
a Billboard Hit.

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,340
Of course, in 1973 in China,

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,210
no one was listening to bourgeois Western
music.

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,390
And the Communist Party’s idea of space
exploration back then

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,410
was sending scientists to the countryside
to be re-educated.

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,510
So all the more reason why China’s 2011
launch of Tiangong-1

26
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,330
was such a big deal.

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,580
The launch was broadcast on state-run CCTV,

28
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,820
which also ran this computer animation during
it.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,660
Ah, there’s something about that music

30
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,250
that just makes me feel so patriotic.

31
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,790
Because it’s “America the Beautiful.”

32
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,840
Oops.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,409
Sounds like someone needs to be re-educated.

34
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,560
But anyway,

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,729
Tiangong-1 is just the beginning for China.

36
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,240
China spends roughly $2 billion dollars a
year

37
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,610
on its space program.

38
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,180
That’s small potatoes compared to the

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,480
$18 billion NASA spends.

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,620
But China’s space ambitions are growing
at a time

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,270
when the US’s are shrinking.

42
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,690
But if China growing space program has you
worried,

43
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,159
let state-run media reassure you

44
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,139
that it’s all for totally peaceful purposes…

45
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,180
...even though it’s essentially run by the
Chinese military.

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,319
In fact,

47
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,469
in December,

48
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:24,159
the Chinese military created the Strategic
Support Forces to oversee—

49
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,179
you guessed it—

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,620
space warfare.

51
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,439
China has been developing and testing

52
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,459
systems that could disable US satellites.

53
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,299
Hey, this is serious.

54
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,239
Without satellite-based GPS,

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,529
how will you be able to find a good Italian
place on Yelp?

56
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:41,529
In fact,

57
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,849
Lieutenant General David Buck

58
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:45,670
recently testified before US Congress, saying,

59
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,370
“There isn’t a single aspect of our space
architecture,

60
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,739
to include the ground architecture, that isn’t
at risk.”

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,160
Yes, that’s just wonderful.

62
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,280
But back to Tiangong-1,

63
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,079
which at least does not appear to have been
weaponized.

64
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,269
It’s been hanging out 200 miles above the
Earth

65
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,939
for 5 years now,

66
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,010
collecting data,

67
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,799
docking with space modules,

68
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,659
and saving Sandra Bullock.

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,980
Then in March,

70
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,519
state-run Xinhua News announced that

71
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,730
Tiangong-1 had completed its missions,

72
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,739
and “will descend gradually in the coming
months”

73
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,409
back down to earth.

74
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:25,569
Yes, descend gradually like a gently falling
autumn leaf.

75
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,639
Of course,

76
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,719
hostile anti-China forces,

77
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,900
i.e. reporters,

78
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,989
did their own investigations.

79
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,310
And it appears the situation might be a bit
more serious than that.

80
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,569
As the Daily Mail wrote in July,

81
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,840
it will “explode through Earth's atmosphere
raining molten metal.”

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,460
Well, that’s the Daily Mail.

83
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,959
What do you expect?

84
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,140
In fact, they later changed the headline of
that article,

85
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,930
presumably to cover up how exaggerated their
original statement was.

86
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,809
But state-run Xinhua News

87
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:00,659
has now also changed its tone on the whole

88
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,999
“gradual descent” thing,

89
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,650
presumably to cover up how

90
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,120
under-exaggerated their original statement
was.

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,189
According to this more recent Xinhua article,

92
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,819
Tiangong-1 has “comprehensively fulfilled
its historical mission”

93
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,219
and “most parts of the space lab will burn
up during falling.”

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,660
Wait, “most parts” will burn up during
falling”?

95
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,200
What about the other parts?

96
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,220
I feel like Xinhua is still trying to spin
this as not a big deal.

97
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,870
According to The Guardian,

98
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,550
China has lost control of the Tiangong-1,

99
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,289
and it will crash back down to Earth

100
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,800
at some unknown time in 2017.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,490
And there will be “lumps of about 100kg”—

102
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,449
or 220 pounds—

103
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,190
that don’t burn up in the atmosphere.

104
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,450
So basically,

105
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,940
cannonballs traveling at 200mph,

106
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,930
landing somewhere that’s impossible to predict,

107
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,190
on an unknown date.

108
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,920
“Uh, Beijing, we have a problem.”

109
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,759
The good news is,

110
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,480
most of the Earth is water,

111
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,580
and it's unlikely that pieces of Tiangong-1
will hit populated areas.

112
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,200
But as we all know,

113
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,770
the best way to solve a problem

114
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,900
is to hide it for as long as possible,

115
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,360
and then when the truth comes out,

116
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,389
spin it as not a big deal.

117
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:12,389
Fortunately,

118
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,770
after Tiangong-1,

119
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,750
this kind of thing will probably never happen
again.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,720
Umm...probably.

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,310
So what do you think of China’s space program?

122
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,310
Leave your comments below.

123
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,009
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

124
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,229
See you next time.
