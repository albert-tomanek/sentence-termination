1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,000
Which of these two maps is correct?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,559
It depends who you ask.

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:09,120
Most countries don’t recognize China’s
territorial claims.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,450
But China is trying to change that.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,160
By slowly changing the maps you see around
the world.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,340
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,480
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,670
This episode is sponsored by MOVA Globes.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,279
This is the coolest globe you’ll ever own.

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,010
But there’s one thing that most people buying
it won’t notice...

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,379
but China Uncensored viewers will.

12
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:38,420
And some of you already have.

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,039
It turns out, there’s no single, standard
map of the world—

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,600
at least not from the perspective

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,170
of the world’s roughly 200 countries.

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,809
Not every country agrees on where the borders
are.

17
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,960
For example, India has border disputes

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,359
with both Pakistan and China,

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,920
so each of those countries

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,359
has its own version of the world map.

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,089
And most notably, the People’s Republic
of China

22
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,989
thinks they own the entire South China Sea.

23
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,800
That’s why, on China’s official maps,

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,390
they draw this Nine-Dash Line.

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,300
Everything inside belongs to China...

26
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,330
including the entire country of Taiwan,

27
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,490
which is also claimed by the People’s Republic
of China.

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,920
Plus, China’s map claims this giant chunk
of India’s

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,160
Arunachal Pradesh state.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,200
China calls it “South Tibet.”

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,110
The important thing here is that while

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,350
this is China’s current official map,

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,810
pretty much no other country’s government
agrees.

34
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,010
In fact, in 2016, an international tribunal
in The Hague

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,590
rejected China’s claims to the South China
Sea.

36
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,940
That made it official.

37
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,750
Except that China rejected the Hague’s ruling...

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,430
and then ramped up its own plans to

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,800
quietly change the rest of the world’s maps.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,840
That’s why when you look at a map printed
in China,

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,080
it looks like this.

42
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,510
Here’s a closeup.

43
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,090
As you can see, this globe has the Nine-Dash
Line,

44
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,870
and Taiwan is the same color as mainland China.

45
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,582
So wait...why is China Uncensored sponsored
by a company

46
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,340
that prints China’s version of the map on
its globes?

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,009
Turns out, it’s a crazy story.

48
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,420
It all started a few months ago.

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,210
Shelley, Matt, and I were at a museum in Norway.

50
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,450
And we saw these MOVA Globes in the gift shop.

51
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,820
I thought, “Cool, that’s our sponsor!”

52
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,580
And then I looked more closely.

53
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,790
On each globe, I could see China’s Nine-Dash
Line.

54
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,860
I was surprised,

55
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,300
because *this* is the globe MOVA had sent
us before,

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,320
when they sponsored America Uncovered.

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,640
It does *not* have the Nine-Dash Line.

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,530
Some of our viewers also contacted us

59
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,470
and said they noticed the Nine-Dash Line on
their own MOVA globes.

60
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,540
So we emailed MOVA and asked them what was
going on.

61
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,910
And they told us their fascinating story

62
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,570
of Chinese censorship and crippling fines.

63
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,180
MOVA International is an American company
based in San Diego.

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,530
But their globes use a lot of complicated
high-tech parts

65
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,660
that are not available in the US.

66
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,680
So, and this may sound familiar,

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,700
they set up shop in China,

68
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,200
by contracting with a local factory.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,310
That way it was easier and cheaper

70
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,600
to get the parts they needed.

71
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,330
They began making globes in China in 2008.

72
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,490
By 2017, MOVA was doing

73
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,319
more than 80% of its manufacturing in China.

74
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,190
MOVA makes dozens of designs, including earth
globes,

75
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,910
the moon, other planets, even a Van Gogh painting.

76
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,970
MOVA has always focused on the technology
of their globes.

77
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,020
They’re not an educational company.

78
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,150
So they were never concerned with the politics
of maps.

79
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,190
MOVA purchased their map designs from a Chinese
vendor,

80
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,380
and then had a local company do the physical
printing.

81
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,510
That includes their 12 globe designs

82
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,120
that have political maps of the world.

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,460
And it turns out, Chinese government regulations

84
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,300
require that all maps sold in China,

85
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,310
or printed in China but sold abroad,

86
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,190
have to have China’s official version of
the world map.

87
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,230
And since MOVA had its maps printed in China,

88
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,240
it had no choice but to comply with Chinese
law.

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Over the years,

90
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,069
and especially since the 2016 Hague ruling,

91
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,620
the Chinese government has strengthened its
map printing rules.

92
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,980
As my favorite Chinese state-run media The
Global Times put it:

93
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,609
The goal is to “make the [Chinese] government’s
position on territory

94
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,509
clear to the international community.”

95
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:23,889
And this is important,

96
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,630
because “Problematic maps... will confuse
the international community

97
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,800
about China’s territory and the government’s
position,

98
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
or even be hyped by those with ulterior motives,

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,150
seriously damaging national interests and
the government’s image.”

100
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,410
And while most normal people would consider
this to be... ludicrous...

101
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,710
the People’s Republic of China takes it
very, very seriously.

102
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:54,389
And they literally have inspectors check every
single Chinese factory—

103
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,849
including foreign companies’—

104
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,789
to make sure their maps are politically correct.

105
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,699
Here’s another example.

106
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,449
Shelley got this map as a Christmas gift.

107
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,509
You can scratch off the countries you’ve
been to.

108
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,699
It’s sold by a UK-based company.

109
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:11,300
It, too, has China’s Nine-Dash Line.

110
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,550
Guess which country that map was printed in?

111
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,520
And when Shelley scratched off China and Taiwan,

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,779
they were the same color.

113
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,559
Sorry, Shelley, you only get credit

114
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,240
for visiting *one* country now.

115
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,719
Even digital maps of China are affected.

116
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:28,020
While Google Maps looks like this...

117
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,319
Chinese-owned Baidu Maps looks like this.

118
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,060
It has China’s version of the border with
India,

119
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,340
the Nine-Dash Line,

120
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,120
and Taiwan is labeled like a province of China,

121
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,919
not a separate country.

122
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,589
And artwork has been affected, too.

123
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,300
Last year, Chinese students protested

124
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
at the London School of Economics

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,430
because a giant upside-down globe sculpture
showed

126
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,449
Taiwan as an independent country.

127
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,129
As you can see from this photo,

128
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,590
Taiwan is clearly pink while China is yellow.

129
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,469
After an international controversy,

130
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,909
the London School of Economics solved the
problem

131
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,379
in the most academic way possible:

132
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,369
They added a footnote.

133
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:09,889
And the map controversy has hit retail stores,
too.

134
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,710
Last year, clothing company GAP

135
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,119
was criticized by Chinese authorities

136
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:17,719
for selling a T-shirt with the “wrong”
map of China.

137
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,869
This is what GAP’s shirt looked like,

138
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,710
And this is the map it was “supposed”
to have.

139
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,039
GAP wrote an apology so pathetic it’s almost
unreal.

140
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,930
They said: “Gap Inc. respects the sovereignty

141
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,090
and territorial integrity of China.

142
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,710
We’ve learned a Gap brand T-shirt sold in
some overseas markets

143
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,060
mistakenly failed to reflect the correct map
of China.

144
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,879
We sincerely apologize for this unintentional
error.”

145
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,259
Other companies that have recently

146
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,930
apologized to China over maps include:

147
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,150
Versace...

148
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,389
Christian Dior...

149
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,839
And Audi...

150
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,849
Just last month,

151
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,479
following that NBA-Hong Kong debacle,

152
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,659
sports broadcaster ESPN showed this graphic
of China—

153
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,749
complete with Taiwan and the Nine-Dash Line.

154
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:04,819
All this is to say,

155
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,400
that a huge number of companies that print
their products in China,

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,590
or simply have a business relationship with
China,

157
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,610
have felt pressure to make their world maps

158
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,039
conform to China’s official version.

159
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,419
And that includes the maps they use in products

160
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,689
sold in the rest of the world.

161
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,610
And given that most maps are made by companies

162
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,180
that are not educational companies—

163
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,719
like GAP, ESPN, et cetera—

164
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,159
those companies don’t really care.

165
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,909
Many of them are not even aware of the politics
surrounding maps.

166
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:38,349
And it’s much easier to just do what the
Chinese government requires,

167
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,839
than to take a stand against

168
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,099
the world’s most powerful authoritarian
regime

169
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,809
on what—for them—is a minor issue.

170
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,279
The United States and other free countries

171
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,309
don’t have these kinds of map restrictions.

172
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,259
So in the US, Canada, Europe, et cetera,

173
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,659
you can show any map you want.

174
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,440
Like Shelley’s scratch-off map—shipped
to the US

175
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,449
by a UK company that just happens to print
its maps in China.

176
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,490
See, it doesn’t matter if it matches

177
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,259
the US or UK’s official world map.

178
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,800
That’s called freedom of the press.

179
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,990
And the Chinese Communist Party

180
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,669
is taking advantage of *our* freedom of the
press.

181
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,189
Their plan is to get the rest of the world

182
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,680
to recognize their territorial claims.

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,879
I’m not exaggerating.

184
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,839
They literally say that in state-run media.

185
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,909
So the Chinese Communist Party

186
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:27,899
is slowly infiltrating all the maps everywhere,

187
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,589
by controlling the printing inside China,

188
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,990
and pressuring Western companies outside China.

189
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,019
But this cloud has a silver lining.

190
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,500
Not every company is a coward like GAP.

191
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,490
Which brings us back to MOVA Globes.

192
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,019
The management at MOVA told us

193
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,110
they hadn’t even noticed the Nine-Dash Line

194
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,019
until we pointed it out to them.

195
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,410
But now MOVA *is* aware.

196
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,329
And MOVA has stopped production in China.

197
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:55,760
I’d like to say it was our message to MOVA

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,410
that convinced them to pull out.

199
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,680
But it wasn’t.

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,100
It was something even crazier.

201
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,370
See, this is MOVA’s Antique Terrestrial
map.

202
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,240
It’s based on an Italian world map from
1790.

203
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,370
In 1790, China was ruled by the Qing Dynasty,

204
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,790
and the map of China looked very different.

205
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,020
But guess what?

206
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,580
China’s communist authorities

207
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,519
don’t recognize that map,

208
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,800
because China was labeled in Italian.

209
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,190
Chinese inspectors had approved

210
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,550
all MOVA Globe designs since 2008.

211
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,300
But things seem to have changed in 2017—

212
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,079
right as China was strengthening its map printing
rules.

213
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,430
That’s when Chinese government inspectors
entered the factory—

214
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,740
the one MOVA had contracted to make their
globes.

215
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,660
The inspectors saw this antique design,

216
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,590
and told them they couldn’t print it—

217
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,899
because it doesn’t match China’s guidelines.

218
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,720
That’s crazy!

219
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,660
But it gets crazier.

220
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,959
The inspectors stopped the presses,

221
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,350
and issued steep fines for, quote,

222
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,759
“not being in compliance with China’s
rules and regulations.”

223
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,550
This applied to the antique designs,

224
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,889
plus a number of modern designs.

225
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:05,240
All in all, MOVA was forced to pay

226
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,910
more than 40,000 US dollars in fines.

227
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,690
So what was MOVA to do in this kind of

228
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,529
highly politicized environment?

229
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,579
They closed up shop,

230
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,600
and moved all their manufacturing to Taiwan.

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,660
Well, they didn’t actually close up shop
themselves.

232
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,300
The Chinese government did.

233
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,600
Officials boarded up the factory,

234
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,279
and forbid them from accessing it until they
paid up.

235
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,379
They had to pay,

236
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,259
because that factory still housed

237
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,570
a lot of MOVA’s expensive internal components,

238
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,529
like solar cells and magnets.

239
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:38,759
And it’s those components

240
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,940
that make MOVA globes spin magically like
this,

241
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,630
without any wires or external batteries.

242
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,170
This unique technology is the core of their
business.

243
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,850
So the Chinese government essentially forced
MOVA

244
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,889
to pay more than 40,000 dollars

245
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,639
just to go into the factory and collect their
own components.

246
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,740
All in all, it was a very expensive form of
censorship.

247
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,519
As of 2019, MOVA does 100% of its printing
and assembly

248
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,870
at its own facility in Taiwan.

249
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,480
And since Taiwan is a free country,

250
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,980
MOVA can now print whatever they want with
no restrictions.

251
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,980
And now that the US has a 30% tariff on certain
imports from China,

252
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,630
it’s actually less expensive to manufacture
in Taiwan.

253
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,460
But like many companies,

254
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,380
even after pulling out of mainland China,

255
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,290
MOVA is still facing pressure.

256
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,300
See, even though MOVA’s map designs are
now printed outside China,

257
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,769
each globe uses highly specialized Low-Light
Solar Cells,

258
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:37,930
and a Low Friction Motor.

259
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,290
And there’s only one country

260
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,899
that manufactures those components:

261
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,130
You guessed it, China.

262
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,680
Which is why MOVA’s willingness

263
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,660
to even work with China Uncensored is so courageous.

264
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,300
Very few companies have the guts to do it.

265
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,110
And that’s why I can proudly say that

266
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,839
this episode is sponsored by MOVA Globes.

267
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,220
And for the record,

268
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,140
we approached them about sponsorship.

269
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,519
And, get this:

270
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,740
MOVA still had some of those Nine-Dash Line
designs in stock—

271
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,839
the ones printed in China.

272
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,810
I asked them to send me this one,

273
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,199
because it’s a limited collector’s item
now.

274
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:14,230
I mean, who else gets to own one of these
awesome

275
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,000
self-spinning globes that has the Nine-Dash
Line?

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,259
And until supplies runs out,

277
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:23,769
you too can get one of these Nine-Dash Line
globes.

278
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,350
This model is called “Political Map Blue”.

279
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,600
A link with our tracking code is in the description
below.

280
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,560
And when you buy one of these MOVA Globes,

281
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,910
you’ll not only have a great story to tell
your friends.

282
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,220
You’ll also be directly supporting China
Uncensored.

283
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,220
And trust me,

284
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,879
we’re not going to be sponsored by GAP any
time soon.

285
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,860
So click the link below and check out MOVA
Globes.

286
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,040
And wherever you are in the world,

287
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,389
if you see one of China’s Nine-Dash Line
maps in a store,

288
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,149
in a magazine, et cetera—let us know.

289
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,920

Then we can all see how widespread this phenomenon
is.

292
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,920
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

293
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,060
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
