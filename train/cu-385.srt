00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,760
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,930
we meet Chinese billionaire, Xiao Jianhua.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,590
So rich, he practically lives at the Four
Seasons hotel

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,090
in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,900
But his luxury lifestyle won’t last.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,860
Stay tuned for Lifestyles of the Rich and
Corrupt.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,820
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,900
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,050
Meet Chinese mega tycoon Xiao Jianhua.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,130
He may not look it,

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,670
but he’s one of China’s richest men.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,630
He has his own entourage of female bodyguards

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,760
who will “even wipe the sweat from his brow.”

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,170
But don’t let his casual style fool you.

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,700
Even though he dresses like someone

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,260
out of a Wes Anderson film,

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,460
he’s worth an estimated 5.8 billion dollars.

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,660
And he’ll need every penny

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,760
for when the fashion police come to get him.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,350
Speculation on what’s happened to Xiao has
been mounting

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,420
since last week

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,380
when some reports came out suggesting that
he’d been

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,360
abducted by agents of Beijing

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,070
and taken to mainland China.

25
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,310
Whoa, China’s fashion police

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,540
are really overstepping here.

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,630
I mean,

28
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,340
they let Chinese billionaire Chen Guangbiao

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,380
get away with absolute murder.

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,259
Wait, what’s that, Shelley?

31
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,390
Oh, it wasn’t the fashion police who abducted
Xiao.

32
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,490
It was the regular police.

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,389
Xiao was staying long-term at the Four Seasons
hotel in Hong Kong

34
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:29,310
when Chinese plainclothes police allegedly
abducted him

35
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,770
and took him across the border into mainland
China.

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,859
And his female bodyguards didn’t even stop
them.

37
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,579
A lot of people are freaking out,

38
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,039
because if this was indeed an abduction

39
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,590
by Chinese police in Hong Kong,

40
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,420
it would be a huge violation of the One Country,
Two Systems policy.

41
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,819
That’s the policy that keeps Hong Kong free
and independent

42
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:52,289
of the Communist Party’s rule.

43
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:55,369
In theory, if not always in practice.

44
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:58,549
But “abduction” is such a nasty word.

45
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:01,039
Recently a source inside Zhongnanhai,

46
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,009
the Beijing leadership headquarters,

47
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,299
with authoritative information on high-level
discussions,

48
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,070
told The Epoch Times that Xiao Jianhua is

49
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,060
“currently assisting the top Chinese leadership

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,080
with corruption investigations in Beijing.”

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,350
Haha, “assisting,” oh my gosh...this thing
just writes itself.

52
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,350
According to the source,

53
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,470
Xiao Jianhua has become yet another pawn in
Xi Jinping’s campaign

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,340
against political rival and toadmaster, Jiang
Zemin.

55
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,580
Sorry, this Jiang Zemin.

56
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,620
So what happened?

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,070
“This is one of China’s richest men—

58
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,700
a tycoon that has business interests and investment
interests

59
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,220
spread through many different areas of the
financial circles,

60
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,070
and reported links to some of the richest
and most powerful families

61
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,670
in China.”

62
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,620
Now if you’re wondering what that has to
do

63
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,630
with his mysterious disappearance,

64
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,680
well, Xiao Jianhua is the perfect example

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,350
of how business and politics are so closely
entwined

66
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,790
in China.

67
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,790
You see,

68
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,170
Xiao’s a smart guy.

69
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,310
He was accepted to Beijing’s prestigious
Peking University

70
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,150
when he was only 14.

71
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,640
He’s also smart because he can read the
political winds.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
While many of his classmates were protesting
and dying

73
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,230
in Tiananmen Square,

74
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,220
Xiao stayed loyal to the Communist Party.

75
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,930
Then he made his fortune

76
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,990
by helping China’s elite make their fortunes.

77
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,020
You see many of China’s biggest state

78
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,910
and publicly owned business a

79
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,190
re actually in the hands of the top Chinese
leaders’

80
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,190
family members.

81
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,120
That’s the glorious way communism

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,480
with Chinese characteristics works.

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,710
Under communism,

84
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,940
they forcibly took over all private enterprise,

85
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,980
so everything was owned by the state.

86
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,310
And then when the state decided to try out
capitalism,

87
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,120
they made some of those state businesses

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,840
“publicly owned,”

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,760
which in many cases meant owned by family
members

90
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,940
of public officials.

91
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,300
Of course, this doesn’t look so good.

92
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,480
So smart guys like Xiao Jianhua help Chinese officials

93
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,320
cover their tracks.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,090
And when it comes to covering tracks,

95
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,490
Xiao seems to play the field.

96
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,410
He has ties to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

97
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,410
For example,

98
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,360
“In 2012, a company owned by Xiao bought
shares

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,680
worth at least $2.4 million from

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,310
the sister and brother-in-law of Xi Jinping.”

101
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,460
He also has ties with Xi Jinping’s rivals.

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,810
In 2006, he helped the family of this guy,

103
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,540
Zeng Qinghong.

104
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,500
And Zeng Qinghong was the right hand man

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,960
of former Chinese leader, Ziang Zemin.

106
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,490
This is my left hand. You get the idea.

107
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Don’t they look happy together?

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,720
That photo was taken in the good old days,

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
before they were engaged in a life-or-death
factional power struggle

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,290
against Xi Jinping.

111
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,290
But anyway,

112
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,190
back in 2006, billionaire Xiao Jianhua helped
Zeng Qinghong’s son

113
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,280
get control of a state power company

114
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,850
in Shandong province that was about to go
public.

115
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,490
Using a series of shell corporations,

116
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,590
Xiao helped Zeng’s son get the power company

117
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,340
for pennies on the dollar,

118
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,930
making him rich.

119
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,180
It was a good deal for everyone,

120
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
except Chinese taxpayers

121
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,460
who effectively footed the bill.

122
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,710
That power company thing briefly became a
big scandal

123
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,160
when financial newspaper Caijing published
it as their cover story.

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,630
It “was the only one Caijing ran

125
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,100
that was ever pulped by censors.”

126
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,830
News censored, scandal gone, problem solved.

127
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
It least it would have been,

128
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,139
if it weren’t for that meddling Internet!

129
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,639
Now, that story is floating around again

130
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,740
on Chinese social media.

131
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,870
But strangely enough,

132
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,930
this time it’s being left uncensored.

133
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,530
Hmm…

134
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,790
So has Xiao Jianhua

135
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,610
really been helping corrupt officials?

136
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,120
Well, according to the The Epoch Times’
source,

137
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,330
“Xiao Jianhua is the most important ‘money
launderer’

138
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,920
of the Jiang [Zemin] faction.”

139
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,130
A lot of money laundering goes on in Hong
Kong.

140
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,720
It’s the place some corrupt Chinese officials

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,380
use to funnel their ill gotten gains from
mainland China

142
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,270
out into the West.

143
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,770
Take Xiao himself for example.

144
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,419
I said earlier he was worth about 5.8 billion
dollars.

145
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,420
That number comes from the Hurun report,

146
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,000
which ranks China’s richest people.

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,330
But the Hurun chairman told Financial Times
that

148
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,890
“it is extremely difficult to work out his
wealth because

149
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,660
‘he’s a got a myriad of highly complex
structures.’”

150
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,820
Structures even more complex

151
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,290
than Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl performance.

152
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,030
And if what Epoch Times’ source says is
accurate,

153
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,419
Xiao may have helped the Jiang faction

154
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:40,520
empty out China’s coffers.

155
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,190
If Xiao Jianhua is a money launderer,

156
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,850
he would have dirt on a lot of people.

157
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,200
So the information Xiao has could be a big
boon

158
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,949
to Chinese leader Xi Jinping

159
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,770
in his fight against Jiang Zemin.

160
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,460
Because, as always, there’s a political
power struggle going on.

161
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,760
So it’s quite possible that Xi Jinping

162
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,030
is using Xiao Jianhua as a tool in his anti-corruption
campaign—

163
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,889
a campaign designed mainly

164
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,979
to take down his political enemies.

165
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,389
“That’s why the Xi Jinping administration

166
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,320
has decided to arrest Xiao Jianhua,

167
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
investigate him,

168
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,760
and use his case to make a breakthrough in
cleaning out

169
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,150
the many godfathers in China’s financial
sector,”

170
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,120
the Epoch Times’ source said.

171
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
If that’s true,

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,960
it’s a bold move by Xi Jinping.

173
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Abducting someone from Hong Kong

174
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,260
would violate Hong Kong law.

175
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,650
Especially because Xiao isn’t even a Chinese
citizen.

176
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,169
He was born in China,

177
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,550
but he's a Canadian citizen now.

178
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,120
He also holds a diplomatic passport

179
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,229
from Antigua and Barbuda—

180
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,230
which is incidentally is also a great place

181
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,300
for laundering money.

182
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,800
Of course, you never know.

183
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,669
Maybe Xiao just went to Beijing to

184
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,860
voluntarily assist with corruption investigations.

185
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,290
So what do you think of the disappearance

186
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,919
of Chinese billionaire Xiao Jianhua?

187
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,259
Leave your comments below,

188
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,830
but then cover them up.

189
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,470
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

190
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,570
Once again, I’m your host Chris Chappell.

191
