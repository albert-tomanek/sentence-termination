1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,679
Mike Pence talks tough on China

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,490
He blasts the regime for human rights abuses

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,980
and a Range of unfair trade practices

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,360
And he got plenty of strong reactions

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,720
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,039
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,890
Vice President Mike Pence.

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,949
The bran muffin of the Trump administration.

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,439
Sure, bran muffins are wholesome,

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,039
but everyone still hates them.

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,039
Last Thursday,

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,399
Pence gave an hour-long talk on US policy
towards China.

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,550
And everyone hated it.

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,860
First, as you can imagine, Pence has deeply
hurt

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,430
the feelings of the Chinese people.

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,430
And by Chinese people,

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,149
I mean the poor spokespeople at China’s
Foreign Ministry,

18
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,480
whose job it is to respond to this kind of
thing.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,160
"Pence's speech was exactly the same as

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,079
the one he made last October,

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,500
revealing sheer arrogance and hypocrisy,

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,969
and it was filled with political bias and
lies."

23
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:04,660
So just what kind of biased, hypocritical
lies

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,680
did Mike Pence spew from his arrogant mouth?

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,880
Here’s just one example.

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,310
“Millions of ethnic and religious minorities
in China

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,630
are struggling against the Party’s efforts

28
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,720
to eradicate their religious and cultural
identities.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,450
The Communist Party in China has arrested
Christian pastors,

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,970
banned the sale of Bibles, demolished churches,

31
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,030
and imprisoned more than one million Muslim
Uighurs.”

32
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,710
OK, well those things are all true.

33
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,490
But China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson

34
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,250
was right about one thing.

35
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,880
That *was* same thing Pence said last October.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,710
“And when it comes to religious freedom,

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,520
a new wave of persecution is crashing down
on

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,050
Chinese Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims.”

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,850
But overall, it wasn’t *exactly* the same
speech.

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,890
Because last year,

41
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,740
Pence blamed the Communist Party

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,060
for exploiting American corporations.

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,979
This time, he blamed American corporations

44
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,000
for hypocrisy and for buckling to communist
censorship.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,750
"Far too many American multinational corporations

46
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,670
have kowtowed to the lure of China’s money
and markets

47
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,490
by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese
Communist Party,

48
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,250
but even affirmative expressions of American
values."

49
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,410
And that brings us to the second group Pence’s
speech has upset:

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,290
American corporations that have kowtowed

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,100
to the lure of China’s money.

52
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,550
And one in particular: the NBA.

53
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,310
Pence cited that tweet from Houston Rockets
General Manager

54
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,310
Daryl Morey:

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,370
"Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong."

56
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,530
And unless you’ve been living in a cave—

57
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,620
the kind of cave with no wifi—

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,770
you know the backlash that happened next.

59
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,870
The NBA apologized to China

60
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,210
and then tried to distance itself

61
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,480
from that kind of discussing pro-freedom talk.

62
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,650
“In siding with the Chinese Communist Party

63
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,110
and silencing free speech,

64
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,290
the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary

65
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,470
of that authoritarian regime.”

66
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,980
And that remark sparked an angry reaction

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,400
from former NBA all-star Charles Barkley.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,600
“Vice President Pence needs to shut the
hell up...

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,900
These holier-than-thou politicians,

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,040
if they are so worried about China,

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,660
why don’t they stop all transactions with
China?”

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,670
Um, I don’t think the only two options

73
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,720
are never criticizing someone,

74
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,200
or never talking to them again.

75
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
But anyway,

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
the idea of stopping all transactions with
China

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
is actually a thing.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,250
It’s called “decoupling,”

79
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,970
and some people have advocated for just that.

80
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,110
“I like the term ‘decoupling.’

81
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,140
I think being coupled to China in such a fulsome
way

82
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,260
is actually damaging to our democracy.”

83
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,410
But, Pence can add decoupling advocates

84
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,050
to the list of people he’s upset—

85
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,220
because he didn’t advocate for decoupling,
either.

86
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,920
“People sometimes ask whether the Trump
administration

87
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,620
seeks to ‘decouple’ from China.

88
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,850
The answer is a resounding ‘no.’”

89
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,220
Pence said the US wants to engage with China,

90
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,630
but does China really want to engage properly
with the US?

91
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,910
"All that Beijing is doing today,

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,510
from the Party’s great firewall in cyberspace

93
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,880
or to that great wall of sand in the South
China Sea,

94
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,040
from their distrust of Hong Kong’s autonomy...

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,540
it’s the Chinese Communist Party that has
been

96
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:42,900
‘decoupling’ from the wider world for
decades."

97
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,620
In other words, I’m rubber and you’re
glue.

98
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,910
Whatever you say bounces off me and...

99
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,030
ends up in my speech on national television.

100
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,710
Pence also came out in favor of Hong Kong
protesters.

101
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,120
For four months, they’ve been protesting

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,680
increased Chinese Communist Party interference

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,650
in their political system.

104
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,880
The Beijing-backed government has responded

105
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,080
with escalating levels of violence.

106
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,500
"Nothing in the past year has put on display

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,060
the Chinese Communist Party’s antipathy
to liberty

108
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,940
so much as the unrest in Hong Kong."

109
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,881
”To the millions in Hong Kong

110
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:22,630
who have been peacefully demonstrating

111
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,290
to protect your rights these past months,

112
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:33,000
we stand with you.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,340
We are inspired by you,

114
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,520
and we urge you to stay on the path of nonviolent
protest."

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,250
Unsurprisingly, these words

116
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,480
also upset the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.

117
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,680
"Affairs of Taiwan, Hong Kong,

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,570
Xinjiang are all China's domestic affairs.

119
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,150
No foreign forces whatsoever

120
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,450
are allowed to interfere in our internal affairs."

121
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,450
But I have to say,

122
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,870
they should at least agree with

123
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,710
Pence’s support of *nonviolece*...

124
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,710
since Chinese state-run media

125
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,660
have repeatedly called for an end to violence.

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,820
But no, Chinese media were still upset.

127
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,930
You know who else was upset about Pence’s
speech?

128
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,930
China hawks who felt Pence should

129
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,310
have given his speech sooner.

130
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,600
Pence was originally supposed to give the
speech in June.

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,020
But then Trump wanted to meet with Xi Jinping
at the G20.

132
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,170
And according to Reuters,

133
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,830
the speech was seen as “potentially hampering
Trump’s bid

134
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,090
to use that meeting to get negotiations back
on track.”

135
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,700
But then China’s state-run Global Times
criticized the delay, too.

136
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,350
Because the delay “reflects White House
chaos”.

137
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,480
So American China hawks and the Global Times
agree?

138
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,060
I’m not sure what’s happening here.

139
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,820
Still, Pence tried to end his speech

140
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,970
on a positive note of peace and cooperation.

141
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,340
"There is an ancient Chinese proverb that
reads,

142
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,860
‘Men see only the present,

143
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,800
but Heaven sees the future.’

144
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
As we go forward,

145
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
let us pursue a future of peace and prosperity

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,140
with resolve and faith.

147
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,600
faith that Heaven sees the future —

148
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,760
and by God’s grace,

149
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,470
America and China will meet that future together."

150
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,639
And how did that go over?

151
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,450
"He's not playing bad cop.

152
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,520
There are some lists of human rights violations.

153
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,430
But overall, the speech shows a new respect
towards China.”

154
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,540
So at least that part didn’t upset anyone.

155
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,760
Except China hawks who thought he was too
soft.

156
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,160
And China doves who thought

157
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,639
he shouldn’t have given the speech at all.

158
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,990
And atheist Communist Party officials

159
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,630
who couldn’t stand all that talk of “faith
in Heaven”

160
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,310
and God’s grace.”

161
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,530
Really, there’s no winning this one.

162
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,550
So what do you think about Pence's China speech?

163
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,180
Leave your comments below.

164
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,470
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from one of you.

165
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,370
Most of China Uncensord’s income

166
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,270
comes from direct viewer support

167
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,419
through the website Patreon.

168
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,670
So as a reward to our supporters,

169
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,160
I answer a question from our Patrons

170
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,250
at the end of some of my episodes.

171
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,889
This question comes from...

172
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:24,889
Justin:

173
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,771
“There seems to be signs that Hong Kong

174
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,240
will have an economic recession

175
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,180
partly from the unrest and partly from China’s
interference.

176
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,560
If Hong Kong goes into a recession will

177
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,050
that change people’s view on the protests?”

178
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,450
Great question, Justin!

179
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,810
There’s definitely a recession in Hong Kong
already.

180
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,000
Tourism is down, especially from mainland
China.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,170
And wealthy Hong Kongers are gradually transferring

182
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,370
their assets from Hong Kong to overseas.

183
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,610
After the first couple months of protests,

184
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,990
I was also concerned that an economic recession

185
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,540
would make Hong Kongers turn against the protesters.

186
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,950
That’s exactly what Beijing wanted.

187
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,580
And there *are* definitely people

188
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,040
who are upset about the protests.

189
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,470
Some of them are angry at protesters

190
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,400
for hurting business and tourism.

191
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,790
But a lot of Hong Kongers still put the ultimate
blame

192
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,320
on the Chinese Communist Party.

193
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,410
They say that if the Party hadn’t tried
to violate its agreement

194
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,950
to let Hong Kong keep its freedoms until 2047,

195
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,950
there would be no protests.

196
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,589
That’s why huge numbers of Hong Kongers

197
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,420
continue to support the protesters,

198
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,330
and even join practically every week.

199
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,990
And for people who were born and raised in
Hong Kong,

200
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,730
they many of them believe that the alternative
to protests isn’t peace.

201
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,100
It’s authoritarian rule by the Communist
Party.

202
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,550
And their entire future is at stake.

203
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,470
So even if they are disrupted by the protests
for now,

204
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,540
not supporting the protests really isn’t
a good option.

205
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,460
Thanks for your question, Justin.
