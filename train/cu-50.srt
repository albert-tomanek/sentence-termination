00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,050
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,990
Donald Trump blames China.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,300
Again.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,600
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,260
Presidential candidate Donald Trump is no
stranger to controversy,

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,040
whether it's making sexual innuendos about
other politicians…

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,000
or saying China is raping the United States.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,150
"We can't continue to allow China to rape
our country,

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,560
and that's what they're doing."

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,050
And who's to blame?

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,610
The victim of course!

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,680
“China's great. No problem.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm not angry with China… I'm angry at our
leaders,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,330
because they are grossly incompetent

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,850
and they shouldn't have ever been elected
to do this job.”

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,940
Now if you're like me,

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,670
your reaction to this was probably the same
as your reaction to,

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,120
really, this entire election cycle…

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,820
“Jane, stop this crazy thing! Jane!”

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,150
Sorry George,

22
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,130
there's no stopping this crazy, out-of-control
ride.

23
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,579
So is Trump correct that China is "raping"
the United States?

24
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:11,310
Well, some are pointing out that perhaps Trump
is being

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,570
a tad insensitive in his use of descriptors.

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,520
But the United States does have a huge trade
deficit with China.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,620
In 2015, the US bought $480 billion worth
of Chinese goods.

28
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,759
That's about one-fifth of all US imports.

29
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,539
But the US only sold about $115 billion of
goods to China last year.

30
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:40,499
And that marked the biggest annual trade deficit
with China ever.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,960
According to a 2013 report by the American
Economic Review,

32
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,170
one million American factory jobs have been
lost to China.

33
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,299
So what could Donald Trump actually do about
this if elected?

34
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,709
We'll, he's suggested this:

35
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:58,770
a 45% tariff on Chinese goods.

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,979
Which he cannot do.

37
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,999
You can't impose tariffs on entire countries.

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,659
What you can do under existing laws

39
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,459
is to set out specific categories of imports

40
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,269
you want to put a tariff on,

41
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:14,480
like the US did to Chinese tires in 2009.

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,000
The result?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,620
Tires just got imported from Indonesia, Mexico,
and Thailand.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,700
And no, there were not suddenly more US jobs
manufacturing tires.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,500
But it's not easy to place these tariffs

46
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,260
because you'd have to prove specific violations
of trade rules

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,610
to the World Trade Organization.

48
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,760
They're the ones that regulate global commerce.

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,780
You see, when the WTO was set up in 1995,

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,049
the rules laid out didn't really take into
consideration

51
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,560
dealing with China—

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,579
a country where the Communist Party

53
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,390
has pretty murky ties to just about everything,

54
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,970
including the handling of the economy.

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,189
It's not really communism,

56
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:58,560
but the government is way more involved than
in most countries.

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,900
If a president Trump decide to say "screw
it"

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,090
and did impose a broad China tariff, well,

59
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,209
that would kind of mean global trade laws
no longer matter.

60
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,560
And that goes against US policy

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,980
going as far back as the end of World War
II.

62
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,920
It was thought that increasing international
trade

63
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,909
would prevent international conflict.

64
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:24,609
And so the US has been lowering tariffs.

65
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,080
According to the World Bank,

66
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,620
the US imposes some of the lowest tariff rates
in the world.

67
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,460
And US manufacturing output right now is at
an all-time high.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,980
So it's not that China is stealing US manufacturing
jobs,

69
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,089
it's that technology is stealing US jobs.

70
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,400
Because a lot of the jobs that used to be
done by humans

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,909
have become automated.

72
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,760
Like bowling alley pinsetters.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,480
Or switchboard operators.

74
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,240
Or checkout clerks.

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,640
And having a trade deficit is not in of itself
a bad thing.

76
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,080
The US economy runs on consumption,

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,960
and boy are we good at it!

78
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,939
"Can he break his own record of 68 hot dogs
in 10 minutes?

79
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,320
With seconds on the clock,

80
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,869
[Joey] Chestnut manages to do the impossible."

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,840
That also means China has a lot of US dollars
floating around.

82
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,430
And though that's not going into buying US
goods,

83
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,610
it is being used to buy US services.

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,120
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis,

85
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,700
the US has a service surplus with China.

86
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,900
Though in 2014, it was only $28 billion,

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,800
so not nearly as much as the trade deficit.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,169
But here's the thing: Trump has a point.

89
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,469
No, not that China is stealing our jobs directly.

90
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:46,940
But according to one expert I interviewed,

91
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,870
the US loses an estimated $5 trillion a year
to China

92
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,750
—yes, trillion—

93
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,650
due to intellectual property theft

94
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,510
spearheaded by the Chinese military.

95
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,099
Not to mention all this trade and theft

96
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,680
are basically what prop up a cruel, tyrannical
regime.

97
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,759
It's just that, when you put things like this…

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
"We can't continue to allow China to rape
our country…"

99
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,500
though people will listen, they might not
take it seriously.

100
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,560
What do you think?

101
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,870
Leave your comments below.

102
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,600
Once again I'm Chris Chappell, and I'm voting
for…

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,780
cthulhu!
