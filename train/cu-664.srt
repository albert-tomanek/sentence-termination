1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,750
Forget Uncle Sam.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,490
China has Uncle Trump.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,970
Chinese agents have infiltrated the US!

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,980
Don't worry,

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,250
Congress is doing what it does best:

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,100
Absolutely nothing.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,040
And China's facial recognition technology

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,720
will keep you safe…

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,730
from committing thought crime.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,680
This is China Uncensored.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,600
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,220
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,239
The number two guy in Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption
campaign

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,250
is saying corruption in China is so bad,

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,870
it could lead to a soviet style collapse.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,680
Top Party officials have said

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,230
similar things in the past.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,910
But will this unusually strongly worded warning

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,100
lead to lasting change and meaningful reform?

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,380
Of course not.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,250
Xi Jinping will use it to strengthen his grip
on power,

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,399
which he’ll then use to further purge his
political opponents

24
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,449
under the guise of the anti-corruption campaign.

25
00:00:58,449 --> 00:00:59,449
To be fair,

26
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,280
Captain Toadstool and his underlings

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,410
were pretty corrupt,

28
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,420
and you can’t blame Xi for purging them.

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,900
Speaking of strong leaders:

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
Uncle Trump,

31
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,180
the Grand Commander,

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,140
or Donald the Strong as they call him in China.

33
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,090
US President Donald Trump has a legion of
fans there.

34
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,610
Some online Trump fan groups even boast

35
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,320
tens of thousands of members.

36
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,729
As one Chinese citizen told the New York Times,

37
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,030
“He’s true to himself.”

38
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,020
Just like One Punch Man.

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,799
If One Punch Man had golden locks of hair.

40
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,799
And were president.

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,000
President Trump, by the way,

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,979
just finished his first official state visit
to China,

43
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,700
and we’ll have more on that after the break.

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,920
And back in the US, the annual report by

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,920
the U.S. China Economic and Security Review
Commission

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,950
has a piece of advice for Congress:

47
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,259
Chinese journalists should be labeled as foreign
agents.

48
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,329
The Chinese regime has rapidly expanded

49
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,570
its state-run media to the United States.

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,680
I mean, CCTV has an office

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,560
literally seven blocks from the White House.

52
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
According to the report,

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,520
state media’s purpose is not so much journalism,

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,939
but to spread propaganda

55
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,409
and spy for the Chinese regime.

56
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:08,409
After all,

57
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,259
if Russia Today had to register,

58
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,600
maybe the same should apply to Chinese state-run
media

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,770
and those who work for it.

60
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,620
Of course there’s another alternative to
dealing with

61
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,350
China’s creepy authoritarian control.

62
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,739
If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em!

63
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,849
The Chinese Communist Party has been taking
the concept

64
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:28,430
of a surveillance state to the next level.

65
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,150
Chinese companies have been working

66
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,550
on facial recognition software.

67
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,410
They hope that by analyzing hair,

68
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,739
facial dimensions, and skin color,

69
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,410
they can accurately track individuals.

70
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,379
And then use behavior recognition software

71
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,150
to predict whether they’re going to commit
a crime.

72
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,080
And also, just keep an eye on everyone

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,629
so they’re safe.

74
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,220
It’s all about safety.

75
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,160
I know, you’re jealous of the CCP’s progress

76
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,280
on facial recognition.

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,940
But don’t worry,

78
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,370
because that kind of technology

79
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,659
may someday come to the West!

80
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,720
Oh, it already has.

81
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,980
I mean, it still doesn’t work very well.

82
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:06,209
But not to worry,

83
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,709
because investors are pouring money

84
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,080
into facial recognition software—

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
and not just to unlock stupid iPhones

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,409
that have no home button.

87
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,960
Investors are flocking to the 6.4 billion
dollar

88
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,320
video surveillance market in China,

89
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,099
including “leading U.S. venture capital
firms

90
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,130
such as the China arm of Sequoia Capital,

91
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,319
which is one of the best-known

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,550
Silicon Valley venture capital firms.”

93
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,750
And I don’t know if the US can compete.

94
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,489
Because it just came out that China

95
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:37,849
now has more supercomputers than anywhere
else.

96
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,379
China has 202;

97
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,690
the US, only 144.

98
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,690
Come on, America.

99
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,870
How can we be a global superpower

100
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,940
if we don’t have the most supercomputers?!

101
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,880
And finally, Hong Kongers have not been reacting
well

102
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,280
to the new law that makes it illegal

103
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,159
to disrespect China’s national anthem.

104
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,420
Namely, they’ve been booing it.

105
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,740
But they might regret that action.

106
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,160
There’s a law in Mainland China

107
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,769
that disrespecting the anthem

108
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,870
could carry a three-year prison term.

109
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,530
That law hasn’t been passed in Hong Kong...

110
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,479
but some Hong Kong lawmakers want to.

111
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,780
Namely, the pro-Beijing ones.

112
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,620
Shocking, I know.

113
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,880
And at least one former Legislative Council
member

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,020
thinks that law could be applied retroactively.

115
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,020
In other words,

116
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,560
you might not want to be caught on camera

117
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,840
booing the Chinese anthem in Hong Kong right
now.

118
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,050
Because when your booing becomes illegal

119
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,800
years after you did it,

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,910
you could be spending time in an orange jumpsuit

121
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,639
with hardened criminals.

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,840
And student democracy leaders.

123
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
So what do you think?

124
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,400
Leave your comments below.

125
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,590
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

126
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,370
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

127
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,320
see you next time.

128
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,080
Oh say can you see,

129
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,139
by the dawn’s early light,

130
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,139
