Chinese Netizens Are Tortured And Punished

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,600
For Leaking Information On Xi Jinping’s Daughter

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,920
Daddy Xi Is Not Happy

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,520
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,880
In China, netizens can be\h
arrested for simply browsing\h\h

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
China’s Dirty Web—basically,\h
the Dark Web for doxing sites.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,000
Like many young internet users, netizens in China\h
have formed subcultures on certain websites.\h\h

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,040
Some of these websites are hosted\h
on foreign servers outside of China,\h\h

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
so authorities can’t shut them down as easily.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,240
Some of these websites function\h
as wiki database sites—that is,\h\h

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,800
users can contribute information on the site.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,520
The Chinese Communist Party calls these\h
wikis the “Esu Circle”. Esu means Vulgar.\h

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:09,200
One of the Esu Circle websites is Zhina Wiki. And\h
just look at this homepage. Now that’s vulgar.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,760
It started as a place where young netizens could\h
share memes and throw shade at public figures like\h\h

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,520
celebrities and athletes. But in 2019, users\h
on Zhina Wiki shared personal information\h\h

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,720
about Xi Jinping’s relatives: his brother-in-law\h
Deng Jiagui, and his daughter Xi Mingze.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,240
That leaked information included Date\h
of Birth, Household Registration number,\h\h

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,480
and for Xi Mingze, her new name.\h\h

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,160
She allegedly had her name changed after getting\h
her Bachelor’s Degree from Harvard University.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,680
The only official photo of Xi Mingze is\h
this Xinhua propaganda photo from the 90s.\h\h

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,360
And it’s not really a photo of her. It’s\h
a photo of how great her dad is. Daddy Xi!

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,320
But that little girl\h\h

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,680
is now 28. And very few people actually\h
know what she looks like as an adult.

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,440
Occasionally, alleged photos\h
of her have been leaked.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
This Daily Mail article from\h
8 years ago shows this photo,\h\h

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
but without citing a source.\h
It’s most likely not her.\h

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,280
There’s also this photo, from\h
thefamouspeople.com—also not a reliable source.\h

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
There’s also this photo from Getty\h
Images, labeled as Xi Mingze, but\h\h

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,920
not confirmed that it’s the same Xi\h
Mingze who’s the daughter of Xi Jinping.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
And obviously none of these\h
photos are the same person.\h

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
And this latest leak from the Zhina Wiki\h
website is yet another unconfirmed photo.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Whether accurate or not, Daddy Xi is not pleased.\h

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,200
And in the typical communist style, the\h
response to the leaked photo is pretty extra.\h\h

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,120
The Ministry of Public Security established\h
a special task force. In the end they jailed\h\h

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,520
24 netizens for the information leak.

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,680
Which is crazy. When can you get\h
24 people to cooperate on anything?

37
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,440
The most severe sentence was given\h
to 21-year-old computer prodigy\h\h

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,320
Niu Tengyu, who had made around 200 entries\h
online. He was deemed the primary offender.

39
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,560
Niu Tengyu was sentenced to 8 years in prison for\h
“picking quarrels and provoking disturbances,”\h\h

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,040
5 years in prison for “infringing on citizens’\h
personal information,” and 2 years for “illegal\h\h

41
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,120
business operation.” His combined sentence is\h
15 years in prison, and the court decided to\h\h

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:53,040
implement a 14-year sentence with a 130,000\h
RMB fine—which is about 20,000 US dollars.

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,800
14 years in prison seems excessive for\h
leaking a photo and some information—and\h\h

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,680
it wasn’t even embarrassing information.

45
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,920
Just imagine someone leaking information\h
about the US president’s embarrassing child.

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,400
Twitter might freeze your account.

47
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,640
But you won’t go to prison.

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,120
Even Donald Trump eventually stopped\h
hiding his embarrassing daughter.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,240
And Xi Mingze is by all accounts well behaved\h
and low key. So what’s such a big deal that\h\h

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
the people who allegedly leaked her\h
information are going to prison?\h

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,160
Well, it’s hard to say. But the prison\h
sentence isn’t even the worst part.\h\h

52
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
I’ll explain after the break.

53
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
Welcome back.

54
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,400
Niu Tengyu is the Chinese netizen who\h
was sentenced to 14 years in prison\h\h

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,080
for allegedly leaking this photo and information\h
about Xi Jinping’s daughter, Xi Mingze.

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Visiting “Esu Circle” websites has not been\h
punished by the judicial system before.\h\h

57
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,200
But this case is different because\h
it involves Xi Jinping’s family.\h\h

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,720
And that’s also why Chinese lawyers\h
are reluctant to represent Niu Tengyu.

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,920
This handwritten letter from Niu Tengyu was\h
released by an anonymous friend or colleague. It’s\h\h

60
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,320
about how the authorities tortured him to confess.
￼\h

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,840
It says: “Around January 2020, I was forced to\h
write ‘confessions’ on a few hundred pages of\h\h

62
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,280
A4 paper. I wrote tens of thousands of words. All\h
of the content I wrote was required by the police,\h\h

63
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,200
and I was forced to make up and fabricate things\h
that are non-existent, deliberate fabrications\h\h

64
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,800
according to their demands. I had to write enough\h
pages within a given timeframe following the\h\h

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,040
titles and outlines they demanded. When failing\h
to do so, I was allowed to eat nothing but rice,\h\h

66
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,920
I was deprived of sleep, and I was hung up and\h
beaten. Between December 10, 2019, and January 20,\h\h

67
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,480
2020, I slept less than 30 hours in\h
total, and I was crippled by beating.\h\h

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,720
I’m hereby stating that all these\h
documents were fabrications under duress,\h\h

69
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
and they do not represent my own\h
opinion, and much of them are not true.”

70
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,760
According to Niu’s mother, the police tortured him\h\h

71
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,120
to get him to confess to being\h
the ringleader behind the leak.

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,080
She also said that one of Niu’s\h
arms has been permanently injured\h\h

73
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
and he was beaten until he was\h
unconscious several times.\h\h

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,800
I know what you’re thinking: That’s\h
an excessive amount of torture.\h\h

75
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,680
But remember, he’s a dangerous terrorist. He\h
posted a photo on the internet. Allegedly.

76
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,880
And I say allegedly because it might\h
not have been Niu Tengyu at all.

77
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,480
The founder of one of the Esu Circle websites\h
has testified that Niu Tengyu wasn’t actually\h\h

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,240
involved in the information\h
leak, but is just a scapegoat.

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,240
After all, there’s no way to verify\h
that Niu Tengyu was the one who found\h\h

80
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Xi Mingze’s information in the first place.\h
According to Xiao Yanrui, who started several\h\h

81
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,360
of the Esu Circle websites, the data may have\h
been shared online by...corrupt police officers.

82
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,120
Xiao says the administrators of the Zhina\h
Wiki website, where the information was\h\h

83
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,840
actually leaked, are based overseas. So the\h
authorities chose to blame Niu Tengyu instead.\h\h

84
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:46,800
Even though Niu was not posting on Zhina Wiki.\h
He was posting on a different website, Esu Wiki.\h

85
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,160
And according to Xiao, the information about\h\h

86
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,000
Xi Jinping’s relatives was\h
not even posted on Esu Wiki.

87
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:03,040
Xiao also said that Niu had traveled with him\h
to Hong Kong to see the protests back in 2019.\h

88
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,720
So...this could have been about punishing\h
him for visiting the Hong Kong protests,\h\h

89
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,200
while at the same time covering\h
up police behavior? Hmmm.

90
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,920
And now it’s time for me to answer a question from\h
a viewer who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

91
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,320
Bruce Johnson asks:
Chris, what's your general impression of the\h\h

92
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,360
post Trump/mid pandemic world as it relates\h
to China's future? It seems between Trump\h\h

93
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,360
and the CCP's handling of the Coronavirus, the\h
cat is out of the bag.\h How much will all this\h\h

94
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,560
impact China's trajectory of becoming a\h
true super power and rival of the US?\h

95
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,080
Well, Bruce: The good news is that through the\h
pandemic, a lot of people are waking up to the\h\h

96
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,680
problems with the Chinese Communist Party—from\h
their initial cover up that caused the spread,\h\h

97
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,240
to the hostile mask diplomacy, to\h
the ineffective Chinese vaccines.\h\h

98
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,120
Even some governments are getting tougher\h
on the CCP, like the UK and Australia.

99
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,480
In terms of post-Trump, it’s hard to say. We’ve\h
only had a few weeks of post-Trump, and it’s not\h\h

100
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,080
yet clear what the Biden administration is going\h
to do on China. They’ve said some tough things,\h\h

101
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,960
they’ve said some cooperative things. But\h
ultimately it’ll be actions that count.

102
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,680
But the best way to prevent the\h
CCP from being a true super power\h\h

103
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,320
is simple: Stop giving them money. That’s it.\h
Stop investing in their bonds. Stop buying their\h\h

104
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:48,240
products. Stop watching their stupid panda videos.\h
And if we all do that, the CCP will not survive.

105
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
Thanks for your question, Bruce.
