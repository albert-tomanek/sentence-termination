00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,110
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,240
China’s toilet revolution gets flushed.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,020
Hi, welcome to 
China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,500
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Chinese leader Xi Jinping

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,150
has been talking about a revolution...

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,070
a toilet revolution.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,320
What a potty mouth.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,760
Let’s just say,

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,270
toilets in China are not always in good shape,

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,420
like this one at a hotel my producer Matt

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,880
stayed at in Yunnan Province.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,080
It lacks important features,

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,010
such as...a door.

15
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,429
Well, fear not, bathroom-goers!

16
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:35,890
Because Xi Jinping has a plan!

17
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,769
He wants to improve toilets across the country.

18
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:41,739
70,000 toilets have been built so far,

19
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,610
and 64,000 more are on their way.

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,000
You see, Xi Jinping is worried that

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,769
bad toilets can affect tourism.

22
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,620
So the obvious solution is a top-down mandate

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,249
that absolutely won’t be taken to ridiculous
extremes

24
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:58,440
by overzealous local officials.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,949
Oops, spoke too soon.

26
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:04,760
Because “In an apparent bid to gain favour
with Beijing,

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,330
some officials have carried out

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,560
other over-the-top improvements,

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,450
including refrigerators packed with drinks,

30
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,200
microwave ovens, LCD televisions,

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,030
and automatic shoe polishers.”

32
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,150
Yes, there’s nothing I’d rather do in
a Chinese toilet

33
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,520
than microwave some food.

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,430
And want toilet paper?

35
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,430
In the past,

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,080
you usually had to bring your own

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,280
everywhere you went,

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,450
since people would steal

39
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,540
what was foolishly left unguarded.

40
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,830
Well now some restrooms

41
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,150
have face recognition toilet paper dispensers

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,440
that ensure you get the right amount.

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,660
The right amount depends on

44
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,460
whatever local officials think you need.

45
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,810
At least in China,

46
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,640
everyone gets an equal... small amount.

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,550
But some places are spending big

48
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,520
to show how enthusiastic they are

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,740
about Xi Jinping’s toilet revolution.

50
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,930
This restroom in Chongqing

51
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,870
cost over 120,000 dollars.

52
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,370
It’s become such a problem

53
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,640
that China’s tourism head official

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,350
has told everyone to just hold it.

55
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,070
“We don't need local governments

56
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,899
trying to outdo each other with ‘five-star
toilets’—

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,650
we just need to build practical public facilities.”

58
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,760
Exactly!

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
From now on,

60
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,300
officials should to just order cheap toilets
online.

61
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,660
Like this one from Alibaba.com.

62
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,300
What?

63
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,460
They’re only 250 bucks each!

64
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,470
So what do you think about

65
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,470
China’s toilet revolution?

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,270
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

68
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,780
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

69
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,000
see you next time.

70
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,280
You know, considering that people

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,550
are actually buying Squatty Potties,

72
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,670
maybe China should embrace its squat toilets.

73
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,210
They could be a great place to catch up on

74
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,250
