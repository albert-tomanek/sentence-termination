00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,560
On this episode of China Uncensored

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,709
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. You won't catch me Stalin with a pun. I'm Chris Chappell

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,699
Well

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,149
It's been a hundred and sixty-five years since Karl Marx put out his Communist Manifesto that led the world into the communist utopia

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,490
we know today. The shackles of the workers have been cast off and all live in equality

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,240
And, oh, what's that?

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,630
Communism was a total failure that instead of liberating people killed tens of millions and has all but vanished from the face of the earth?

8
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:40,649
Looks like Marx was a little off the mark there. Pun number two!

9
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,649
I don't even think that was a minute between.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,120
The 20th century was marred by the fear that

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:55,949
communism would sweep through the world and that there'd be a nuclear Armageddon. One of the most famous guns in the world

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,020
the ak-47 was designed by the Soviet Union to be the weapon of revolution. That's why there are anywhere from 100 to 500 million of them in the world today.

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,319
That's a gun for about every 14 people.

14
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,170
That wasn't such a good idea.

15
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:14,069
Of course since guns are banned in China. That's about 1.3 billion people out of the picture, though

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,799
So we might have to share a little less. But despite all the Red Terror the Soviet Union turned out to be well

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,140
corrupt and broken. The communist bloc

18
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,110
collapsed.

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,150
The only significant communist country left now is China and even then its communist leaders tout Marxism on the one hand

20
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,179
But on the other they sneak over to the U.S. to buy a property.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,729
But just as the USSR seemed strong and mighty and then suddenly collapsed overnight the same thing is happening to the Chinese Communist Party.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,899
So while China's economic policies may no longer be purely communism, communism is more than just economic policy.

23
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,089
It's also a culture and something that the party has latched on to the people to ensure its own survival.

24
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:01,679
But then in 2004, The Epoch Times, NTD's partner media, published the Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party.

25
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,550
It's a book-length series of nine editorial commentaries detailing the history of the CCP and its effects on the Chinese people

26
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,349
So, for example, for decades

27
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,349
the Communist Party has been telling Chinese people that the Party is

28
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,630
China, there can be no China without the Party.

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
Even when Chinese people criticize the Party they do it in the context of the Party.

30
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,190
That's why the permissible calls for reform are still only calling for reform within the Party rather than an

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,290
alternative to it. Take Charter 08

32
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,800
for example. It was a document about the crazy idea that China should have greater freedoms. Nobel Prize-winner

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,809
Liu Xiaobo was thrown in jail for 'inciting subversion of state power' for his part in Charter 08.

34
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,179
But even so the document was still only calling for those freedoms under 'one-party' rule

35
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,209
Basically what the CCP was trying to do was establish

36
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:57,009
Charter 08 as the most extreme form of dissidents because if everyone thinks the most radical ideas for change you can come up with

37
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,209
still has the Communist Party on top, then hey! Great for the Communist Party.

38
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,839
But by detailing all the terrible things that the Party has brought to the Chinese nation that were once kept secret from the public

39
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,410
the Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party has started exactly the kind of movement that the CCP has feared for so long.

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,489
One in which the Chinese people are finally saying, "this Party sucks."

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,019
It's called Tuidang or withdraw from the Party. From an early age,

42
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:29,559
Chinese people are made to swear that they'll give their blood to the Party. Tuidang is when they get to say, "Stuff that."

43
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:35,649
It's been done by the likes of prominent human rights lawyers like Gao Zhisheng. And, boy, did the party strike back hard.

44
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:43,239
Gao who has also defended Falun Gong practitioners of third-rail issue in China has disappeared was brutally tortured,

45
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,380
reappeared just long enough to say he's giving up the fight before disappearing

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:54,579
once again. In the first year after the Nine Commentaries was published, 1 million people withdrew from the Party. That number today is over

47
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:01,119
a hundred and forty five million. Now, wait a minute, according to latest figure, there's only around 85 million members of the Chinese Communist Party

48
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
What's going on here?

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,369
Well, that's because basically the Tuidang movement isn't just about getting those eighty-five million to withdraw membership. Its goal is to get

50
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,509
1.3 billion Chinese people to sever their ties with the Communist Party

51
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,109
The party in China basically consists of three branches: the Young Pioneers, the Communist Youth League, and the Communist Party itself.

52
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,459
So from a young age children are made to swear those blood oaths to the Party.

53
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,399
So even if you never become an official member of the Party, you've been groomed your whole life to be a part of it.

54
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:37,299
But now, all over China ,messages to withdraw from the Party have been popping up. Now, that's a major embarrassment for the regime.

55
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,910
That's why the Nine Commentaries are banned. But here in Hong Kong and also elsewhere around the world

56
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,440
Mainland visitors are greeted by volunteers helping them withdraw from the Party

57
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,309
One of the reasons why Beijing has tried to wrestle for greater control in Hong Kong

58
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:58,510
The Tuidang movement is run by volunteers most of whom seem to be affiliated with the persecuted Falun Gong spiritual practice.

59
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,669
A person can give their real name or a pseudonym if they fear reprisal for their actions.

60
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,429
Boy, can there be reprisals. In 2005, dissident author Zhang Lin

61
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:14,169
from on Anhui Province was sentenced to five years in prison for so-called 'inciting subversion of state power' after he published articles online

62
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,250
praising the Nine Commentaries.

63
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,720
And so while using a pseudonym may sound like a cop-out, when you consider

64
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
the goal is to have the person making the decision

65
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,270
recognize in their heart why they want to do it, their name doesn't really matter that much.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,750
Of course the fact that over a hundred million Chinese people have renounced the Chinese government hasn't really made headlines in the West

67
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:38,079
So if one day you turn on the TV and everyone's reporting that the Chinese Communist Party's suddenly collapsed just like the Soviet Union

68
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,880
just remember, you heard it here first. I'm not Lenin you down. Pun number three!

69
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,570
Thanks for watching. Be sure to check the Facebook and Twitter page

70
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,309
And if you happen to be a member of the Communist Party, join the tens of millions of others and quit.

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm Chris Chappell. See you next time.
