1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,840
More buildings are collapsing.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:15,920
Dangerous construction is everywhere in China.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
This episode is sponsored by\h
Surfshark. You should be using\h\h

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,640
a VPN like Surfshark to protect\h
yourself whenever you go online.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
Nothing exemplifies the Chinese\h
dream like owning a home.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,200
And nothing exemplifies the Chinese reality\h
like having that home collapse on you.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
A week ago, a seven-story apartment building\h
collapsed here in China’s Hunan province.\h

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
Videos of the rubble have been circulating online.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,760
The collapse wasn’t caused by an earthquake.\h
It was the result of poor construction.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,320
In China, buildings are\h
built fast, but not to last.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
It’s what’s called “Tofu Dreg\h
Construction”—basically, when\h\h

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,320
so many corners are cut during the construction\h
process that buildings are unstable and unsafe.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
I talked about Tofu Dreg Construction\h
in an episode a few months ago\h\h

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,440
about exploding manhole covers...

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,480
and again in a recent episode\h
about giant sinkholes.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,640
I keep bringing it up because problems caused by\h
poor construction happen all the time in China.

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,480
And while it’s funny when you see\h
a KFC awning fall to the ground,

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
the truth is, it actually puts\h
a lot of Chinese people at risk.\h

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,800
Poor construction in China is a\h
byproduct of widespread corruption.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
We’ve seen this for a long time.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,920
In 2016, this building suddenly\h
fell over in Guangxi province.

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,440
But now, the Chinese Communist Party tells\h
people it’s cracking down on corruption.\h\h

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,720
They say Tofu Dreg Construction\h
is a thing of the past.\h\h

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,320
But like many things the Communist\h
Party says, that’s a lie.

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,240
The one that collapsed last\h
week was built only two\h\h

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,760
or three years ago. There were\h
ten families living there.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,600
Local Chinese news outlets seem to have quickly\h
deflected responsibility from authorities.\h\h

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,440
They didn’t disclose much information about the\h
building aside from calling it ‘self-built’.\h

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
It’s like the Communist Party’s motto: If you\h
want something done wrong, do it yourself.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I’m not actually sure what it means for a\h
seven-story apartment building to be “self-built.”\h\h

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
But regardless, the collapse was a tragedy.\h\h

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,880
Chinese state-run CGTN says\h
five people were killed...

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,120
...but with a propaganda emphasis on the\h
rescue: “Twelve people were trapped—seven\h\h

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
of which were pulled from the rubble and\h
are being treated at local hospitals.”

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,080
The same week, another building\h
collapsed—this one in Jilin Province

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
One person was reported to be trapped\h
in the rubble of an auto repair house\h\h

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,840
that suddenly collapsed during rainfall.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
And also in the same week, another\h
tragedy in Fujian province.

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,960
Nine people were killed and\h
seven others injured at a banquet\h\h

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,960
after a brick wall fell from the\h
roof of a residential building.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,960
On June 21 in Chongqing , 5 people were injured\h
in an elevator explosion. Videos were shared of\h\h

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,960
people trembling as they walked with their clothes\h
completely burnt and torn off of their bodies.\h\h

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
Is that security officer just\h
gonna stand there and watch?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
Problems like these are not only\h
caused by Tofu Dreg Construction.\h\h

46
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
Another factor is poor maintenance.\h
Inspectors can be bribed to\h\h

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,280
look the other way. A lot of Chinese citizens\h
don’t trust official safety certifications.

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,320
In Wuhan last month, flammable\h
gasses underground caused this.

49
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,160
And not too long after that, a\h
natural gas pipe exploded in Wuhan.\h\h

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,160
It injured more than 130 people,\h
and killed an estimated 25.

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,520
That explosion was too large of an incident\h
to be ignored by the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,840
So they started rolling out punishments\h
for anyone who could be deemed responsible.

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
“An initial investigation found the\h
company affiliated with China Gas,\h\h

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,000
a gas operator that provides natural gas\h
and liquefied petroleum gas to residents\h\h

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,080
and businesses, did not strictly perform\h
gas pipeline patrols and checks as required\h\h

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
and there were serious flaws in the\h
operation of related facilities.”

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,360
And so Chinese leader Xi\h
Jinping got directly involved\h\h

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
to stop this kind of thing from happening.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,960
“Xi Jinping instructed all localities\h
to investigate potential safety hazards,\h\h

60
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,920
maintain the overall stability of their society,\h\h

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,480
and ‘create a good atmosphere’ for the 100-year\h
anniversary of the Communist Party of China.”

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
In other words, local officials should\h
focus on making things look good,\h\h

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
and covering up any incidents.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
The Chinese Communist Party\h
has been hyping themselves\h\h

65
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
up for their big anniversary on July 1st.

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,120
As my favorite Chinese state-run media\h
The Global Times writes in English:\h\h

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,280
“A wide range of works including films, television\h
dramas, operas, documentaries and animated works\h\h

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,680
will be produced to celebrate mark\h
this important occasion time.”

69
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,800
You know, if they want to make their anniversary\h
look good, they should hire a proofreader.

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,880
But I hope everyone in China enjoys the pageantry.\h\h

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,200
They can even watch the fireworks from\h
the street—because their home collapsed.

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880

And in many cases, by the government.

76
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
And if you’re in an\h
authoritarian country like China,\h\h

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,280
this kind of tracking can put you at\h
