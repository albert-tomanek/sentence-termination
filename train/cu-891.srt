1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,940
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,800
When a giant Chinese corporation

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,980
goes bankrupt,

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,240
should the Chinese government bail it out,

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,660
or let it fail?

6
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,930
In the case of Anbang Insurance Group,

7
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,080
the decision was neither.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,080
No, the government has their own

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,680
unique solution.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,340
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,990
I’m Chris Chappell.

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,620
The Chinese Communist Party loves

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,619
to have its influence felt around the world.

14
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,580
That’s one reason why over the last few
years,

15
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,940
it’s been encouraging Chinese companies

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,930
to buy up assets overseas.

17
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,220
It’s even supported them with policies

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,820
like low interest rate loans

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,720
from Chinese state-owned banks.

20
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,030
For example,

21
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,200
the Chinese company Dalian Wanda

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,020
bought up AMC Theaters—

23
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,320
which owns about one third

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,070
of American movie screens.

25
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,520
Shuanghui International bought Smithfield
Foods—

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,720
so they can literally bring home the bacon.

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,340
And Anbang Insurance Group

28
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,040
has spent 10 billion dollars

29
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,070
buying up hotels and resorts—

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,559
including the Waldorf Astoria.

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,670
From which I have been banned for life.

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,460
But now Anbang Insurance Group

33
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,240
is facing a bit of a problem.

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,220
China Uncensored producer Matt Gnaizda reports.

35
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,000
Thanks, Chris.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,380
For more than a century,

37
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,030
the Waldorf Astoria was one of

38
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,180
America’s great hotels—

39
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,400
a host to US presidents,

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,830
world leaders...

41
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,030
and weird tea parties.

42
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,210
But now,

43
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,280
this proud testament

44
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,600
to American history,

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,220
hospitality, and sophistication...

46
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,890
is run by the Chinese government.

47
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,170
Here’s what happened:

48
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,570
In 2014, privately owned Chinese conglomerate

49
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,470
Anbang Insurance Group bought the Waldorf

50
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,659
for almost 2 billion dollars.

51
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,710
Anbang also bought billions more

52
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,900
in other American companies and hotel chains.

53
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,960
US investors were happy to work with Anbang.

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,810
Anbang was willing to pay big money—

55
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,899
and who doesn’t love getting big money?

56
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,610
In fact,

57
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,470
investors loved Anbang’s big money so much,

58
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,770
they were willing to overlook Anbang’s

59
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,569
other shady business operations.

60
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,780
But it turns out,

61
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,319
Anbang had pulled a Lehman Brothers of sorts.

62
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,319
That is,

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,549
they’re a hundred-billion-dollar company

64
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,529
that made risky, highly leveraged investments.

65
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,239
And they went into quite a bit of debt

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,389
as part of their spending spree.

67
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,900
What could go wrong?

68
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,980
Apparently, a lot.

69
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,159
In late February,

70
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,939
Chinese authorities prosecuted Anbang’s
CEO

71
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,980
for economic crimes.

72
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,230
And Chinese regulators took control of the
company.

73
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,580
It’s only for a year.

74
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,129
But it could be more than a year,

75
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:42,489
if they feel like it.

76
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,099
This government takeover is

77
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,620
a very different approach

78
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,090
than the US took with Lehman Brothers in 2008.

79
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,489
The US just let Lehman Brothers fail,

80
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,159
its poor employees turned out into the streets

81
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,139
with nothing but their $5,000 suits.

82
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,150
According to Bloomberg,

83
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,840
Anbang was doing something similar

84
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,959
to what went on during the 2008

85
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:04,419
subprime mortgage crisis in the US.

86
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:07,799
For example, thanks to some financial alchemy,

87
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:10,540
Anbang had been posting pretty good growth

88
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,709
in its life insurance business.

89
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,010
And when I say pretty good,

90
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,299
I mean that from 2010 to 2016,

91
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,549
Anbang’s annual life-insurance premium revenue

92
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,290
increased by 11 million percent.

93
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,760
If I had a nickel—

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,349
and grew it at 11 million percent—

95
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,400
I’d have enough to buy

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,680
one of those $5,000 suits.

97
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,629
Anyway, Anbang was taking

98
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,479
life insurance products,

99
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,680
repackaging them,

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,290
and selling them to investors—

101
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,080
with the promise of high interest rates.

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,430
And who doesn’t love earning high interest
rates?

103
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,430
Pretty soon,

104
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,430
life insurance made up

105
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,409
96 percent of Anbang’s revenue.

106
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,269
And it was using all that extra revenue

107
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,719
to buy up cool playthings—

108
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,379
like the Waldorf Astoria hotel.

109
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,209
But maybe that was a bad idea.

110
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,930
Because they almost collapsed—

111
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,459
and now the Chinese government has taken over.

112
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,859
Now as much as this sucks for Anbang—

113
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,449
and its CEO who’s going jail

114
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,569
for a long time—

115
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,969
there’s a bigger issue.

116
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,479
It shows that China’s government

117
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,859
is willing to use heavy-handed tactics

118
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:16,650
to take control of private companies.

119
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,720
An analyst from the Economist Intelligence
Unit

120
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,300
says it’s a warning shot to other companies

121
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,979
that are leveraging investor money

122
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:25,970
and complex financial products

123
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,260
to buy assets overseas.

124
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,820
Who will Chinese regulators go after next?

125
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,699
It could be conglomerates like HNA Group.

126
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,370
They own everything from real estate

127
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,610
to airline catering to luxury hotels.

128
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,949
It could be Dalian Wanda,

129
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,379
which owns movie theaters,

130
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,460
film studios, and luxury hotels.

131
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,830
Or it could be Fosun Group,

132
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,930
which owns Canada’s Cirque du Soleil,

133
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,680
a British soccer club,

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
and you guessed it,

135
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,379
luxury hotels.

136
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,710
So what do they all have in common?

137
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,590
Besides a weird fetish for luxury hotels?

138
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,189
Their CEOs are all being investigated

139
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,129
by Chinese authorities.

140
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,449
So the Anbang takeover

141
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,409
could be a message to Chinese companies

142
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,910
to clean up their financial transactions

143
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,030
that have gotten a little too,

144
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,610
shall we say, “creative”—

145
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,610
in the Lehman Brothers sense.

146
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,780
Or else we’ll arrest your CEO

147
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,129
and take over your company.

148
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,550
But this should also serve as a warning

149
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,840
to American investors:

150
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,960
When you do business with China,

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,879
things can get really complicated really fast.

152
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,910
One reason that Anbang made such a splash

153
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,860
when it first started investing overseas,

154
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,620
besides its seemingly endless billions of
dollars,

155
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,430
was its high-level political connections.

156
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,800
Back in 2016,

157
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,770
the Financial Times called Anbang

158
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,620
one of China’s most politically connected
companies.

159
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
Turns out,

160
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,840
that might have been part of the problem.

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,669
After the CEO was first taken into custody
last June,

162
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,360
the Epoch Times reported that he was

163
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,569
close to former leader Jiang Zemin’s faction,

164
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,490
and helped his cronies launder money.

165
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,930
And the New York Times found that

166
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,000
Anbang’s assets were mostly controlled

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,669
by a series of shell companies

168
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:07,710
owned by relatives of the CEO.

169
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,710
By the way,

170
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,210
that is not normal.

171
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,710
So to recap:

172
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,740
If you sell your company

173
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,490
to an opaque Chinese conglomerate

174
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,960
with deep pockets,

175
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,719
you might find that someday,

176
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,620
your company will be partly controlled

177
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,680
by the Chinese government.

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,530
Good thing Jared Kushner scrapped that deal

179
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,200
to sell his Fifth Avenue building to Anbang.

180
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,260
Back to you, Chris.

181
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,100
Thanks Matt.

182
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,439
Well, now that the Waldorf

183
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,800
is directly controlled by the Chinese government—

184
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,810
I doubt I’m going to get my

185
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,120
lifetime ban lifted anytime soon.

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,240
So what do you think of the Chinese

187
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,889
government takeover of Anbang?

188
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,830
