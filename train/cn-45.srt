1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,710
This is The Technical Difficulties,
we're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,900
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,880
Now then.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,580
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,540
It’s me!

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,720
AUDIENCE: Hurray!

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,519
Oh, I see, I see!

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,019
- You get the warm-up time.
- Wow.

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,380
Did you set up that up while we were outside
waiting for you?

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,660
Yes, I did.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,800
And standing in for Matt Gray, please welcome
stand-up mathematician, Matt Parker.

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,180
Pleasure to be your replace-Matt.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,920
In front of me I’ve got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can’t see it.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding,

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,930
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers which is...

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,660
What did you do?

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,600
Whacked my funny bone on my chair.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,420
- Oh!
- That is pretty funny.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,600
And today…!

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,060
That’s the right hand, he needs that one(!)

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,079
Come Matt, fill in for the classy panel show,
it'll be great(!)

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,240
And today we are talking about Turra Coo.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,980
I don’t know, Turrack who…?

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,760
Y'know, I figured out at least know what the
words you’re saying are.

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,660
Well, the language is Doric.

26
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,800
Okay, Aberdeen.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,400
Oh he’s right. Straight off.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,540
Oh, thank you.

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,770
Aberdeenshire, North East Scotland.

30
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,100
It’s a particular dialect.

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,870
Yes, you are absolutely right,
near the Aberdeenshire town of Turriff.

32
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,740
And Turra is Turriff.

33
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
Okay.

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,100
What might Coo be?

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,140
PIGEONS.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,710
Is it one of those cattle that's in fields?

37
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,220
- Oh yeah, Coo!
- A Highland Coo.

38
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,480
- He’s absolutely right.
- What?!

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,320
I just... how does... wow.

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,300
Right! Bye, everybody.

41
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,920
I’m just working out if they had a big enough
population for a hostile takeover.

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
That is incredible.

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,070
No, you’re absolutely right.

44
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,960
The Turra Coo is Doric for the Turriff cow.

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
Were you not expecting that to be
the right answer?

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,120
No! That was supposed to be a “joke”.

47
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,500
You were just making a cheap joke at the expense
of the Scots dialect.

48
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,220
- I was.
- You’re absolutely right.

49
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,220
I know somewhere between, like, a non-zero
amount of things about a lot of things

50
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,720
and a niche dairy cow…

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm like, okay, I’m out.

52
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,770
Mate, welcome to my world.

53
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,960
The cow became famous.

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,200
Britain’s Got Talent!

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
Did it juggle?

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,620
How, it’s got four legs and no arms?

57
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,140
It lies on its back and does that.

58
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,360
I was going to go,
it was sat on an office chair.

59
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,940
Or any other chair could do.

60
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,180
It just so happened its act
was on an office chair.

61
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,720
Well, that means you can
slide it onto the stage.

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Exactly.

63
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,580
'Cos it can’t propel itself because its
little legs are stuck out forwards.

64
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,520
Oh, you think I’m being ridiculous, but
actually I’ve just produced

65
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,440
a very good way of
transporting a cow sat down.

66
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,720
At last(!)

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,080
I like the idea that there would be notation
for a cow juggling with four limbs.

68
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
There would.

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
I’m sure you could.

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,480
Well somebody’s written the patterns
’cos it…

71
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,520
“Boring juggler information!”

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,220
Brace yourselves, here it comes.

73
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,960
Well, that’s how Gandini patterns work.

74
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,430
That’s effectively one...

75
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,069
There’s two people using four arms to juggle
one pattern.

76
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,700
And the siteswap notation,
they mathematically predicted

77
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,690
new juggling tricks that had never been
juggled before

78
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,360
because the maths worked out and then
they're like, “oh it worked, my goodness!”

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,790
And so, mathematically you can
predict ways to juggle

80
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,000
without ever having to bother to learn or
pick the balls up, it’s great(!)

81
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,400
Biscuit that man.

82
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,860
So, Turra Coo...!

83
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,870
Yeah.

84
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,959
The juggling cow of Britain’s Got Talent,
we’ve already established this.

85
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,700
This was definitely before
Britain’s Got Talent. It is...

86
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,780
Oh, X Factor.

87
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,900
PT Barnum.

88
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,700
Pop Idol.

89
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,930
Opportunity Knocks for the students in the
audience, yeah.

90
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,210
You’re certainly closer, this was Aberdeenshire.

91
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,340
This was under a Liberal government,
and liberal with a capital L there.

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,760
Okay, so that is pre-David Lloyd George, probably,

93
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,250
are we talking Liberal Whig territory here?

94
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,280
It was actually, I’m going to give you the
point because you gave the name.

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
David Lloyd George.

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,020
It was David Lloyd George as
Chancellor of the Exchequer.

97
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,120
Oh my God, that’s... 1911!

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,540
Yeah, you’re absolutely right,
have a point again.

99
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,480
I have it down here as the 1910s, but that’s…

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,040
Specific referencing(!)

101
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,380
What did he bring in?

102
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,160
Er. Finance and Valuation Act.

103
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,620
Erm, pensions.

104
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,550
And Unemployment Benefit.

105
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,560
The Parliament Act.

106
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,959
Have I missed them all?

107
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,709
The first cow that could retire
with a safe pension(!)

108
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,840
I’m going to give Gary the point.

109
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,139
It was National Insurance contributions.

110
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,240
What, for cows?

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,340
Yeah!

112
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,560
Er, no, it w...

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
Three squirts for you, one for the taxman.

114
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,120
For all workers between 16 and 70.

115
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,969
So it was the National Insurance Act.

116
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:34,969
Yes, okay.

117
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:38,310
And the farmers local to Turriff were not
happy about this.

118
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,059
Because they would have pay their employees
National Insurance stamps.

119
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,259
The contributions were too high,
yes, absolutely right.

120
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,680
And it was unfair for them to pay for something
they were unlikely to use.

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Unlikely?

122
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,389
They’re very likely, they’re all going
to get to…

123
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,140
Well, they might not get to pensionable age
actually.

124
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,400
No, Coo-beasties kill 'em.

125
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
Immortal dairy workers.

126
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,560
Less in mortal peril than some other people
in that era.

127
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,720
Who might have been more at risk?

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
At risk?

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,840
People working in the dairy mines.

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah, the big cream seams,
they took a lot of lives.

131
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,680
Yes, rich seam of...

132
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,640
Rich seam of squirty that comes out.

133
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,039
More they're drilling, and it's like:
“we’ve struck cream!”

134
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,480
“We’ve got a gusher!”

135
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,009
Face is white, takes the glasses off.

136
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,300
“Oh, we’re safe now.”

137
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,210
The thing is, apart from the word dairy in
there you’re absolutely right,

138
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,210
so I’m giving you the point.

139
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,300
It was people that would work in the mines
and in industry.

140
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,760
So there were protests, and what did one particular
farmer refuse to do?

141
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,200
And no doubt it involves this cow.

142
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,280
No, not yet. The cow has not yet got involved.

143
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,740
It will later involve this cow.

144
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,100
It will later involve this cow, but I’m
not giving you a point for that ’cos that’s

145
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,300
bloody obvious.

146
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,180
Did they march somewhere?

147
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,900
That was happening, but we’re looking at
what one specific person was doing,

148
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:52,060
as civil disobedience.

149
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,460
And it can’t just be… he wasn’t just
refusing to make the payments,

150
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,240
so it must be something creative.

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,920
It was stamping the insurance cards.

152
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,440
It was doing the paperwork
required for that time.

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,700
That maybe the most boring answer
to a quiz question.

154
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,550
I realise that but we need
to get through this.

155
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,979
That’s how we resist in this country.

156
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,520
Stuck his quill in the farmyard,
and wrote it on with that.

157
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Oh...

158
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Was it a poo-related protest,
are we headed there?

159
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,139
No it wasn’t, it was literally he just refused
to do this,

160
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:25,219
so he was charged, he was sentenced to pay
£15 plus the arrears which, in…

161
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,840
That’s not a small amount of money,

162
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,740
that’s probably a couple of hundred quid
actually in today’s terms, I would have thought.

163
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,560
Did the debt collector take his cow?

164
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,760
Ah!

165
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,680
Sheriff’s Officer George Keith turned up,
as a bailiff essentially,

166
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:43,360
and looked around for property that could
be seized.

167
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,640
And went, “this cow’s in a chair already”.

168
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,939
“I can just wheel it
straight out of the farmyard.”

169
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,620
In the barn, juggling,
it’s dead easy to see, yeah.

170
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,860
That cow’s worth a lot.
Future earnings alone…

171
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,259
This is getting a bit Jack-and-the-Beanstalk
so far, I’m going to be honest.

172
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,720
It is a bit, the Sheriff seized the cow.

173
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Okay.

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,039
The trouble is:
now the government owns a cow.

175
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
Wait, we’ve got the National Cow!

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,500
It was set to be sold.

177
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,580
Yes.

178
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,249
What’s the slight problem with that?

179
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:12,779
Oh, no bugger'd buy it!

180
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,779
Absolutely right.

181
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,779
Oh boy.

182
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,520
Not only that. No local mart, no local
agricultural mart, would handle the sale.

183
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,020
So now the government still has a cow.

184
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,380
Who is no doubt hungry…

185
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,960
Can I just ask,
is it a boy cow or a girl cow?

186
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,319
- It’s a girl cow.
- Okay, thank you.

187
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,520
I believe there’s technically
a term for that.

188
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Yes, it’s "cow".

189
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,100
I only know that because I’ve made that
same mistake myself.

190
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,120
The citizens found the cow
tied in the village square

191
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,180
and decorated with a slogan,
“Lendrum to Leeks.”

192
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:00,740
Lendrum is where they were.

193
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,000
Why that might
have been the slogan?

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,270
It’s making a reference to someone.

195
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,270
To Lloyd George?

196
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,270
Why would that be?

197
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,270
Oh, he’s Welsh.

198
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,289
There’s the point, yes.

199
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,289
Yes, yes, yes.

200
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,259
That’s a nice bit of stereotyping I just
sauntered into there, isn’t it?

201
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,420
Well, this was being done by the Sheriff,
as the victor.

202
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,550
This is: we have taken your cow,
we are tying it in the square,

203
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,069
we can’t sell it
but it’s not your cow anymore.

204
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:28,100
What was the response to this?

205
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,320
Barbecue!

206
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,830
No, they liked the cow,
they wanted to keep the cow.

207
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,620
You can like it, and it be delicious.

208
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,980
Fair point.

209
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,640
Those are not even close
to being mutually exclusive.

210
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,659
They brought in loads of other identical cows.

211
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,349
They're like, “you’ll never tell which
one it is now!”

212
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:43,349
Oh, that’s cunning.

213
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,079
And painted them one, three, and four, so
everyone looked for number two.

214
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,100
Did they put giant hats over them and do like
a three-cow Monte?

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,940
Get-- mmf-- in---!

216
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,690
Which one is the cow in?

217
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,279
Well, like, it’s not a difficult…

218
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,029
“Under one of these cups...”

219
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,880
One of them is about six-foot off the ground.

220
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,480
And it's walking that way…

221
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,720
I’m going to Vegas and doing that,
I’ll make my fortune, I know I will.

222
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,460
There was a near-riot, is the answer.

223
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,720
There was a 100-strong mob pelting the 
Sheriff’s officers with rotten fruit and soot.

224
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,810
We don’t do that these days, do we?

225
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,899
We don’t get riled up over minor issues
to the same extent.

226
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,480
It’s also very hard to get soot and
fresh vegetables these days.

227
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,040
That’s a fact, you’re not going to pay through
the nose at Waitrose for those, are you,

228
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,300
if you’re just going to lob them at someone?

229
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,440
You know, the best you can do is, like,
Amazon one hour delivery,

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,060
and even then the Sheriff’s probably
cottoned on and legged it.

231
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,140
There’s an outlet for them, Amazon Protest!

232
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,580
They can supply you with…

233
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,600
Brilliant! Anything that goes out of date.

234
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,640
Send it for flinging!

235
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,440
Bags of soot…

236
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,120
And it could be good because
instead of a real brick,

237
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,710
they could send you one of those rubber ones,

238
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,410
so you make the same point
but no one gets hurt.

239
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,500
But you can still do the same thing,
you put someone else’s address in,

240
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,940
and under delivery instructions say
“please throw through window”.

241
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,660
Oh, yes!

242
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,600
I can’t help but feel this is drifting towards
Amazon drones, to a drone-strike joke.

243
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,520
A drone general strike!

244
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,540
Like three people got that Gary, and that
was a really good gag.

245
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,940
It’s a constituency, thank you.

246
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,140
You can do that. You can send people bees,
can’t you, in the post?

247
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,240
You can send ants, definitely.

248
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
I mean, I’ve heard.

249
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,940
I’m not opening that package now, man.

250
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,040
- And ladybirds.
- Instructions:

251
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,560
“If I’m not home, through the letterbox,
one at a time, please.”

252
00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:32,970
In individual packaging.

253
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,710
Well, once you’ve sent the first one through
the others will probably follow it.

254
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,329
Well, Lloyd George was subject to a lot of
protests anyway, it won’t be over this.

255
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,100
I think it’s over women’s suffrage, but they 
planted a bomb outside his house at one point.

256
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,000
And my favourite one is they cut his braces.

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,580
A lady came up behind, snapped his braces
and his trousers fell down.

258
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,240
For the non-UK audience, that’s like suspenders,
the things that hold your trousers up.

259
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,610
It's not like the things on his teeth.

260
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,060
Get someone with wire cutters, “pa-twing”!

261
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,080
Oh no, snaggle-toothed again!

262
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,449
And for someone in the UK, Lloyd George had
enough scandal around him not to say 'suspenders'.

263
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,040
Yes, that’s true.

264
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,649
So amidst the melee, there is a cow…

265
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:12,690
Love it.

266
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,250
That’s probably winning.

267
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,000
...with a slogan painted on the side.

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,150
There are the Sheriff’s officers and now
an angry, rioting mob.

269
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,150
What happens during this?

270
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,820
I’m reckoning the cow is used in some way
as part of the mob,

271
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,880
maybe to head it off, or a battering ram.

272
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,100
Oh, that would be a sheep though.

273
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,560
No, the cow escapes.

274
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,480
- Yay!
- Oh, fantastic.

275
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,860
The cow makes a bid for freedom, and is…

276
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,870
This is what they want.

277
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,160
It’s just gone from that edge of
organised protest to Benny Hill.

278
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,740
Yes!

279
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,860
The cow was later found in a nearby barn.

280
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,610
Eight farm workers were put on trial in Aberdeen
for disorderly conduct.

281
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,610
Nice charge.

282
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,879
All the people put on trial were acquitted,
why?

283
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,620
What was the verdict they were given?

284
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,500
“Ultimate LOLs”.

285
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,649
That is not a valid Scots verdict.

286
00:11:58,649 --> 00:11:59,880
But something else is.

287
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,080
“Top bants”?

288
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,800
There is a verdict in Scotland that there
is not in England and Wales.

289
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,459
It must be some kind of... you’re allowed
to protest provided you use enough soot?

290
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,220
No, we’re talking verdict here.

291
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,879
There is guilty, there is not guilty,

292
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,602
and there is something else in Scotland.

293
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,779
Is there not proven, or something like that?

294
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,939
Yes, you’re absolutely right.

295
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:22,740
Scots Law has a verdict of not proven.

296
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,830
Which is that kind of:
“We know you done it really.”

297
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,350
“We’re not saying you didn’t do it,
but you did it well.”

298
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,759
The prosecution have not proved their case
beyond reasonable doubt, is “not proven”.

299
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,420
There was that one hold-out guy that was actually...

300
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,040
a cow.

301
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,120
I suspect in this instance
it’s just nobody'd testify.

302
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,380
You’re absolutely right, you’re absolutely
right and that’s one of the reasons why.

303
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,029
If the evidence is not sufficient,
but it’s circumstantial…

304
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,160
- Are you okay there?
- Oh, god.

305
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,540
We’ve lost Gary, we’ve lost him.

306
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,520
It’s going to be interesting to see
what this is about,

307
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,129
because it doesn’t really follow from what’s
just been said.

308
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,689
It’s something so incredibly funny
but grossly inappropriate.

309
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,379
I was going to say,
whenever you’re ready, fella.

310
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,250
No, no, it’s not, it’s just like, no,
no, no,

311
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,910
It's the thought of, they’re going into
the court room and the prosecution going in.

312
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,410
“We’ve got them, we’ve nailed them,
we’ve got a good body of evidence.”

313
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,290
“All rise for his Honour…”

314
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,800
The sound of four hooves coming in.

315
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,420
“Forget it!”

316
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,700
So the cow was eventually taken to Aberdeen,
it was sold for £7.

317
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,360
The government, how did they do
out of that deal?

318
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,230
Oh, are they massively out of pocket on the
rail fares?

319
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,180
Yeah, you have to book two seats and…

320
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
Yeah, yeah…

321
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,089
I was just thinking, you didn’t factor in
because this is,

322
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,600
it’s not just a cow, it’s a famous cow.

323
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,050
That must push the value up a little bit.

324
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,480
It can juggle, it’s passed the Bar
and become a judge so…

325
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,660
It’s diversified its skillset.

326
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,490
Yes, you need some little cows as bodyguards
obviously.

327
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,329
Yeah, little things in their ears, dark glasses,
all that kind of shizz.

328
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,151
So the entourage alone, getting it down to
the market and that…

329
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,480
The expenses that you incurred
are outrageous really.

330
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,269
The high-class grass she got shipped in.

331
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:57,240
Yes, you’re absolutely right, the Sheriff’s
department took a loss on the whole thing.

332
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,960
What then happened?

333
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,420
’Cos this cow is in Aberdeen

334
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,810
and it’s not been slaughtered
for anything yet.

335
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,910
Got on the wrong train, ended up in Sheffield.

336
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,610
Why is this cow on a train?

337
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,970
Because that’s how you’d probably transport
a cow at that time.

338
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,009
There’s a full circle to this story.

339
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:13,420
Did it become a cow again?

340
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,700
It was never not a cow, Gary.

341
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,960
It was a judge for a bit!

342
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,250
That doesn’t mean it can’t still be…

343
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,600
For God’s…

344
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,080
I mean you put a wig on it, who’s to say
what animal it is?

345
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,839
That’s my defence and I’m sticking to it,
it’s not proven.

346
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,020
Not proven because we couldn’t see its scalp.

347
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,160
Exactly.

348
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,660
The farmer’s friend bought it back and gave
it to him as a gift.

349
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,940
Yes. You are absolutely right.

350
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,220
Oh, that’s nice.

351
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,180
It was…

352
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,980
Good, ’cos I had a list of about ten different
permutations I was going to go through.

353
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,360
Yes, it’s close enough.

354
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,230
Bryony Miller, local girl and
wife of the farm hand

355
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,430
rallied the local community together,
bought back the cow

356
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,139
and presented it back as a major public event.

357
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:00,459
Was it in a box?

358
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:02,360
Did it have a bow around it?

359
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,840
Paraded with garlands and ribbons and flowers.

360
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,920
Eyy!

361
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,480
And painted with the slogan, “free...”

362
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,129
I’m going to translate this from the Scots,
because I can’t do the accent,

363
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:15,759
“Don’t you wish you were me?”

364
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,759
Aww.

365
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,940
Yeah, I’m a juggling cow
that’s been a judge.

366
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,759
I’ve had a hell of a life.

367
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,310
How are they doing all these messages?

368
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,240
I mean does paint rub off cows?

369
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,639
Well, I’m from an urban environment,
I’ve never painted one!

370
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,000
Chalk, yeah, but…

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,020
Do we have any one in the audience who has
ever painted a cow?

372
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:34,589
Or knows someone who might later.

373
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:35,589
That is, like...

374
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,480
I was really worried for a minute
there was…

375
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,880
This is the most middle version of cow-tipping
I’ve heard of in my life.

376
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,699
To be fair, he dropped Waitrose
into the conversation earlier.

377
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,220
Like you’ve, you’ve gone up…

378
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,460
Only because I’ve been to one earlier to
buy your biscuits.

379
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:49,500
And his banana.

380
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:52,209
And my croissant, but that’s different.

381
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,639
He says, “Do you want
anything from the shop?”

382
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,069
I’m like, “Yeah, we need some biscuits.”

383
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:57,790
He’s like, “Yes, get me a banana.”

384
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,790
“Banana!”

385
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,790
Yes actually he just said…

386
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,790
Banana, repeatedly.

387
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,959
And then he comes in and he’s got a croissant.

388
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,579
Don’t get me about middle class.

389
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,740
Didn’t have almond in it.

390
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,260
“Almond? Luxury!”

391
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,639
What happened to the cow?

392
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,320
There’s got to be, like, if you want to
visit the cow now, its skeleton is in the…

393
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,430
Is in a corner of the farmland, yes.

394
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,750
It was treated well for the remaining years.

395
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,070
It was not sent to market after all and eventually
died a natural death

396
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,529
and was buried in the corner of the farm.

397
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:29,309
And you can still pilgrimage to the corner
of the farm?

398
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:33,040
No, but you can go to a roadside monument
in Lendrum.

399
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Ah.

400
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
That’s good.

401
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
I thought you were going to say no,

402
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,900
but you can stop on the outside lane of the
A363 or something like that.

403
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,960
A bit of light trespassing later.

404
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,620
Is there a ghost of the cow by the layby?

405
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,850
I'd like to think there is.

406
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,589
I like the idea that’s just a layby ghost,
because that’s a pretty crap ghost.

407
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,249
’Cos you park in a layby in the middle of
the night, you hear a mooing,

408
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:53,569
“oh there’s a cow nearby.”

409
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:55,980
Yes, but it’s a juggling cow ghost!

410
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,040
How would you know you’ve
not seen the ghost of a cow?

411
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Deep.

412
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,880
And on that note, congratulations Gary,
you win this week’s show.

413
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,020
You win a tool for combing through ponds to
find male ducks,

414
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,180
signed by a Canadian rapper.

415
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,100
It’s a Drake Lake Drake Rake.

416
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,740
Sorry, it looks like Drake’s signature is
actually a forgery there,

417
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,380
so it’s a fake Drake Lake Drake Rake.

418
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,940
You are the f***ing worst.

419
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,110
Do enjoy that, and on that we say
thank you to Chris Joel.

420
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,140
“It’s over! It’s over!”

421
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,420
To Gary Brannan.

422
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,340
And to Matt Parker.

423
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,260
I’ve been Tom Scott
and we’ll see you next time.
