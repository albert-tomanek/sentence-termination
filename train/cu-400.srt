1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,680
The Philippine foreign minister curses out China

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,600
The EU suspends its big China investment deal

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
And why Chinese clergy love the motherland

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,920
Thad more on this week’s China news headlines

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,560
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris\h
Chappell. This week’s China news headlines.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,520
The Philippines is getting pretty fed\h
up with the Chinese Communist Party\h\h

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,160
constantly encroaching on its territorial waters.\h\h

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,640
And some Filipino officials are expressing\h
it in some pretty colorful ways.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
Chinese ships have been mooring\h
in disputed territorial waters.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,880
And here’s a tweet from the\h
Philippine Foreign Minister,\h\h

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,560
Teodoro “Teddy Boy” Locsinresponding to that.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,680
China, my friend, how politely can I put it?\h
Let me see… O…GET THE FUCK OUT. What are you\h\h

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,480
doing to our friendship? You. Not us. We’re\h
trying. You. You’re like an ugly oaf forcing\h\h

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,520
your attentions on a handsome guy who wants to\h
be a friend; not to father a Chinese province …

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
I think Teddy Boy here might\h
be my favorite politician now.\h

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,800
Imagine if all officials talked to\h
the Chinese Communist Party like that.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Hey you ugly oaf, we’re going to circle back\h
and kick your butts out of the South China Sea!\h

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,920
China responded to Locsin’s tweet\h
by calling for basic manners.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
Yes, the country that uses\h
gang rape as a form of torture\h\h

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
is lecutring the Philippines about manners.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,320
Anyway, Locsin has since apologized\h
to China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi.

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
While also bragging about being the original\h\h

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Wolf Warrior diplomat. He\h
sounds like an interesting guy.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Meanwhile, President Duterte’s spokesperson\h
reminded Philippine officials that profanity\h\h

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,640
has no place in diplomacy.
Duterte added, “I am the only one who can curse.”

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,240
And for clarity, that’s not a joke,\h
that’s what Duterte actually said.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,120
Talk about rules for thee, not for me.\h

28
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,000
But in a move that could be even\h
more explosive than a Twitter fight,\h\h

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,680
the Philippines has also rejected a fishing\h
ban put in place by the Chinese Coast Guard,\h\h

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,960
saying that Filipino fishing boats should\h
keep on fishing in their territorial waters.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,080
The Phillipine Coast Guard is\h
also continuing to challenge\h\h

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Chinese maritime militia\h
vessels in the South China Sea.

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
I’m just waiting for Chinese officials to tell the\h\h

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,640
Philippine Coast Guard to\h
mind their basic manners.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,720
Speaking of manners, China’s Political\h
and Legal Affairs Commission—one of the\h\h

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,720
top Party organizations—posted this to their\h
Weibo account, China’s version of Twitter.\h\h

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,680
The text says “China lighting a fire\h
versus India lighting a fire.” It compares\h\h

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,520
China’s space launch, to India burning\h
bodies of people that died from Covid-19.

39
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,400
Now obviously, this lack of sensitivity\h
upset like a BILLION PEOPLE.

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,120
And then Chinese authorities deleted\h
the post amid a huge backlash.

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
Even the editor in chief of my favorite Chinese\h
state-run media, The Global Times, said China’s\h\h

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,560
official social media accounts should “hold\h
high the banner of humanitarianism at this time,\h\h

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,320
show sympathy for India, and firmly place\h
Chinese society on a moral high ground.”

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,720
When even the Global Times says a meme was\h
too nationalistic, you know it went too far.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,720
But I don’t think the Global Times or the Chinese\h
Communist Party are upset about being insensitive.\h\h

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,720
They’re upset because they overplayed their\h
hand, at a time when they’re trying to woo\h\h

47
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,080
India by being really helpful during\h
their current coronavirus crisis.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,760
It’s more than just vaccine diplomacy.\h
It’s oxygen concentrator diplomacy.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,520
All this is happening at a time when India is\h
trying to ally with the West to counter China.

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,400
You know, because China keeps trying\h
to take Indian border territory.

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,840
And spy on India through mobile apps.

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,200
And because China covered\h
up the deadly coronavirus,\h\h

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,720
which is why it spread to India, which is\h
why India has to cremate so many bodies!

54
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
And more fun China news,\h
coming up after the break.

55
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Welcome back.

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,840
You may have heard of Cuban refugees,\h
risking their lives to flee to America.\h

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,600
But now a Chinese man, seeking ‘freedom and\h
equality’ says he traveled to Taiwan in a dinghy.

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,680
It took him 10 hours to make the 100-plus\h
mile journey across the Taiwan Strait\h\h

59
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
in a small rubber boat,\h
powered by an outboard motor.

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,200
Taiwan police arrested him at the port\h
of Taichung. When they asked if his\h\h

61
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:10,160
life was bad in mainland China, “Zhou said he\h
believed life in China ‘is all kinds of bad.’”

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
Well, he’s not wrong.

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,920
It’s looking like the EU has effectively suspended\h
its proposed mega investment deal with China.

64
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,160
The deal is not officially dead, but an\h
official from the European Commission\h\h

65
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
said that they’ve basically\h
stopped pushing for it.

66
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
It’s going to be hard to get the\h
European parliament to vote in favor\h\h

67
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,640
of an investment deal with China, when China is\h
sanctioning members of the European parliament.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,520
That investment deal was signed at the\h
end of December, spearheaded by Germany.\h\h

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,640
Got to get those German\h
cars into the China market!

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
But then in March, the EU sanctioned\h
Chinese officials for the genocide\h\h

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,800
of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang. China\h
responded by sanctioning EU officials,\h\h

72
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,440
and now things are just kind of a\h
mess. Who could have predicted that?

73
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
The EU has also laid out new rules on foreign\h\h

74
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,200
investment that will make\h
things tougher for China.

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,400
If approved, the rules would give EU\h
antitrust authorities a lot of power\h\h

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,280
to block investments from Chinese companies.\h\h

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,760
The Chinese regime has used business investments\h
as a way to infiltrate and undermine the EU.

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,000
“The new regulation would help address rising\h
European concerns that Chinese businesses,\h\h

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,040
bolstered by state support, are\h
competing unfairly around the world,\h\h

80
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,280
making rock-bottom bids at public tenders and\h
offering unbeatable premiums for acquisitions.”

81
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Of course the rules aren’t targeting\h
China. No, they’re just about\h\h

82
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,040
foreign investment. From no country in particular.

83
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,960
Now I don’t often do this on the show, but\h\h

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,320
I want to talk to you about Jesus.\h
Jesus told us to love thy neighbor.

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,240
And as an extension of that, new\h
rules for religious clergy in China\h\h

86
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
dictate that clergy should “love the motherland.”

87
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,120
Clergy should also “support the leadership\h
of the Chinese Communist Party,”\h\h

88
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,440
and “practice the core socialist values.”

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,600
It’s in the Bible. Somewhere.\h
I think it’s in Corinthians\h\h

90
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,280
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Now for some reason, these new regulations\h\h

91
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
have some asking if Christians\h
are next in line for reeducation.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,040
“Authorities in China are detaining Christians in\h\h

93
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,400
secretive, mobile ‘transformation’ facilities\h
to make them renounce their faith.”

94
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,360
There’s also reports of a crackdown\h
on Christians using social media.

95
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,040
But the Chinese Communist Party may reap\h
what it sows. Retribution may be coming.\h\h

96
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Chinese state run media are warning\h
about the risks of rising sea levels...

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
If that happens, they’re going to need\h
someone to part the waters—and he’ll\h\h

98
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,480
demand that China let their people go.\h

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,640
And that my friends is the kind of humor 7\h
years of Catholic school education will get you!

100
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,920
Here’s another joke for you.

101
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,480
In the two years since China\h
arbitrarily kidnapped two Canadians,\h\h

102
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,920
the Canadian government has ok’d nearly 6\h
million dollars in contracts with China.

103
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,080
That’s on top of over 2\h
million dollars in direct aid.

104
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,200
And yet, despite the Canadian government\h
piling on this kind of immense pressure,\h\h

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
China still hasn’t released the two Michaels.

106
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,080
That’s the joke.

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,240
Meanwhile in the US, Chinese companies\h
are having record breaking IPOs.

108
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,960
Yet another way in which Americans are\h
investing in China...even if they don’t want to.

109
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,840
And US defense contractor Honeywell has been fined\h\h

110
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,680
13 million dollars for sharing\h
military secrets with China.

111
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,440
But don’t worry, because the G7 just met\h
and they have a message for China—the\h\h

112
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
West ain’t over just yet!

113
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,040
Yes, truly the West is putting up a strong\h
united front against the Chinese Communist Party.

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,280
By the way, New Zealand has decided not to\h
call China’s treatment of Uyghurs a genocide.

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,880
And coming up after the break, who’s\h
a bigger threat: China or America?\h\h

116
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,280
The answer may surprise you.

117
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
Welcome back.

118
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,400
In a new global poll from the Alliance of\h
Democracies Foundation, looking at 50,000\h\h

119
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:42,480
people in 53 countries, the US is seen as a\h
bigger threat to democracy than Russia or China.

120
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,840
That’s right, the US has a lot of problems.

121
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,240
And why should we criticize China\h
when we have our own issues?

122
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,520
What about how the US treats\h
its ethnic minorities?

123
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,080
Isn’t it really the US that’s\h
undermining democracy around the world?\h

124
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,480
Why do so many people think the US is a\h
bigger threat to democracy than China—a\h\h

125
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,760
country where dissidents are put in labor camps\h
and people are tortured for their beliefs?

126
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,760
I don’t know. But for a long time, the\h
Communist Party has been pushing this logic:\h\h

127
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,480
that no one is allowed to criticize China, unless\h
that person himself is perfect. And no one is\h\h

128
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,560
perfect. Except maybe Jesus, but he’d be in a\h
Chinese labor camp. So no one could hear him!

129
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
And now it’s time to answer a question from a\h
member of the China Uncensored 50 Cent Army,\h\h

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
fans who support us and our\h
efforts to expose the truth\h\h

131
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
about the Chinese Communist Party on\h
the crowd funding website Patreon.

132
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,840
Banana Pancakes asks, “When\h
do we cancel China instead?”

133
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,640
Ah, that’s in response to our episode about\h
the Oscar winning Chinese director Chloe Zhao\h\h

134
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
getting censored in China.

135
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,480
Banana Pancakes, that’s actually a really\h
good question. When do we cancel China? I\h\h

136
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,760
would say cancel the Chinese Communist Party for\h
clarity. But that’s exactly what needs to happen.\h\h

137
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,640
The Chinese regime is propped up by the West.\h
People around the world need to be very clear\h\h

138
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,040
on what the Chinese Communist Party is—a country\h
that using gang rape as a form of torture.\h\h

139
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,320
That’s not a regime you should do business\h
with. It’s not a regime that you should\h\h

140
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,760
cooperate with on climate change. It’s a pariah\h
that you ought to shun at every opportunity.

141
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,160
It’s North Korea with better\h
PR. And a lot more money.

142
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,080
That they made from the West.

143
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,920
Try not to buy things made in China. It’s hard,\h
but try to make sure you aren’t invested in the\h\h

144
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Chinese market. Don’t support companies that turn\h
a blind eye to human rights abuses in China. Tell\h\h

145
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,280
your elected representatives to do the same. When\h
do we cancel the Chinese Communist Party? Today.

146
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,360
So how do you get the word out? Well this\h
is something I’ve been thinking about.\h\h

147
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,080
Sharing these episodes is a great start.\h
But I was considering making, for example,\h\h

148
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,440
PowerPoint presentations about the Chinese\h
Communist Party, their human rights atrocities,\h\h

149
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,520
and the threat to global freedom and democracy. I\h
was thinking I could make these available to you,\h\h

150
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,480
and you could use them to help educate your\h
schools, business, rotary clubs, what have you.\h\h

151
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,240
But, is that something you would be interested\h
in? Let me know in the comments below.

152
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,200
Thanks for your question Banana\h

without you. So thank you for joining us in the\h
fight to expose the Chinese Communist Party to\h\h
