1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,460
If you've never watched this before, you're in for a treat(!)

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,889
Every season we get new people.

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,700
You... oh my god, the s*** you're about to
endure, let's face it!

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,929
Go back to the start, make your decision from
there!

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,640
No, go back to like season 3. We hit our stride
about then, I think.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,100
Oh, thanks for dissing our early work, you
****!

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,220
I sat in a small room just outside... where
was it, not Carlisle...

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,680
Wrexham!

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,240
- Wrexham!
- Not Carlisle?!

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,560
There's 100 miles in it!

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,300
Is this because it's all top left?

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,670
F***ing hell, in cosmic terms
that's spot on!

13
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,460
Don't get all Carl Sagan on my arse!

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,980
'Carl Sagan's Carlisle'!

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,620
If you're getting a cheap day return it's
not exactly...

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,530
"Oh, in a cosmic sense it's the same..."

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,250
You try telling that to the person manning
the exit barriers at Carlisle Station!

18
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,260
I think you'll find that's why I lost my job
as a f***ing Uber driver.

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,700
Carl Sagan's Carlisle: "you find me here in
the lovely town on the borders of Scotland".

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,290
"I should be 100 miles further south..."

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,530
Where Carl Sagan from?!

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,630
- Carlisle!
- Canada!

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,180
Gentlemen, we have peaked too soon.

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,650
- Tell me about it.
- Speak for yourselves.

25
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,460
"Speak for yourself, ducky."

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,220
Do you want to explain the rules?

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,310
Nah, f*** it.

28
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,030
It's like all the others!

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,280
Today's...
