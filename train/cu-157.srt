00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,000
On this episode of China Uncensored, no, you
can't play with LEGOs!

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,840
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your
host Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,860
So, you know what's hard about growing up?

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:19,880
Finding out that your beloved childhood icons
aren't what you imagined.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,970
For example, I used to be a Hulkamaniac.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,289
And who didn't love the Cosby Show?

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:32,829
But now, has the last plastic-bricked bastion
of my childhood been knocked down?

8
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:38,690
Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has slammed LEGO
for refusing to supply him with a bulk order

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,579
he wanted

10
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:45,269
for an upcoming exhibition on free speech
at Australia's National Gallery of Victoria.

11
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,469
And I know from personal experience, if you
slam LEGOs,

12
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,530
they really get stuck together and just impossible
to separate.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,329
Ai Weiwei is well known for criticizing Chinese
censorship through his art.

14
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,300
And now he is accusing LEGO of censoring him
because of alleged pressure from the Chinese

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,439
regime.

16
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,320
So Ai Weiwei handled the rejection in the
mature, adult manner that one would expect

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,850
from the eccentric artist.

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,100
But does Ai Weiwei have enough of a case to
build on?

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,320
A LEGO spokesman defended their decision by
saying they never supply bulk orders for projects

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,140
with a political context.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,450
Yes, LEGO stays away from politics.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,930
That's why for LEGO's 50th anniversary in
2008,

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,340
when they had their ad agency create a series
of ads called "Making History,"

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,369
they picked only nonpolitical topics.

25
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:40,140
Like the Muhammad Ali fight. Or...

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,159
Wait, is that the fall of the Berlin Wall?

27
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,100
Well, I'm sure Chinese politics would be off
limits...

28
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,799
Oh.

29
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,270
Maybe it's just bulk orders.

30
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,109
Except that in preparation for Ai Weiwei's
2014 art exhibit on Alcatraz,

31
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,719
the group he worked with told LEGO from the
beginning that they were

32
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,969
"seeking LEGO bricks for a project... exploring
freedom of expression."

33
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,660
And then LEGO did sell to them in bulk.

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,560
That exhibition featured 176 prisoners of
conscience,

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,730
including many from China.

36
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,050
So come on, LEGO! Why the sudden change of
heart?

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,560
Oh.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,510
So Ai Weiwei pointed out that LEGO's rejection
came on the heels this 300 million dollar

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,760
Legoland China deal.

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,349
But whether LEGO was right or wrong to deny
Ai's request, the Internet has clearly sided

41
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,470
with Ai.

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,430
He's set up several, uh, cars, where people
can donate LEGOs to him.

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,909
And this whole incident has made LEGO look
pretty bad.

44
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,940
In fact you could say it's making the company's
reputation fall to pieces.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,159
But maybe we've been focusing too much attention
on Mr. Lego,

46
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,599
when maybe the real bad guy is this one.

47
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,349
It's not certain whether LEGO's decision was
a result of pressure by the CCP.

48
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,680
But if it were, LEGO would hardly be alone.

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,730
Because under the CCP, the price of doing
business in China is to play by their rules,

50
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,120
or face the consequences.

51
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,190
So what do you think?

52
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,330
Should LEGO have sold to Ai? Who's to blame?

53
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,849
Let me know what you think in the comments
section below.

54
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,300
Once again Iâ€™m Chris Chappell. See you next
time.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,220
Starting recently, my new videos will have
optional Chinese subtitles.

56
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,610
You can access them a couple days after each
episode is posted, through that Closed Captions

57
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,110
button below.

58
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,080
Those are provided by Island Nation Translation,
based in Taiwan.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,280
Next time you need your stuff translated,
give these guys a try.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,700
They do a great job, work fast, and they won't
censor you.

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,980
Check out their Facebook page. The link is
in the description below.

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:00,409
The US guided missile destroyer the USS Lassen
sailed within 12 nautical miles of Chinese

63
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,819
territory...

64
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:07,040
as long as you consider artificial islands
built on submerged reefs part of China's territory,

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,450
which no one besides China does.
