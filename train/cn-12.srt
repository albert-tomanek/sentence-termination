00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,860
This is the Technical Difficulties,
we’re playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,940
Joining me today, he reads books y'know,
it’s Chris Joel.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello again, my beauties!

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,220
Everybody’s favourite Gary Brannan,
Gary Brannan.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,080
And of course, the thing you must not do
if the ape is enraged

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,680
is the Macarena.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,280
And the bounciest man on the internet,
Matt Gray.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,980
Marhaba, YouTube.

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,140
In front of me I’ve got an article from Wikipedia
and these folks can’t see it.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,920
Every fact they get right is a point
and a ding,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,520
and there's a special prize for particularly
good answers which is...

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,080
And today we are talking about Charles Blondin.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,520
Which gives us exactly
nothing to go on, apart...

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,260
I mean, the way I pronounce that
gives you a bit of a hint.

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,260
Français?

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,260
Yes, absolutely right.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,260
He was French.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,333
Oh, the wheel spins and lands on France…!

19
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,333
It’s not a wheel!

20
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:55,850
It’s just a piece of cardboard with an arrow
saying France!

21
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,260
Charles Blondin, also known as The Great Blondin.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,170
Did he do something with hot air balloons?

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,490
That sounds like you know that.

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,610
Well, it’s a stunt man-y sort of name,
isn’t it?

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,510
I know France did hot air balloons.

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,289
That was the Montgolfier brothers.

27
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:11,900
- See? France did hot air balloons!
- He’s right, you know.

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,460
I mean he’s not wrong, he’s not wrong,
but no.

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,020
He’s not wrong and yet, in the back
of your mind, the phrase is:

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,679
"how do I say he is wrong?"

31
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,240
That's fair.

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,720
Yes, Chevalier Blondin, or The Great Blondin.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,080
Magician?

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,460
Certainly that sort of entertainer,
that sort of genre…

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,460
Strongman.

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,060
Oh, was he like that bit in Ocean’s Eleven
with the acrobatics

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,139
to steal the money from the vault?

38
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:38,289
We are looking for a specific
acrobatic trick here.

39
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,289
Something that you’d be known for.

40
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,540
It wasn’t like Henry IV’s
favourite acrobat?

41
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,740
I think it’s Henry IV, I might be...
medievalists out there,

42
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,130
apologies I might have got
the wrong king there,

43
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,810
who was known for
a whistle, a tumble and a fart.

44
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,540
That was his act.

45
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,999
And he was knighted because the king thought
it was so funny.

46
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:56,159
Apparently, Roland the Farter.

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,259
Roland the Farter!

48
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,259
That's it.

49
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,259
Roland the Farter.

50
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,529
You’re not getting points for this, but
you are right.

51
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:03,689
This was King Henry II, in medieval times.

52
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,400
A medieval flatulist who each year, in exchange
for 30 acres of land,

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,890
was obliged to perform a jump,
a whistle and a fart.

54
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,500
Can I just take a moment here for "flatulist"?

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Yes!

56
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,380
Now I know this 'cos Wikipedia has a list
of flatulists.

57
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,040
Yes, yes they do.

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,080
What wasn’t he actually doing?

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,470
He wasn’t actually breaking wind.

60
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,760
He was actually...

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,020
This is going to grim.

62
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,730
He was able to suck wind in,

63
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,680
and then blow it out again
through muscle power, I assume.

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,660
And because that was technically a question
I asked, you’re getting the point.

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,260
Ever felt you’re on home turf with a subject?

66
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,220
We are looking for a specific acrobatic act
that Charles Blondin was famous for.

67
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,700
The windy-windy-falling-fabric thing!

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,600
- Aerial silks!
- Aerial silks!

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,100
No. What have you got, Chris?

70
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,760
The flat-o-mer-boing-a-mi-thing!

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Slackline?

72
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,980
Trampo-mo-line!

73
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,620
Trampo-mo-line, no.

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
The high-rope-walkalongy…

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Yes!

76
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,800
Is he the one that walked between big buildings?

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,320
No, that’s Philippe Petit.

78
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,260
Yes, this was…

79
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,320
Wasn’t he French?

80
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Yes, hence the name Philippe Petit!

81
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,780
No, but you said it more "Philip Petty", though.

82
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,900
He’s Philip Petty!

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,380
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' brother.

84
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,800
You’re absolutely right, it is the
walky-longy-not-fally-downy-thing.

85
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
Correct.

86
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,380
The elastomastring!

87
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,560
He was a tightrope walker.

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,830
He came up with the idea to cross
a certain thing on a tightrope.

89
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,490
Oh, Thingy Falls.

90
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,590
I’m not allowing you Thingy Falls!

91
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
Niagara.

92
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,590
That’s the one, Thingy.

93
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,590
Yes, you’re absolutely right, Niagara Falls.

94
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,590
I knew what you meant.

95
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,400
Widey! Big! Dangerous!

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,660
Yeah, Thingy Falls!

97
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,240
Widey Falls, not Tall Falls.
Victoria, tall… wide.

98
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,580
It’s going to be curved in, it’s going
to be like that…

99
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,220
Oh, that’s where I went wrong, I need my
hands that way.

100
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,100
Have you ever rubbed a waterfall?

101
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,580
Don’t get your hands backwards.

102
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,180
You don’t want to rub it the wrong way.

103
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,600
Actually you were trying to push the water
back up weren’t you?

104
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,940
Get-- ugh!-- what is Cnut doing
in the wave pool?

105
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,640
Stood at the bottom, like Atlas, failing.

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,440
You’re sort of, “Why is no one else as
bothered about this as me?”

107
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,260
“The sea will be empty, the 
fish will...

108
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,800
“...opposite of drown!”

109
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,960
Asphyxiate, Gary!

110
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,960
“The fish are drowning!
They seem fine with it, though...”

111
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,040
You should have seen Noah trying to
load them onto the Ark!

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,520
Did not like it, did not like it at all.

113
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,500
“There’s going to be a flood!
Get the fish on!”

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,340
A long time ago...

115
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,960
You’re absolutely right, he was the first
to cross Niagara…

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
What did he do, insult it or something?

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
To cross Niagara Falls on a tightrope.

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,990
What did he then go back and do?

119
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,830
Fetch the other end of the rope and
walk back with it.

120
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,870
Oh, what an act!

121
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,290
You’d pay to see it.

122
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,900
Well he did some other acts on the tightrope.

123
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,780
Whistle, tumble, fart?

124
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,920
Famous mid-air, tightrope walking flatulist.

125
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,840
Hell of an entry on Wikipedia,
let's face it.

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
There were some theatrical variations,
it says here, on the idea of…

127
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,080
Oh, he wore a hat.

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
Well he wore something.

129
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
His wife.

130
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,960
He carried his manager.

131
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,040
I think the idea of carrying a person
is close enough,

132
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,480
I’m going to give you the point there.

133
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,080
Is that in case he had any border issues at
the other end?

134
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,380
No, it’s in case he wasn’t getting
a big enough cut.

135
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,740
Someone to negotiate with him
on the other side.

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,520
Negotiate at the top of the Niagara Falls!

137
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,650
Hey, you’d agree quick, though,
wouldn’t you?

138
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,930
Also: in a sack, on stilts,
not at the same time, and also…

139
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,930
He was in a sack?

140
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,930
Yes, he was in a sack.

141
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,920
How did he tightrope walk in a sack?

142
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,940
- Carefully.
- You put it on the top, not the bottom.

143
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,790
Oh, right, with you, sorry, yeah.

144
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,020
Sack racing across a tightrope.

145
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,919
I would defo… never mind over Niagara Falls!

146
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,730
Well, two people, think about the overtaking!

147
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,680
Yes, you could see the waveform on the line.

148
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,160
Does that mean they next did an
egg and spoon race over Niagara Falls?

149
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,540
Are we talking tightrope sport race?
Sports race? Sports day.

150
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,740
Matt. Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.

151
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,040
You are so close…

152
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:03,550
Because unbelievably the word “egg” is
the accurate one in there.

153
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,220
What did he do in the middle of a tightrope,
over Niagara Falls in about 1860?

154
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,240
Fry an omelette.

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,640
Omelette. Oi, I was saying that!

156
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,699
But how did I get that afterwards?

157
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,350
I was doing it better!

158
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,200
And Chris steals the point!

159
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,780
He cooked and ate an omelette on a tightrope
in the middle of Niagara Falls.

160
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,360
What? On what?

161
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,460
- Well, the tightrope.
- Pan.

162
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,620
Yeah, alright knobhead, but what?

163
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,320
Because that means a heat source,

164
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,530
so you’ve got to have a little cooking stove
or something balanced on...

165
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,730
But what’s that balanced on?

166
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,730
- His hand.
- His hand!

167
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,620
How the f*** is he carrying a thing, and a
thing, and what’s-a, on a balance…?

168
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,090
Well, that is the trick.

169
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,950
That is literally the act
he is being paid to do.

170
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,080
That is why it’s impressive, Gary.

171
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,430
He also stood on a chair, with one chair leg
on the rope, on Niagara..

172
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,389
No, no, no, no, no, no...

173
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,740
50 metres above the water.

174
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,260
How big is this wire by the way,
while we’re on it?

175
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,199
Well quite long 'cos it has to go
across Niagara Falls.

176
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,110
What’s the diameter of this wire?

177
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,110
Cheesewire!

178
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,110
Oh no.

179
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,389
Ooh, just slices of feet.

180
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,740
What I’d like y'all to do at this point is to
gesture how big you think this wire is.

181
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,120
What, thickness wise?

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
- Girth?
- Yes, girth.

183
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,480
- That big?
- That big?

184
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,900
Have you just made whatever happens to be
the size of your…?

185
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,520
No, no, I’m thinking of cable for...

186
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,570
I’m thinking how big it would be for your
feet to comfortably sit on and be attached,

187
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,240
so it can’t be much bigger than about that,
I wouldn’t have thought.

188
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,660
Yeah, Gary you’ve basically got it
spot on.

189
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,410
Eight and a bit centimetres,
you’re absolutely right.

190
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,410
Oh.

191
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,400
Balls to this, I can’t actually see the
man do the egg.

192
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,669
I’d rather I was closer to him so I could
witness how good the omelette was.

193
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,180
I’m sorry, if he’s going to show off I’m
going to get picky as well.

194
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,660
Is it going to be Saturday Kitchen where they
try and do it under a minute?

195
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,960
Omelette Challenge.
60 seconds.

196
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,960
That’s a reference that not many people
are going to get isn’t it?

197
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,210
Now there is a sentence in this article.

198
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,460
Obviously, at this point --

199
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,310
he was born in France, he’s moved to the
US to do this sort of thing.

200
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,509
While in the US he married someone called
Charlotte Lawrence.

201
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,460
What’s strange about that?

202
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,520
Is he a bigamist?

203
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,980
Well, we don’t know.

204
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,110
I’ll give you the point because the phrase
here is:

205
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,150
"while in the US he married a second wife".

206
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,220
That indicates you’re a bigamist.

207
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,020
And then slightly earlier it says he married
Marie Blancherie,

208
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,600
and it is not known what happened to his French
family after he went to America.

209
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,729
So I will give you the point.

210
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,430
It’s quite possible that he divorced her
or that something else happened.

211
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,919
It’s not recorded in here.

212
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,990
Can you imagine being his first wife,
thinking your husband’s disappeared,

213
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,450
never to be heard of again, and picking up
Le Monde and seeing the front page,

214
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,380
“Man Cooks Egg Over Niagara Falls”
and going “b******!”

215
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,720
Oh yes, because it was definitely
front-page-worthy.

216
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,730
Oh, yeah!

217
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,279
What, you think this isn’t?

218
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,020
Blondin came back to Europe,
lived in the UK,

219
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,350
retired for a while and then made a reappearance
in the sort of manner

220
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,690
you’d expect stars who are
in need of money to do.

221
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,130
I’m a Celebrity.

222
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,690
Something that existed at the end of
the 19th century and still exists now.

223
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,690
Panto.

224
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,690
Yes.

225
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,810
You are absolutely right.

226
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,330
He appeared in Jack and the Beanstalk
at the Crystal Palace.

227
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,660
Not at Crystal Palace, at the Crystal Palace.

228
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,960
I’m going to guess that what he did is his
tightrope act on was, maybe, the beanstalk.

229
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,660
I’m going to suggest that might be it,
it’s not recorded here but, yes.

230
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,230
Nah, he was the front end of the panto horse.

231
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,589
While on the beanstalk.

232
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,000
Back end, not a tightrope walker,
clinging on desperately.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,230
It’s like, you have to put some
tightrope walking in there,

234
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,640
because this guy’s a one-trick pony…

235
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, f*** off…

236
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,840
That wasn’t a joke.

237
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680
Oh, horse!
Panto horse.

238
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,620
I must just be naturally funny(!)

239
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,560
When he’s out of work he’s getting the
washing in, where is he?

240
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,160
On top of the washing line.

241
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,250
He was so associated with tightrope walking,
what happened to his name?

242
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,810
Oh, the tightrope became his name!

243
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,639
A tightrope walker was called a Blondin.

244
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,920
- Ah.
- That’s how well-known he was.

245
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,320
Like how people Google for things…

246
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,420
Going back to an earlier thing,

247
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,850
like that guy was around in the early 2000s
called Mr Methane.

248
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,500
Another one on your list of famous flatulists!

249
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes.

250
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,800
See how I’m tying these bits together today.

251
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,580
There is also a thing called a Blondin,
even now.

252
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,380
And it’s a bit of industrial equipment.

253
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,700
What might it be?

254
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,560
Safety rig for working at height?

255
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,709
Not for people.

256
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,700
- Animals.
- For sheep working at height!

257
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,920
“Go on Bessie, the grass is a bit long
near the cliff.”

258
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
“Baaa!”

259
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,760
- Not for animals...
- That’s a valid thing you might need

260
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,700
because companies are putting sheep on their
roofs, aren’t they?

261
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,120
What?

262
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,800
If you build a new building you can put the
organic roofs on

263
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,710
that are a layer of turf to help insulate,
to stop it...

264
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,240
Some companies want it to be kind of a wild
garden, but other companies…

265
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Want it neatly mowed?

266
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,860
And they’re putting sheep and goats on it.

267
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,840
Cracking.

268
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,520
So you might need a safety line for a sheep,
it's working at height…

269
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,120
When was the last time you put a safety harness
on a sheep?

270
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Wednesday.

271
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,480
All I can think is that I want to change jobs
to aerial shepherd.

272
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,700
What might you need to move,
on a rope, in a quarry?

273
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,780
Oh, stone.

274
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,220
You’re absolutely right.

275
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,020
It’s an aerial ropeway used in
Welsh slate quarries.

276
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,470
It’s called a Blondin after him.

277
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,550
Oh, right, so like the ones at the end of…
nah, that doesn’t spoil anything,

278
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,110
like the ones at the end of Get Carter,

279
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,320
that kind of thing where it dumps
coal in the sea.

280
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
Hands up who's seen Get Carter?

281
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,120
- Literally none.
- Literally only Gary.

282
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,459
F*** it, bring the screen down.

283
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,670
We’re watching this, alright?

284
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,220
“You’re a big man, but you’re out of shape.
He does this for a living.”

285
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,180
- That’s from Get Carter.
- Get Carter.

286
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,180
There is one other person I’d like to talk
about from Niagara Falls

287
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,250
and from the history of Niagara Falls.

288
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,180
Is it... was it a lady or a gentleman went
over it in a barrel?

289
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,900
You said lady or a gentleman, Gary,
I’ll give you the choice, pick one.

290
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,760
Oh f***.

291
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,680
The little bell that’s ringing in the back of my head
says lady but I could be wrong.

292
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,780
- Roll with it.
- Have a point.

293
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,800
- Oh, right okay.
- Any idea of the names?

294
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Annie Edison Taylor.

295
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,779
Born in 1838, ended up in Bay City, Michigan

296
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,100
where she hoped to become a dance instructor.

297
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,500
Did she not?

298
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,360
I mean, have the point. Why not?

299
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,900
Couldn’t f***ing dance(!)

300
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,519
Bog-all rhythm.

301
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,500
There’s nobody wanting to dance.

302
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,090
There are no dance schools.

303
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,320
Now why didn’t she sort of break the mould
and start one, rather than just…

304
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,100
Well she did! She absolutely did, have a point.

305
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,020
Then she travelled all over the place trying
to find work,

306
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,240
couldn’t find any
and moved back to Bay City.

307
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,600
Which means she wanted to secure
her later years financially.

308
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,269
She wanted to avoid what?

309
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:38,000
Workhouses? Something like that?

310
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,580
Yes, the poor house, absolutely right.

311
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,330
She decided she would be the first person
to ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel.

312
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,030
And she considers that securing her future?

313
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,730
Not putting it at dire risk.

314
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,240
She was actually in her 60s,
when she went over.

315
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,540
Really?

316
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,920
Using a custom made barrel.

317
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,740
Why did she use a barrel, not, like a boat
or something proper?

318
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,620
“It was a proper barrel!”

319
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,570
That’s good question.
What is a barrel designed to do?

320
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,580
Oh, keep water out?

321
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Exactly.

322
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
It’s designed…

323
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,690
Well, strictly speaking,
to keep water in, surely?

324
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,140
- No, keep booze in, and water out!
- Oh, right, with you!

325
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,300
- Yes!
- Focus man, come on.

326
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,660
It is meant to be waterproof.

327
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,750
So the idea is she’s in there,
in a slightly pressurised barrel,

328
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,260
with a heart-shaped pillow and mattress.

329
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
There was a lid on it?

330
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
There was a lid on it.

331
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,470
Oh right, I assumed it was up to the waist
or something!

332
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,470
“Tally-ho!”

333
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,930
I’ve always assumed that, that’s how I’ve
always pictured it.

334
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,930
I never thought…

335
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,080
Sort of like a tub over the edge, yeah.

336
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,960
Come to think of it, yeah, so have I.

337
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,890
No, she was stuffed in a barrel
with the top sealed.

338
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,640
A little bit of pressure in there, the idea
being that all she’s going to feel is:

339
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,800
darkness, darkness, darkness, plunge, thump,
thump, thump, thump,

340
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
get out the other side.

341
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Did she?

342
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,020
Well you keep asking me the questions, Matt,

343
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,980
but that’s not actually
what I’m here for.

344
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
So…

345
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,709
Let’s say she didn’t.

346
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,260
She did.

347
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,060
She made it over the falls with nothing but
a small gash on her head.

348
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,720
What did she say afterwards?

349
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
F***!

350
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,860
I mean it was… it was…

351
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,580
I’m going to give you the point because
it wasn’t that short,

352
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,180
it wasn’t in so few words,

353
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,740
but yes, “If it was with my dying breath,

354
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,380
“I would caution anyone against attempting the feat.”

355
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,980
That’s never a great recommendation for
a ride is it?

356
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,160
No, but it’s really smart for somebody who
is looking to secure their fame

357
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,840
for being the one who did it.

358
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,900
“I would sooner walk up to the mouth of a cannon
knowing it was going to blow me to pieces

359
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,600
than make another trip over the fall.”

360
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,630
And next week, watch me walk up to a cannon
knowing it’s going to blow me to pieces!

361
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,300
At the end of the show, congratulations Chris,
you win this one.

362
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,680
Well done.

363
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,790
You win a small fast bird that makes clothing
for other small fast birds.

364
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,970
Oh God.

365
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,339
It’s this Tailor Swift.

366
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,980
With that we say thank you to Chris Joel,

367
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,540
to Gary Brannan,

368
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,840
to Matt Gray.

369
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,520
Bye bye YouTube.

370
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,360
I’ve been Tom Scott and we’ll see you
next time.
