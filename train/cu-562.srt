1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:04,470
Hong Kong erupts in protest...again.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,000
And police arrest people...again.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,300
Even as the deadly coronavirus spreads.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,310
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,740
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,740
Hong Kong.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,740
Remember them?

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,230
It’s been nine very long months

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,509
since the protests began there.

10
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,330
They started after the Hong Kong government
tried

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,509
to pass a law that would let them extradite
criminal suspects

12
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,210
to mainland China...

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,360
...where they’d be treated to China’s
legal system,

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,510
which looks like this.

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,130
For some reason, Hongkongers didn’t want
that.

16
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,260
After months of stalling, the Hong Kong government

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,670
eventually scrapped the extradition bill.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,510
But that didn’t stop the protests—

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,600
which by then had evolved into anti-Chinese
Communist Party protests.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
“Chinazi.”

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,110
I think it’s pretty clear how the people
feel.

22
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,670
So for almost 9 months,

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,350
there have been protests in Hong Kong virtually
every week—

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,190
sometimes even more often.

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,890
And the typical reaction of the Hong Kong
police has looked like this.

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,200
So really, why bother extraditing people to
mainland China,

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,140
when Hong Kong police can bring mainland China
to the people?

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,770
Now, there’s a deadly coronavirus spreading
in China,

29
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,040
and it’s also affected Hong Kong.

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Back in 2003, Hong Kong went through

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,799
the worst SARS outbreak outside of mainland
China.

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,960
So people are understandably concerned about
the coronavirus.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,360
But if the Chinese regime was hoping the coronavirus

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,299
would make Hong Kongers too scared to protest,

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,380
they’ve been sorely disappointed.

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,040
We haven’t seen large-scale rallies in a
while.

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,960
But the coronavirus is also inspiring *new*
protests in Hong Kong.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,299
These are often strikes or smaller spontaneous
protests.

39
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,100
Authorities aim to arrest their way out...

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,780
...because arresting people is apparently

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,850
the solution to all of life’s problems.

42
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,420
Except student loan debt.

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,420
If only...

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,770
It’s also clearly the solution

45
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,879
to dealing with pesky local media moguls

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,370
who refuse to censor themselves.

47
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,670
Like Jimmy Lai.

48
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,989
He’s the founder of Apple Daily,

49
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,560
a Hong Kong newspaper that has been explicitly
supporting the protests.

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
Hong Kong police arrested Jimmy Lai on Friday

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,400
for participating in an “illegal assembly”
back on August 31.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,029
Also arrested were two former pro-democracy
legislators,

53
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,309
Yeung Sum and Lee Cheuk-yan.

54
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:38,590
It was a smart move by Hong Kong police.

55
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,739
Arresting senior citizens, including a multi-millionaire,

56
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,349
is a great way to remind Hong Kongers from
all walks of life that

57
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,250
they have a reason to hate the government.

58
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,269
It really brings people together.

59
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,800
Jimmy Lai has been released,

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,349
but he’ll have to appear in court on May
5.

61
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:00,129
If he’s convicted of participating in an
illegal assembly,

62
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,090
he could face big fines, and up to five years
in prison.

63
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,319
More than 7,000 people have been arrested

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,480
since the Hong Kong protests began last June.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,090
And a lot of them have been charged with “rioting,”

66
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,659
a more serious charge that carries up to 10
years in prison.

67
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,409
But somehow, arresting people doesn’t actually

68
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,220
deter other people from protesting.

69
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,969
This past Saturday, Hongkongers came out to
protest again.

70
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:30,449
They were commemorating the six-month anniversary

71
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,269
of that time when Hong Kong police actually

72
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,409
boarded the subway to beat people up.

73
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,750
Following tradition,

74
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,900
Hong Kong police came to provide the solution:

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,260
Tear gas.

76
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,559
And arresting more people.

77
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,530
It’s hard to believe protests like this

78
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,480
have been going on for so long.

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,609
Then again, time flies when you’re repressing
people.

80
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:52,609
So what do you think?

81
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:53,609
Leave your comments below.

82
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,609
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

83
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,760
from one of our supporters who contributes
to China Uncensored

84
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,930
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,930
Shane asks:

86
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,639
“Hi Chris, Why is it that the former colony
of Hong Kong

87
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,069
has such a vibrant culture of democratic values

88
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,229
that they're willing to fight tooth and nail
for,

89
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:13,390
while the former colony of Macau

90
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,150
seems to have just rolled over

91
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,170
and accepted their authoritarian fate?”

92
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,100
Good question, Shane.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,320
There are potentially many reasons why this
is the case.

94
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,600
But one reason is the economy.

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,210
Hong Kong’s economic future depends on having
rule of law.

96
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,660
Institutions like banks, financial firms,

97
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,030
and many others have set up their operations
in Hong Kong.

98
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,260
They depend on liberty and rule of law,

99
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,470
because if clients renege on agreements,

100
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,960
or if there are lawsuits, et cetera,

101
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,330
these companies can rely on a fair court system,

102
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,930
without interference from powerful Communist
Party officials.

103
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,460
At least in theory.

104
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,780
So Hong Kong’s economy *requires* liberty.

105
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,060
Who wouldn’t “fight tooth and nail”
for that?

106
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,290
But Macau’s economy *depends* on powerful
Communist Party officials.

107
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,190
Macau technically has the same

108
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,620
“one country, two systems” policy as Hong
Kong.

109
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,120
But Macau is China’s hub for gambling and
money laundering.

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,070
Macau’s economy has grown by sevenfold since
Portugal

111
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,810
returned it to China twenty years ago,

112
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,680
and that economy is built around gambling.

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,190
Rich Chinese people use these casinos

114
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,450
to change their Chinese currency into US dollars
or Euros,

115
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,900
so they can move their ill-gotten money out
of China.

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,920
And most of Macau’s residents are, in some
way,

117
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,070
connected to the gambling industry—

118
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,310
working in casinos, hotels, restaurants, or
related services.

119
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,560
So if Macau loses the support of China’s
communist officials,

120
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,840
there would be massive, massive unemployment.

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,580
The locals do not want that.

122
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,140
Also, in 2009, the Macau government passed

123
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,930
a Draconian anti-subversion law,

124
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,340
which allows police to easily go after dissidents.

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,980
So that’s a big deterrent to protesting
as well.

126
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,370
So in Macau, it’s much easier to

127
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,050
“just roll over and accept your authoritarian
fate.”

128
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,050
If you want to learn more,

129
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,590
check out the interview I did a few years
ago

130
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,920
with Macanese pro-democracy activist Scott
Chiang.

131
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,190
Thanks for your question, Shane.

132
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,220
And thank you to all of you watching.

133
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,590
