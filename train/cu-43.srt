00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,080
Every day, China gets closer to invading Taiwan.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,880
And a dangerous kind of warfare

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,320
could spell disaster.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,640
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

Please help us. YouTube has been\h
randomly unsubscribing people\h\h

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,680
You should also share this particular\h
episode because everyone needs to know\h\h

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,640
what the Chinese military is doing against\h
Taiwan. It’s called gray zone warfare.\h

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,920
And it has many in Taiwan’s military—and the\h
US military—worried about the future of Taiwan.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,320
The Chinese Communist Party has been\h
solidifying its grip in the Asia Pacific. First,\h\h

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
it militarized artificial\h
islands in the South China Sea.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,920
Then it squashed the freedoms of Hong Kong,\h\h

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,800
using brutal policing and a\h
draconian national security law.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,160
All that remains is Taiwan. The Chinese Communist\h
Party claims Taiwan as part of its territory.\h\h

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,200
The independent government—and\h
military—of Taiwan, say otherwise.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,480
China’s communist regime has threatened to use\h\h

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,400
military force to invade Taiwan,\h
but there’s a problem with that.\h

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
First, the geography. The Strait\h
of Taiwan is difficult to cross,\h\h

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,880
80 miles wide at the narrowest point.

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,040
Weather conditions mean an amphibious invasion\h
could only be launched in April or October. And\h\h

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,520
remember, Taiwan has had decades to fortify any\h
and all possible landing sites along the coast.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,720
But despite the challenges,\h
Taiwan is still a major prize\h\h

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,760
and a top priority for\h
China’s Communist leadership.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,440
Politically, once they control Taiwan,\h
then the People’s Republic becomes the\h\h

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,880
undisputed China. And in the eyes of the\h
Chinese regime, there can be only one.

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,200
“For [Xi Jinping], democratic Taiwan is now the\h
last outpost of resistance to his dream of a\h\h

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,160
unified and rejuvenated China that\h
can displace the United States as\h\h

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,360
the major power in the Asia-Pacific region.”

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
That’s because if the Chinese military\h
can successfully conquer Taiwan,\h\h

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,600
they would have a commanding\h
position in the region.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,040
They would control what’s\h
called the first island chain.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,320
The Chinese military could then dominate\h
shipping lanes, crippling Japan and South Korea,\h\h

35
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,840
and give the Chinese Navy\h
access to the Western Pacific.

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,760
That could essentially make the Chinese Communist\h
Party the dominant power in the Pacific,\h\h

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
instead of the United States.\h

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,240
And all of that is why China is using a\h
dangerous new tactic to fight Taiwan: gray\h\h

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,760
zone warfare. It’s a way for the PLA to defeat\h
Taiwan’s military without ever firing a shot.

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,920
Since just mid-September, “Chinese warplanes\h
have flown more than 100 of these missions.”

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,040
These are missions where the PLA\h
fly aircraft around and even into\h\h

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,320
Taiwan’s air defense identification\h
zone. Sometimes multiple times a day.\h\h

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Even though no shots are fired, Taiwan has\h
to scramble jets each time in response.

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,880
According to the Pentagon, China has more than\h
2,000 fighter jets, bombers, and warplanes.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,240
Taiwan only has 400.\h

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,920
“Over time, fuel costs, pilot fatigue\h
and wear and tear on Taiwanese aircraft\h\h

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,720
will threaten the readiness of the island’s\h
air force if this pressure continues.”

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,800
Besides the psychological toll,\h\h

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,920
Gray Zone Warfare is also designed to\h
enact a financial toll on the defenders.

50
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,040
The numbers we’re talking about here are insane.\h
In October, Taiwan’s Defense Minister said\h\h

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,520
they had to scramble their air force nearly 3,000\h
times in 2020. That cost 900 million dollars.

52
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,160
And it’s not just a battle for the skies.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,520
From January through November of 2020,\h
Taiwanese ships launched 1,200 missions\h\h

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,200
to intercept PLA ships. That’s an increase\h
of about 400 missions from the previous year.

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,400
They’re basically trying to push the\h
Taiwanese military to the point of exhaustion.\h\h

56
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
And sap their will to fight.\h

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,480
There is another benefit of gray zone\h
warfare for the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

58
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,000
It allows the PLA to gather intelligence,\h
on not just Taiwan’s defenses, but also\h\h

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,240
Taiwan’s and its allies’ submarine activity\h
in the area. That includes the United States.\h

60
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,280
And as Taiwan’s military gets more and more worn\h
out, the Chinese Communist Party is throwing the\h\h

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,840
entire Communist state apparatus into building\h
up its own military. That’s why, according\h\h

62
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,160
to a retired Taiwanese military chief, for a\h
Chinese invasion—“It’s only a matter of time.”

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,560
It’s important for people to know what the Chinese\h
Communist Party is doing. But YouTube has been\h\h

64
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,440
soft censoring China Uncensored—by demonetizing\h
our videos, secretly unsubscribing people,\h\h

65
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,160
and not notifying people when we release new\h
videos. So join us in the fight, what I call\h\h

66
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,760
the China Uncensored 50 cent army. They’re\h
viewers like you who contribute as little as\h\h

67
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,880
a dollar an episode on the crowd funding website\h
Patreon. That’s patreon.com/ChinaUncensored

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,320
As a thank you to them, I answer\h
their questions on the show.\h\h

69
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,240
And today’s question comes from 50 Cent Army\h
member...Logan! “Any truth to China having energy\h\h

70
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,440
blackouts and falling steel production\h
due to there ban on Australian coal?”

71
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,160
Well, it’s 100% true that\h
there’s a coal shortage in China\h\h

72
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
that's causing the worst blackouts in a decade.

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,360
And it’s also true that the Chinese regime has\h
been using trade to attack Australia. Australia\h\h

74
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,320
has been standing up to the Chinese Communist\h
Party—even calling for an investigation into\h\h

75
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,000
the origin of the coronavirus. The Communist\h
Party hates this. So it’s basically banned\h\h

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,480
loads of Australian goods—from barely,\h
to wine, lobsters, and yes coal.\h

77
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,720
But the Party denies that the shortage\h
is due to their ban on Australian coal,\h\h

78
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,800
noting that most Australian coal\h
is used for steel production.\h

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,440
Are they telling the truth? Maybe. Even if\h
the coal shortages aren’t caused by the ban\h\h

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,920
on Australian coal, that ban isn’t helping\h
the situation. Coal prices are soaring,\h\h

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,200
but the Communist Party remains\h
determined to punish Australia.\h

82
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,080
China’s energy shortage is also affecting steel\h
production. And even worse, BitCoin mining!

83
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,200
China clearly went a step too far.\h
If only they hadn’t banned lobsters,\h\h

84
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,040
they could burn them for fuel! And then\h
all the steel would smell delicious!

85
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,600
Thanks for your question Logan.\h
And thank you for supporting\h\h

86
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,040
truly the most insightful\h
China analysis out there.
