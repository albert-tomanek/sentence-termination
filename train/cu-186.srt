1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,790
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,000
the US thinks it might not be the best idea

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,310
to let a Chinese company control your financial
data.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,060
Huh, wonder why.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,080
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,780
I’m Shelley Zhang.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,960
Chris is on vacation until Friday,

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,670
snoozing in his own desert paradise.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,090
But the news never sleeps,

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,820
so I’m here to talk about how the US blocked

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,090
China’s 1.2 billion dollar takeover

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,770
of the US-based company MoneyGram.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,720
MoneyGram is like Western Union,

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,350
but less well known.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,170
Like Mandy Moore is to Britney Spears.

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,579
Except MoneyGram is probably not going to
have

17
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,309
a career comeback playing the mother

18
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,409
of three mixed-race triplets,

19
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,440
making Americans ugly cry

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,109
every Tuesday at 9.

21
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,199
Ok, seriously, though,

22
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,620
you can use MoneyGram to send money.

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,210
It’s helpful when you can’t deliver cash.

24
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,370
Or mail a check.

25
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,370
Or use a credit card.

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,770
Or PayPal.

27
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,190
Or bank transfer.

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,809
Or Venmo.

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,180
Ok, so I have never used MoneyGram,

30
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,870
but apparently a lot of people do.

31
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,060
Because MoneyGram operates

32
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,280
in pretty much every country.

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,870
It has 347,000 agent offices worldwide.

34
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,540
That’s 10 times the number of McDonalds.

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,650
I know.

36
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,360
I also thought there were way more McDonalds
than that.

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,009
Although—to be fair—

38
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,870
some of MoneyGram’s “offices”

39
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,220
are just electronic kiosks.

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,220
Which is nice,

41
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,220
because then you can give them money

42
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,899
without having to talk to other people.

43
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,729
Something McDonald’s is also working on.

44
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,790
MoneyGram is based in Dallas.

45
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,250
And it’s worth 1.2 billion dollars.

46
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,689
At least, that’s what the Chinese company

47
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,960
Ant Financial was willing to pay for it.

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,149
Ant Financial is owned

49
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,909
by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma,

50
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:53,979
seen here.

51
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,380
He has...flair.

52
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,420
Yeah.

53
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,579
He’s bad, he’s bad.

54
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,509
You know it.

55
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,159
Jack Ma also owns the world’s largest retail
company,

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
the Alibaba Group.

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,600
Alibaba runs several websites

58
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,140
that are like the Chinese versions

59
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,260
of Amazon and eBay.

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,330
But much bigger.

61
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,980
You can buy everything on there—

62
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,870
from, you know, phone chargers,

63
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,590
to beauty products,

64
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,530
to a wide selection of interrogation chairs.

65
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,480
You know, there’s just something about

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,540
a company advertising its convenient and durable

67
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,610
interrogation chairs on Taobao.

68
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,390
It just says so much about

69
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,840
what’s happening in the country.

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,550
Perfect for prisons and police stations.

71
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,340
Ten year guarantee!

72
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,390
Ok, back to Alibaba before I scream.

73
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,840
Alibaba made so much money for Jack Ma

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
that he created his own financial services
company

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,489
just to process the payments.

76
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,850
He called it Alipay.

77
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,930
Later, he spun it off into Ant Financial.

78
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,920
The weird name is because—

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,740
and this is not a joke—

80
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,610
Jack Ma thinks the small merchants

81
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,500
who sell goods on Alibaba

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,900
are like ants.

83
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,830
And if they say why, why?

84
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,489
He’ll tell them it’s just Human Nature.

85
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,370
Anyway, after a year-long review process,

86
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,740
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States,

87
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,250
or CFIUS,

88
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,849
rejected Ant Financial’s takeover

89
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,730
of MoneyGram last week.

90
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,891
They said it posed a national security risk.

91
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:31,209
There were “concerns over the safety of
data

92
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,799
that can be used to identify U.S. citizens.”

93
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,620
CFIUS is a committee formed of members

94
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,370
from 16 government agencies,

95
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,120
including the Commerce Department,

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
State Department,

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,840
and Homeland Security.

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,620
Its main purpose is to review cases

99
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,520
where a company from a foreign country

100
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,950
wants to acquire a US business

101
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,739
that has sensitive technology,

102
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,819
data, intellectual property,

103
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,300
et cetera.

104
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,840
Then it approves or rejects each transaction.

105
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,939
Imagine it like having your mom approve

106
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,730
everything you buy before you buy it.

107
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,970
Do you really need another life-sized BB-8?

108
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,300
Honey, I’m just looking out for

109
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,659
your national security.

110
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,750
But unlike your mother,

111
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,269
CFIUS actually approves

112
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,989
the great majority of these transactions.

113
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:20,060
In recent years, though,

114
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,470
CFIUS has blocked a bunch of large deals

115
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,490
involving Chinese companies.

116
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,000
Like in 2011,

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,900
when CFIUS prevented telecom company Huawei

118
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,660
from buying a US company.

119
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,460
US Presidents can also directly step in

120
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,810
to block a deal,

121
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,889
like in 2016

122
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,669
when President Obama blocked the sale

123
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:39,650
of US assets of a tech company

124
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,060
to China.

125
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,310
Or in 2017 when President Trump blocked the
sale

126
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,280
of Lattice Semiconductor to China.

127
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,539
Still, even with this increased scrutiny of
Chinese firms,

128
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,490
a lot of people were surprised

129
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,680
that CFIUS told Jack Ma to Beat It.

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,990
Remember the time Trump

131
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,650
met with Jack Ma last January?

132
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,650
This is what he said.

133
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,650
“We had a great meeting, and—

134
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,650
a great, great entrepreneur,

135
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,650
one of the best in the world—

136
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,539
and he loves this country.”

137
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,539
At the meeting,

138
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,340
Jack Ma told Trump he wanted to

139
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,289
create a million jobs in the US,

140
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:16,110
by having US merchants sell stuff

141
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,020
on Alibaba.

142
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,169
Jack Ma hasn’t done that so far.

143
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,169
Not even close.

144
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,580
He’s actually been focused on

145
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,400
having his other company, Ant Financial,

146
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,789
take over MoneyGram.

147
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:27,199
It would have taken as many as

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,340
2,700 American workers,

149
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,440
and put them under the control

150
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,910
of his Chinese company.

151
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,750
Now, that’s not Black or White,

152
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,210
but it’s also not the same as creating jobs.

153
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,360
Jack probably figured he had

154
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,760
a good relationship with The Donald—

155
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,190
what we call in Chinese “guanxi.”

156
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,780
A sort of relationship currency

157
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,759
that’s more valuable than gold in China.

158
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,710
But Jack Ma is learning that guanxi

159
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,639
has a pretty weak exchange rate

160
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,350
with the US government.

161
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,850
They might still reject your takeover plan—

162
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,530
even though you guys are totally besties

163
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,740
after that one meeting you had.

164
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,150
So how did Chinese state-run media

165
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,680
respond to the rejection?

166
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,090
“We hope the U.S. can create

167
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,569
a fair and predictable environment

168
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,630
for Chinese enterprises to invest

169
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,849
and start businesses.”

170
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,259
Which is like a lionness saying to

171
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,259
a group of gazelles,

172
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,750
“Hey c’mon, guys.

173
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,349
You gotta give me a fair chance.

174
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,870
What’s with the running away?”

175
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,210
You see, the Chinese regime

176
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,599
has never created a level playing field

177
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,060
for foreign businesses.

178
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,360
In fact, if you’re a foreign company,

179
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
you’re not even allowed

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
to set up shop in China

181
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,229
without having a Chinese joint venture partner,

182
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,520
giving your partner a majority stake in the
company,

183
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,880
and handing over some of your intellectual
property.

184
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,120
So when it comes to MoneyGram,

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,780
if the roles were reversed—

186
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,979
and it had been a China-based company

187
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,599
that an American company wanted to buy—

188
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,639
the Chinese regime would have

189
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,400
flat out rejected it.

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,500
And they wouldn’t have even bothered

191
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,900
reviewing it for a year.

192
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,449
Chinese officials understand that

193
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,280
this is frustrating for American companies,

194
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,720
and they’ve tried to use it as leverage

195
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,990
in the past.

196
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,970
“Past meetings between the two countries

197
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,180
have seen China ask the US

198
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,289
for easier passage of its deals

199
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,910
in return for access to the Chinese market—

200
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,229
something the Obama administration

201
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,110
repeatedly declined.”

202
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,110
But now,

203
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,300
not only has the US been screening

204
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,970
more and more of these Chinese investments,

205
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,539
the EU will be too.

206
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,820
Because the fundamental problem

207
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,721
is that every major Chinese company

208
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,520
that is big enough to invest outside China

209
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,259
will have direct or indirect ties

210
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,930
to the Chinese Communist Party.

211
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,379
That’s just how it works.

212
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,379
But it means that as

213
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,060
more Chinese companies go abroad,

214
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,240
they’ll get heavier scrutiny because

215
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,750
other countries have concerns

216
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,319
that their technology and intellectual property

217
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,720
will be used by the CCP.

218
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,730
And what will happen with Ant Financial?

219
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,120
Well, Jack Ma will probably have to

220
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,020
take a good look at the Man in the Mirror

221
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,080
and realize that he’s not as smooth a criminal

222
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,070
as he thought.

223
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,319
But his company will be fine.

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,620
As for other Chinese companies

225
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,669
looking to buy foreign assets,

226
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,710
well, they won’t stop til they get enough.

227
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,710
So let me know what you think

228
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,380
of the US government’s rejection

229
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,440
of the MoneyGram takeover.

230
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,430
Bonus points for using Michael Jackson lyrics

231
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
in your reply.

232
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,780
I’m Shelley Zhang.

233
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,040
See you again soon.

234
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,040
Thanks for watching this episode.

235
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,530

236
