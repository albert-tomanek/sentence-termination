1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,360
Hong Kong authorities

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,440
Could start a new crackdown.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,760
Are things getting worse in Hong Kong?

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:15,920
Or is it part of the CCP’s\h
internal power struggle?

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,080
This episode is sponsored by PC-Doctor Toolbox.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,080
Protect your PC from software\h
crashes, hardware failures,\h\h

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,000
and the kind of glitches that\h
make your life miserable.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,800
One year after the Chinese\h
Communist Party imposed a harsh\h\h

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,000
national security law on Hong Kong, things\h
are looking pretty good...for the Party.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,960
The Communist Party is well on their way\h
to remaking Hong Kong in their image.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Stifling freedom of the press.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,840
Crushing democracy.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,680
And molding the impressionable minds of Hong\h
Kong’s youth with “patriotic education.”

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,440
Here’s one of the biggest signs\h
of how Hong Kong has changed\h\h

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,000
under the national security law. Hong\h
Kong used to be the only place in China\h\h

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
where people could commemorate\h
the Tiananmen Square massacre.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,760
And they did every year, even\h
last year during the coronavirus.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
As part of the deal to give Hong Kong\h
to the People’s Republic of China,\h\h

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
the UK made the Chinese regime promise\h\h

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,600
to leave Hong Kong’s freedoms intact for 50\h
years after they took over the territory.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Hong Kong’s annual Tiananmen vigil\h\h

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
was seen as a test of whether the Communist\h
Party was actually honoring their promise.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,400
Here’s a thought. If a country you’re making\h
a deal with has to promise *not* to take away\h\h

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,360
people’s freedoms...maybe that’s a sign you\h
shouldn’t make a deal with that country.

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,360
Because here’s what happened. This year, under\h
the national security law, Hong Kong had no vigil.\h\h

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Police locked down the park and\h
arrested one of the organizers.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
And it wasn’t just that the vigil was\h
stopped. Some people tried to open a\h\h

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,160
Tiananmen massacre museum. Then they had\h
to shut it down because the police started\h\h

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,040
investigating them. For...licensing issues. Sure.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,040
But hey, why do you need a Tiananmen massacre\h
museum when you can have a museum about the\h\h

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,880
glorious Communist Party instead?! One that will\h
definitely not mention the Tiananmen massacre.

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
So the Chinese Communist Party promised to\h
leave Hong Kong’s freedoms intact for 50 years\h\h

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,400
and they made it for...less than 24 years.

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,440
And that’s why you should never trust a\h
Communist. They’re always missing their Marx.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
Hong Kongers see the writing\h
on the wall...literally.

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,800
Which is why many are starting to leave.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,760
But for those who are staying, there\h
is another sign many Hong Kongers are\h\h

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,240
watching to see how bad the Communist\h
Party’s crackdown is going to get.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,360
That canary in the coalmine is the bright yellow\h
t-shirts of Hong Kong’s Falun Gong practitioners.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,640
And that canary is in danger.\h
I’ll tell you why after the break.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,440
Welcome back.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,240
Like Hong Kong’s Tiananmen vigil,\h
Hong Kong’s Falun Gong practitioners\h\h

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,680
have been a symbol of the city’s\h
freedoms for more than 20 years.

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Falun Gong, sometimes called Falun\h
Dafa, is a Chinese spiritual practice.\h\h

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
In the late 1990s, there were between 70 to\h
100 million people practicing Falun Gong,\h\h

47
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,600
according to the Chinese government.

48
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,840
But under former Chinese leader and shriveled\h\h

49
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
toad Jiang Zemin , the Chinese\h
Communist Party banned Falun Gong.

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,360
And the Party began a long campaign\h
to eradicate it. Including arresting\h\h

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,520
and torturing, and even killing\h
Falun Gong members for their organs.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,880
But Hong Kong supposedly has\h
freedom of speech and religion.\h\h

53
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,840
And in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is a\h
legally registered organization.\h\h

54
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,040
So Hong Kong became the only place in\h
China where Falun Gong was allowed.

55
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,200
Falun Gong practitioners would\h
set up booths around Hong Kong\h\h

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
to raise awareness about the\h
Communist Party’s persecution\h\h

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,040
just across the border in mainland China. Many\h
of these booths were aimed at Chinese tourists.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,360
They also called out the\h
Communist Party in general.\h\h

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,920
These banners say “Heaven will\h
destroy the Chinese Communist Party,\h\h

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Heaven will bless the Chinese nation” and “Loving\h
the country does not mean loving the Party.”

61
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
The Chinese Communist Party did not like\h
this. But they couldn’t officially do anything\h\h

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,640
about it, since they were supposed to leave\h
Hong Kong’s freedoms alone. So instead\h\h

63
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,960
they used proxy groups to target Falun Gong.

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
The biggest one of these was the Hong Kong\h
Youth Care Association. It was part of the\h\h

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,480
Communist Party’s United Front, which are\h
groups that are controlled by the Communist\h\h

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Party. United Front groups do stuff on behalf of\h
the Party while posing as regular organizations.

67
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,440
For example, the Hong Kong Youth Care Association\h
set up anti-Falun Gong banners next to the Falun\h\h

68
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,880
Gong booths and monitored, harassed, and\h
even assaulted Falun Gong practitioners.

69
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,320
This went on for almost a decade. Then suddenly\h
at the end of last year, the Hong Kong Youth\h\h

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,800
Care Association disbanded. They just packed\h
up their banners and left. It’s not clear why.

71
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,360
But that doesn’t mean Falun Gong’s\h
troubles in Hong Kong are over.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Because now pro-Beijing Hong Kong lawmakers\h\h

73
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,840
are calling on the Hong Kong government to outlaw\h
Falun Gong, under the national security law.

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,680
Legislator Elizabeth Quat said “external\h
forces are making use of ‘religious groups’\h\h

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,040
and ‘media organisations’ as a disguise\h
for extending anti-China forces in the\h\h

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,400
city.” She also said that Falun Gong was one\h
of these organizations and should be outlawed.

77
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
Separately, Elizabeth Quat has said the BBC\h\h

78
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
should be banned in Hong Kong because\h
it produces fake news to smear China.

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,280
Wait, Elizabeth Quat said that “external\h
forces” are using “religious groups”\h\h

80
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,440
and “media organizations”? Clearly\h
the CIA is using Falun Gong and the\h\h

81
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,600
BBC to subvert Hong Kong! Why\h
didn’t we realize this before?

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
So, Quat seems like a very reasonable person who\h\h

83
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
is not at all bootlicking to\h
appease the Communist Party.

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,040
But Quat wasn’t the only one. Other pro-Beijing\h
lawmakers accused the Hong Kong government of\h\h

85
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,320
being “weak” in the past about “handling” Falun\h
Gong and urged authorities to ban the group.

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,080
In response, Hong Kong’s Secretary for\h
Security Chris Tang said the government\h\h

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,040
will “look closely into” whether Falun Gong\h
is in breach of the national security law.

88
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
But he refused to comment further.

89
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
So if we’re using Falun Gong’s presence in\h
Hong Kong as a barometer for how bad the\h\h

90
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,520
Chinese Communist Party’s repression of Hong Kong\h
will get, this is bad... but not the worst. Yet.

91
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Pro-Beijing lawmakers are trying to pressure\h
the Hong Kong government to ban Falun Gong,\h\h

92
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,920
but the government isn’t committing to anything.

93
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,200
But there are signs it could get worse.\h
Recent articles in Chinese state-run media\h\h

94
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,320
are trying to connect Falun Gong to what they\h
are calling “terrorist attacks” in Hong Kong,\h\h

95
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,840
including the man who stabbed a Hong Kong\h
policeman before killing himself on July 1st.

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,120
There’s no evidence that the man had any\h
connection to Falun Gong. Chinese state media\h\h

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,760
are basing their accusation on the fact that\h
the reporter who accidentally filmed the\h\h

98
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,200
attack during a livestream is tied to a media\h
company linked to Falun Gong practitioners.

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,440
Now, that might sound like Chinese state media are\h
being ridiculous. But actually it’s really smart.\h\h

100
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
Because if reporters who livestream events\h
can be held responsible for those events,\h\h

101
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,600
think about all those media who\h
livestreamed the Hong Kong protests!\h\h

102
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,440
They’re all responsible for\h
the protests! Lock ‘em up!

103
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,800
Wait a minute...

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
we livestreamed the Hong Kong\h
protests. Don’t lock ‘em up!

105
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,400
By the way, this Global Times article is\h
not just about Falun Gong. It also attacks\h\h

106
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,440
lots of Hong Kong Christian organizations\h
for supporting the pro-democracy movement,\h\h

107
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,680
which could mean that a bigger religious\h
crackdown is coming to Hong Kong.

108
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Now in some ways, a Falun Gong ban in Hong\h
Kong seems like just a matter of time.\h\h

109
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
People were worried about it last year, as\h
soon as the national security law was passed.

110
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,680
But Hong Kong authorities spent the past\h
year targeting people directly involved\h\h

111
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,800
in the 2019 protests, and left Falun Gong alone.

112
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,200
At this point, every prominent Hong Kong\h
activist is now either in jail or in exile.\h\h

113
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,160
So Hong Kong authorities may\h
be looking for a new target.

114
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,080
Especially now that authorities have forced\h
pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily to shut\h\h

115
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,280
down. Because the Hong Kong edition of the\h
Epoch Times, which was started by Falun Gong\h\h

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,960
practitioners, is now the only local media that\h
actively opposes the Chinese Communist Party.

117
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,400
They’ve already been attacked\h
several times in the past year.

118
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,160
First, thugs wrecked their printing press.

119
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,640
Then thugs attacked a local\h
reporter with a baseball bat.

120
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,280
The Epoch Times says they won’t back down.

121
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,080
But it turns out the Falun Gong issue in\h
Hong Kong could be more complicated. And\h\h

122
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,840
a ban might not happen yet. Because of\h
factional infighting within the Party.

123
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,720
More after the break.

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,600
Welcome back.

125
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,480
The Falun Gong issue in Hong Kong could be\h
more complicated than it looks on the surface.\h\h

126
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,120
That’s because of a power struggle\h
within the Chinese Communist Party.

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,880
That’s according to SinoInsider, a\h
China political risk consultancy .

128
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
You know what that means. It’s time\h
for another installment of everyone’s\h\h

129
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,640
favorite communist soap opera, General Hostility .

130
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,920
Previously on General Hostility:\h
Hong Kong is a battleground\h\h

131
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,200
between Chinese President Xi Jinping\h
and former toad leader Jiang Zemin.

132
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,280
Xi tried to go after Jiang and his cronies’ wealth\h\h

133
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,120
in Hong Kong. Jiang tried to force Xi to\h
crush Hong Kong protests with violence.

134
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,840
Neither side succeeded.\h
Who has the upper hand now?

135
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,840
In the deadly political battle between Xi Jinping\h
and Jiang Zemin , Hong Kong has been a stronghold\h\h

136
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,000
for Jiang’s faction. But Xi might use the\h
Falun Gong issue in Hong Kong to his advantage.

137
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,080
According to SinoInsider, in the debate between\h
Hong Kong Secretary for Security Chris Tang\h\h

138
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,480
and pro-Beijing lawmakers, Tang\h
was speaking for Xi’s faction\h\h

139
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,840
when he refused to commit to banning Falun Gong.

140
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,320
While the pro-Beijing lawmakers trying to start a\h\h

141
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
crackdown on Falun Gong were\h
speaking for Jiang’s faction.

142
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
Basically, for years Jiang’s faction\h
has been trying to get Xi Jinping\h\h

143
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
to take over responsibility for\h
the crackdown on Falun Gong,\h\h

144
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:18,000
which Jiang started. Meanwhile Xi has been\h
resisting that. He wants to use the threat\h\h

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,920
of exposing the true extent of the Jiang faction’s\h
actions against Falun Gong to keep them in line.

146
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,080
Xi has also been slowly\h
dismantling Jiang’s power base.

147
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,080
That includes things like\h
eliminating the 610 Office,\h\h

148
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,320
which Jiang used to persecute\h
Falun Gong and accumulate power.

149
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,960
If that carries over to Hong Kong, it would\h
explain the sudden disbanding of the Hong Kong\h\h

150
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,360
Youth Cares Association last year, which\h
was also used to persecute Falun Gong.

151
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,440
Meanwhile, the Jiang faction wants to use unrest\h
in Hong Kong to undermine Xi Jinping’s ability\h\h

152
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,280
to get a record third term as Party\h
leader, which he will try to do next year.

153
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,880
Xi obviously wants to prevent that.\h
Because Xi wants to be presitator for life.

154
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,880
According to SinoInsider, if Xi succeeds against\h
Jiang, he may increase the suppression of Falun\h\h

155
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,320
Gong in Hong Kong, but he wouldn’t outright ban\h
the group before he gets a third term next year.

156
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,480
But if Jiang comes out on top, then the ban\h
on Falun Gong could happen a lot quicker,\h\h

157
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,920
because Jiang’s faction would use that to\h
blame Xi for a harsher Hong Kong crackdown.\h\h

158
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,520
Their ultimate goal is to weaken Xi\h
enough to get rid of him altogether.

159
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
That’s intense. General Hostility\h
always keeps me on the edge of my seat.

160
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,240
The Chinese Communist Party just\h
celebrated its 100th birthday.\h\h

161
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,560
But with the power struggle between\h
Jiang and Xi getting worse by the day,\h\h

162
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,520
will the Party make it to 101? Find\h
out next time on...General Hostility.

163
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800

164
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Computer and software crashes, hardware\h
failures, and general computer slowdowns are\h\h

165
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,840
way too common. And they can come up during\h
the worst times—like during a business meeting,\h\h

166
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,600
or when you're traveling away from home,\h
and your trusted IT person isn’t around.

167
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,480
If you're concerned about the health of your\h
computer and want tools to prevent untimely\h\h

168
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,200
system issues, you should be using PC-Doctor\h
