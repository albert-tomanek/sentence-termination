1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,190
Proof the Coronavirus is a Biological weapon

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,260
Small victories for Hong Kong

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,839
And outrage against the Chinese Communist
Party.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,140
That and more on this week’s China News
Headlines

5
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:18,920
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,170
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,530
The coronavirus.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,619
Is it a biological weapon?

9
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:26,560
For a long time, there have been conspiracy
theories

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,130
that the coronavirus that spread from Wuhan,

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,750
China was a biological weapon.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,300
That’s even a conspiracy theory t

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,239
he Chinese Communist Party has pushed.

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,590
The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman tweeted

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,780
the US army brought the coronavirus to Wuhan.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,559
Keep in mind, he’s not just any old crackpot
conspiracist.

17
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,090
He’s the Foreign Ministry Spokesman for
a country.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,350
But we’ll never know for sure if the coronavirus

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,219
was a biological weapon, right?

20
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,710
Well, proof has just come out that it is a
biological weapon.

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,020
Just not the kind of bioweapon you were thinking
of.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,840
See, most of the United States’ medical
supplies

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,810
and generic drugs are made in China.

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,790
Great choice, by the way.

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,920
And now, Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,860
is saying they can impose pharmaceutical export
controls to quote,

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,439
throw America into the Mighty sea of the coronavirus.

28
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,210
When the Communist Party threatens to attack
America

29
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,590
by withholding critical medical supplies

30
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,530
needed to stop a deadly virus outbreak—

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,909
that is a biological weapon.

32
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,880
If only America had been willing to do

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,030
the Chinese Communist Party’s bidding,

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,229
this would never have happened!

35
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,159
Speaking of not doing the Communist Party’s
bidding,

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,079
President Donald Trump.

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,170
He loves to call it the Chinese Virus.

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,920
And the Communist Party hates that.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,219
“Recently some U.S. politicians have linked

40
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,740
the novel coronavirus to China.

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,570
This is a smear of China.

42
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,140
We are very angry and strongly oppose it.”

43
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,120
Yeah, “some U.S. politicians”—not gonna
name names here.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Now, I recommend you watch my recent episode

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,350
“Coronavirus: How China Spun Criticism Into
Racism”

46
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:24,830
for a better understanding of what the Communist
Party is trying to do here.

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,750
But in a way, I agree with the Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman.

48
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,290
I think President Trump needs to stop calling
it the “Chinese virus.”

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,260
That’s because we’re just getting into
stupid fights about

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,230
whether saying Chinese virus or Wuhan virus
is racist.

51
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,130
Which turn into fights about whether Trump
is racist.

52
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,110
Which turn into fights about whether *everyone*
is racist.

53
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,330
That is exactly what the Chinese Communist
Party wants!

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,900
Because it means we’re so busy fighting
each other

55
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,850
that we’re losing sight of the bigger picture
here.

56
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,150
I don’t advocate calling the coronavirus

57
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,720
the Wuhan virus or the Chinese virus.

58
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,800
It’s unfair to the Chinese people who are
victims

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,730
of their authoritarian regime—

60
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,500
the one that caused this problem in the first
place,

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,590
by covering up the spread of the virus and
silencing

62
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,040
people who tried to get the truth out.

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,410
Let’s not forget that it’s the Chinese
Communist Party—the CCP—

64
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,120
that’s ultimately responsible for this pandemic
and all the people

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,980
who will die from it.

66
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,450
So I say, from now on, we call it the CCP
Coronavirus.

67
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,250
All the cool kids are doing it!

68
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,272
Which is why I have to tip my hat to the law
firm in Florida

69
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:40,390
that is suing the Chinese regime for their
coronavirus coverup.

70
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,960
“[The Chinese Government] suppressed information

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,670
rom the global medical community that could
have averted

72
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,560
or minimized the damage that has been done.”

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,410
So props to that Florida law firm.

74
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,851
Because if there’s one foe the Chinese Communist
Party

75
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:56,710
should be afraid of, it’s Florida Man.

76
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,510
I assume that’s what the lawyers in Florida
look like.

77
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,290
Of course, the Chinese Communist Party completely
denies

78
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,070
the ridiculous accusations that they would
ever

79
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,900
want to suppress information.

80
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,940
On a totally unrelated note,

81
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,340
China just announced it will expel American
journalists.

82
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,400
That includes, “American journalists working
for The New York Times,

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,840
The Wall Street Journal and The Washington
Post”

84
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
That is a blow.

85
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,320
I wonder if those media companies will continue

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,980
taking money from China’s propaganda department

87
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,410
to publish the Communist Party propaganda

88
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,030
called China Watch in their newspapers.

89
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,710
Chinese authorities say their decision to
expel American journalists

90
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,500
is because the Trump Administration put restrictions

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,040
on Chinese state-run media operating in the
US—

92
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,490
because, you know, they’re Chinese state-run
media,

93
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,520
and therefore by definition agents of the
state.

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,510
But even those restrictions did not expel
all the journalists,

95
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,510
or force those Chinese media to shut down.

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,240
Still, China’s foreign Ministry Spokesman

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,400
said this is ultimately America’s fault.

98
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,870
“The steps China has taken are countermeasures

99
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,470
to the US’s unreasonable oppression of Chinese
media.

100
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,730
China is compelled to take them.

101
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,520
China shouldn't be responsible for the cause

102
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,430
and the result of the current situation.

103
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,170
If any American media has any issue,

104
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,040
please raise it to the US government.”

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,850
That’s a tall order.

106
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,220
I can’t remember a time when American media

107
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,900
have ever been willing to criticize the US
government.

108
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,920
But the Trump Administration is not taking
China’s actions lying down.

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,810
“U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on
Tuesday hit back at China

110
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,560
over its decision to kick out American journalists
from the New York Times,

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,850
Wall Street Journal and Washington Post.”

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,810
“The Chinese will tell you that they want

113
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,100
more people to know about their country,

114
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,530
yet they continue to take actions like the
one you've seen today,

115
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,370
where they deny the world the capacity to
know

116
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,800
what's really going on inside another country.”

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,920
I can’t imagine what the Chinese Communist
Party

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,160
would be trying to cover up.

119
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,500
The Chinese Communist Party has been trying
to spin

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,550
the coronavirus at home and abroad.

121
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,850
You know, focus less on the coverup and more
on how swift, decisive,

122
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,290
transparent, and cooperative China’s coronavirus
response has been.

123
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,870
In other words, they are lying through their
teeth.

124
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,060
State-media have also been praising...their
state-media reporters,

125
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,420
for their brave coverage of the epidemic.

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,180
Like Liao Jun.

127
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,030
Only problem is, Chinese people hate all of
it!

128
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,530
“Chinese social media has recoiled with
anger at the lionization of Ms. Liao,

129
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,580
saying she helped propagate fictions that
clouded

130
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,730
the severity of the outbreak in its early
days.”

131
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,800
And that anger is now flaring “into broader
attacks

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,340
on the Communist Party’s muzzling of the
news media.”

133
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,870
So now, the Party will do what it always does

134
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,980
when its propaganda backfires.

135
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,820
Attack the critics!

136
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,460
“Online enforcers are dragging in hundreds

137
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,270
for questioning as an assault on online speech
continues.”

138
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,410
That includes any pesky tycoons who criticize
Xi Jinping.

139
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,520
Wait, are we actually getting to the point
where Chinese citizens

140
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,240
are less likely than Americans to believe

141
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,210
Chinese Communist Party propaganda?

142
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,080
Speaking of the Party’s coronavirus coverup,

143
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,190
remember Dr. Li Wenliang?

144
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,389
He was detained by the police after warning
his colleagues

145
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,560
about the coronavirus on Chinese social media.

146
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,550
He later died of the coronavirus himself,

147
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,960
which sparked a huge backlash against the
government in China.

148
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,030
Well, Chinese authorities have investigated
Dr. Li’s case,

149
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,480
and guess who’s to blame?

150
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,760
The local police!

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,520
It was their fault.

152
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,551
And they will be dealt with accordingly.

153
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,010
The investigators also wanted to clear one
little thing up.

154
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,480
You see, it appears that some “hostile forces”

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,930
are attacking the Communist Party by calling
Dr. Li

156
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,150
a “hero” for standing up to the system.

157
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,300
Well, the joke’s on those hostile forces,

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,640
because Dr. Li was a member of the Chinese
Communist Party!

159
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,990
Is that really the message you want to go
with?

160
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,490
Dr. Li was a member of the Communist Party,

161
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,180
which was ultimately responsible

162
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,570
for the spread of the disease that killed
him.

163
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,570
So there!

164
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,889
We showed you!

165
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:25,889
In other news,

166
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,580
now might be a good time to quit the Chinese
Communist Party.

167
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,209
Speaking of getting rid of the Chinese Communist
Party,

168
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,520
here’s an update about Hong Kong.

169
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,810
You may remember how the city has been embroiled

170
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,789
in massive protests against the Chinese regime
for nine months.

171
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:43,729
Well, according to a Reuters Exclusive,

172
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,950
what we all thought was happening turns out
to have been true—

173
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,140
“Officers from China’s top internal security
force—

174
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,980
the People’s Armed Police—

175
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,870
joined Hong Kong police on the frontlines.”

176
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,250
Color me shocked.

177
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,950
But another blow might be coming to the forces
of evil in Hong Kong.

178
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,050
Remember back in August when Hong Kong police

179
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,510
attacked protesters on the Hong Kong subway?

180
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,180
Well, a court has ordered the subway operator
to release CCTV footage of it.

181
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,990
Authorities claimed there was no police brutality.

182
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,339
Really?

183
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,760
Well, now they might have a harder time denying
that.

184
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,960
Another small victory for the Hong Kong protest
movement: Chan Kin-man,

185
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,140
one of the leaders of the 2014 Umbrella Movement,

186
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,279
has been released from an 11-month prison
sentence

187
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,060
he got for peacefully protesting.

188
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,000
He said he had no regrets.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,620
But Europe is about to have some major regrets.

190
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,310
France is going to allow Huawei gear in its
5G network.

191
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,540
The US has called Huawei a national security
threat,

192
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,080
since it’s closely tied to the Chinese Communist
Party.

193
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,580
You know, the one responsible for the CCP
Coronavirus

194
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,220
that’s spreading around the world.

195
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,940
I guess France surrendered to the pressure.

196
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,400
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also a
fan of Huawei.

197
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,610
She’s trying to block other lawmakers from
blocking it.

198
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,649
It’s like there’s a split in Berlin,

199
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,420
where one side is in favor of the communists.

200
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
Speaking of which,

201
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,860
Merkel says there’s no reason to be suspicious

202
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,649
of gifts of medical supplies from China.

203
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,570
I believe this is how they’re shipping them.

204
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,430
Part of the problem with getting medical supplies
from China

205
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,200
is how the Chinese regime uses them as propaganda.

206
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Hua Chunying

207
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
shared this video of Italians singing thank
you China

208
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,820
as the Chinese national anthem plays.

209
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,730
The problem is, it’s fake.

210
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,589
Or as the Italians say, fake news.

211
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,250
With the CCP coronavirus happening,

212
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,610
many people have been forced to stay at home.

213
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,480
But even so, exercise is still important.

214
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,690
I would just think, military exercises might
not be the priority.

215
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,529
Despite the pandemic,

216
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:09,040
the Chinese regime is still finding time to
harass Taiwan.

217
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,930
Some things never change.

218
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,040
Next up, I’ll answer a question from a fan

219
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,190
who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

220
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,260
But first, did you know YouTube has been secretly

221
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,130
unsubscribing people from the show?

222
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,990
Take a moment to make sure you’re still
subscribed.

223
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,050
And if you haven’t subscribed, what are
you waiting for?

224
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,580
This question comes from carbide149.

225
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,290
“Would you say that ordinary citizens are
falling for China's lies

226
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,020
as much as media outlets and politicians have?”

227
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,830
Ah, that’s actually a question with a very
encouraging answer.

228
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,050
Some Western media are unfortunately

229
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,750
eating up the propaganda about racism,

230
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,150
and the lies that China’s response to the
coronavirus

231
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,520
was so much better than the West’s.

232
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,730
But as I mentioned earlier in the episode,

233
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,520
many Chinese people are furious at the Chinese
regime.

234
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,820
China was the worst hit by the CCP Coronavirus
pandemic.

235
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,770
And the response by the regime has been more
brutal than helpful.

236
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,840
A lot of people in China also know the Party
tried to cover it up,

237
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,600
and persecuted doctors who tried to blow the
whistle.

238
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,790
And this reminds me of something Chinese lawyer
Chen Guangcheng

239
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,560
told Shelley in an interview a couple months
ago:

240
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,440
The people he’s in contact with in China
all understand

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,930
that the Chinese Communist Party

242
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,910
is the cause of the problems in Chinese society.

243
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,170
They just can’t say so online, because they
might be arrested.

244
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,910
But they know it, and they don’t like it.

245
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,430
So some day, I really think the Chinese Communist
Party

246
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,810
will be taken down by the Chinese people.

247
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,330
And many reporters in the West will be left
scratching their heads

248
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,670
wondering how it happened.

249
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,200
That’s how it went down with the Soviet
Union.

250
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,000
That’s how it will go down with the Chinese
Communist Party.

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,420
Thanks for your question Carbide149.

252
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,839
And thank you for watching.

253
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,839
Remember,

254
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,840
YouTube has been demonetizing almost all of
our videos.

255
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,760
They’d have run us out of business

256
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,020
if it weren’t for support from fans like
you

257
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,670
who contribute through the crowdfunding website
Patreon.

258
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,430
I call them the China Uncensored 50-cent army.

259
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,149
