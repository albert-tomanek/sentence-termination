1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:02,710
Is Hong Kong descending into chaos?

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,710
Or parties?

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,490
Either way, the Chinese Communist Party

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,700
Is threatening to intervene.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,639
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,780
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,880
The situation in Hong Kong is getting out
of control!

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,489
At least according to the Chinese Communist
Party.

9
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,050
It makes sense.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,349
If the Party gradually steals away Hong Kongers’
freedoms

11
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:26,950
without anyone noticing,

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,390
everything is going according to plan.

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,050
If people stand up for themselves,

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,010
the situation is totally out of control!

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,800
And obviously, the best way to bring it under
control,

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,360
is for Beijing to get involved

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,140
in some unspecified but threatening manner!

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,890
“A senior Chinese official in charge of
Hong Kong affairs

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,130
warned that Beijing would intervene if the
local government

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,210
proved unable to contain the violent protests.”

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,230
He said the protests,

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,100
“have clear characteristics of a color revolution.”

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,500
So, let’s check in on those violent protests.

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,351
Ok that looks less like a color revolution

25
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,699
and more like a color-ful laser show.

26
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,120
And sing along.

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,140
Which turned into a dance off!

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,990
Hey, it’s friend of the show Tom Grundy,

29
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,370
editor in chief of Hong Kong Free Press.

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,110
That, uhh, violent protest was in response
to

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,400
the arrest of a university student.

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,240
Plainclothes police arrested him for what
they called

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,570
buying an offensive weapon.

34
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,060
That weapon...was a laser pointer.

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,970
Protesters have used laser pointers to disrupt
police cameras.

36
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,450
The fear is that police will later identify
protesters

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,650
and arrest them for rioting.

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,620
Those fears...are justified.

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,880
The city of Hong Kong has been in turmoil
for two months.

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,600
It’s because of the Chinese Communist Party’s
attempts

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,040
to gradually remove Hong Kong’s democracy
and freedom.

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,270
Protests in Hong Kong have been heating up.

43
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,690
Earlier this week,

44
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,400
protesters lit a bonfire outside a Hong Kong
police station.

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,090
Police responded with tear gas.

46
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,810
And one protester responded with a molotov
cocktail—

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,290
the most offensive kind of cocktail.

48
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,840
Well, after an Espresso Martini.

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,159
This week also saw a thousand lawyers taking
to the streets in protest.

50
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,730
That’s the second time lawyers have marched
in the streets since June.

51
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,019
So many lawyers,

52
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,909
that truly is terrifying.

53
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,329
And it’s not just lawyers.

54
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,400
Over the last two months,

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,060
there have also been protests from mothers,

56
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,329
retirees, aviation workers,

57
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:30,290
government employees, and bankers.

58
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,930
Yes, the bankers are out on the streets!

59
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,709
This truly is chaos.

60
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,239
On Monday, there was also a general strike

61
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,099
and protests throughout the city,

62
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,689
despite Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s
warning

63
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,590
that protesters were going down “a path
of no return.”

64
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,590
During the strike,

65
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,700
Hong Kong police fired 800 canisters of tear
gas in one day.

66
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,919
Which was impressive,

67
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,669
since they had only shot 1000 tear gas canisters

68
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,700
in the previous two months combined.

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,779
I’m old enough to remember when

70
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,069
police firing 150 tear gas canisters in a
day

71
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,640
was a record.

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,879
That was less than two months ago.

73
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,599
On the plus side, these protests

74
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,019
have been a boon for the tear gas industry.

75
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,499
And if you’re wondering why some protests

76
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,319
seem to end in tear gas,

77
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,459
and others end in dance parties,

78
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,750
I have noticed it seems to depend on

79
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,150
whether or not the police show up.

80
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,150
Interesting.

81
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,319
But the situation in Hong Kong will only get
worse.

82
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,739
Protesters are already calling for another
protest this weekend.

83
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,790
And they’re using lightsabers as a play
on laser pointers.

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,889
Meaning now, Hong Kong protesters will face

85
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,239
their greatest enemy yet—

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,900
a copyright lawsuit from Disney.

87
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,299
And may I just remind everyone that Google
and YouTube

88
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,769
have taken to instantly demonetizing,

89
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,859
and in some cases age-restricting,

90
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,079
our Hong Kong videos.

91
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,870
That’s why we need your help.

92
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,589
Share this episode with your friends and family.

93
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:56,400
Because YouTube won’t.

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,089
And now I’ll answer a question

95
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,139
from a fan who supports China Uncensored

96
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,680
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

97
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,689
We couldn’t afford to keep making China
Uncensored

98
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:10,390
if it weren’t for the support of fans I
call my 50-Cent Army.

99
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,919
Joe King asks,

100
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,430
“Chris, does the weather pattern around
Taiwan mean

101
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,220
there is only a certain time of year

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,450
it is possible to try an invasion?”

103
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,050
Actually yes.

104
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,700
According to Taiwan expert Ian Easton

105
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,570
of the Project 2049 Research Institute,

106
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,110
there are only two narrow windows of time
each year

107
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,710
that it would be possible to move large numbers
of Chinese troops

108
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,350
by boat across the Strait of Taiwan.

109
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,280
I mean, if invading the island of Taiwan were
easy,

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,850
the Party probably would have tried by now.

111
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,540
As it is, despite all the talk of invasion,

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,720
the Chinese Communist Party probably would
find

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,180
the whole prospect far too risky,

114
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,630
especially when there’s turmoil in Hong
Kong,

115
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,350
which is a problem much closer to home.

116
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,090
Thanks for your question, Joe.

117
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,350
And if you have a question for me

118
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,290
you want to hear answered on the show,

119
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,540
sign up to join the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

120
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,270
by supporting the show with a dollar or more
per episode.

121
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,550
Again, YouTube is demonetizing us so much

122
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,910
we would have to shut down the show

123
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,980
if it weren’t for your support.

124
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,990
And to everyone,

125
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,990
thanks for watching!

126
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,380
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

127
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,440
See you next time.
