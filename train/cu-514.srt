1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,240
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,220
Get off my plane!

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,350
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,800
United Airlines:

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,320
Fly the Friendly Skies.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,170
Unless you’re still sitting on the tarmac.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,849
Then it’s Mad Maxx.

9
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,560
By now, it seems everyone in America

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,700
has seen this video.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,140
But what you may not know

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,239
is that it’s also gone viral in China—

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,059
and for some unusual reasons.

14
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,550
But first, for those of you who don’t watch
TV,

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,150
don’t read newspapers,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,449
don't use the Internet,

17
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,870
live in a cave, and rely on China Uncensored

18
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,920
as your sole source of edutainment—

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,230
here’s the background.

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,230
On Tuesday, this video emerged

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,440
of police dragging a 69-year old doctor

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,090
from his United Airlines flight.

23
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,000
In the process, he was visibly injured.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
What heinous crime did he commit?

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,780
Well, if you ask United Airlines,

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,030
they’d tell you:

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,510
They needed to get their employees

28
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,360
on an overbooked flight,

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,460
got no volunteers to switch,

30
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,910
and eventually randomly selected four unhappy
passengers

31
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,130
to be removed from the plane.

32
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,310
Technically, United is allowed to do that,

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,340
but it became a PR nightmare for them.

34
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,720
That’s because the unhappiest of the four
passengers

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,920
refused to leave,

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,270
so Chicago Aviation Police had to

37
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,250
“re-accommodate” him.

38
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,960
With force.

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,760
So why has the Chinese internet

40
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,130
exploded over this?

41
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,960
Well, it’s largely because

42
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,870
the unhappy passenger is Asian—

43
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,510
Chinese-Vietnamese to be exact.

44
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,870
A passenger on that flight

45
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,970
recalled him saying,

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,040
“I’m being selected because I’m Chinese.”

47
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,830
Now whether or not that's true,

48
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,160
It fits a widely held view in China

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,780
that when Chinese are the victims

50
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,090
of crimes overseas,

51
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,700
it’s because of race.

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,250
A view often encouraged

53
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,580
in Chinese state-run media.

54
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,580
For example,

55
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,580
the incident last month

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,040
where Paris police shot and killed a Chinese
man

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,850
had state-media questioning

58
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,390
whether it was race-related.

59
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,770
So it should be unsurprising

60
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,750
that the United incident video

61
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,340
has gone viral in China.

62
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,660
It has been viewed more than 550 million times
and counting

63
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,560
on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter.

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
And with it has come

65
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,560
nearly a quarter million comments.

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,530
A lot of commenters are angry about discrimination

67
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,710
against Chinese people.

68
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,640
Others are saying America is hypocritical

69
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,040
for criticizing other countries’ human rights.

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,330
So this incident has become like propaganda
Christmas

71
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,650
for the Chinese Communist Party.

72
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,910
Not that the officially atheist Communist
Party

73
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,290
would celebrate that kind of opiate for the
masses.

74
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,540
But anyway,

75
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,540
Chinese state-run media

76
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,500
have been having a field day.

77
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,370
Plus, since Chinese Communist Party

78
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,780
is behind almost half a billion

79
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,660
fake social media posts a year,

80
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,980
I think it’s safe to say they’re fanning
the flames

81
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,010
on Chinese social media as well.

82
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,830
If everyone is being guided to be morally
outraged

83
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,370
at the United States,

84
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,040
they’ll have less time to be morally outraged

85
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,090
at issues closer to home.

86
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,540
You see, the Chinese Communist Party has a
problem.

87
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,100
As Foreign Policy points out,

88
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,590
when the Chinese Internet argues about America,

89
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,410
“the real subject under discussion

90
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,350
is often the Chinese government

91
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,820
and how inferior or superior it is

92
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,930
to the U.S. system.”

93
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,100
Guess which side

94
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,710
China's internet police are on?

95
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,400
Because it's true that America is dangerous.

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,569
With its freedom and democracy

97
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,540
and breathable air.

98
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,620
And Chinese state-media have a hard time

99
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,870
breaking the cultural hold America has.

100
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,370
So state-run media will exaggerate and manipulate

101
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,020
news stories to make America

102
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,520
seem like a ruthless, racist land.

103
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,900
Like when Chinese authorities issue

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,770
their annual human rights report on the US.

105
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,770
Hmmm,

106
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,940
"gunshots lingering in people's ears

107
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,180
behind the Statue of Liberty".

108
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,330
Those creative writing classes are really
paying off.

109
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,330


110
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,330
But that's why this United story

111
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,250
is such a gift to state-run media.

112
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,190
They barely had to do anything to it at all.

113
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,340
The point is to convince everyone in China

114
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,350
that they're much better off under the benevolent
dictatorship

115
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,940
of the Chinese Communist Party.

116
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,150
The benevolent dictatorship

117
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,120
where the kind, gentle city management police

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,000
treat law-abiding citizens like this.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,730
Or this.

120
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,460
Or this.

121
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,960
So yes,

122
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,880
it’s debatable whether United Airlines

123
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,400
really needed to “re-accommodate” these
passengers,

124
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,060
and there are really legitimate concerns

125
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,150
over how it was handled.

126
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,400
But the outrage in China

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,750
might include a tiny bit of deflection

128
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,310
from a regime that frequently "re-accommodates"
the organs

129
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,960
of prisoners of conscience.

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
And let's not forget that besides having Internet
police

131
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
guide the opinions of Chinese netizens,

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
the Communist Party heavily censors the Internet,
too.

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,810
Like this censorship directive issued to

134
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,310
"find and delete negative and harmful commentary"

135
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,560
about a man in Beijing

136
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,620
who mysteriously died in police custody.

137
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,130
But you probably won't see any censorship
directives

138
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,490
to stop people from posting on the United
issue.

139
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,770
Which is another reason the topic

140
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,360
has become so big on Chinese social media.

141
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,770
So remember,

142
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,510
next time you’re flying with United

143
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,610
and you get “volunteered,”

144
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,480
just be thankful you don’t have to deal
with

145
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,949
Chinese city management police.

146
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,490
So what do you think of the United scandal

147
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,919
and the response in China?

148
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,639
Leave your comments below.

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,639
And if you haven’t,

150
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,241
take a moment to sign our petition to Apple.

151
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:47,520
Apple has blocked the China Uncensored app
from Apple TV

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,210
in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

153
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,570
Because that would make the Chinese Communist
Party sad.

154
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,010
Let them know what you think.

155
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,949
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

156
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:00,180
Once again your host, Chris Chappell,

157
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,740
see you next time.

158
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,240
Wow, that city management police is such a...

159
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
jerk.

160
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,580
And by the way,

161
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,640
can I just ask,

162
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,080
what exactly were they planning to do with
that porcupine?

163
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,740
Acupuncture?
