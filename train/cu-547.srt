1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,860
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,140
does this corruption make me look fat?

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,600
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,610
You know,

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,370
the Chinese Communist Party is a little like...

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,370
Smaug!

7
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,300
Sure, it seems big and scary.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,869
But then it starts to show off…

9
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,949
My teeth swords.

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,050
My claws are spears.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,370
My wings are a hurricane!

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,540
And reveals its greatest weakness.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,540
Hmm,

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,160
does this mean I’m Bilbo?

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,250
No, I’m pretty sure I’m someone else.

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,820
Anyway, it’s a common problem:

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,420
The big scary bad guy has a glaring weakness.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,210
In the Communist Party's case, it’s corruption.

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,570
In 2012, then-Chinese leader Hu Jintao passed
the torch to Xi Jinping.

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,829
But before he retired, Hu warned that failing
to defeat corruption

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:09,520
And so Xi has made rooting out corruption
kinda his thing.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,550
Since Xi’s anti-corruption campaign began
in 2013,

23
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,501
he’s taken down more than one million officials.

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,501
(Show Headline
'One million' Chinese officials punished for

25
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,501
corruption

26
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,790
That’s according to official statistics
just released

27
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,700
by the Central Commission on Disciplinary
Inspection,

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,770
the government organ in charge

29
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,710
of Xi’s anti-corruption campaign,

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,280
and headed by China’s most woeful man,

31
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,700
Wang Qishan.

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,190
But why stop at a million?

33
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,710
Xi and Wang are just getting started.

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,940
The Central Commission on Disciplinary Inspection

35
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,060
also partnered with Party mouthpiece CCTV

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,060
to make this:

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,270
a reality show starring some of the biggest
officials

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,270
taken out.

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,560
It’s called “The Real Corrupt Officials
of Beijing.”

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,650
What’s that, Shelley?

41
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,880
Oh, it’s called “Always on the Road.”

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,920
Weird.

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,080
Fortunately,

44
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,440
my favorite state-run media,

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Global Times, explains the unusual title:

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,220
“The [anti-corruption] campaign is ‘always
on the road’

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,530
and will never turn back.”

48
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,659
Ah, of course.

49
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,060
How silly of me for not immediately getting
it.

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,630
The show's featured confessions

51
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,850
include Bo Xilai and Zhou Yongkang,

52
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,200
two of Xi Jinping’s biggest rivals.

53
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,760
Also giving a totally uncoerced confession
is Zhou Benshun,

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,870
who confessed to the heinous crime

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,640
of giving his dead pet turtle Buddhist burial
rites.

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,030
Communist Party officials are suppose to be
atheists, you see.

57
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,810
Let’s hope he never met fellow “confessionaire”
Zhang Jianjin.

58
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,349
He’s a former Party secretary for a pharmaceutical
company

59
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,860
who was often treated to extravagant meals,

60
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,720
including a three-foot long crocodile tail.

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,350
Because anyone can have common food,

62
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,870
like a footlong hot dog.

63
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,700
Just go to the Yulin Dog Meat Festival.

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Anyway,

65
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,180
there’s one thing all of these fallen officials
have in common:

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,540
They acted on their own,

67
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,569
and there is absolutely, definitely, for suresies

68
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,801
no systemic problem within the Communist Party

69
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:07,750
that led to this rampant corruption.

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,780
“The wrong lies with me.” says Li Chuncheng.

71
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,040
“How did a provincial party secretary nurtured
by the party for so many years change into

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,459
this?” said Bei Enpei.

73
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,440
He was sentenced to death for taking bribes
of nearly $38 million.

74
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,670
So are all officials featured in “Always
on the Road” corrupt?

75
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,900
No, of course not!

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,709
One official featured prominently is described
as spartan,

77
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,480
humble, and happy with a simple diet:

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,170
Xi Jinping!

79
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,170
Simple diet?

80
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,380
I guess he does eat a lot of vegetables.

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,420
According to the New York Times,

82
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
“In many areas,

83
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,480
[Party Members] have been ordered to watch
the show.”

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,030
I mean, it would be corrupt not to force people
to watch it!

85
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,030
Now on the one hand,

86
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,150
showing that Xi Jinping is tough on corruption
makes him,

87
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,150
and the Party,

88
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,310
seem powerful.

89
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,470
But on the other hand,

90
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,380
might people start to wonder,

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,680
“Hey, they’ve already punished a million
corrupt officials

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,319
and they’re still going at it.

93
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,489
Is there, maybe, a bigger problem with the
Communist Party?”

94
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:17,959
The correct answer is NO!

95
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,979
All these officials acted completely on their
own,

96
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,720
and there is absolutely no culture created
by the Communist Party that

97
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,760
condones corruption.

98
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,050
Nonetheless,

99
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,290
according to this recent poll by the Pew Center,

100
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,400
“Roughly half (49%) the Chinese public

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,960
says corrupt officials are a very big problem
in the country,

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,150
while another 34% believe they are a moderately
big issue.”

103
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,110
All this comes at a crucial time for the Communist
Party.

104
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,370
Because this week,

105
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,930
it held its annual plenum.

106
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,400
The Sixth Plenum, to be exact!

107
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,630
What’s a plenum?

108
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,630
Well, it’s when China’s top Communist
leaders come together,

109
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,610
don their ceremonial robes,

110
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,900
and seal themselves behind the vaulted doors

111
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,770
to discuss Party policy,

112
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,210
economic strategy,

113
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,010
and once again try to awaken the slumbering
cosmic horror,

114
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,010
Cthulhu.

115
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,610
Just kidding about that last one.

116
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,520
That's actually scheduled for next year's
plenum.

117
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,490
Each plenum has a different theme.

118
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,550
According to Party mouthpiece Xinhua,

119
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,620
this year the Plenum will focus on

120
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,080
“The norms of political life within the
Party

121
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,211
under the new situation,” and

122
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:25,280
“A revision to an intra-Party supervision
regulation.”

123
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,330
Which I think is the Party-speak equivalent

124
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,470
of Xi Jinping saying:

125
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,140
I’m watching you; don’t cross me.

126
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,140
Yes,

127
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,590
if anything has become clear

128
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,800
in the opaque dealings of the Party,

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,330
it’s that Xi has been consolidating power,

130
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,430
by purging political opponents in his so called

131
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,320
Anti-Corruption Campaign.

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,460
“We observe that 77% of local Party secretaries,
governors,

133
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,500
have been rotated,

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,460
the military has been fully restructured,

135
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,090
suggesting that President Xi is fully in power.”

136
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,950
And funny enough,

137
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,600
many of those provincial Party leaders

138
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,620
have recently been referring to Xi as the
“core leader.”

139
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,770
Two thirds of them in fact,

140
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,000
according to Reuters.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,840
And the Communist Party just announced

142
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,800
that Xi is now officially the “core leader”
of the Party.

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,990
That means Xi ranks right up there

144
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,639
with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping—

145
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,639
in other words,

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,580
it means he’s made big headway.

147
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,180
We’ll talk more about this in a later episode.

148
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,889
But Xi’s position is still uncertain.

149
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,070
Many of the 300 Central Committee members

150
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,530
that make up the Sixth Plenum

151
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,590
were appointed by former Chinese leader

152
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,360
and retired Mario villain Jiang Zemin,

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,169
Xi’s biggest political opponent.

154
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,240
And Xi Jinping has another problem.

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,990
The head of his anti-corruption campaign,

156
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,169
Wang Qishan,

157
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,550
is 68 years old.

158
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,550
Theoretically,

159
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,090
68 is the mandatory retirement age,

160
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,780
which means that he’s supposed to retire
at next year’s

161
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,080
Party Congress.

162
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,900
And who would be willing to replace this guy?

163
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,970
Xi Jinping will also be expected to name his
own successor

164
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,350
for when he steps down in 2022.

165
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,180
But that’s only if he follows precedent.

166
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,389
And let’s just say,

167
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,479
Xi is kind of unprecedented guy.

168
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,580
So what do you think?

169
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,530
Is Xi’s anti-corruption campaign saving
the Communist Party?

170
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,110
Or shooting itself in the foot

171
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,800
by exposing its dark underbelly?
