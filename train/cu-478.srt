1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:07,210
Professional Wrestler and Actor John Cena
Accidentally called Taiwan a country.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,260
Is this the end of his career in mainland
China?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:22,310
Welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:35,510
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,290
Did you know American World Wrestling Entertainment
star John Cena speaks Mandarin Chinese?

6
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,500
You want the Chinese version, I'll give you
that too.

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,860
I want the gold belt.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,740
I am the champion.

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,100
I will never give up!

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,289
Like a lot of people who want to get a foothold
in the China market, John Cena began learning

11
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,510
Mandarin many years ago.

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,969
Here he is in 2016 introducing WWE in Mainland
China.

13
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,520
Please allow me to tell you a little about
WWE.

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,190
The WWE marketspace in China wasn’t big
in the past.

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:21,080
I think this is a bad thing.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,170
But the problem with pandering to the China
market is...sometimes you have to pander to

17
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,970
the China market.

18
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,620
And that can get complicated when part of
the China market is Taiwan.

19
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:38,240
On May 8, John Cena did a promotional interview
on Taiwanese television to promote the upcoming

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,300
film “Fast & Furious 9” —and its world
premier in Taiwan.

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,340
“Taiwan will be the first country to see
‘Fast & Furious 9.’”

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,870
I know, you’re shocked.

23
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,430
There’s going to be a Fast & Furious NINE?!

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,670
How many of these freaking movies are they
going to make?!

25
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,450
How do you outdo a submarine car chase?

26
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,730
Also shocking: John Cena just called Taiwan
a country.

27
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,720
“Taiwan will be the first country...”

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,110
And now John Cena is being canceled in mainland
China.

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,870
Because inadvertently referring to Taiwan
as a country instead of a region one time

30
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,420
in a language he’s just learning to speak...is
enough to spark outrage among mainland China’s

31
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,050
butt-hurt online commentators.

32
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,090
You know who you are.

33
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,090
You’re the ones writing angry comments below
this video right now.

34
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,550
But before you do, let me just say one thing:
Taiwan...is...a...country.

35
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,050
It has its own independent, democratic government.

36
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,590
It was never part of the People’s Republic
of China.

37
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,820
Taiwan is a country.

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,390
Now you can finish writing those angry comments.

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,140
But unlike me, John Cena still has dreams
of being in the China market.

40
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,270
And that’s why instead of defending his
comments, he apologized.

41
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,930
Hello China, this is John Cena, I have something
I must say.

42
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:11,950
During the promotion of Fast & Furious 9 I’ve
done tons and tons of interviews, but made

43
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,200
one mistake.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:26,100
I need to say now, it’s very very very very
very important how much I love and respect

45
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,200
China and Chinese people.

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:40,120
I am very sorry for my mistake.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,220
I am very sorry.

48
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,490
Sorry.

49
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,770
Bye.

50
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,540
John Cena is not afraid to take on Vin Diesel
man to man... but he sure wusses out when

51
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,960
it comes to the China market.

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,220
Speaking of Vin Diesel, my favoring Chinese
state-run media, The Global Times, contrasted

53
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,770
the two men, saying “Vin Diesel said he
was grateful to Chinese mainland audiences

54
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:11,080
for supporting the Fast and Furious series,
which led him to do something unprecedented:

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,959
He asked the film company to release Fast
& Furious 9 in the Chinese mainland first,

56
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,140
as a way of thanking mainland fans.”

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,610
“Hello my brothers and sisters in China.

58
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,050
I am Vin Diesel.

59
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,480
Finally I am here.”

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:34,040
So, now Fast & Furious 9 opens in mainland
China first, instead of Taiwan.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:42,180
Although technically, that’s because Taiwan
closed theaters due to a recent spike in Covid-19—a

62
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,960
plague that came from mainland China...like
political correctness.

63
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,550
Speaking of the plague of political correctness,
this brouhaha over John Cena’s comments

64
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,210
are part of a long-standing problem for anyone
who wants to do business in the China market.

65
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,240
It’s one of the strongest tactics used by
Chinese state-run media to manipulate public

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,230
opinion or put pressure on brands and businesses.

67
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:13,200
Back in 2016, Tzuyu, a Taiwanese member of
the famous K-pop group Twice, was seen waving

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,650
the ROC flag on a television show.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,270
And then her agency, JYP Entertainment, allegedly
coerced her into publishing an apology video.

70
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,919
There is only one China.

71
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,610
The two sides of the strait are one body.

72
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,840
I have always identified as a Chinese person,
and a proud one at that.

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,870
(pause…)

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,210
Wow, that looks sincere.

75
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,230
Interestingly enough, that controversy happened
right before Taiwan’s 2016 elections.

76
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,520
The forced apology video didn’t really help
cross-strait relations.

77
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,710
“Taiwan election analysts have said the
issue may have contributed as much as 1 to

78
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,139
2 percent of the electorate’s vote to Ms
Tsai, whose DPP traditionally backs independence

79
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,780
for the self-governed island.”

80
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,070
And the list goes on.

81
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,230
Taiwanese actress Vivian Sung issued an apology
after being caught calling Taiwan her ‘Favorite

82
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,460
Country’ in an old interview.

83
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,640
Zara apologized for simply listing Taiwan
as a country on its website.

84
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,320
More recently in 2020, “two virtual Japanese
YouTube hosts were suspended... from live-streaming

85
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,750
for three weeks” by their talent agency.

86
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,800
“The suspension came after the pair included
Taiwan on a list of countries that had contributed

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,450
the most to their subscribers, and displayed
[Taiwan’s] national flag.”

88
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,800
So even virtual, animated people can be cancelled
for calling Taiwan a country.

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,480
A South Korean variety TV show was also boycotted
by Chinese viewers for showing a Taiwanese

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,009
flag on a game board, posted next to a Chinese
PRC flag.

91
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,580
Apologizing to China has almost become the
norm over the years for everyone in the entertainment

92
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,740
industry.

93
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,320
Very few people can stand up to that kind
of pressure.

94
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,210
Except me, of course.

95
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,660
But the trick is...I’m not very entertaining.

96
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,620
But what actual market impact have John Cena’s
comments had?

97
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,090
I’ll tell you after the break.

98
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,430
Welcome back.

99
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,830
The public outrage over John Cena calling
Taiwan a country shows just how much the China

100
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,650
market can be manipulated to punish foreigners.

101
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,470
Overnight, the approval rating for ‘Fast
And Furious 9’ dropped by 2%.

102
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,880
“Before, it was predicted that the final
box office of ‘Fast and Furious 9’ could

103
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,550
reach 2.3 billion yuan.

104
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,460
But due to the careless speech, the box office
forecast has dropped to 1.5 billion.’”

105
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,680
As other articles put it, “Fast And Furious
9 Villain John Cena, Speaks Chinese Well,

106
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,770
Likes Laoganma [hot sauce], Yet Supports Taiwan?”

107
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:08,199
“There are too many ‘two-faced celebrities’
from foreign countries, and they always want

108
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,040
to come to the mainland only to make money.

109
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,960
Their friendly behavior towards China is not
sincere.”

110
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,330
Even after John Cena’s apology, some Chinese
people just didn’t buy it.

111
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,289
“You better say, in Chinese, ‘Taiwan is
part of China’, or else we will not accept

112
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:28,650
your apology.”

113
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,900
“I’m going to pass out.

114
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,860
In Taiwan, he says Taiwan province is a country.

115
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,089
In the Mainland, he says he respects Chinese
people.

116
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,089
How two-faced.

117
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,050
I don’t understand why Chinese people should
tolerate him.

118
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,311
He’s profiting from Chinese people’s money
with such an unclear political stance, and

119
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:52,779
yet people will still watch his movies?

120
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,519
What generation is this!”

121
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,250
Of course there were some people who focused
on educating the pro wrestler.

122
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:06,741
“Remember from now on, Taiwan is a part
of China, Hong Kong is a part of China, they

123
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,870
were never independent countries.”

124
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,339
“I applaud you for your fast and serious
response in standing up to admit your errors.

125
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,839
If you could record yourself saying Taiwan
is a part of China, that would be even better.

126
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,579
I hope you enjoy China and can spend more
time understanding China.”

127
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:31,279
Well I’m sure he understands China much
better now—after seeing how one sentence

128
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,089
has nearly jeopardized the access to China
he’s worked so hard for.

129
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,990
John Cena is the perfect example of what happens
when optimistic foreigners think they can

130
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,459
have a future in the China market.

131
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:47,679
You spend years learning the language, and
building relationships.

132
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,980
But it’s always a ticking time bomb.

133
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,809
And John Cena’s day just happened to come.

134
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,660
And this is actually a gift to the Chinese
Communist Party.

135
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,720
They don’t really care what John Cena said.

136
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,129
You can’t offend this man.

137
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:09,089
It’s just an opportunity to make a famous
foreigner get down on his knees and beg.

138
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:13,910
And it’s a lesson to other foreigners to
toe the Party line.

139
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,639
And now it’s time to answer a question from
you, viewers who support China Uncensored

140
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,309
by contributing through the crowd-funding
website Patreon.

141
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:28,829
Aladin Masic asks: "If Xi Jinping was to die
from ‘natural causes’ what would happen

142
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:33,050
to the CCP: continue as normal, or a 180?

143
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,839
Xi Jinping's death would mean what for China?"

144
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,690
Interesting question, Aladin.

145
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,559
This has been a topic of much debate.

146
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:46,680
For example, this think tank essay called
The Longer Telegram argues that China would

147
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,800
be better without Xi Jinping.

148
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,939
That it could reform, if only Xi Jinping were
removed.

149
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,949
That...is stupid.

150
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,300
I’m not defending Xi Jinping.

151
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,689
He’s done some very bad things.

152
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:03,360
Like lock up Uyhgurs in concentration camps.

153
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,160
But all the bad things Xi Jinping has done
are just extensions of the terrible things

154
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
the CCP has been doing for more than 70 years.

155
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,929
Like lock up intellectuals.

156
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:16,220
And lock up democracy advocates.

157
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,989
And lock up Falun Gong.

158
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,310
And lock up Tibetans.

159
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,220
Every Chinese leader has at least one group
they arbitrarily go after as a way to maintain

160
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,769
power.

161
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,369
The chance of the Chinese Communist Party
reforming itself and becoming a liberal democracy

162
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:37,059
after Xi Jinping dies...is less than my chance
of teaming up with John Cena in the next big

163
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,059
China movie.

164
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:40,160

169
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
