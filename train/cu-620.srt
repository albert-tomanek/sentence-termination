1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,530
Christmas in China is...

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,120
a little different

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,370
The Western holiday has taken on some new
traditions in China.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,560
Today we’ll show you 7 ways China got Christmas
wrong

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,480
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,980
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,700
Christmas.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,060
The only time of the year when people come
together,

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,860
regardless of our differences,

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,180
to celebrate diabetes.

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,570
Now sure, the meaning of Christmas

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,860
has changed a bit over the years.

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,500
From celebrating the birth of Christ,

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,300
to celebrating all the stuff we can buy.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,540
But the real meaning of Christmas changes
even more

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,550
when something gets lost in translation.

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,249
And this is especially true in China.

18
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,660
So here are 7 ways China got Christmas wrong.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,469
Number 7

20
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,469
Christmas Apples

21
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,719
A Chinese Christmas tradition is handing out

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,980
these fancy cellophane wrapped Christmas apples.

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,059
They usually have a message printed on them,

24
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,559
like Merry X-mass...

25
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,860
...or I love you.

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,550
The reason for apples is because

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,500
the Chinese word for Christmas eve is Ping’an
ye,

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,280
which means a safe or peaceful night.

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Apple is pingguo.

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Different “ping”,

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,630
but it sounds like of like “fruit of peace.”

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,540
How do you like them apples?

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,790
Number 6

34
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,430
Holiday Confusion

35
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,180
In China, Christmas isn’t really the religious

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,360
and/or family holiday it is in the US.

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,880
That’s because the big family holiday in
China

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,390
is the Lunar New Year.

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,680
And no one in any culture wants to have to
travel back home

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,990
to spend time with their family more than
once a year.

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,140
Twice at most, if there’s turkey.

42
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,990
Plus, no one gets Christmas Day off of work.

43
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,810
Instead, everyone gets two weeks off for Lunar
New Year,

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
which is great because you definitely want
to take a vacation

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,050
along with 1.3 billion other people.

46
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,750
Anyway, all of that is why Christmas in China

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,610
is more of a hanging out with friends holiday.

48
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,030
Like Saint Patrick’s Day,

49
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,030
with less drinking.

50
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,159
Or New Year’s Eve,

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,890
with less...drinking.

52
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,380
Or for those with a sweetheart,

53
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,740
like Valentine's Day.

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,909
With more...trees.

55
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,030
It’s also one of the biggest shopping days
of the year.

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,030
So we have that in common.

57
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,190
But that brings us to…

58
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,770
Number 5

59
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,880
Christmas Dinner

60
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,180
So if people aren’t traveling to have

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,910
a big home-cooked meal with extended family,

62
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,890
what will they eat for Christmas dinner?

63
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,400
That’s where Western fast food chains

64
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,790
have stepped in to fill the gap.

65
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,440
After all, who wouldn’t want to

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,310
celebrate Christmas with this?

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,160
A classic Christmas turkey...pizza,

68
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,990
or a steak pizza,

69
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,590
or a shrimp pizza.

70
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,780
Yum.

71
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,140
Yes, Pizza Hut,

72
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,220
that is indeed a taste surprise.

73
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,980
And if I have too much turkey pizza,

74
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,780
I might even be willing to join in on...

75
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,790
Number 4

76
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,620
An actual war on Christmas

77
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,290
Twas the night before Christmas,

78
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,771
and all through the house,

79
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:00,890
hostile foreign forces were lying in wait

80
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,890
in order to undermine China.

81
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,300
At least according to some people.

82
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,880
“Christmas-bashers in China warn against

83
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,680
allowing Western culture to contaminate Chinese
civilization.”

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,290
For example, in 2006,

85
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,720
there was an open letter from Chinese intellectuals

86
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,599
warning that Christmas was just another tactic

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,240
in the West’s soft power invasion of China.

88
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
They warned,

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,099
"[Christmas celebrators in China] are doing
what

90
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,380
western missionaries dreamed to do

91
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,599
but didn't succeed in doing 100 years ago."

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,599
The letter added,

93
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,360
"Chinese people need to treat Christmas cautiously,

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,510
and support the dominance of our own culture."

95
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,970
One city “banned any Christmas-related events

96
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,400
or celebrations in the city's schools,

97
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,380
kindergartens and universities,

98
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,390
despite there being a Christian population

99
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,920
of over one million there.”

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,930
Another city had banners saying

101
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,340
“‘oppose kitsch foreign festivals’

102
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,450
and ‘stop Western culture from expanding.’”

103
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,360
They’ll be happy to know the Communist Party

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
is way ahead of them.

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Number 3

106
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,950
War on Christians

107
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,750
The officially atheist Communist Party

108
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,540
has never been a fan of Christians.

109
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,660
Or really, any ideology or belief

110
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,349
that competes for the love of the people.

111
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,640
Because you can’t be both a Communist Party
member

112
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,620
and a religious believer.

113
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,739
And for non-Party members,

114
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,570
if you want to be Christian,

115
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,280
you have to worship at state-approved churches—

116
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,250
or face severe persecution.

117
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,510
And even if you do go to a state-approved
church,

118
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,820
there’s always the chance authorities will
come along

119
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,940
and tear down your cross.

120
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,780
Or make you take down pictures of Jesus

121
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,970
and replace them with pictures of Xi Jinping.

122
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,270
But you know what makes a great stocking stuffer?

123
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,070
Xi Jinping thought for a new era.

124
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,270
Speaking of stocking stuffers...

125
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,270
Number 2

126
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,270
Santa’s helpers

127
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,699
No, I’m not talking about how in China,

128
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,570
Santa’s helpers aren’t his elves.

129
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,220
They’re his “sisters.”

130
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,970
Something has definitely been lost in translation
there.

131
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,720
But anyway, it turns out the real Santa’s
workshop

132
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,120
isn’t in the North Pole.

133
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,050
It’s in China.

134
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,050


135
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,930
China makes a large percentage of the Christmas
decorations

136
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,530
and presents for the rest of the world.

137
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,680
So much for elves.

138
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,860
And Chinese state-run media don’t want you
to forget it.

139
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,040
“American fellows,

140
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,151
it is Christmas time,

141
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:15,580
a time to wake up,

142
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,300
have a strong cup of coffee,

143
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,430
and see what gifts a Chinese Santa Claus really
delivers.”

144
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,910
You see, some people might start thinking

145
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,270
that Made in China is a bad thing,

146
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,930
and state-run media wants you to know that
it’s great.

147
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,199
Well, it’s great for you.

148
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,930
Maybe not for the Chinese factory workers
who make everything.

149
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,150
That does not look healthy.

150
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,150
But strangely,

151
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,889
Chinese state-run media don’t seem to have
mentioned

152
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,010
how Christmas items might even be made

153
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,320
in Chinese labor camps.

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,830
Or prisons.

155
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,270
Importing products made from prison slave
labor

156
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,240
is illegal in the US, by the way.

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,370
But Chinese prisons manage to get away with
it

158
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,050
by hiding in the supply chain.

159
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,050
You know, once Santa finds out,

160
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,580
those prisons are definitely getting coal
in their stockings.

161
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,449
The stockings that they forced prisoners to
make.

162
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,550
Which brings us to...

163
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,610
Number 1

164
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,770
Smooth Jazz Santa

165
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,070
Even the most recognizable symbol of Christmas

166
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,990
has developed Chinese characteristics.

167
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,259
You see, in China, Santa plays the sax.

168
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,300
Maybe he and the little drummer boy

169
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,949
can get together and form a jazz duo.

170
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,210
But why does Santa play the saxophone?

171
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,389
The Washington Post devoted an entire article
to this mystery

172
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:29,270
and still couldn’t solve it.

173
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,550
The closest they got was that

174
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,040
“it may have to do with Chinese perceptions
of the saxophone

175
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,520
as romantic and cool.”

176
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,770
Saxophones are romantic and cool?

177
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,860
That explains why China is the only country
in the world

178
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,449
where people still like Kenny G.

179
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,639
The Washington Post writer also theorized

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,229
that maybe Bill Clinton’s saxophone playing
in the early nineties

181
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:52,960
inspired the saxophone Santas.

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
That seems a little far-fetched to me.

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
But if true,

184
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,039
we should all be glad that it was early nineties
Bill Clinton.

185
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,669
Because if it was late nineties Bill Clinton,

186
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:09,110
Santa would have been holding a cigar.

187
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,199
So what do you think about China’s Christmas
traditions?

188
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,580
And let me know what your favorite weird Christmas
tradition

189
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,259
is in the comments below.

190
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,500
Mine is listening to the Christmas Rap by
Crew X,

191
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,850
which my friends and I found in the 99 cent
store.

192
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,759
And don’t go anywhere,

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,139
because now is the time when I answer a question

194
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,080
from a member of the China Uncensored 50 cent
army,

195
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,389
fans who support China Uncensored

196
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,120
on the crowd funding website Patreon.

197
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,180
Vanities aks,

198
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,990
“My wife is a bit worried about ever saying
too much on Wechat

199
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,900
because of what the government might do to
her family.

200
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,419
Have you ever heard of families of outspoken
Chinese in America

201
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,860
ever being harassed back in China?”

202
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,960
You know, I hate to say it,

203
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,229
but your wife is probably right to be worried.

204
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,919
WeChat has some serious privacy issues,

205
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,110
which is why a lot of people are suggesting
you delete it.

206
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,110
The problem is,

207
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,110
WeChat is used by 800 million users in China,

208
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,930
so it is a gateway to China.

209
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,210
But the Chinese Communist Party has access

210
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,930
to everything you do on WeChat.

211
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,150
One report told the Committee to Protect Journalists,

212
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,789
“They believe officials accessed their WeChat
account

213
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,550
to surveil the journalist.

214
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,490
The reporter said that after using WeChat

215
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,990
to discuss visiting a friend in another city,

216
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,940
local community officers approached the friend's
family

217
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,050
and warned them not to let the journalist
stay.”

218
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,370
So that shows the Party is willing and able

219
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,220
to not only monitor you,

220
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,220
but also go after the people you chat with.

221
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,289
Private chat groups aren’t safe either.

222
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,050
Now those previous examples were about people

223
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,860
who were inside China using WeChat.

224
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,990
And there have been several cases of people
being jailed

225
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,300
or detained for what they wrote on WeChat,

226
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,539
again, in China.

227
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,270
I am not aware of any cases where someone
using

228
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,330
WeChat outside China has had their family
members

229
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,200
harassed in China.

230
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,990
But security experts say that WeChat outside
China

231
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,730
is just as insecure,

232
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,220
and can be monitored by the Chinese authorities.

233
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,490
And there have definitely been cases of Chinese
authorities

234
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,029
harassing the family members of Chinese dissidents

235
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:03,920
who are outside China.

236
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,360
So your wife should be careful with WeChat.

237
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,410
Thanks for your question, Vanities.

238
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,410
