1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:02,949
Wall Street is selling out to China

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:05,390
And it’s much worse than you think

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,040
But what are they getting in return?

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,260
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,190
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,090
Over the last couple years, the US government
has been getting tougher and tougher on China.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,780
But don’t worry.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,810
Because China has one powerful friend left
in the US: Wall Street.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:36,071
Yes, Wall Street CEOs really want to be BFFs
with the Chinese Communist Party—the kind

10
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:40,440
of best friends who make lots of money together
selling out America.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,109
And Wall Street is not afraid to let people
know.

12
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:48,960
Take Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,140
BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management
company.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,289
It has more than 7 trillion dollars of assets
under management.

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:02,209
It’s invested in things like mutual funds,
retirement funds, and exchange-traded funds.

16
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:08,630
Back in 2018, BlackRock received an award
from the National Committee on US-China relations,

17
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,960
a nonprofit that “promotes understanding
and cooperation” between the US and China.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,340
The award was presented at a black-tie gala
dinner featuring speeches by former Secretary

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,439
of State Henry Kissenger and Chinese Ambassador
Cui Tiankai, who read a congratulatory message

20
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,359
from Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

21
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:37,090
That dinner by the way raised more than 2
million dollars for that nonprofit.

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,159
Is it too late for me to sell out?

23
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,119
Meanwhile BlackRock CEO Larry Fink took the
opportunity to praise China’s leadership.

24
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:54,259
“And the work China has done to lift millions
out of poverty and build a strong middle class

25
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,229
is one of the great economic achievements
of our lifetimes.

26
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:05,530
And when I am in China, I always congratulate
the leaders for what an accomplishment.”

27
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:13,530
Yes, first China’s communist leaders destroyed
their country’s economy for 30 years, then

28
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,170
they actually let people make their own money
again, and finally they took all of the credit.

29
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,590
What an accomplishment.

30
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,640
But Larry Fink didn’t just parrot Chinese
Communist Party propaganda.

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,260
He went on to talk about how China still has
a long way to go, but don’t worry because

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,170
foreign companies can help Chinese people
build their investments.

33
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,360
Foreign companies like BlackRock, I assume.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,140
BlackRock is not alone.

35
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,160
The biggest Wall Street investment banks,
private equity firms, and hedge funds are

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,180
all complicit.

37
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,590
What these companies and their CEOs have done
is shocking.

38
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,410
And I’m going to name names later in this
episode.

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,280
But first, how does Wall Street influence
the US government on China?

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,590
I’ll show you after the break.

41
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,110
Welcome back.

42
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,870
How does Wall Street influence the US government
on China policy?

43
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,920
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro explains.

44
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,150
“Consider the shuttle diplomacy that’s
now going on by a self-appointed group of

45
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,260
Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers
between the US and China.

46
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,810
As part of a Chinese government influence
operation, these globalist billionaires are

47
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:43,190
putting a full court press on the White House
in advance of the G20 in Argentina.

48
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,540
The mission of these unregistered foreign
agents—that’s what they are, they’re

49
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,170
unregistered foreign agents—is to pressure
this president into some kind of deal.”

50
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,000
Navarro is talking about Wall Street pressuring
the Trump Administration to cut a trade deal

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,790
with China back in 2018.

52
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,880
He uses some pretty strong language here,
calling these Wall Street bankers “globalist

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,690
billionaires” and “unregistered foreign
agents” and accusing them of being part

54
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,390
of a “Chinese government influence operation.”

55
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,989
Is that going too far?

56
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,130
Well, consider this.

57
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,120
China’s chief trade negotiator Liu He came
to the US in February 2018 to try and work

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,190
out a trade deal with the White House.

59
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,710
According to the Wall Street Journal, before
Liu even met with US officials, he met with

60
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,380
a group of Wall Street executives.

61
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,260
“Looking for allies in trade talks with
the Trump administration, Mr. Liu dangled

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,810
a prize...Beijing offered to give U.S. financial
firms a new opportunity to expand in China.”

63
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,050
And it worked.

64
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,540
“The get-together helped turn Wall Street
into one of the biggest cheerleaders for a

65
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
[trade] deal.”

66
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,280
Unfortunately for Wall Street, the Trump Administration
wasn’t buying what they were selling.

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,650
Right after President Trump took office, we
predicted on this show that he would put tariffs

68
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,560
on China, based on the fact that he had been
consistently talking about it for decades.

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,760
And a year later, he did.

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,570
And that’s when China’s Wall Street allies
started losing their...clout.

71
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,900
In September 2018, executives from some of
the biggest Wall Street companies traveled

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,620
to Beijing to meet with Chinese Vice President
Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping’s right-hand man.

73
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,030
Those executives also met with “current
and former Chinese officials and bankers...to

74
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,100
find ways to strengthen financial ties between
the United States and China.”

75
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,130
Yeah, if Gordon Gekko were around today, he’d
be smoking his Cuban cigars in Shanghai.

76
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,730
Selling out is good.

77
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,270
But the Chinese Communist Party’s courting
of Wall Street didn’t start because of the

78
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,620
recent trade war.

79
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,910
It’s been going on for decades.

80
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,300
Let’s travel back to the year 1999.

81
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,340
When the biggest thing we were worried about
was the Y2K computer bug, and the biggest

82
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,400
thing we were looking forward to was a new
Star Wars movie.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,370
Well, we’re older and wiser now.

84
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,440
The Matrix also came out that year.

85
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,810
And you just didn’t listen, Mr. Anderson.

86
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,090
In April 1999, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
visited the US.

87
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,080
The purpose of his trip was to lobby US officials
and business executives to support China’s

88
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,590
entry into the World Trade Organization.

89
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,370
He even gave the CEO of Nasdaq a carved wooden
bull.

90
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,720
Highly symbolic, because the Chinese Communist
Party would spend the next twenty years giving

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Wall Street a truckload of bull.

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,970
But Zhu Rongji also played hardball, warning
business executives that they wouldn’t get

93
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,190
access to the China market unless a trade
agreement was quickly approved.

94
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,919
“Taking his case to the American business
interests that have consistently pushed for

95
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,400
expanded commercial ties to the world’s
biggest market, Mr. Zhu insisted that compromises

96
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,700
allowing American telecommunications firms,
farm products, banks and insurance companies

97
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,660
into the Chinese market could all perish.”

98
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,150
Well, it worked.

99
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,020
And the White House ended up giving into pressure
from the business community.

100
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,180
The Clinton Administration helped China join
the World Trade Organization.

101
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,040
And the rest is history.

102
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,360
Really depressing history, involving the loss
of millions of American jobs and the hollowing

103
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,460
out of US manufacturing.

104
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,330
But hey, Wall Street made billions of dollars.

105
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,900
The Chinese Communist Party has learned a
lot about manipulating Wall Street over the

106
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,020
last 20 years.

107
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,150
And I’ll show you a video later that proves
it.

108
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,320
Stick around because it’s explosive.

109
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,360
But first, it’s time to name names.

110
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,150
Right after this short break.

111
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,740
Welcome back.

112
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,680
Who are the biggest Wall Street sellouts?

113
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,260
Well, I can’t go into detail about *all*
of the Wall Street companies that have sold

114
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,990
out to China—or this video would be 20 hours
long.

115
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,050
But I’ll give you some highlights.

116
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,070
Let’s start with BlackRock, the asset management
company I talked about at the beginning of

117
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,430
this episode.

118
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,139
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is gunning for the
China market.

119
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:39,439
In his 2019 letter to shareholders, Fink said
“Our goal is to become one of the country’s

120
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:41,089
leading global asset managers.”

121
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,499
But don’t worry!

122
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,519
This is good for the US.

123
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,350
According to BlackRock.

124
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,240
Blackrock told the Wall Street Journal that
“U.S. financial institutions’ expanding

125
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,240
in China is consistent with the policy goals
of the U.S. government.”

126
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,050
Yes, it’s consistent with the US government’s
policy goals...that were set by Wall Street

127
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,220
in the 90s.

128
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,089
BlackRock’s China ambitions have also affected
the larger investment market.

129
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:11,480
In a pretty disturbing way.

130
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,600
MSCI is one of the biggest index providers
in the world.

131
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,020
Lots of big investors, like banks and government
pension funds, invest according to MSCI’s

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,369
indexes.

133
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:31,069
Back in 2017, MSCI was considering adding
Chinese A Shares, which are stocks that trade

134
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:34,670
in mainland China, to its emerging-markets
indexes.

135
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,189
“The Chinese government lobbied heavily
for the inclusion.

136
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:44,370
The other strong voice that helped drive the
shift was from BlackRock.”

137
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,009
Just that one change “steered tens of billions
of dollars into China’s stock market.”

138
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:57,649
So thanks to BlackRock, the money in your
bank or your pension fund could be invested

139
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:58,990
in China.

140
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,959
And you have absolutely no control over that.

141
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,160
Yay!

142
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,009
Now let’s move from BlackRock to Blackstone.

143
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,110
Blackstone is the world’s largest private
equity fund.

144
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,079
That means it invests money for private groups
of investors.

145
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:22,610
Back in 2007, China’s sovereign wealth fund
bought a stake in Blackstone.

146
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,980
They sold their stake in 2018 as the trade
war with China ramped up.

147
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,810
Blackstone’s CEO Steven Schwarzman has been
called Trump’s China whisperer.

148
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,279
Schwazman says he made eight trips to China
in 2018 on behalf of the White House, “trying

149
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,240
to assure China’s most senior officials
that the president was not looking for a trade

150
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
war.”

151
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,149
I bet that went well.

152
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,959
Schwarzman also helped organize trade talks
between the US and China behind the scenes.

153
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,920
But that’s not his only connection to China.

154
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,089
“Mr. Schwarzman has raised more than $500
million to build a scholarship program in

155
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,360
his name at China’s prestigious Tsinghua
University.”

156
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,339
But educating Chinese youth is a lot better
than what one investment bank did.

157
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:16,149
JP Morgan Chase is one of the few Wall Street
companies that have actually gotten in trouble

158
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,829
with the US government over its China activities.

159
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:26,990
It was forced to pay 264 million dollars in
fines for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices

160
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,990
Act.

161
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:34,709
“Between 2006 and 2013, the bank developed
a referral program, known as ‘Sons and Daughters,’

162
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,629
for applicants connected to business or government
officials that could land JPMorgan work.”

163
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:47,149
“As JP Morgan hired more and more candidates
based on referrals from Chinese leaders, senior

164
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:53,629
bankers in several instances explicitly tied
those jobs or internships to securing deals

165
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,749
with Chinese government-run companies.”

166
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:03,800
So basically JP Morgan Chase hired the children
of Communist Party officials in order to get

167
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,970
business in China.

168
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,139
And they got caught.

169
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,279
And they had to pay 264 million dollars in
fines.

170
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,249
Which may sound like a lot to you and me,
but it’s less than a 10th of one percent

171
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:22,639
of their market cap, so did they really care?

172
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,610
And even what JP Morgan Chase did is small
potatoes compared to investment bank Goldman

173
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:35,720
Sachs, which once employed the grandson of
former Chinese leader and money toad, Jiang

174
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
Zemin.

175
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,819
The book Hidden Hand says “No organisation
has been more important to the CCP’s campaign

176
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,259
to penetrate US elites, or more willing”
than Goldman Sachs.

177
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:52,880
This isn’t surprising, since Goldman also
has close links to the US government, which

178
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,209
the Chinese Communist Party wants to influence.

179
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:02,750
“Goldman Sachs is one of the most heavily
invested financial firms in the [US] federal

180
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,619
government, whether it manifests in the form
of campaign donations, hiring former government

181
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:13,869
officials as lobbyists, or having former employees
receive appointments to powerful cabinet positions.”

182
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:16,179
Mmmm.

183
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,889
So many possible targets of influence.

184
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,059
So little time.

185
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,769
Speaking of Goldman employees that get cabinet
positions: Hank Paulson was the CEO of Goldman

186
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,699
Sachs until he became Treasury Secretary under
George W. Bush.

187
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:37,290
“By the time he became treasury secretary
in July 2006, [Hank] Paulson had traveled

188
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,230
to China about 70 times in his capacity as
a top Goldman Sachs executive.”

189
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,629
By that time, Goldman Sachs had already helped
Chinese state-owned enterprises raise billions

190
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,799
of dollars on the US stock market.

191
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,149
And in his first trip to China as Treasury
Secretary, Paulson even got a private meeting

192
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,819
with then Chinese leader Hu Jintao.

193
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:06,559
Paulson, by the way, is good buddies with
Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan.

194
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,040
They started working together in the 90s.

195
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,269
Wow, that’s the happiest I’ve ever seen
Wang Qishan.

196
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,240
What happened to you Wang?

197
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,739
What horrors have you seen that you dare not
name?

198
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,209
Communism is bad for the soul.

199
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,209
Anyway, back to Hank Paulson.

200
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:31,519
After leaving office in 2009, he set up his
own think tank, the Paulson Institute.

201
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,649
Which is “dedicated to fostering a US-China
relationship that serves to maintain global

202
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,220
order in a rapidly evolving world.”

203
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:46,029
Yes, a relationship that serves to maintain
global order sounds totally normal and not

204
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,429
creepy or authoritarian at all.

205
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:54,389
Moving on to another former Goldman Sachs
executive, John Thornton.

206
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:57,119
He was co-president when Hank Paulson was
CEO.

207
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:03,379
When Thornton left Goldman in 2003, he joined
Tsinghua University as the director of their

208
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:05,429
global leadership program.

209
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:12,399
In 2006, he gave 12.5 million dollars to the
Brookings Institution think tank to fund the

210
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,560
John L. Thornton China Center.

211
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,489
And in 2008, he received the Friendship Award,
the highest honor given to foreign experts

212
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,220
working in China.

213
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,310
Thornton has also been involved in Trump’s
trade negotiations.

214
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:34,220
Back in August 2018, he briefed China’s
trade negotiator Liu He in Beijing.

215
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,129
And Thornton also helped arrange a meeting
between Wang Qishan and...Steve Bannon?

216
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,480
I wonder what those two talked about.

217
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,610
This episode just keeps getting weirder.

218
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,549
I should also mention that in the Trump Administration,
current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

219
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,699
is also a former Goldman Sachs executive.

220
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,259
However, he didn’t really work on the China
side of things at Goldman.

221
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,559
Mnuchin’s China conflicts come from his
former role as... a Hollywood producer?

222
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,939
Whoa, whoa.

223
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:07,019
Wait a minute.

224
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,540
So Mnuchin’s Hollywood ties raise ethical
questions because he was pushing for Beijing

225
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,519
to give Hollywood more access to the China
market.

226
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,149
But Hank Paulson’s Goldman Sachs ties that
directly involved putting American money in

227
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:26,040
Chinese state-owned companies *did not* raise
ethical questions?

228
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,209
Really, New York Times?

229
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:32,930
Don’t get me wrong, when it comes to selling
out to the Chinese Communist Party, Hollywood’s

230
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,859
hands are not clean.

231
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:40,639
But if Hollywood’s hands are dirty, Wall
Street’s hands are caked in 3 inches of

232
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,999
mud.

233
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:46,720
As I’ve spent this whole episode showing,
this problem is not new.

234
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,290
It’s been happening since at least the 1990s.

235
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,810
But it’s likely going to get worse.

236
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,959
Because the Chinese Communist Party has figured
out how to manipulate America’s elite.

237
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,239
And I’ll show you how after this final commercial
break.

238
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,239
Welcome back.

239
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:10,189
As I like to say, the Chinese Communist Party
is great! ...at manipulating America’s elite.

240
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:16,289
I’m going to show you part of a speech given
last month by Di Dongsheng an Associate Dean

241
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:19,850
at Renmin University, a prestigious university
in Beijing.

242
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:26,439
“Because we know that the Trump administration
is in a trade war with us, so why can’t

243
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,530
we fix the Trump administration?

244
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:36,059
Why did China and the U.S. use to be able
to settle all kinds of issues between 1992

245
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,059
and 2016?

246
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,970
No matter what kind of crises we encountered,
be it the Yinhe incident, the bombing of the

247
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,490
embassy, or the crashing of the plane, things
were all solved in no time, like (a couple)

248
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,830
do with their quarrels starting at the bedhead
but ending at the bed end.

249
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,269
We fixed everything in two months.

250
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,269
What is the reason?

251
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,210
I’m going to throw out something maybe a
little bit explosive here.

252
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,930
It’s just because we have people at the
top.

253
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,150
We have our old friends who are at the top
of America’s core inner circle of power

254
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,150
and influence.”

255
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,620
He goes on to tell a story about how an “old
friend of China” from a top US financial

256
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:11,789
institution helped him pressure a famous Washington
DC bookstore into doing an event for Xi Jinping’s

257
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,649
book back in 2015.

258
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,940
I’ve cut that because it’s too long.

259
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,309
But the next clip is definitely worth watching.

260
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,519
“As I said before, since the 1970s, Wall
Street had a very strong influence on the

261
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,409
domestic and foreign affairs of the United
States.

262
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,850
So we had a channel to rely on.

263
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,440
But the problem is that after 2008, the status
of Wall Street has declined, and more importantly,

264
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,169
after 2016, Wall Street can’t fix Trump.

265
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:37,740
It’s very awkward.

266
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Why?

267
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,160
Trump had a previous soft default issue with
Wall Street, so there was a conflict between

268
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,149
them, but I won’t go into details, I may
not have enough time.

269
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:53,559
So during the US-China trade war, they (Wall
Street) tried to help, and I know that my

270
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:59,730
friends on the US side told me that they tried
to help, but they couldn't do much.

271
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:07,860
But now we’re seeing Biden was elected,
the traditional elite, the political elite,

272
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,059
the establishment, they’re very close to
Wall Street, so you see that, right?

273
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:18,520
Trump has been saying that Biden’s son has
some sort of global foundation.

274
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,850
Have you noticed that?

275
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,720
Who helped him (Biden’s son) build the foundations?

276
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Got it?

277
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,260
There are a lot of deals inside all these.”

278
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,630
Now I’m not saying Di Dongsheng is right
about everything.

279
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:35,200
But his speech represents the attitude of
the Chinese elite: the absolute gloating over

280
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,360
the fact they’ve cracked the code to manipulate
American politics, using their old friends

281
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,940
on Wall Street.

282
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,720
Especially if Biden becomes president.

283
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,279
If you’re upset after watching that video,
don’t worry!

284
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,190
This story has a happy ending.

285
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,470
For Wall Street, that is.

286
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,850
Because now that there’s a Phase 1 trade
deal, the Chinese Communist Party is rewarding

287
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,789
a lot of the companies I talked about earlier.

288
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:05,780
For being a good friend to China.

289
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,820
“Since the signing of the trade deal, JPMorgan
will get full control of a futures venture

290
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,419
in which it had a minority stake.

291
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,899
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became controlling
owners of their Chinese securities ventures.”

292
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:26,190
“And in August, BlackRock became the first
foreign firm to win preliminary approval to

293
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,340
start a wholly owned mutual-fund business
in China.”

294
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,730
See?

295
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,270
Selling out *is* good!

296
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,091
Of course, ultimately it’s not going to
be a happy ending for Wall Street, because

297
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:45,650
the Chinese Communist Party is luring American
companies to China for a specific reason.

298
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,690
But that’s a topic for another episode.

299
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,029
Still, the Chinese Communist Party is keeping
Wall Street happy for now.

300
00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:00,130
Because no matter which political party is
in power in America, Wall Street will always

301
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,500
be there to grease the wheels for the Communists.

302
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,159
Like a loyal friend should.

303
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,509
And now it's time for me to answer a question
from a fan who supports China Uncensored on

304
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,509
Patreon.

305
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:14,929
We couldn’t afford to make this show without
their support.

306
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:21,990
zEd asks, “Thank you for the great content...Any
plans to expand further with this momentum?

307
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,159
Asia, Europe, Central/South America Uncensored?

308
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,480
Happy holidays and positive vibes.

309
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,670
Now that’s an interesting question Zed.

310
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,630
I actually was just talking with Matt about
doing new shows.

311
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,660
His suggestion was...that we do a show that’s
just him playing with Legos.

312
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,870
He really likes Legos.

313
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:49,600
And while that’s a...great idea, maybe there’s
some better kind of show we could do.

314
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,190
Shelley had a great idea for a cooking show,
where we invite all the world’s top dictators

315
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,190
on.

316
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,179
It’s called Cooking with Authority.

317
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,690
Kim Jong-Un still hasn’t returned my call.

318
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,720
But if we were to start another show, what
would you like us to do?

319
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,860
Let me know in the comments below.

320
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:28,090
Once again I’m Chris Chapppell, see you
next time.
