1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:16,880
there are philosophers and sociologists who even\h
before covet the kobe crisis and the pandemics\h\h

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:29,200
they pointed at the china model as the uh solution\h
for for for the future in terms of policy and\h\h

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:38,320
politics uh the the the solution to the the\h
the the great big question on sustainability of\h\h

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,040
modern states and all the problems with democratic\h
society and this and this and that and they kindly\h\h

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:56,640
kind of envision a technocratic model uh based\h
on the chinese regime where they say you know the\h\h

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:06,240
ideology marxist ideology is not per se very\h
strong in china anymore they use the name they use\h\h

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:16,640
the framework but but it's not real communism it's\h
a it's a kind of social democrat uh technocratic\h\h

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:26,720
model in which everyone has been he is being\h
taken care of by the state so they don't need to\h\h

9
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,400
to to worry about anything and they\h
even can get rich when the state\h\h

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,680
says you can get rich if you don't put too\h
many question if you do what i want if you\h\h

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,120
if you enjoy the liberty i give you it's not the\h
god-given liberty but it's a ccp given liberty so\h\h

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,920
there are western philosophers sociologists even\h
politicians who think that this chinese model\h\h

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,120
could be the solution to the uh modern\h
democratic problem kobe came into the\h\h

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:12,960
into the scenario and added to that uh in the way\h
you you were saying uh you know look at china uh\h\h

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:21,280
china was so good and so able to resolve quick\h
the the covet problem and this is by the way what\h\h

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:30,880
they say they tell us we don't have um we don't\h
have um any means to verify the the what what the\h\h

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,360
regime says but but many many western corners\h
took that at face value and say yes okay yeah\h\h

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,200
uh beijing was was was was um very practical\h
they they solved the problem so let's adopt that\h\h

19
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,920
that model and of course as you were uh correctly\h
pointing out uh the big enemy of this techno new\h\h

20
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:05,040
technocratic chinese uh model again is his\h
religion organized religious uh churches\h\h

21
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,360
movements uh whatever because they do just the\h
opposite first of all they don't obey the to these\h\h

22
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,200
atheistic god ultimately they\h
have another god they had another\h\h

23
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,920
another superior being to to to whom they\h
they looked so they they okay they cope\h\h

24
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,400
with with the load of the state but if the\h
state gives them liberty so there is some\h\h

25
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,240
tension here that becomes a threat in the\h
eyes of these technocratic chinese apologies

26
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:50,240
and plus big groups churches uh movements\h
of course they are the one who uh\h\h

27
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,240
nurture the virus because we know that you\h
know social distancing in a lot of that and\h\h

28
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,160
repressing uh uh liberty of movements like they\h
did in china is the key to defeat the virus and\h\h

29
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,840
churches and groups and religious groups just do\h
the opposite uh we have seen examples of these\h\h

30
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:25,920
outside of china when huge large religious groups\h
were accused of being nurturing the virus because\h\h

31
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,240
they had big evidence there is no proof that\h
that is true but it's very suitable to the to the\h\h

32
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
ideological language of these people\h
who say you know big governance\h\h

33
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,640
equal to religious groups equal to\h
spreading the the virus it's very useful\h\h

34
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,720
for for people who who see religion as an enemy\h
yeah and again i'm not i'm not trying to sound\h\h

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,120
conspiratorial we we there are facts who can\h
document these uh it happened in korea it\h\h

36
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,160
happened at some extent in taiwan and the whole\h
idea even in the west to shut down churches just\h\h

37
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,200
before uh supermarkets goes back to the idea\h
churches groups religious movements are the\h\h

38
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,280
other problems uh as to the kobe so let's get\h
dream read of them first and then we can discuss\h\h

39
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,800
the the kobe problem it it it originates in\h
the ideology of the of the materialistic regime\h\h

40
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:39,040
like the communist regime in in in china but\h
it it easily goes beyond china been taken\h\h

41
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,680
by some technocratic ideologues and applied to\h
some western society with with some differences\h\h

42
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,360
but you know this is what we are facing now in\h
countries like like mine or or in the west where\h\h

43
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,960
you know the problem is shut down churches before\h
doing anything else because covet is lies in in\h\h

44
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,000
churches this is becoming um a common mentality\h
which is very dangerous dangerous i think uh you\h\h

45
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,920
could even not be a religious person but when\h
you start thinking that religion is the problem\h\h

46
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:25,760
you mean that the most intimate of the human soul\h
is the problem so you need to to repress that\h\h

47
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,840
in order supposedly a democratic society\h
i don't believe that this is democracy

48
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:46,880
you
