1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,060
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,220
what is Xi Jinping thinking?!

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,800
We’re back.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
And it’s time.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,129
They’ve spread the rumors.

6
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:14,440
They’ve tabulated the scores.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,669
Ladies and Gentlemen,

8
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,610
the results of the Chinese Communist Party’s

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,030
19th Party Congress!

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,520
Let’s look at our seven finalists,

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,250
the men who have made it to the top of the
Party:

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,340
the Politburo Standing Committee.

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,700
And here they come!

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,190
Don’t they look great in their black suits
and red ties!

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,170
Wait, am I seeing...

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,750
blue ties?

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,260
And gray hair?

18
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,460
It truly is a new era.

19
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,530
And who has been crowned the ultimate title...

20
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,749
Mr. CCP?

21
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:48,829
“I see this as not just an approval of my
work,

22
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,010
but also as, like,

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,239
an encouragement that will make me want to,

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,309
like, do even better, you know?”

25
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:57,850
Of course, the 6-day event leading up to this
point

26
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,069
was incredibly boring.

27
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,469
Basically, an official gives a long speech.

28
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,960
Another official gives a long speech.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,440
And then they break up into small groups

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,240
to do more long speeches.

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,970
Kind of like the world’s worst company retreat.

32
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,300
“And for our next icebreaker,

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,460
turn to the official next to you

34
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,650
and say your name,

35
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,910
plus a quote from Karl Marx

36
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,210
that begins with the same letter.”

37
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,490
Sitting through that event

38
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,340
was the hardest test of endurance

39
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,210
I’ve ever gone through.

40
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,670
And I say that as someone who, in college,

41
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,920
had a professor lecture for three hours

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
about how Buffy the Vampire Slayer

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
was an image of Christ.

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,820
It was a strange school.

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,920
And yet, that has nothing

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,110
on the three and a half hour lecture

47
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,000
Xi Jinping gave to kick off the Congress.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,550
Seriously, though,

49
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,890
this meeting was really, really important

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,070
for the future of China.

51
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,120
It was just also really, really boring.

52
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,150
Former leader Jiang Zemin was caught yawning.

53
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,060
Oh, no wait, he was just catching a fly.

54
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,120
When Xi Jinping wrapped up his long speech,

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,980
even the other, less important former leader

56
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,510
Hu Jintao was like,

57
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,280
a little longer and we’d all be dead!

58
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,590
But look how happy it made Xi Jinping.

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,410
Not Jiang though.

60
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,810
You might be wondering,

61
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,480
what was Xi Jinping thinking?

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,150
Oh, my friends,

63
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,860
he was thinking Xi Jinping Thought.

64
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,860


65
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Xi Jinping has written himself

66
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,130
into the Communist Party’s Constitution.

67
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,510
It’s this bit,

68
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,880
the “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism

69
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,569
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.”

70
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,709
So what does that stupidly long phrase mean?

71
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,420
It means Xi Jinping is only the second Chinese
leader—

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,190
after Mao Zedong—

73
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,780
to have his name put in the Party Constitution

74
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,170
while he’s still in power.

75
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,560
It’s a big deal.

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,770
According to Bill Bishop,

77
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,140
publisher of Sinocism,

78
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,459
“It means Xi is effectively unassailable
…

79
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,240
If you challenge Xi,

80
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,380
you are challenging the party—

81
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,959
and you never want to be against the party.”

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
Yes, welcome to China’s Xi Jinping Era.

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,349
Xi Jinping is dominating

84
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,880
former amphibian overlord Jiang Zemin.

85
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,430
To be fair,

86
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,209
Jiang Zemin is kind of guilty of genocide—

87
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,240
including the whole,

88
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,910
let’s kill Falun Gong practitioners

89
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,780
and sell their organs for profit campaign—

90
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,840
so I don’t really feel that bad for Jiang.

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,650
But for years on this show,

92
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,580
I’ve been talking about how Xi Jinping

93
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,290
and Jiang Zemin have been locked in

94
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,020
a life-or-death political struggle.

95
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,280
And after this 19th Party Congress,

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,460
it looks like Xi is closer than ever to winning.

97
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,910
State-run media has been singing

98
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,580
Xi Jinping’s praises.

99
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,500
“Enshrining Xi’s thought into the Party
Constitution

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,020
has proved the main highlight of the congress.”

101
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,280
And this is how the major Chinese newspapers

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,140
covered the end of the Party Congress:

103
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,510
Some of their Instagram filters need a little
work.

104
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,569
And Xi wasn’t above lording his big win

105
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,290
over Jiang Zemin.

106
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,550
Check out CCTV’s footage from Xi’s speech.

107
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,940
When they all walk out, J

108
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,370
iang is repeatedly obscured by Xi.

109
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,520
But you can see former leader Hu Jintao.

110
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,190
I don’t need a class in Buffy as an image
of Christ

111
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,720
to know that’s symbolism.

112
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
And check out at the end

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,200
when Xi shakes hands with Hu,

114
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,660
and then...oops!

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,100
Jiang wasn’t in the shot.

116
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,120
In fact,

117
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,360
in the live broadcast that was later altered

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,699
for the online version,

119
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,850
“When Xi gets to a section of his speech

120
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,430
about fighting corruption,

121
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,930
emphasizing a ‘zero tolerance’ approach

122
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,250
toward those in the party

123
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,720
who engage in bribery,

124
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,650
the camera cut to Jiang.

125
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,820
Later, when Xi starts a sentence with

126
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,260
‘what the people and the masses oppose,

127
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,770
what they abhor,’

128
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,470
the camera once again goes to a close-up of
Jiang.”

129
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,900
And if you remember from the headlines

130
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,660
earlier in today’s broadcast,

131
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,520
Xi had his boy Liu Shiyu say Xi Jinping

132
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,970
“saved the party,

133
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,100
saved the military,

134
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,040
and saved the country,”

135
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,560
by foiling attempts by Jiang Zemin’s guys

136
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,580
to take over the Party.

137
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,200
And let’s look at the new guys

138
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,930
on the Politburo Standing Committee.

139
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,530
Of the six other members,

140
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,660
only one has been considered

141
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,990
a member of Jiang’s faction.

142
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,310
But there are also reports

143
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,240
that he’s already defected from Jiang.

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,780
If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.

145
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,410
And having all or nearly all Standing Committee
members

146
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,930
either neutral or on his side is a big win—

147
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,290
even though Xi had to let his favorite Anti-Corruption
Czar retire.

148
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,960
So is this it then?

149
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,510
Is Xi Jinping now the ultimate power?

150
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,240
Has he unquestionably won?

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,310
Not so fast.

152
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,310
For one,

153
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,419
the anti-corruption campaign isn’t over,

154
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:47,420
which means the factional infighting isn’t
over.

155
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,270
There are still members of Jiang’s faction

156
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,169
who haven’t been fully dealt with,

157
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,190
including the final bad guy,

158
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,960
Jiang Zemin himself.

159
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,040
And just because they’re on their way down,

160
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,660
doesn’t mean that they couldn’t still

161
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,419
cause a lot of trouble.

162
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,850
And with Xi Jinping Thought in the Party Constitution,

163
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,040
Xi is now the guy responsible

164
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,270
for the current direction of the Communist
Party.

165
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,680
He’s facing major disasters on all sides:

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,610
An economy that’s imbalanced in crazy ways,

167
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,350
a finance system plagued by bad debt,

168
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,330
a disastrously polluted environment,

169
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,070
and an increasing wealth gap

170
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,860
that underlies widespread public unhappiness.

171
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,280
I mean, who wouldn’t want to be in charge
of all that?

172
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Seriously.

173
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,570
Hu wouldn’t want to.

174
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,080
It’s up to Xi Jinping now.

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,889
