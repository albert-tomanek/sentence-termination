1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,330
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,300
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your
kids.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,710
Unless the Earth is destroyed by nuclear war.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,920
Xi Jinping might be getting his name written
into

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,690
the Chinese constitution.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,960
And an American University that crossed the
Chinese Communist Party

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,070
just got schooled.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,920
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,500
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

10
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:28,269
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:29,779
The Chinese Communist Party has had

12
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:32,550
a lot to freak out over this week.

13
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,940
Most of it revolved around this man.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,410
Kim “Rocketman” Jong-un.

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,809
Yes, Kim’s been burning out his fuse up
here alone,

16
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:42,699
with his insistent push to turn North Korea

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,080
into a nuclear power.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,160
Now, sure, all this science,

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,320
he don’t understand.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,440
It’s just his job 5 days a week.

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,760
Cause he’s a rocket man.

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,670
That is of course what US President Trump
called him

23
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,010
at meeting of the UN Security Council.

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,420
“Rocket man is on a suicide mission for
himself…”

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,420
Now I know there were

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,230
mixed reactions to Trump’s speech,

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,550
and I understand.

28
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,550
On one hand,

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,550
President Trump quoted Elton John at the United
Nations.

30
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,590
That’s got to be worth something.

31
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,310
But on the other hand,

32
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,180
everyone knows that Space Oddity

33
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,680
is the far superior

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,250
“man lost wandering the far reaches of space”

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,250
song.

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,590
So that’s disappointing.

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,430
But calling Kim Jong Un rocket man

38
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,400
does make Trump’s threats to destroy North
Korea

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,920
sound more folksy.

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,310
And you know who definitely liked Trump’s
speech?

41
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,310
Japan.

42
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,380
“We also highly regard President Trump’s
stance

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,960
of announcing all options are on the table,

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,620
and we would like to continue our cooperation

45
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,970
in security matters between Japan and the
U.S.

46
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,350
as well as among Japan,

47
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,240
the U.S. and South Korea.”

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,340
Yes, Japan would absolutely love to continue

49
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,220
its cooperation in security matters.

50
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,800
And you know what would really help them do
that?

51
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,940
A strong military.

52
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
Last week,

53
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,710
North Korea launched a missile right over
Japan.

54
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,369
And that’s reignited a debate about

55
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,170
whether or not Japan should have

56
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,520
a more aggressive military.

57
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,270
Japan was banned from having a military

58
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,600
for any purpose besides self defense

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,720
after its defeat in World War II.

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,130
Or as it’s known in China,

61
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,830
the War to Resist Japanese Aggression.

62
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,130
And the Chinese regime absolutely does not
want

63
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,100
Japan becoming a military rival

64
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,760
in the Asia Pacific region again.

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,350
And as much as China would like to think

66
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,120
it’ll be a long long time before Japan can
do that,

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,980
Rocketman is giving them a pretty good reason
to do it.

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,360
That’s why, according to the White House,

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,870
just before his big Rocketman speech,

70
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,840
President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

71
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,980
“committed to maximizing pressure on North
Korea

72
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,610
through vigorous enforcement of United Nations

73
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,080
Security Council resolutions.”

74
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,180
That was the fourth phone call

75
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,640
between the leaders of the US and China.

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
And honestly,

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,780
Trump’s been in office for nine months now,

78
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,480
and only four phone calls?

79
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,350
Would it kill Xi Jinping to call a little
more often

80
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,780
and just let Trump know he’s okay?

81
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,170
He worries.

82
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,060
But while the Chinese regime is quick to say

83
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,750
threats won’t help the North Korean situation…

84
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,810
...just in case, China and Russia are holding
military drills

85
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,800
in the waters near the Russia-North Korea
border.

86
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,120
Unfortunately, Xi Jinping missed President
Trump’s UN debut.

87
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,030
That’s most likely because he’s preparing
for

88
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,780
the 19th Party Congress next month.

89
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,930
It’s a big event where

90
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,020
more than half of China’s Communist leadership

91
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,890
is getting a big shake up.

92
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,540
It’s also particularly important this year,

93
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,000
because according to state-run media,

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,510
they’re going to amend the constitution.

95
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,120
The Communist Party’s constitution, that
is.

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,190
While the article doesn’t say exactly

97
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,300
what it will be amended to say,

98
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,130
it will probably be related to something Xi
Jinping said.

99
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,390
His predecessors,

100
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,989
Woodie McWoodface and Toadie McToadface,

101
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,310
also had their policies written into the Party’s
constitution.

102
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,790
You know, the famous “scientific development”

103
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,300
and the “three represents.”

104
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,090
Yes, they all have catchy nicknames like that.

105
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,560
Can’t wait to see what Xi comes up with!

106
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,300
What’s that, Shelley?

107
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
T

108
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,620
he four comprehensives?

109
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,940
What does that even...nevermind.

110
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,039
In other news, the Chinese regime and India

111
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,829
are still repairing ties a month after wrapping
up

112
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,870
a tense border conflict.

113
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,990
But China may have found a way to solve

114
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,199
its troubles with India...permanently.

115
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,150
Let the country drown.

116
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,960
This is the Brahmaputra River.

117
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,110
It’s one of Asia’s major rivers.

118
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,280
It starts in Chinese Tibet and flows down

119
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,599
through India and Bangladesh before emptying
out

120
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,279
into the Ganges River.

121
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,860
It also often floods during the monsoon season.

122
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,520
That’s a major problem in Northern India
and Bangladesh.

123
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,630
That’s why these countries have an agreement
with China.

124
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,360
China, being upstream,

125
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,059
shares information with India and Bangladesh

126
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,860
so they can prepare if it looks like

127
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,870
a flood is going to happen.

128
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,139
But gosh, this year,

129
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,699
China didn’t share that information with
India.

130
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,210
“Beijing has said its hydrological stations

131
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,559
are being upgraded

132
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:05,699
which means it cannot share data.”

133
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:06,789
Shoot.

134
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,630
Except, the BBC found that somehow,

135
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,309
China did manage to share the data with Bangladesh.

136
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,559
Funny that.

137
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,430
But just in case flooding does happen in India,

138
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,089
the Chinese regime will be ready to help.

139
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,439
They’re building a highway in Tibet to Nepal,

140
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,330
that will give the Chinese military

141
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,639
easy access to South Asia,

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,349
in case they need to send troops into India.

143
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,349
You know,

144
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,090
to help with flood relief, of course.

145
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,580
Speaking of a disaster,

146
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,229
a Chinese-born New Zealand Member of Parliament

147
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,330
is under fire.

148
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,599
He’s accused of being trained by Chinese
spies.

149
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:45,509
A joint investigation between New Zealand’s
Newsroom

150
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:48,139
and the Financial Times found Jian Yong,

151
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,930
had “studied at an elite Chinese spy school,”

152
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,289
was likely, “an officer in Chinese military
intelligence,”

153
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,289
and of course,

154
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,639
“a member of the Communist Party.”

155
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,349
Now while that may sound bad,

156
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,319
Jian Yong has a pretty good defense.

157
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,020
No, he is not a Chinese spy;

158
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,589
he just taught English to Chinese spies.

159
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,199
Well, I guess case closed.

160
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,199
And over in Hong Kong,

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,619
it’s a hotbed of political unrest.

162
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,520
Many people there feel the Communist Party

163
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,029
is rapidly encroaching on the rights and freedoms

164
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,969
they’ve had for decades.

165
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,539
Pro-democracy activists have been imprisoned.

166
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,150
Mainland Chinese police plan to

167
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,320
patrol a Hong Kong train station.

168
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,779
And democratically elected leaders

169
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,750
have been kicked out of office.

170
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,780
But Beijing-backed Hong Kong Chief Executive
Carrie Lam

171
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,690
has a plan to soothe those worries.

172
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,659
By telling everyone to stop that independence
talk,

173
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,199
because it’s making Beijing mad.

174
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,699
Well if Beijing is getting mad, of course!

175
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,659
Keep quiet about all the problems you’re
facing,

176
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,210
and surely they will all magically go away.

177
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,580
But if you don’t do what Beijing wants,

178
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,860
there could be consequences.

179
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,719
And that’s what one US university is learning.

180
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,379
In June, the University of California San
Diego

181
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,741
disregarded the demands of the Chinese embassy,

182
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:05,059
and allowed their commencement speech

183
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,770
to be given by a known terrorist,

184
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,069
a wolf in monk’s robes,

185
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,169
the Dalai Lama.

186
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,740
Imagine that!

187
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,240
The Chinese international students

188
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,219
had begged the University to cancel

189
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,569
the Dalai Lama’s speech,

190
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,999
or stop him from talking about political topics,

191
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,379
like, Tibet.

192
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,149
Well, now the Chinese regime

193
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,699
is showing American Universities

194
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,960
that if they do something

195
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,169
the Communist Party doesn’t like,

196
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,340
there will be consequences.

197
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,340
The Chinese government has now

198
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,479
apparently barred Chinese scholars

199
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,050
from getting state funding to attend UCSD.

200
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,580
Although Chinese students make up around

201
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,110
10% of UCSD’s student body,

202
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,219
it's not clear how many receive scholarships

203
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,780
from the Chinese government.

204
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,289
Hopefully at least some Chinese students

205
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,409
will still be able to enjoy fish tacos

206
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,409
and Legoland.

207
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,960
What do you think?

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,779
