1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,860
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,400
what’s the greatest threat

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,780
facing the Chinese military?

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,360
Apparently it’s

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,400
“Up, up, down, down, left, right, left right,
B, A start.”

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,900
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,580
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,580
China may have the biggest

9
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,130
standing army in the world,

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,250
but its troops are a little distracted these
days.

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,929
So distracted, they can’t fight.

12
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:29,420
At least according to the official newspaper
of China’s army,

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,730
the People's Liberation Army Daily.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,770
And it all has to do with this.

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,050
It’s a Chinese mobile phone game

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,680
called King of Glory.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,430
Also known as Honor of Kings or Strike of
Kings.

18
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,830
And it’s so addictive

19
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,780
The PLA Daily says it could sap

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,710
the fighting power of soldiers.

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,120
I mean who wants to fight a real war

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,460
when you could be pretending

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,300
to fight a war instead?

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,620
PLA Daily said,

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,520
“The game has already infiltrated

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,270
the daily lives of some soldiers and officers,

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,360
affecting [their] physical and psychological
health

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,700
on a certain level.”

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,920
Well that’s simple enough to deal with.

30
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,200
Just don't play that level.

31
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,780
King of Glory is a fantasy role playing

32
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,000
mobile phone game

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,610
based on Chinese historical characters.

34
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,659
Like the famous poet Li Bai.

35
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,220
Sorry, he looks like this in the game.

36
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,439
He’s an assassin.

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,920
And there’s also the famous doctor Bian
Que.

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,760
In the game, he kills people with poison.

39
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,640
And let’s not forget famous hero...

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Mulan?

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,540
Mushu the dragon looks

42
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,600
a little bigger than I remember.

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,831
I actually agree with state-run People’s
Daily

44
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:32,831
when they say the game

45
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:36,460
might be slightly misrepresenting history.

46
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,170
Fortunately, the English version of the game

47
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,270
fixed that,

48
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,270
by adding a more

49
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,350
historically accurate character:

50
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,350
Batman.

51
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,260
I’m not making this up.

52
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
For some reason,

53
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,030
they added Batman.

54
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,330
And King of Glory is not just

55
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,430
super addictive for Chinese soldiers.

56
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,159
It’s become the most popular

57
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,760
mobile game in the world

58
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,840
with 200 million active users.

59
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,010
That’s about one out of seven people

60
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,010
in China.

61
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,010
It’s made by

62
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,070
the Chinese company Tencent.

63
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,350
Remember that name,

64
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,970
because we’ll come back to Tencent

65
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,400
later in the broadcast.

66
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,170
Anyway, as I said,

67
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,679
the game has become so popular

68
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,670
it’s become a distraction.

69
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,420
Last month, Party Mouthpiece People’s Daily

70
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,920
called it a “poison”

71
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,480
and a “drug” for teenagers

72
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,650
“That [article] caused the market value
of Tencent

73
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,750
to plunge by US$17.5 billion at one point.”

74
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,610
Tencent responded by putting time limits

75
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,720
on how long people could play.

76
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,310
Which is good because Internet addiction

77
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,330
is becoming a major problem in China.

78
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,880
And you do not want to be sent to

79
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,360
one of China’s Internet addiction boot camps.

80
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,760
And finally, Big Brother is watching.

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,540
So could you be a little more entertaining?

82
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,820
In China, everyone is being filmed all the time.

83
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,180
Cameras are everywhere

84
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,160
They even have special police buses for it.

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,180
So what do you think of the effect

86
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,489
King of Glory is having on Chinese troops?

87
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,159
Leave your comments below.

88
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,159

92
