1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,790
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,609
China’s top actress has disappeared!

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:08,270
Or maybe has been disappeared.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,670
China threatens more tariffs on the US,

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,180
in retaliation for US retaliation.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,560
And a virus is infecting millions of Chinese
pigs.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,810
I guess I’ll be taking a break from double-cooked
pork.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,740
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,300
I’m Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,130
Chinese superstar actress Fan Bingbing seems
to have disappeared.

12
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,030
That’s Fan Bingbing who played Blink in
X-Men: Days of Future Past.

13
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,670
She’s the highest paid actress in China,

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,719
and the fifth-highest paid actress in the
world.

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,280
But since late July,

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,670
the 36-year-old actress hasn’t been seen
in public,

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,690
or really anywhere that people seem to know
about.

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,539
Her Weibo account has been silent.

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,879
No new dresses.

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,949
Not even a cute cat.

21
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:01,819
There’s also no word about why she’s gone.

22
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:04,730
But the Chinese internet loves speculation.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,070
The current rumor is that she’s been abducted

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,010
by authorities for tax evasion.

25
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,080
I mean, she could be chillin’ on a beach
somewhere.

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,280
We don’t know.

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,570
But in May, a presenter on Chinese state television
leaked

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,240
a pair of contracts that supposedly showed
Fan Bingbing

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,730
double-billing for a production.

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,220
Basically, she had two contracts covering
the same work.

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,790
“The documents appeared to reveal an arrangement,

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,070
known as ‘yin-yang’ contracts,

33
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,790
wherein one contract reflects an actor’s
actual earnings

34
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,970
while a second, lower figure is submitted
to tax authorities.”

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,880
So it’s possible she’s been abducted because
authorities plan

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,960
to use her as a warning to other actors:

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,140
Pay your taxes, or else!

38
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,390
Fan’s disappearance is probably less dire

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,320
than that of the thousands of human rights
lawyers,

40
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,390
religious believers, and other dissidents

41
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,729
who are “disappeared” on a regular basis
by the Communist Party.

42
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,250
But it does show the overall repressiveness
of the system in China.

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,740
After all, if Kim Kardashian or Beyonce

44
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,099
wasn’t seen in public for two months,

45
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,050
no one would think they were being secretly
held

46
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,209
by the US government.

47
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,159
Too bad Fan Bingbing can’t teleport her
way out of detention.

48
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,140
In a move that’s been a long time in the
making,

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,010
the US Justice Department is requiring China’s

50
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,280
two biggest state run media companies—

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,799
Xinhua and China Global Television Network—

52
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,609
to register as foreign agents.

53
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,650
Over the past year, two Russian outlets,

54
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,739
RT and Sputnik, have also been required

55
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,019
to register as foreign agents.

56
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,180
What this means is there’ll be more limitations

57
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,730
to press credentials for all these media.

58
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,840
They’ll have less access to lawmakers and
other US officials.

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,829
This is causing a bit of a debate.

60
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,560
There are the free speech activists—

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,189
who don’t like the government deciding

62
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,879
what counts as journalism and what counts
as propaganda.

63
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,760
Then there’s national security experts—

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,599
who are happy these state-backed propaganda
outlets

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,060
are getting a little more scrutiny.

66
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,569
The law in question is the Foreign Agents
Registration Act.

67
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,160
It was created in 1938 to tackle covert Nazi
propaganda in the US.

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,930
But it was rarely used after World War 2.

69
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,239
Until recently.

70
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,700
Of course, state-run China Daily, who’s
distribution company

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,739
has long been registered as a foreign agent,

72
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,049
has not been that inconvenienced.

73
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,559
Why, you can see their newspaper boxes dotting
the streets

74
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:29,730
of major US cities like New York.

75
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,029
China is retaliating in the trade war with
new tariffs

76
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:35,290
on 60 billion dollars of American goods.

77
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,450
Which is a predictable response to the US’s
response...

78
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,430
to China’s earlier response to the original
US tariffs...

79
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,129
which were a response to China being a big
fat cheater.

80
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:48,980
President Trump commented on China’s latest
tariffs,

81
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,269
saying, “If there’s retaliation against
our farmers

82
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,980
and our industrial workers and our ranchers,

83
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,219
if any of that goes on

84
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,859
we are going to kick in another $257 billion.

85
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:00,859
We don’t want to do it,

86
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,730
but we’ll probably have no choice.”

87
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,409
Later he clarified he actually meant 267 billion
dollars.

88
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,680
But anyway, it’s not exactly tit for tat.

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,730
Since the US buys more from China than China
buys from the US,

90
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,489
the US is able to hit China with bigger tariffs.

91
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,310
And if the new tariffs Trump is threatening
go into effect,

92
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,020
tariffs would cover the majority of all US-China
trade.

93
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,940
So for all of you who wanted to boycott Made
in China products,

94
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,320
looks like a lot more people will be forced
to join you.

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,760
A deadly African swine fever is sweeping across

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,490
at least seven Chinese provinces.

97
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,050
The virus has killed at least 40,000 pigs.

98
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,540
It’s become a major disruption to China’s
pork industry.

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,420
And more importantly, it’s super gross!

100
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,930
And not gross in a cool way,

101
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,340
like that glow-in-the-dark pork from a few
years ago.

102
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,990
The good news is that the swine fever outbreak

103
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,120
is way too big to cover up.

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
So it’s forced Chinese authorities to address
it,

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,700
and state media to report on it.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,820
But just to be clear,

107
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,150
state media says, it’s an African swine
fever.

108
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,860
And it’s happening despite China’s strict
controls.

109
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,200
And again, please remember that this is

110
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,420
not some kind of Chinese disease.

111
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,580
It’s “been circulating in neighboring
countries for a long time”.

112
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,780
The virus can apparently live in pork products,

113
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,890
including ham and salami, for a month or more.

114
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,830
And one of the reasons the infection has spread
globally

115
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,990
is that “pigs can become infected

116
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,580
if they eat contaminated food scraps.”

117
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,110
Wait, does this mean pigs are eating...pork?

118
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,250
Well, at least they’re not forcing Muslims
to eat pork.

119
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh.

120
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,180
There is one piece of good news, though.

121
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,420
The virus only kills pigs, and not humans.

122
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,930
So while pork prices in China are going up—

123
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,800
you know, because so much of the supply is
dying—

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,270
at least it’s still safe to eat bacon.

125
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,780
Well, as safe as it ever was.

126
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,350
And finally, a “nightmare” incident between

127
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,690
Chinese tourists and Swedish police.

128
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,870
At least according to state-run media.

129
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,380
A Chinese family of three tried

130
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,190
to check into a hotel in Stockholm,

131
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,870
but apparently hadn’t made reservations
for that night.

132
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,460
So the hotel staff turned them away.

133
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,560
The Chinese family refused to leave,

134
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,170
and insisted on sleeping in the lobby.

135
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,940
So the staff called the police,

136
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,380
who used what the Chinese son described as

137
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,100
“excessive violence” on the family.

138
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
See for yourself.

139
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,920
“This is killing!

140
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,910
This is killing!”

141
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,950
It’s basically murder.

142
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,870
Just look at this cry for help!

143
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:48,070
Wow, he could be a professional soccer player.

144
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,070
All this, of course,

145
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,420
has blown up massively on the Chinese internet.

146
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,850
And China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
expressed concern

147
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,000
about the safety and legitimate rights

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,140
of all Chinese citizens visiting Sweden.

149
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,300
Which makes sense.

150
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,000
No one treats Chinese citizens worse than
the police in Sweden.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
And before we go, it’s that time when I
answer questions

152
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,850
from China Uncensored fans who support the
show on Patreon,

153
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,480
the crowdfunding website.

154
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,310
Uchida O. asks

155
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,310
“Hi, Chris.

156
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,410
While Tibet is strategically advantageous,

157
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,890
wouldn't a complete pull-out go a long way
to making it appear

158
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,190
as though China is interested in human rights
and democracy?

159
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,530
What do you guys think it would it take

160
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,120
for the CCP to relinquish Tibet?”

161
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,050
Well, unfortunately for the people of Tibet,

162
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,700
the Chinese Communist Party will never, ever
let Tibet go.

163
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,140
It’s too strategically valuable.

164
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,200
For one, there’s gold in them there hills!

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,710
Or at least a variety of minerals and rare
earth elements.

166
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,030
Then there’s the border security that comes
with controlling Tibet.

167
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,030
I

168
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,030
t’s impossible to move an army through the
Himalayas.

169
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,900
But if the Chinese Communist Party didn’t
control Tibet,

170
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,920
then it wouldn’t have the Himalayas to protect
China’s western border.

171
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,670
And then there’s the fact that most of Asia’s
rivers start in Tibet.

172
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,800
That gives whoever controls Tibet tremendous
power over

173
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,090
all the surrounding nations.

174
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,240
If the Communist Party gave up Tibet,

175
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,030
then someone else would control the source
of these rivers—

176
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,780
including China’s rivers.

177
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,580
If you’d like to learn more about this topic,

a Free Tibet.
