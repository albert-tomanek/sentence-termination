00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,950
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,060
does Trump’s Secretary of State want

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,500
war with China?

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,400
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,140
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,849
Job interviews are just the worst.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,330
You're overdressed,

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,330
sweaty,

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,300
and trying to answer difficult questions like,

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,700
"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,310
"If you were a brand,

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,900
what would be your motto"?

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,260
And of course the classic,

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,610
"Are you prepared to say that Vladimir Putin

15
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,789
and his military have violated the rules of
war

16
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,309
and have conducted war crimes in Aleppo?"

17
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,109
Ok, that last one was a question posed last
week

18
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,659
to Rex Tillerson,

19
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,390
Donald Trump’s pick for Secretary of State.

20
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,710
It was at his confirmation hearing

21
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,870
before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,100
Think of it as a nationally televised job
interview.

23
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,149
One where you might make a slip of the tongue.

24
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,450
Like suggesting that maybe the US

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,809
should take military action against China

26
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,570
by blockading their activities in the South
China Sea.

27
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,000
We’re going to have to send China a clear
signal

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,049
that first the island-building stops

29
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,860
and second your access to those islands

30
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,070
is also not going to be allowed.”

31
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,890
He was referring to the Chinese regime

32
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,540
turning submerged reefs in disputed territorial
waters

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,320
into this.

34
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,700
The Secretary of State is the United State’s
top diplomat.

35
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,820
And who says diplomats have to be diplomatic?

36
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,820
Rex Tillerson,

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,910
or as I like to call him,

38
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:26,910
T-Rex,

39
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,540
used to be chairman and chief executive

40
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,390
of ExxonMobil.

41
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,320
But just because he’s into oil,

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,210
that doesn’t make him a dinosaur.

43
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,580
He’s a hawk,

44
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,590
and he’s going after China.

45
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,110
Building islands and then putting military
assets on those islands

46
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,360
is akin to Russia's taking of Crimea.

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,730
Comparing the Chinese regime to Russia.

48
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,830
Can China hack that?

49
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,820
Let’s see what they have to say.

50
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,980
Like the U.S.,

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,680
China also completely has the right to conduct

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,360
any normal activities in its sovereign territory,

53
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,790
and that is indisputable.

54
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,830
Because nothing is more normal

55
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,240
than building fake islands in disputed waters.

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,560
At least when those waters carry 5 trillion
dollars a year

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,310
worth of international shipping.

58
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,190
Oh yeah, and oil and natural gas reserves.

59
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,130
Now ever since Barack Obama’s Pivot to Asia,

60
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,520
the US has been increasing its naval presence

61
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,980
in the region.

62
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,450
But to suggest an actual blockade of Chinese
ships

63
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,560
from accessing their fake islands

64
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,420
is taking things to a whole ’nother level.

65
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,420
And while according to Reuters’ sources

66
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,200
the US has the military capability to do it,

67
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,790
the consequences could be huuuge.

68
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,480
Yes, no one wants a war!

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
I mean,

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,880
sure China is building military fortresses
in the South China Sea.

71
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,459
But they "highly value" peace and stability.

72
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,040
Something about those quotation marks makes
it seem sarcastic.

73
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,130
Anyway,

74
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,270
the Chinese regime’s, um, peaceful ambitions
in the South China Sea

75
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,240
have largely gone unchecked.

76
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
International pleas,

77
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,460
regular freedom of navigation tours by the
US navy,

78
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,490
and even rulings from the United Nations

79
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,569
have all failed to curb literally any of China’s
actions

80
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,849
in the South China Sea.

81
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:15,849
Last month,

82
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:19,069
the Chinese navy even stole a US research
drone

83
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,020
right in front of the US navy.

84
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,940
But hey, they gave it back.

85
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,270
So was T-Rex serious

86
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,400
about blocking China's access to those islands?

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,630
Or did he just get carried away

88
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,770
talking about a topic he's not that familiar
with?

89
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,709
Which I've never personally done in a job
interview,

90
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,560
but I, uh, hear it happens, sometimes.

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,140
Wait, what's that Shelley?

92
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,580
Oh, wow.

93
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Apparently,

94
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,810
when Rex Tillerson was in charge of ExxonMobil,

95
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,950
the company signed deals with Vietnam

96
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,180
to drill in areas of the South China Sea

97
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,170
that overlap with China's territorial claims.

98
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,880
13 million acres worth.

99
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,350
That’s a lot of acres.

100
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,681
So I guess he does have some experience

101
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:02,530
with the South China Sea.

102
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,530
At the hearing,

103
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,080
future Secretary of State T-Rex

104
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,310
also echoed Trump on China issues

105
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,360
ranging from trade, intellectual property
theft,

106
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,690
and China’s “empty promises” on stopping
North Korea’s

107
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,340
nuclear ambitions.

108
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,970
Though he does seem to disagree with Trump

109
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,090
on some issues,

110
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,690
like that more nuclear weapons for our allies

111
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,120
is a good thing,

112
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,210
T-Rex wants everyone to have smaller arms.

113
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,590
Many politicians in the past on both sides
of the aisle

114
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,770
have favored a more nuanced approach

115
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,350
to US-China relations.

116
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,410
That has avoided military conflict,

117
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,650
but hasn’t been very effective at stopping
the Chinese regime.

118
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,250
This new more aggressive China policy by the
Trump administration

119
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,080
at least promises to be interesting.

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,580
So what does Xi Jinping think about all of
this?

121
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,030
Well, it's...hard to tell.

122
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,250
But he is in the middle of a massive purge
of political rivals,

123
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,990
and to survive, he needs to consolidate his
power quickly.

124
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,280
He can’t afford to look weak in his handling
of US relations.

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,810
Especially when it comes to third rail issues
like Taiwan

126
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,840
and the South China Sea.

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,740
So will T-Rex lead us to armed military conflict

128
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,600
in the South China Sea?

129
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,840
Only our future selves know for sure.

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,260
And since no time travelers have come back
to warn us

131
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,680
of imminent destruction in World War III,

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,520
I assume everything turns out fine in the
future.

133
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,150
Unless there’s no one left to come back
and warn us.

134
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,870
So what do you think about T-Rex’s idea
to blockade

135
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,229
China's access to their artificial islands?

136
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,360
And, if you were a time traveller,

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,450
what historical event would you try to change,
and how?

138
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,139
Leave your comments below.

139
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,400
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

140
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

141
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,540
see you next time.
