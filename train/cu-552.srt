00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,880
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,410
between China and India,

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,340
who won the border dispute?

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,070
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,460
I'm Chris Chappell

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,500
and I've got some bad news.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,760
I won't be able to make a name for myself

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,370
as a reporter covering the war

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,130
between China and India.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,380
I had it all planned out, too!

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,390
After the war was over,

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,000
I'd sell the rights to my story

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,120
and see it turned into a Bollywood sensation.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,640
Or a nationalistic Chinese thriller.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
Which movie I'd do

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,219
would depend on who won the war, obviously.

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,489
But unfortunately for my movie

18
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,930
peace has won the day.

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,559
On Monday, India's Ministry of External Affairs

20
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,399
posted this notice,

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,270
saying both sides have been talking to each
other,

22
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,390
and there would be an

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,870
"expeditious disengagement of border

24
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,609
at the face-off site at Doklam."

25
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:03,969
And now you'll never get to see

26
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,310
my sick dance moves/fighting skills.

27
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,820
Anyway, for those of you somehow new to the
issue,

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Indian and Chinese troops have been facing
off

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,890
for the past two

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,630
It's in an area called the Doklam Plateau,

31
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,170
on the awkward three-way border

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,260
between India, China, and Bhutan.

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,670
Chinese soldiers were building a road

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,650
in their own territory.

35
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,030
Except Bhutan was like,

36
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,600
"Excuse me, that's OUR

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,090
not China's."

38
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,170
And so Indian troops came to Bhutan's aid

39
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,720
to help enforce that border.

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,920
Not so much out of friendship;

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,340
more because a Chinese road

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,200
would be a security threat to India.

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,380
So the conflict got pretty heated.

44
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,020
Like when Indian and Chinese troops

45
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,750
chest-butted each other like drunk frat boys.

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,110
And when Chinese state-run media

47
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,390
was one step short of inciting war.

48
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,280
And who could forget the time Chinese leader

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,070
Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Modi

50
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,110
faced off on a dragon and a tiger,

51
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,030
and it looked like Xi was going to win,

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,750
until Modi, who, by the power of Grayskull,

53
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,030
was able to overpower Xi Jinping and his dragon,

54
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,410
which it turns out wasn't all that great

55
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,940
because it was made in China.

56
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,190
I just want to say:

57
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,200
India's TV news is way more entertaining

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,500
than America's.

59
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,100
Anyway, as that animation

60
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,600
India was the clear winner in the border dispute.

61
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,690
"Big diplomatic victory for the Indian government..."

62
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,940
"India and China have agreed to begin disengagement

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,040
of troops at Doklam."

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,740
Yeah, hashtag #ModiTamesDragon!

65
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,860
The most popular hashtag since...

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,800
Oh.

67
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,150
Hang on a second.

68
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,600
What's that, Shelley?

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,510
Ok, this just in from Chinese state-run media:

70
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,400
"China said Monday it had made on-site checks

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,990
of India's withdrawal of personnel and equipment

72
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,720
from Donglang, also known as Doklam,

73
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,240
after over two months of military standoff."

74
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,600
Wait a second.

75
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,290
That Chinese host makes it sound like

76
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,990
Indian troops withdrew first.

77
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,830
So...both sides are claiming victory now?

78
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,830
C'mon!

79
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,260
They can't both be winners!

80
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,790
This isn't kindergarten tee-ball.

81
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,070
Maybe it was a mutual withdrawal,

82
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,319
but both sides' media just reported it

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,080
in a biased way to play to their audiences.

84
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,880
I've never heard of any media

85
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,240
doing that before,

86
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,320
but I suppose it's possible.

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,660
I mean, the wording used

88
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,050
by India's Ministry of External Affairs,

89
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,960
"expeditious disengagement," seems to be intentionally
vague.

90
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,340
As one expert told the Washington Post,

91
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,850
"Clarity is the enemy of face-saving."

92
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,990
So anyway,

93
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,270
India can claim it got China

94
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,180
to back off from construction,

95
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,240
and China can can talk about how

96
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,920
it's a responsible big country.

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,650
But I would say overall,

98
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,750
India handled it masterfully

99
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,209
by refusing to give in until China backed
down,

100
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,840
while not being provoked by the rhetoric

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,459
from the CCP.

102
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,459
And this is a good lesson

103
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,740
for other countries dealing with

104
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,250
an aggressive Chinese regime.

105
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,959
The Chinese regime was pushing its claims

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,300
further than it should have.

107
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,030
China kept claiming it had historical rights

108
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,200
to the area,

109
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,950
as per an agreement from the year 1890

110
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,360
between the UK and China's Qing Dynasty.

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,770
Now there's nothing necessarily wrong

112
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,590
with following an old treaty--

113
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,620
except in this case,

114
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,269
it's disputed,

115
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,730
and China knew that Bhutan

116
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,340
didn't recognize China's claim.

117
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,560
And more importantly,

118
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,220
the Chinese regime conveniently "forgot"

119
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,680
that as recently as 1998

120
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,660
they'd agreed to "maintain peace and tranquility

121
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,480
until a final settlement is reached

122
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
on the boundary"--

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,930
which they didn't follow.

124
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,350
So when the People's Liberation Army

125
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,030
started building a road,

126
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,120
India came to Bhutan's aid

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,540
and refused to back down.

128
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,139
Then the CCP brought up the 1890 treaty,

129
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,260
and India brought up the 1998 treaty--

130
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,480
and refused to back down.

131
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,060
Then the CCP directed its state-run media

132
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,920
to threaten war with India.

133
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,430
The idea, according to this article,

134
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,970
was for the CCP to use

135
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,660
"ambiguity, risk manipulation

136
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,199
and controlling the narrative

137
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,639
to win without fighting."

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,740
But India still refused to back down.

139
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,180
And that was was a brave and risky move--

140
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,080
considering that if even a single soldier

141
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,090
from either side had accidentally fired a
shot,

142
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,320
it could have instantly triggered

143
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,590
a very serious conflict.

144
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,130
But India understood the political game.

145
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,300
leader Xi Jinping didn't really want a war.

146
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,570
That's because if if the PLA didn't immediately

147
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,110
win a decisive victory,

148
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,919
it would hurt Xi Jinping's reputation

149
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,330
ahead of the 19th Party Congress later this
year.

150
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,960
And also, the Indian Prime Minister

151
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,620
did something smart.

152
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,650
He met with Xi Jinping on the sidelines

153
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,850
of the G20 Summit in July.

154
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,330
They didn't agree on the border dispute,

155
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,370
but they agreed to at least have their people

156
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,960
call their people and talk about it.

157
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,490
So for the last month or so,

158
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,419
they've had backchannel discussions aimed

159
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,080
at resolving the conflict--

160
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,930
even as the media kept blowing the story up.

161
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,479
So how did it get resolved?

162
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,979
Indian troops withdrew from the region

163
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,639
on August 25th,

164
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,710
and Chinese troops announced

165
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,450
they'd stopped building that road,

166
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,450
at least for now--

167
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,430
claiming that "weather was a factor."

168
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,430
It's the international relations version of,

169
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,710
"I would have kicked his butt,

170
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,710
but I didn't want to get his blood all over
my new shirt."

171
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,240
So even though there's no clear winner or
loser,

172
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,460
both sides get to save face.

173
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,520
And in the end,

174
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,770
isn't that the important thing?

175
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,930
Besides avoiding war, I mean.

176
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,930
So is this the end to border disputes

177
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,800
between India and China?

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,500
Let's see what India's army chief has to say.

179
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,320
"The recent standoff in the Doklam plateau

180
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,979
by the Chinese side attempting to change

181
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,900
the status quo are issues which we need to
be wary about,

182
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,420
and I think such kind of incidents are likely
to increase in the future."

183
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,780
Wait, such kind of incidents are

184
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,700
"likely to increase in the future"?

185
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,320
That's terrible!

186
