00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,090
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,779
we bless the rains down in Africa.

3
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:06,649
That is, if the Chinese Communist Party

4
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:08,120
doesn’t beat us to it!

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,690
Welcome back to China Uncensored,

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,330
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,550
Did you know the United States

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,199
is the world’s biggest hegemon?

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,179
Yes, America’s colonial ambition knows no
bounds.

10
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,529
Just ask my favorite Chinese state-run media,

11
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,939
the Global Times!

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,960
“US monopolistic hegemony goes against

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,490
the will of the people.”

14
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,360
But, “Over-confident and Cold War-minded
US

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,450
is feeling that it is increasingly tough

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,520
to pursue global hegemony.”

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,990
Fortunately, a glorious red hero has emerged

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,120
to take the place of America’s imperialist
ambitions:

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,510
The Chinese Communist Party!

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,640
State-run Xinhua says,

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,940
“If globalization is led by countries in
the East,

22
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,580
like China,

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,210
it will be more respectful of the political
identity

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,150
and sovereignty of other countries.”

25
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,150
And the Chinese Communist Party

26
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,940
has already begun respecting

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,530
the political identity and sovereignty of
Africa.

28
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,140
To learn more, I sat down with Jeff Smith,

29
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,660
the founding director of Vanguard Africa,

30
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,260
an advocacy group for human rights

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,159
and democracy in Africa.

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,250
So Jeff, thank you for joining me.

33
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,490
You're an expert on Africa,

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,420
so you must be pretty happy with the way China

35
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,640
is liberating Africa from European colonialism.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,530
I think it's, um, I think it's certainly a
mixed bag.

37
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,060
I think a lot of the attention lately

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,050
has been on China filling this,

39
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,060
what people describe as a void with US leadership

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,070
under the current administration taking a
step back,

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,090
putting a positive spin and so far as the
infrastructure

42
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,560
that the Chinese government has been involved
in across

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,990
the continent building schools and roads,

44
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,150
but what gets left out of that conversation

45
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,590
quite a bit is the really disastrous effects
that it's had on,

46
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,240
um, the state of democracy and in a certain
few countries,

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,810
but I think across the continent writ large,
um, and you know,

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,840
along with that as well,

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,910
the declining respect for civil liberties
and political rights,

50
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,190
uh, due to their political and social influence

51
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,760
on some of these countries.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,960
Um, so yeah, it's a very complicated,

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
increasingly worrying situation

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,819
for pro democracy advocates like myself.

55
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,450
Well, I bet the African dictators,

56
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,030
China's helping prop up, I bet they love it.

57
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,720
They do. I mean, they embrace it.

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,630
Um, it's often seen as, you know, Chinese
support,

59
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,450
whether it's through a, you know, military
support or,

60
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,930
or trade or direct bilateral support.

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,750
It's often seen as coming with, you know,

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,090
what many people describe as "no strings attached."

63
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,800
Uh, so the Communist Party in China doesn't
really care so much

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,239
as evidenced by their own track record at
home about respect

65
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,709
for basic human rights and democratic ideals

66
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,410
and the principles of human dignity.

67
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,349
And is that different from investment from
the West?

68
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:08,500
Uh, in some cases, yes. I think there is valid
criticism of um,

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,430
you know, so called Western involvement in
some of these environments,

70
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,410
particularly the way our government views
Africa,

71
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,720
which has traditionally been through military
security lens.

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:25,269
But the, the deleterious effects that China's
involvement has had,

73
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:31,170
in my opinion, severely outweighs these other
issues,

74
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,370
particularly if you look in areas of, um,
you know, uh,

75
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,900
you know, investment in some of Africa's,
you know, military,

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,470
their security forces, their collaboration
and at times,

77
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,410
direct involvement in censorship of both online
discussion

78
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:55,910
and public discussion, the massive investment
in censorship technology.

79
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,450
Particularly, we're seeing this in east Africa
a lot, very recently.

80
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,030
They've been holding what they call media
roundtables.

81
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,550
It just recently happened in Tanzania where
they're talking about

82
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,409
how to censor their populations, how to block
social media,

83
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,600
how to really stifle discussion online.

84
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,270
Um, and lo and behold, you know, thereafter
the country,

85
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,510
Tanzania in this case, will pass a raft of
draconian laws.

86
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,400
For instance, just this past month, passing
legislation

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,481
that requires all online bloggers to post
over a $900 fee

88
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,530
just to have their blogs online. When, if
you look at that figure,

89
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,410
it may not seem like much to those of us

90
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,730
sitting here in the United States,

91
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,550
but that's oftentimes what many Tanzanians
will make in a year.

92
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,360
Uh, so it's really had a profoundly negative
effect across the board.

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,570
Well it's great that China can use all of
the experience

94
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,390
it's developed over the years and export that.

95
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,180
Exactly. No, they have exploited draconian
measures that have

96
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,841
really stifled civil liberties and political
rights, across the board.

97
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,670
But I think it's been particularly prevalent
in certain countries.

98
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,500
I think you've seen it a bit more particularly
and unsurprisingly

99
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,300
in countries where you've had one ruling party
since independence—

100
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,110
in the case of Tanzania, one ruling party,

101
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,660
it's actually the longest ruling party in
all of Africa.

102
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,620
So it's, you know, it's a natural fit there
if you will.

103
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,449
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

104
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,280
but tell me about Djibouti.

105
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,550
Djibouti is a very small country, less than
a 2 million people,

106
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,620
in what is called the eastern Horn of Africa
or the Horn of Africa.

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,180
It's really a geostrategic goldmine given
its location on the Red Sea,

108
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,810
So the size of Djibouti doesn't matter.

109
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,310
The size of Djibouti does not matter.

110
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,660
It does matter in so far as the size and scope
of the

111
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,540
increasing military bases that are occupying
essentially Djibouti.

112
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,350
It's actually where the US has their lone
military base in Africa,

113
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,570
Camp Lemonnier.

114
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,560
And China has its first overseas base.

115
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
China has its first overseas base,

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
so they've been flexing their muscles quite
a bit in Djibouti

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,830
but also in the region.

118
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,380
But in Djibouti as well, you have other competing
powers

119
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,660
where you have Russia, you have Italy, you
have Japan

120
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,690
all jockeying for position on that very strategic,

121
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,520
small strip of land.

122
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,870
So China has been investing in Africa for
a long time, for years.

123
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,270
How have things changed under Xi Jinping and
the One Belt,

124
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,570
One Road Initiative or Belt and Road Initiative?

125
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,949
I mean, I think you've seen, to my mind

126
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,949
just a continuation of standard Chinese Communist
Party

127
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,010
policy and an ideology really, again,

128
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,850
a lack of respect for, you know,

129
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,110
democratic basic democratic principles.

130
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,570
I also don't think it's a coincidence that—

131
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,039
I don't think you can draw a direct line,

132
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,889
but for the past 12 years in a row,

133
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,840
there's been overall declines in respect for
civil liberties

134
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,380
and political rights throughout the entire
continent.

135
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,770
I don't think it's a surprise or a coincidence
that during that

136
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,430
same time span you've seen China dramatically
increase its

137
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,850
investment in, and times cooperation, as I
mentioned earlier,

138
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,530
with military and security forces, across
the continent.

139
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,639
So I don't think you can draw a causal line,

140
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,590
but I think the correlation is rather rather
stunning.

141
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,960
Secondly, related to that, there's been academic
studies

142
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,020
that have shown that the more China invests
in a country,

143
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,960
particularly in the security forces, unsurprisingly,

144
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,750
human rights abuses go up and that's been
documented repeatedly.

145
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,819
Um, so again, \hthat's, that's cause for concern
as well for all of us

146
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,690
were concerned about, you know,

147
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,130
these sorts of issues and the overall democratic
backsliding

148
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,539
that we're seeing across the continent.

149
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,960
Well, don't you think it's a bit hypocritical
of the West

150
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,840
to criticize what China's doing in Africa
considering,

151
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,040
you know, slavery?

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,729
Yeah, no, I take that point.

153
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,150
I think that's something that certainly needs

154
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,530
to be taken into consideration.

155
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,970
The United States certainly has a checkered
past on human rights...

156
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,340
England, too.

157
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,820
...particularly in Africa.

158
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,389
But I think if you look at the general trajectory,

159
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,400
I don't think one could ever make the argument
that, well,

160
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
let's put it this way.

161
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,789
I don't think there's ever been a country
in the history of the earth

162
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,490
that has contributed more to human freedom
than the United States.

163
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,649
Despite the myriad mistakes that have been
made in the past.

164
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,690
I don't think it's anything compared to the
negative influence

165
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,050
that China has had, whereas the US government
invests

166
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,459
under both Democratic and Republican administrations

167
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,459
hundreds of millions of dollars every year
to democracy and governance

168
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:53,850
to, to human rights, to supporting local civil
society groups.

169
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,430
That type of investment over the course of
human history is unmatched.

170
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,830
The counter to that is, I think the investments
that China

171
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,470
has made in some of the world's worst autocratic
leaders,

172
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,720
not just in Africa but worldwide, is also
unmatched.

173
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,519
So it is really a great power struggle playing
out right now.

174
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,480
And I think unfortunately where we are now
in the US,

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,139
we've sort of taken a few steps back

176
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,429
and we're allowing China to fill that void.

177
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:24,579
Often the criticism is that, you know,

178
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,610
the no strings attached approach that China
takes

179
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,889
is a benefit to them,

180
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,480
and it's a negative for the United States.

181
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I see the opposite.

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,509
I think the fact that our government has traditionally
stood

183
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,249
on the side of the democratic underdog,

184
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:37,990
on the side of pro democracy advocates in
Africa and elsewhere,

185
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,170
it should be seen as a positive.

186
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,929
That should be seen as a strength.

187
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:45,639
And I think that should be advanced and not
retreated.

188
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,639
So why should Americans care about

189
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,199
Chinese investment in Africa?

190
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,220
I think it goes to the larger point of this
larger

191
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,220
democratic backsliding we're seeing,

192
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,259
and it allows a highly abusive leaders to
kill torture,

193
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,889
to disappear their citizens with impunity.

194
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:05,060
We've seen this over and over again.

195
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,360
You know, let's just take one example.

196
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,569
There are upcoming elections

197
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,009
about a month from now in Zimbabwe.

198
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,899
China has built to their military college.

199
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,480
They have built the ruling party's—

200
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,920
or I should say they have built

201
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,149
the national assembly in the country,

202
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:22,000
which is dominated by the ruling party, again,

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,839
the same ruling party that has ruled the country

204
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,200
since independence in 1980.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,899
Again, a natural attraction there for one
party rule.

206
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,069
So you see that playing out on a daily basis.

207
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:36,360
And you also see in Zimbabwe and elsewhere,

208
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,299
these leaders who've been in power for decades
at a time

209
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:42,249
adopting some of the same tactics that you've
seen in China,

210
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,059
whereas before, until recently, you know,

211
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,420
it was brute violence that kept them in power.

212
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,369
It was baton wielding security forces.

213
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:51,610
It was opening fire on protestors and killing
them.

214
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,189
Now they become more clever because of the
role of social media,

215
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:56,160
because of the role of the international media,
because of shows

216
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,220
like yours who sort of, you know,

217
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,009
highlight and keep a sustained spotlight on
some of these situations.

218
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,249
They've become more clever.

219
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,759
They've used more subtle forms of voter suppression.

220
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,639
They've used more subtle forms of intimidation
to keep people in line,

221
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,579
including censorship that we were talking
about before.

222
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:16,079
So I think overall it's just been a very concerning,
um,

223
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,989
decline in respect for basic basic human rights.

224
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:25,269
And I think it's evident to anyone who's paying
attention.

225
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,959
Chinese investment though,

226
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,709
does it have any benefit for the locals?

227
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,540
Like pumping up the local economy?

228
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Sure, yeah.

229
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,970
I think it always is important to sort of
check ourselves

230
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,019
and notice the positive.

231
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,309
Being a human rights activist and being involved

232
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:40,429
in a pro democracy field,

233
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:43,619
we often look at the negative and how we can
help

234
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,870
work with local partners to counteract that.

235
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,459
But I think it is also important to recognize
some of the

236
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,119
positive contributions that Chinese investment
has made.

237
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:56,370
I think we noted at the top the investments
that they've made

238
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,879
in building local infrastructure, building
dams, building bridges,

239
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,910
and building the African Union for instance,

240
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,230
which was then bugged to then spy on African
leaders...

241
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,529
So maybe not so great, that one.

242
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,980
...but I think it is important to note

243
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,579
some of those positive achievements.

244
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,230
However many of the complaints you'll hear

245
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,069
from local citizens in Zimbabwe

246
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,129
where I've traveled extensively

247
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:18,809
and throughout southern Africa in particular,

248
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,809
is when Chinese investment comes in,

249
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,329
or Chinese companies come in,

250
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,259
locals often don't benefit from that.

251
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:27,319
They bring in Chinese workers.

252
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:28,920
They don't hire local workers.

253
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,560
They bring in shoddy infrastructural, um...

254
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,290
The buildings might not be great quality.

255
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:41,230
Exactly, so just last night, a copper mine
in Zambia,

256
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,410
allegedly reportedly run by a Chinese company,

257
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,060
collapsed, killing 10 people,

258
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,799
which is not the first time that this has
happened in Zambia.

259
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,799
It's happened a lot.

260
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,799
It's happened many times and so there's

261
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,279
no account of no accountability.

262
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,519
These people are dying with no recourse to
justice because,

263
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,399
you know, it's a Chinese company and obviously

264
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,299
there's very little recourse for accountability
there.

265
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:08,269
So I think those are some of the problems
that they run into.

266
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,649
Also, you know, China's population is expanding.

267
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,129
They, you know, you'll hear

268
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,879
when you talked to many people on the ground,

269
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,249
and they'll say they need space.

270
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:22,019
They're buying up entire, you know, entire
swaths of land,

271
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,550
so people could come and move there.

272
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:28,639
There, there are these famous ghost towns
in Angola

273
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,420
where China has invested heavily in the oil
industry there.

274
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,790
And you have these entire towns,

275
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,339
these entire cities that are built for Chinese
workers.

276
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:38,339
Wow.

277
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,139
And it's staggering when you look at the size
and scope of this,

278
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:46,179
and ordinary average Angolans, the vast majority
of which are

279
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,829
living under the poverty line, will never
have the chance of,

280
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,529
you know, having the opportunity to live in
a neighborhood like that.

281
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,689
Whereas, you know, a Chinese companies are
importing

282
00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:00,259
their own citizens to work local industries.

283
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,879
And I think that, um, that really has harmful
effects.

284
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,069
I've heard a lot of criticism that this is
essentially

285
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,990
a Chinese form of colonialism.

286
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,290
Do think there's any merit to that?

287
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,519
I'm biased. So, you know, I think there is
some merit to that,

288
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,170
but if you talk to—again,

289
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,869
and you notice that the hypocrisy of the United
States

290
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:22,359
and, you know, we weren't a colonial power
by any means,

291
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,579
but you mentioned England, and in some, some
others,

292
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,809
there really is still in some segments of
these populations a

293
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,480
n animosity towards the west—

294
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
and rightfully so—

295
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,699
towards the United States and in some of the,
you know,

296
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:39,009
more negative instances of us supporting dictators

297
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,009
just like China does today in Africa.

298
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:46,040
So there's sort of like that prevailing hostility
towards

299
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,350
what is perceived as the west, and anything
that comes from

300
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,600
say Russia or China or North Korea—

301
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,939
in some instances where the North Korean regime

302
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,919
is investing heavily in so called cyber security

303
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,679
and threat detection in Zimbabwe and elsewhere—

304
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,509
there's less of an apprehension to allow them
in

305
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,889
because there's no colonial history there.

306
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:06,610
But I think it's absolutely right to call
it

307
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,069
on a modern form of colonialism.

308
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:10,809
And many people may see it differently.

309
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,989
But, but I would certainly,

310
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,429
I would certainly agree with that.

311
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,319
So where do you see the situation in the next
50 years?

312
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:21,149
I mean, I'm an idealist, I'm an idealist without
illusions,

313
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,079
but I would hope that the US recognizes—

314
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,079
whether it's a Republican president

315
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,399
and whether it's a Democratic president—

316
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,279
Or some "third party"...

317
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,930
Or some third party—who knows?—

318
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,299
that in so many ways,

319
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:36,429
Africa really is the future.

320
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:38,559
If you look at the youth population that is
coming up.

321
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,379
And I think that's where the one hope lies,

322
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,679
is they become more emboldened, I think, you
know,

323
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,249
with the explosion of social media and different
outlets

324
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,730
for mobilizing and for communicating and for
building

325
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,309
solidarity across borders, whether they're
regional or international.

326
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:58,239
I think that's where the hope lies and if
you look at just to the,

327
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,699
not only the human potential on the continent,

328
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:03,859
which I think is first and foremost, but also
again,

329
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:09,779
the natural resource wealth that this continent
has is just tremendous.

330
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,009
And I just don't think, number one, it's going
to benefit local populations.

331
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,350
It's going to benefit individuals, it's going
to benefit

332
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,040
highly abusive autocratic leaders.

333
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,490
And it's going to benefit in many ways that
the Chinese government,

334
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,569
because they're partnering directly with,
with these abusive leaders.

335
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,869
So I would like to think that we could, you
know,

336
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:34,220
get back on track and power local people,

337
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,389
allow them to take control of their own destiny.

338
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:39,350
Have the US government play more proactive
and positive role

339
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,879
in developing that democratic culture.

340
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,679
But right now I'm feeling a bit pessimistic

341
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,779
and I think we can get there,

342
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,970
but I think it'll certainly take some time,

343
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,269
but it's, you know,

344
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:53,339
we have to start talking about these issues.

345
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,389
We're just not, we're not even having that
discussion

346
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,109
here in Washington right now.

347
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:59,910
We're not even talking about the future of
Africa.

348
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,529
We're talking about—when it is talked about,

349
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:04,850
it's talked about under the guise of stability.

350
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,669
And what that often means is keeping the men

351
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:09,559
who've been in power for 20, 30, 40 years
in power

352
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,510
and not messing with the status quo,

353
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,659
which is what China wants.

354
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,839
So I think we need to,

355
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,069
we need to get over that hurdle.

356
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,809
Well, fortunately I can guarantee you

357
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,319
there'll be some lively conversation happening

358
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,449
in the comments section below this video.

359
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,270
Uh, one final question.

360
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,660
The most important question really:

361
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,340
in the Toto song "Africa",

362
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,530
is it "bless the rains in Africa"

363
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,450
or "miss the rains down in Africa"?

364
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,700
So it's definitely, I think it's "bless."

365
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,650
That's correct. I only just found that out.

366
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,820
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

367
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,559
and that just sounds better, right?

368
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,559
Bless the rains?

369
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,850
It's better to bless something than to miss
something.

370
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,230
I guess, but I mean, who is this, who is "Toto"

371
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,010
to have the ability to bless the rains in
Africa?

372
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,270
Oh, I think it speaks to all of us, though.

373
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,559
It speaks to our, you know,

374
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,960
it speaks to our humanity.

375
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,080
So really that's...

376
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Blessing the rains.

377
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
...that's the essence of everything.

378
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,130
Rain brings life. Yeah.

379
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,370
And that is what the West can bring to Africa,

380
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,370
versus China.

381
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,380
We can bless the rains in Africa.

382
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,960
I would hope so. In the ideal scenario, yes.

383
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,789
But to your point, I think it is very important
that we do

384
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,669
have to recognize the mistakes that our government

385
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,159
has made for a long time.

386
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,950
But with that said,

387
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,120
I think there's so much more positive that
has been done,

388
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,149
and unfortunately that gets sort of pushed
by the wayside.

389
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:29,059
But I think if we all come together and recognize
that

390
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,550
human solidarity knows no bounds,

391
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,240
and we're all in this together,

392
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,140
I think we can really make a positive impact.

393
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,809
So that's my idealism coming out,

394
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,159
but I really do truly profoundly believe that.

395
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,799
Well, I think that's the message

396
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,880
Toto was trying to leave us.

397
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
I think so, too.

398
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,659
So they were the trailblazers way back.

399
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,659
Absolutely.

400
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:49,659
Way back in the day.
