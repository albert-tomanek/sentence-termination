1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,520
The US could be defenseless

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,110
Against Chinese hypersonic weapons

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,630
Another Canadian is sentenced to death

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,490
And spies are everywhere!

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,300
That and more on this week’s China news
headlines.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,820
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,110
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,050
This week’s China news headlines.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,109
China’s hypersonic weapons are posing

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,289
a serious threat to the United States.

11
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,130
That’s according to a meeting this week

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,609
of the American Foreign Policy Council.

13
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,610
China’s “hypersonic missiles will be capable
of delivering

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,830
conventional or nuclear warheads anywhere
on the globe

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,400
with a flight time measured in mere minutes.”

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,949
Good, I hate waiting for anything.

17
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,399
Hypersonic weapons, according to a professor

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,100
of aerospace engineering at Michigan University,

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,520
are “rocket-boosted to high altitude

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,309
and may be launched from land, sea or air.

21
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,789
They fly far faster than any other weapons—

22
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,210
more than 3,000 mph

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,920
and potentially up to 10,000 mph—

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,850
which makes them difficult to identify,

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,960
avoid or shoot down.”

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
And that might mean

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,690
they could get through US defense systems.

28
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,690
According to one of the speakers

29
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,280
at the American Foreign Policy Council,

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,350
“These newly developed hypersonic missiles

31
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,479
can potentially penetrate U.S. ballistic missile
defenses

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,340
and possibly target and destroy an early warning
radars

33
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,970
and/or aircraft carriers in the event of a
future conflict.”

34
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,520
This is a big problem, not just for America,

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,750
but for Taiwan.

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,130
Not that Taiwan needed more problems.

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,950
A senior defense official told reporters

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,970
at the Pentagon earlier this year

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,350
that as China’s hypersonic weapons technology
improves,

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,750
it might make Beijing more willing to take
risks

41
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,079
it wouldn’t have before.

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,960
“They are getting to a point where the PLA
leadership

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,729
may actually tell Xi Jinping

44
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,830
that they are confident in their capabilities.”

45
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,159
And I would just like to remind any of the
PLA leadership

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,680
watching that I’ve always been a big fan
of Xi Jinping.

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,030
Ask anyone.

48
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,360
Back me up on this one, guys.

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
You might remember

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,590
that the Chinese Communist Party has been
a little upset

51
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,020
with the Canadian government since last December.

52
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,479
That’s when Meng Wanzhou,

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,160
the CFO of Huawei that was arrested in Canada.

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,340
The US had requested Canadian authorities

55
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,320
arrest and extradite her—

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,110
because she’s suspected of violating US
sanctions on Iran.

57
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,410
And even though China has asked Canada very
nicely

58
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,360
to ignore the rule of law and let Meng go,

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,310
that has not yet happened.

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,120
And now a second Canadian

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,730
has been sentenced to death in China.

62
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,990
This Canadian was allegedly dealing drugs
in China,

63
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,740
just like the first one sentenced to death
earlier this year.

64
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,460
What a coincidence.

65
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,740
These drug dealing Canadians, eh?

66
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,780
I should know.

67
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,070
I’m addicted to maple syrup.

68
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,670
Anyway, Canada is saying the Chinese Communist
Party

69
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,440
is arbitrarily applying the death sentence,

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
to which they replied Canada totally has “double
standards.”

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,200
Which, considering Canada abolished the death
penalty

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
n the 1970s,

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,600
I’m not quite sure what they mean.

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,060
In addition to the two Canadians sentenced
to death,

75
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,460
“Two other Canadian citizens,

76
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,100
former diplomat Michael Kovrig

77
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,190
and businessman Michael Spavor,

78
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,000
are also being held by China and face

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,650
accusations of harming national security.”

80
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,900
And if they’re watching the news,

81
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,300
I’m sure they’re very worried right now.

82
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,660
I’m just kidding.

83
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,590
They don’t show that kind of news inside
China.

84
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,050
A former CIA agent who allegedly

85
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,440
conspired with the Chinese Communist Party

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,610
is expected to plead guilty.

87
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,650
He’s being charged with trying to give

88
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,590
secret information to China.

89
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,510
But for some background,

90
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,880
this was happening at the same time as

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,400
the CIA’s network inside China was being
exposed.

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,850
Agents were arrested or killed.

93
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,500
So I don’t imagine the CIA is too happy
with the guy.

94
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,110
And the CIA are not the friendliest people

95
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,550
under the best of circumstances.

96
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,630
Though to be clear,

97
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,760
Lee was not charged with being the mole

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,230
who brought down the CIA network in China.

99
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,500
The cause of that is still unknown.

100
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,890
Though Lee is a suspect.

101
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,410
Speaking of the CIA, spies!

102
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,710
Spies everywhere!!!

103
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,810
That’s the message Chinese authorities have

104
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,720
for the good people of Beijing.

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,870
And a new directive has asked the public

106
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,550
to get involved in rooting them out.

107
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,530
Because asking the public to root out spies

108
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,570
definitely won’t result in baseless accusations.

109
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,900
It’s not like there’s a history of that
in communist China.

110
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,220
Let me spin you a little yarn

111
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,910
about the on going US-China trade talks.

112
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,940
The US might be putting duties

113
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,920
of up to 460% on Chinese yarn.

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,080
Okay, I mainly just wanted to make that pun.

115
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,610
Look, I spend all my days researching

116
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,900
incredibly depressing things.

117
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Just give me this.

118
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,250
Three Chinese banks may have violated

119
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,780
US sanctions on North Korea,

120
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,710
and a US judge wants their records.

121
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,300
The three banks are accused of funneling

122
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,980
over 100 million dollars into North Korea.

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,710
China is one of North Korea’s only real
allies.

124
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,630
Well, China and Russia.

125
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,430
Ok, China, Russia, and Dennis Rodman.

126
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,050
And they’re the only thing keeping the economy
afloat.

127
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,290
Like, a healthy layer of fat

128
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,890
keeps the Dear Leader afloat in a tub of water.

129
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,640
The Chinese Communist Party has been

130
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,620
really trampling on Hong Kong’s freedom.

131
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,020
And Taiwan is calling out the Hong Kong government

132
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,920
for going along with it.

133
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,100
Hong Kong denied entry

134
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,890
to 68 Taiwanese Falun Gong practitioners

135
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,330
who wanted to join a parade being held in
the city,

136
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,300
to expose the persecution of Falun Gong in
Mainland China.

137
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,080
Such delicious irony.

138
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,150
If I didn’t know better,

139
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,810
I would say the Chinese Communist Party

140
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,520
isn’t honoring the one country two systems
policy!

141
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,310
I don’t want to jump to any conclusions
though,

142
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,840
that really wouldn’t be fair.

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,430
And I’m afraid I have some bad news.

144
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,240
It’s going to be harder for all of us to
bring home the bacon.

145
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,530
The price of pork is expected to jump

146
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,380
because of the ongoing swine flu in China.

147
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,230
One industry expert told CNBC,

148
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,530
“If I really like bacon,

149
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,820
I’d be kind of stocking up.”

150
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,940
Ummm...excuse me,

151
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,400
I have to go now.
