1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,949
Life getting too peaceful?

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:05,410
A new Cold War will fix that!

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,270
Proxy battles and a new arms race

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,170
The confrontation is growing

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,380
between the US and China.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,020
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,420
I’m Chris Chappell

8
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:19,429
Good news for all of you watching

9
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:21,950
who thought the world was getting too peaceful.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,199
Steve.

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,560
The US State Department has approved

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,949
a possible 8 billion dollar fighter jet sale
to Taiwan.

13
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:30,480
Don’t let the headline fool you.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,110
It’s not a single 8-billion-dollar jet,

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,390
decked out with leather seats and a solid
gold interior.

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,570
Which would make it too heavy to fly.

17
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,800
It’s actually up to 66 new aircraft,

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,260
most likely Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets,

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,100
as well as 75 General Electric engines.

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,330
This comes only one month after the State
Department

21
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,350
approved a two billion dollar arms sale to
Taiwan.

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,480
The Trump Administration has proven to be

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,450
a staunch supporter of the island nation.

24
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,390
The Chinese Communist Party, of course,

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,410
does not consider it a nation.

26
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,140
They claim it belongs to China,

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,140
and has threatened to conquer Taiwan by force
if necessary.

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,990
As of last year, the Chinese military

29
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,590
had 2000 ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan.

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,909
Of course, US military support

31
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,509
has played a big role in preventing an invasion.

32
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,899
And just last week,

33
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,259
Taiwan increased military spending

34
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,609
to the highest it's been in a decade.

35
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,189
Obviously, the Chinese Communist Party

36
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:24,179
is not happy about the US weapons or arms
sales.

37
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:27,159
The Chinese regime is threatening sanctions
on US businesses

38
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,039
if the deal goes through.

39
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,549
Congress has 30 days to object to the deal,

40
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,240
but they’re probably not going to.

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,650
Because no matter what differences

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,649
Democrats and Republicans may have,

43
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,789
both sides can agree on one thing: standing
up to China.

44
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,789
The good news is,

45
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,539
no matter what differences the US and China
may have,

46
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,520
both sides can agree on one thing:

47
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,100
We’re in another Cold War!

48
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,600
If you ask China, the US started it.

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,459
“If [America’s] outdated views don't change,

50
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:58,049
if they're forever stuck in a cold war mentality,

51
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,799
I'm afraid to say that Sino-U.S. relations

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,709
will continue to face problems.”

53
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:06,409
And if you ask the US, China started it.

54
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,340
“By their own terms, and what Xi Jinping
himself enunciates,

55
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,349
what they’re waging against us is fundamentally
a cold war.

56
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,209
A cold war not like we saw during THE Cold
War.

57
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,349
But a cold war by definition.

58
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:27,400
A country that exploits all avenues of power
licit and illicit,

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,799
public and private,

60
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,760
economic and military,

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,860
to undermine the standing of your rival relative

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,650
to your own standing without resorting to
conflict.”

63
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,019
And if you ask China *and* Russia,

64
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,409
they say the US is starting an arms race.

65
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,470
See, at the beginning of this month,

66
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,640
the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces,

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,590
or INF, Treaty.

68
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,409
It was an agreement between the US and the
Soviet Union

69
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,019
that prohibited flight testing or possessing

70
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,080
intermediate-range ground launched missiles.

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,580
But, Russia kept violating it,

72
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,049
and China never signed it,

73
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,440
so it was only the US that was

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,579
out those ground launched missiles.

75
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,769
Until this week’s missile test.

76
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,019
That missile was similar to

77
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,080
the nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missile.

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,580
So even though Russia and China are saying
that

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,510
the US is starting a new arms race,

80
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,769
it’s more like the US is playing catch up.

81
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,560
Just like our pals in North Korea!

82
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,310
North Korea has fired two projectiles off
its eastern coast.

83
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
And this time -

84
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,930
it says it's shutting down peace talks with
South Korea too.

85
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,590
And you thought the world was too peaceful.

86
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,590
Steve.

87
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,010
And now it’s time for me to answer a question
from a fan

88
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,980
who supports the show on the crowd funding
website Patreon.

89
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,500
LT Straven asks:

90
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,980
“Does anyone know just how much money

91
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,519
china has flooded into their economy

92
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,760
to try and keep things running smoothly

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,420
followed by just how much longer they can
continue

94
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,870
to do such acts before things crash?”

95
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,909
That’s a good question.

96
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,770
It’s a little hard to know for sure,

97
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,999
since the entire Chinese economy is very opaque.

98
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:06,299
I mean, for years, what looked liked

99
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,530
GDP growth and economic production

100
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,359
was local officials building unnecessary infrastructure.

101
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:13,939
But we do know the number is at least

102
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,140
hundreds of billions of dollars.

103
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,220
At the beginning of the year,

104
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,500
in a single day,

105
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,110
the Chinese central government poured

106
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,810
$83 billion dollars into the economy.

107
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,220
A few months before that it was over 100 billion.

108
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,580
Of course the real question is

109
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,810
what is this going to do to the Chinese economy
overall.

110
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,770
These massive injections of cash

111
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,330
can keep the economy going in the short term,

112
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,470
but sooner or later,

113
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,900
there’s going to be a reckoning.

114
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,460
But no one knows quite when that will be.

115
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,840
It seems like the Communist Party’s strategy
right now

116
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,470
is to try to wait out the Trump administration,

117
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,400
and hope that a new US president is elected
in 2020

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,960
who will go back to business as usual.

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,520
But like I said,

120
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,550
China is one of the few bipartisan issues
right now.

121
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,020
The Chinese regime might find that no matter
who wins in 2020,

122
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,250
they lose.

123
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Thanks for your question.

124
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,949
And thanks to everyone watching.

125
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,169
We could not make this show if it weren’t
for your support,

126
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:06,270
either on Patreon,

127
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,490
or just sharing the show with your friends
and family.

128
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,310
So thanks for watching China Uncensored.

129
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,060
Once again I’m Chris Chappell,

130
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,920
see you next time.
