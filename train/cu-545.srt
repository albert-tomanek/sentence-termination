00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,090
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,540
the Pope wants to give the CCP more authority

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,640
over Chinese bishops.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,480
Underground Chinese Catholics

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,240
had better say their prayers...

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,040
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,730
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,050
Pope Francis loves China.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,610
Perhaps an odd statement considering

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,900
the Chinese Communist Party is officially
atheist.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,019
And they have been blowing up Christian churches.

12
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,120
But don’t worry, those were Protestant churches.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,180
Who needs those when you have

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,120
the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association?

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,800
That’s the official Catholic church in China.

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,600
For decades, the Vatican and the Communist
Party

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,610
have had a schism—

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,180
where the Vatican oversees

19
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,079
all the Catholics outside China,

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,220
and the Communist Party oversees

21
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,010
all the Catholics inside China.

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,450
In China, the Holy Trinity

23
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,120
looks slightly different.

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
The main issue of contention

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
is who has the right to appoint

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,079
Catholic bishops in China.

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,010
China’s position has always been

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,440
that the Communist Party gets to appoint

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,120
Catholic bishops for state-approved churches—

30
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,750
so they can preach the Good Word

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,290
of Jesus Christ with Chinese Characteristics.

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,570
This has obviously been a point of contention.

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,290
In some individual cases,

34
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,460
the Vatican has given its stamp of approval

35
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,060
to bishops the CCP appoints.

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,960
But now Pope Francis is trying to bridge the
gap

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,440
through broader cooperation with the CCP.

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,470
Some Catholics, though,

39
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,650
think this betrays Christ.

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,830
A cardinal from Hong Kong explained that

41
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,080
“The official bishops [in China]

42
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,120
are not really preaching the gospel...

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,920
They are preaching obedience

44
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,320
to Communist authority.”

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,450
This week the story broke

46
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,430
that the Vatican was asking two bishops

47
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,770
in China to retire or be demoted,

48
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,610
to make way for two Chinese Communist Party

49
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,020
approved ones.

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,770
It’s especially odd considering

51
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,740
one of those state-approved bishops

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,680
“was excommunicated in 2011

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
after being consecrated

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,180
without Vatican approval.

55
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,060
He is also a member of the National People’s
Congress,

56
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,970
the Chinese parliament.”

57
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,470
And it’s also odd considering how the CCP

58
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,220
routinely persecutes underground Catholics

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,440
who remain loyal to the Vatican

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,080
instead of to the Patriotic Catholic Association.

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,570
If Pope Francis is willing to give the Communist
Party

62
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,670
what it wants on the issue of appointing bishops,

63
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,420
it may be only a matter of time before

64
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,720
he tries to change the Vatican’s stance

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,890
on another big issue:

66
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,980
The Vatican is one of the few countries in
the world

67
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,720
that still officially recognize Taiwan

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,140
to be the true China.

69
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,460
What do you think of the Pope’s decision?
