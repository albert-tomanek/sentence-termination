00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,180
China Tries to Throw Its Weight Around

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,790
By Demanding G20 Countries

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,340
Don’t talk about Hong Kong

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,100
Will they stay silent?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,620
Welcome to China Uncensored. I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,949
China has demanded countries around the world

7
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:21,079
not bring up Hong Kong at the G20 Summit.

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:24,699
But the Hong Kong people have something to
say about that.

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,089
The situation in Hong Kong has become

10
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,910
an international embarrassment for the Chinese
Communist Party.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,150
In early June, 1 million Hong Kongers

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,210
took to the streets to protest an extradition
bill

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,460
that could allow Hong Kong authorities to
send people

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,050
to mainland China for trial.

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,350
They saw the bill as a threat to their way
of life.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,250
Then after continued protests were

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,000
met with police firing tear gas and rubber
bullets into the crowd,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,879
the Hong Kong government announced it would
postpone the bill,

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,940
but not officially withdraw it.

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,489
So *2 million* Hong Kongers took to the streets
to protest.

21
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,210
People in Hong Kong really don’t trust the
Chinese Communist Party.

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,750
So Beijing made some mistakes

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,470
in how they handled the situation in Hong
Kong.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,171
And like most of us, they absolutely don’t
want

25
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,690
anyone else to bring up their mistakes.

26
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:18,230
Especially not at the upcoming G20 summit
in Osaka, Japan.

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,860
“What I can tell you for sure is that G20

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,360
will not discuss the Hong Kong issue.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,500
We will also not allow G20 to discuss the
Hong Kong issue.”

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,680
The G20 is an annual meeting of the leaders

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,560
from some of the biggest economies in the
world.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,890
And these other countries might not be too
happy

33
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,290
about being told what they can talk about.

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,970
I mean, no one’s ever gotten President Trump

35
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,970
to not talk about something he wants to talk
about.

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,300
Especially on Twitter.

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,430
And according to US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo,

38
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,340
Trump is going to discuss Hong Kong with Chinese
leader

39
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,190
Xi Jinping when they meet during the summit.

40
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,950
Ahead of the G20, about 1500 Hong Kongers

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,150
spent the day in a marathon march to the consulates

42
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,020
of all 20 countries...except, well, China.

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,710
And while China says Hong Kong is purely an
internal affair…

44
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,100
“Hong Kong matters are purely an internal
affair for China.”

45
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,000
Hong Kongers are actually asking for some
foreign interference.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,590
Hong Kong is too small for China.

47
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,900
We need international powers to help.

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,200
We need foreign forces to help.

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,310
It’s America!

50
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,170
Outside of the US Consulate,

51
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,760
protest organizers called on the US to use
its influence.

52
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,280
In desperation, we seek your engagement and
assistance t

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,510
o fight back this authoritarian regime with
us.

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,170
The US state department expressed grave concern

55
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,400
about our situation and we cannot be more
appreciative of the care...

56
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,960
We humbly ask that you could further extend

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,819
our plea to the other heads of state in particularly

58
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,980
President Xi during the G20 talks, and stand
behind Hong Kong’s autonomy.

59
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,350
Representatives from 16 of the G20 countries
came out

60
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,680
to accept letters from the protesters.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Protesters were looking to remind these countries

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,570
that Hong Kong’s situation is an international
issue.

63
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,010
And they had some thoughts about the Chinese
regime’s demands.

64
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,850
So what do you think about China telling other
countries

65
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,720
not to bring up Hong Kong during the G20?

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
It's not up to him.

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,290
It's not up to China because it's a international
conference.

68
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,459
Of course, China cannot dictate the voices

69
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,440
or the discussion in the international society.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,819
I feel like the way that they are doing

71
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,430
it is actually showing their authoritarian
style

72
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,770
I don't know how they can do that.

73
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,370
If any of the leader try to raise a question,

74
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,680
I don't know how they can refuse to answer
or just try to ignore it.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,560
The more you say you should not bring it up,

76
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,770
the more you try to conceal what's happening,

77
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,260
it brings even more international notice.

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,710
That’s a good point.

79
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,121
Maybe the Chinese Communist Party

80
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,730
should try some reverse psychology.

81
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,639
The could tell everyone they will *totally
allow* the G20 to discuss Hong Kong.

82
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,449
Regardless, the Chinese Communist Party

83
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,219
won’t be too happy about Hongkongers going
around

84
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:27,199
asking other countries to help “liberate”
Hong Kong.

85
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
Unless they’re referring to the People’s
Liberation Army.

86
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,169
But protesters didn’t stop with just a marathon
petition protest.

87
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,210
They also held an online fundraising campaign

88
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,560
to buy full-page ads in major international
newspapers during the G20.

89
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,430
They asked for 3 million Hong Kong dollars.

90
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,560
They raised more than 6.7 million. In less
than 12 hours.

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,419
So far, they’ve confirmed ads with

92
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,059
the New York Times and the Globe and Mail,
among others.

93
00:04:56,059 --> 00:05:00,270
Hey, China never said newspapers couldn’t
talk about Hong Kong, right?

94
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,250
Now is not a great time for the Chinese Communist
Party.

95
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,770
It’s not just the massive public displays
of civil disobedience in Hong Kong.

96
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,419
It’s also increased international attention
on the persecution of the Uighurs,

97
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,409
And organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners.

98
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,659
If this continues, the Chinese regime

99
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:20,490
may have to change its strategy from demanding

100
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,240
other countries don’t bring up its human
rights abuses,

101
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,490
to sticking fingers in its ears and going
la la la, I can’t hear you.

102
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,940
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

103
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,460
Once again I’m Chris Chappell coming to
you from Hong Kong.

104
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,640
See you next time.
