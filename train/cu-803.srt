1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,960
The Chinese Communist Party

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,430
is pushing propaganda about Tibet

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,280
to unsuspecting Americans.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,220
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,320
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
Tibet: It was an independent country in the
early 20th Century.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,310
Then, in 1951,

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,670
the Chinese Communist Party convinced Tibet

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,279
to officially become part of their new People’s
Republic of China—

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,210
by invading Tibet and liberating the Tibetan
people...

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,370
from their freedom.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,609
And their religion.

13
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:38,199
And their lives.

14
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,109
Good thing they believe in reincarnation.

15
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:43,050
Although even that won’t save them now.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,850
To be clear, that is not a joke.

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,629
China really did ban unauthorized reincationations.

18
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:53,119
Anyway, the Communist Party quickly integrated
Tibet

19
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,019
into Chinese history books,

20
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,649
with the new narrative that Tibet

21
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,469
has been a part of China since ancient times—

22
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,539
despite that being clearly not true,

23
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,489
because you don’t have to invade a place

24
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,119
that’s already part of your country.

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,340
And in the seven decades since then,

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,010
the Communist Party has pushed the idea

27
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,549
that Tibetans are so much better off

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,000
under their benevolent rule.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,020
Look!

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,710
Tibet has been liberated!

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,719
Look at Tibet’s bountiful harvest, thanks
to Chairman Mao!

32
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,719
Look!

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:28,259
Tibet’s capital is the happiest city in
China!

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,590
But the challenge with pushing a false narrative

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,479
is that you have to repeat it over and over
again

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,609
to get people to believe you.

37
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,230
So in the year 2020,

38
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,119
while the rest of the world is busy worrying
about

39
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,619
all the other terrible things happening in
China—

40
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,729
the deadly coronavirus,

41
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,200
the concentration camps in Xinjiang,

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,369
the ongoing protests in Hong Kong,

43
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:51,549
and THE DEADLY CORONAVIRUS—

44
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,299
it’s easy to miss how the Communist Party

45
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,909
continues to push false narratives about Tibet.

46
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,759
Matt Gnaizda has more.

47
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,020
Queens, New York.

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,310
Famous for America’s worst airport;

49
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,830
That weird spaceship thing from the first
Men in Black movie;

50
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,799
And Chinese Communist Party propaganda.

51
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,349
Ok, it’s not famous for the Chinese propaganda.

52
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:16,530
That’s part of the problem.

53
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,000
Chinese propaganda is hidden in plain sight.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,310
And it’s making its way into

55
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,450
the nooks and crannies of mainstream America.

56
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,510
Even here, at the Queens Public Library.

57
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,700
Obviously, someone at the Chinese consulate
screwed up.

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,510
I mean, who goes to the library?

59
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,030
The answer to that rhetorical question is:
Tibetans.

60
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,790
They came here to protest what they call

61
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,709
a “politically motivated, oppressive exhibition”

62
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,150
at the Elmhurst branch of the Queens Public
Library.

63
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,209
I went inside, and indeed—there’s a small
exhibit

64
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,519
that tells people how great Tibet is

65
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,680
under the Communist Party’s rule.

66
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,590
“Unfortunately, the library is supposed
to be a place

67
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,989
where people are learning, a true education,
true knowledge.

68
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:03,299
However, unfortunately we see some false propaganda

69
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,050
with the partnership with the Chinese Consulate
by Queens Library.”

70
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,050
That’s right.

71
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,489
This exhibit was sponsored directly by

72
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,239
the Chinese Consulate in New York.

73
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,450
Of course, it doesn’t say that anywhere.

74
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,379
There’s just this “introduction”

75
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:18,659
about how China has improved Tibet’s literacy
rate,

76
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,049
economic development,

77
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,910
and environmental protection.

78
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,620
And there’s seven beautiful photos to prove
their point.

79
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,470
I mean, China built them a train!

80
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,739
How could they not be a happy ethnic minority?

81
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:31,959
“What they have inside the library right
now

82
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,110
is an exhibit talking about Tibetan identity

83
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,560
and Tibetan culture

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,420
that is created by the very people

85
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,610
that have suppressed this culture,

86
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,010
that have tried to virtually extinguish our
culture,

87
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,230
and now they're allowing them

88
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,560
to have the monopoly on telling our story.

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,110
So that's why we said it's not an issue of
points of views,

90
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,050
but rather it's an issue of cultural appropriation,

91
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,271
and it further silences Tibetan people

92
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,299
who have already been largely marginalized.”

93
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,910
“So you’re upset about the government

94
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,409
taking away your freedom of speech

95
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,909
and you're upset about cultural appropriation.

96
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,790
Are you far right or far left?”

97
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,409
“I see that it's not a left or right issue.

98
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,829
It's just an issue of humanity.”

99
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,530
So Tibetan activists met with Queens library
officials.

100
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,220
Officials told them they plan to keep exhibit

101
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,000
up through the end of June—

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,140
and that the Chinese Consulate

103
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,010
actually plans to sponsor exhibits

104
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,840
at seven public libraries in Queens.

105
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,910
Officials told me in a statement

106
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,610
that the “Queens Public Library

107
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,310
is a forum for many different points of view,

108
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,970
including those that stir passionate debate.”

109
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,511
And nothing stirs passionate debate

110
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:35,700
like blatant lies from dirty communists!

111
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,140
That second part’s not from their statement.

112
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,080
Anyway, the library did agree to at least
add a label

113
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,790
saying it’s sponsored by the Chinese Consulate.

114
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,440
But for the roughly 9,000 Tibetan people living
in Queens,

115
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
that’s not enough.

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,110
They want the propaganda exhibit taken down.

117
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,070
They say it doesn’t exactly show a truthful
perpsective—

118
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,100
considering that the Chinese Communist Party

119
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,170
is guilty of mass genocide in Tibet,

120
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,880
and continues a ruthless campaign of cultural
destruction.

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,230
The Dalai Lama has called Tibet a “hell
on earth.”

122
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,630
Surely Tibetans wouldn’t think so

123
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,250
if they would just follow orders,

124
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,830
and take down their portraits of the Dalai
Lama,

125
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,200
and replace them with Chinese party leaders.

126
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,780
And show loyalty to the Communist Party.

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,070
Those who refuse, of course, are tortured.

128
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,480
So Tibetans in exile, understandably,

129
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,210
want Americans to know what’s happening
in Tibet—

130
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,670
and not from the perspective of the Chinese
consulate.

131
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,810
“Having an exhibit that is sponsored

132
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,350
by the Chinese Communist Party

133
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,080
in our local library,

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,600
when we have Tibetan-American students like
myself

135
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,500
that like to visit these libraries,

136
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,790
that is silencing.

137
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,020
That is silencing for an entire group of people,

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,190
an entire community.

139
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,280
Having this exhibit is an automatic way

140
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,270
of further marginalizing an oppressed group.”

141
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,460
“What I'm getting from this

142
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,390
is that young people still go to the library.”

143
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,030
Maybe that’s the problem.

144
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,160
If only people could be a little dumber,

145
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,180
and stop going to the library.

146
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,740
This is Matt Gnaizda in Queens, New York.

147
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,020
Thanks, Matt.

148
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,800
So what do you think?

149
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Leave your comments below.

150
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,580
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

151
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,220
Thanks for watching China Uncensored.
