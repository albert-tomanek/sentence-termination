1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,720
China made the world’s medical supplies

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,040
Then the coronavirus hit...

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,520
Have we learned our lesson

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,920
About Made in China products?

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,560
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
China controls the global medical supply chain.\h\h

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,840
That’s not too good in the event\h
of a pandemic. Kind of a problem.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,440
China covered up the coronavirus\h
to hoard medical supplies.

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,840
The Chinese government told\h
Western companies like 3M,\h\h

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,240
that were making N95 masks in China, that\h
they were no longer allowed to export them.\h

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,080
The Chinese Communist Party even\h
threatened to withhold life saving medicine\h\h

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,160
if the US kept asking questions\h
about the origins of the coronavirus.

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,360
If only these critical medical supplies weren’t\h
all made in China. If only someone tried to warn\h\h

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,680
us. Well, someone did. Mike Bowen, co-founder of\h
the medical supply company Prestige Ameritech.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,520
For 15 years he tried to tell anyone who\h
would listen, the enormous national security\h\h

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,720
disaster the United States was facing. But\h
four different US administrations wouldn’t\h\h

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,960
listen. And if you think we’ve learned our lesson\h
after the coronavirus pandemic, you’d be wrong.\h\h

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,920
The US is making the same mistakes all over\h
again. And it’s not just a problem with Made\h\h

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,400
in China masks. It’s a problem with Made in\h
China everything. Joining me now is Mike Bowen.

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,360
​​ Thanks for joining us, Mike.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Thank you. My pleasure.

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,720
I can tell right off the bat, this is going to be\h
one of those interviews that makes me angry. So\h\h

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
the coronavirus pandemic definitely exposed\h
a lot of the fault lines in American society.\h\h

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,120
But I think one thing that's getting lost\h
now is just how unprepared the US was for a\h\h

25
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,160
sudden demand in PPEs, things like the N95 mask.\h
What happened in the early days of the pandemic?

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Well, in January I started seeing a\h
lot of chatter, I'm getting emails from\h\h

27
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,160
around the world, I'm getting emails from DHS,\h
somebody at the border emailed me and said,\h\h

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,480
"Do you make respirators in the US?" And I said,\h
"Yeah." "Can you make a lot of them?" I said,\h\h

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,960
"Yeah." I said, "Why?" "Well we think this\h
could be a problem." And I said, "Okay,\h\h

30
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
tell me as one American to another, like\h
a real problem?" And he said, "Yeah, yeah,\h\h

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,040
I do." So I was getting a lot of stuff\h
like that. So I contracted Rick Bright,\h\h

32
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,120
who I'd been in contact with for a couple of\h
years, with HHS and said, "Hey, this is going\h\h

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,640
to be bad. I think we're going to be in trouble."\h
And then right after that, all hell broke loose.

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,080
And so for 15 years, you've been\h
trying to warn the country that\h\h

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,120
we have a serious mask shortage. China\h
controls everything. Why did no one listen?

36
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
I can't really figure that\h
out. I talked to everybody,\h\h

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,920
I talked to people in government, politicians, I\h
talked to hospital administrators, hospital group\h\h

38
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,200
purchasing organizations and they either didn't\h
believe it or didn't want to believe it. And\h\h

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,840
it was on the news every time there was a flu or\h
whatever, I would be interviewed. And I would say,\h\h

40
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,280
"Okay, yeah, I'm selling a lot of masks. That's\h
the story you want. But here's the real story\h\h

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,720
is that China and other countries control\h
the US mask supply. If there's a pandemic,\h\h

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,680
those supplies will be diverted to their\h
citizens and our healthcare workers and patients\h\h

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,880
will be unprotected. This is a national security\h
problem that we need to fix. Doesn't cost much to\h\h

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,560
fix. The whole market is only $150 million. Let's\h
fix it." And I couldn't get anyone to take action.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,440
This is something you've been screaming into the\h
void, for four US government administrations,\h\h

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,200
Bush, Obama, Trump, now Biden. How\h
did China end up dominating the\h\h

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
global medical supply chain? Didn't\h
anyone think that was a bad idea?

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Low prices. And you have to understand\h
that hospitals, America's hospitals,\h\h

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,600
belong to group purchasing\h
organizations, they call them GPOs and\h\h

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,880
America's hospitals don't make buying decisions\h
on their own. They don't negotiate on their own.\h\h

51
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,800
They join a thousand other hospitals where the\h
GPO and the GPO will send out a bid for instance,\h\h

52
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,680
masks or respirators. And so it's an all or\h
nothing proposition. The way you win the bids\h\h

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
is to have the lowest price. The way you have\h
the lowest price is to make products in China.

54
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,240
And that's because China being\h
a state controlled economy,\h\h

55
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
they're purposefully putting out\h
things below market cost, correct?

56
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,560
That's the way it seems. I know for a fact that\h\h

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Chinese masks that are being sold\h
here to distributors for a penny-

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,320
A penny.

59
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Cannot be made for, yeah, a penny, the cost is way\h
higher than that. So they're being subsidized. So\h\h

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:00,320
it must be by the Chinese government. And for\h
what reason, maybe to control the PPE supply of\h\h

61
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,040
the world, it's not just the USA. I don't have\h
international business. The reason I don't have\h\h

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:12,480
international business because China owns the\h
market. And I've had hundreds of distributors\h\h

63
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,800
from around the world call me in the past and\h
say, "We'd like to sell your masks," until I\h\h

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
give them my price. And they say, "Well,\h
we have to stay with the Chinese masks."

65
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,840
Certainly if they're charging a penny, the Chinese\h
government is not interested in making money,\h\h

66
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,760
but for comparison, how much do your masks\h
cost? If China is selling them for a penny,\h\h

67
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,840
what does Prestige Ameritech sell them for?

68
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,680
About a dime. So you can buy two masks-

69
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,160
A dime.

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,240
Yeah, a dime. It's a class two medical device.\h
You can buy two of them for less than the price of\h\h

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,720
the gumball. The penny price is like,\h
well, let's just put it in other terms,\h\h

72
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,880
let's say that Russia introduced a car\h
here and that car cost a hundred dollars.\h\h

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay, We all know that they can't do that.\h
Even non-business people know that that's not\h\h

74
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
right. Well, what's happening here?\h
You can't sell a mask for a penny.

75
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,400
But so the difference between 5 cents and a penny,\h\h

76
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,000
we are sacrificing our national security\h
and the lives of Americans for pennies.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,840
For a very small amount of money. The entire\h
US mask supply, before COVID, I don't know what\h\h

78
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,920
it's going to be after COVID, maybe bigger, was\h
$150 million with an M, the whole market. There\h\h

79
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,320
are 6,000 hospitals, divide a million by 6,000,\h
that's how much it would cost each hospital to buy\h\h

80
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,200
masks. Okay, now let's say that my mask\h
costs 30% less, or sorry, 30% more than\h\h

81
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,000
the masks. It's not a big problem. It's the tiny,\h
teeny little, hospitals are spending more on-

82
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,640
Surgeries.

83
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,160
Diapers. Yeah, they're spending more\h
on all kinds of things than they are\h\h

84
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,440
on masks. Masks are a very small expense\h
and yet, because they want to save pennies,\h\h

85
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,080
the hospitals and the American made\h
mass makers who went to China to\h\h

86
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,800
serve the hospitals, have put the US\h
at a severe national security problem.

87
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,560
I mean, I just remember at the start of the\h
pandemic, the panic over mask, what a political\h\h

88
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,200
issue it was, the government telling Average\h
Americans, "Don't wear masks. We need to save them\h\h

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:34,800
for the frontline medical workers." And all of\h
this for like the difference between, for pennies.

90
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:46,800
Yeah. Yeah. It was a very strange thing to watch,\h
especially as someone who sells a product that\h\h

91
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,000
nobody really thinks about during peacetime. I\h
mean, my phones don't ring during peacetime. And\h\h

92
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,960
a year ago I was getting a phone call\h
a minute and an email every 30 seconds.

93
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,520
Well, has the coronavirus\h
pandemic changed anything?\h\h

94
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,160
Surely people are paying\h
attention to the issue now.

95
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,640
I would like to say that that's true. I\h
thought that was true after H1N1 10 years ago.

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
The swine flu.

97
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,760
And when, again, again, I'd been telling the\h
message for three or four years when H1N1 hit\h\h

98
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,240
and I thought, okay, people get it now.\h
We're going to fix this problem. No,\h\h

99
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,040
as soon as it ended, it went back to the same way.\h
Although people who came to me crying, literally\h\h

100
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,495
some of them crying on the phone, wanting masks,\h
we provided masks, they went back to their foreign\h\h

101
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:41,760
made masks afterwards. So we're not learning.\h
And I fear that we're not learning this time too,\h\h

102
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,760
because I actually have hospital systems and\h
GPOs right now telling me that they're going to\h\h

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,080
continue to rely on mainly on foreign made masks\h
because they cost less. And they will supplement\h\h

104
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,760
that by buying, maybe 25% of American made masks.\h
But what they don't get is that doesn't work.\h\h

105
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,920
This pandemic was mild, in a severe pandemic\h
china would cut off 80% of the mask supply. So\h\h

106
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,240
the people who are making 20, they\h
can't, the Americans that they're\h\h

107
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,840
using to have some sense of security,\h
won't be able to make up the difference.

108
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
And when you say this pandemic\h
was mild, you're saying like,\h\h

109
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,600
comparing it to a pandemic that kills two\h
in every 10 people versus two in a hundred.

110
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,320
Right. Well, here's the proof of what I'm saying.\h
We've got people out there that don't even believe\h\h

111
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,600
it's real. Why not? Because there are a\h
lot of people who don't know somebody who\h\h

112
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
has died. Well in 1918, with the pandemic,\h
everybody knew people who died. It was bad.\h\h

113
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,840
Let me put it this way. Let's say that we\h
had an Ebola outbreak and there's dead people\h\h

114
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,600
laying in the street and people get it and they\h
bleed out of their eyes and dying all over the\h\h

115
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,560
place. Would masks have become politicized?\h
Would vaccines have become politicized?\h\h

116
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,800
Would states be having secret vaccinations for\h
people who are embarrassed to get vaccinated\h\h

117
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,960
because their friends are going to make fun of\h
them? No. People would have been standing in\h\h

118
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,600
line to get vaccinated and standing in line\h
to get masks, instead of calling it a hoax.

119
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,640
And I fear that having a bunch of these, what I\h
call the boy who cried wolf in a sense, hey, it's\h\h

120
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,800
going to be bad, then it's bad. Hey, it's going to\h
be bad, it's not bad. We've been through that four\h\h

121
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,160
or five times, SARS, Ebola, H1N1 and now COVID,\h
when the big one does come I think we're going to\h\h

122
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,280
be in big trouble because I don't think people\h
are going to believe it until it's too late.

123
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,960
Well, so since the coronavirus pandemic\h
began, American manufacturing has\h\h

124
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,840
stepped up. There are companies making masks.\h\h

125
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,760
Is this a sign that the issue has changed,\h
or that it's been solved, that America can\h\h

126
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,800
kind of take away some of that control that\h
China has over the global medical supply chain?

127
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,480
I don't think so because the people who went\h
into business, the 50 or 100 people who went into\h\h

128
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,800
business of masks this year are all going to go\h
out of business. In the next three or four months,\h\h

129
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,000
they will all be out of business. Most of them\h
will probably be bankrupt because the peacetime\h\h

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,400
market can't support, they can't support them,\h
there's not enough business, especially if the\h\h

131
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,000
government doesn't level the playing field\h
and the Chinese are still allowed to play.\h\h

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,800
The market's going to be tiny still. Instead of\h
eight companies trying to survive, or five or six,\h\h

133
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,240
there's going to be 110, that doesn't work. So no,\h\h

134
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,440
this is going to end. All those companies are\h
going to go out of business. We're not going\h\h

135
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,560
to have giant amount of capacity. And we are\h
at risk of having this happen all over again.

136
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
So the Chinese Communist Party is\h
controlling America's medical supply\h\h

137
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,800
chain, that's a national security issue\h
transparently, what needs to be done?

138
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Well, you're asking a businessman a political\h
question. I don't know. I don't know.\h\h

139
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,560
I see that the problem, it's a problem in our\h
country and it's not just masks of course,\h\h

140
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,920
it's drugs and it's critical\h
items that we have to have\h\h

141
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,120
and they control them. And the reason they\h
control them is they bought the rights to do that.\h\h

142
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,360
They gave us prices we couldn't resist, those\h
everyday low prices are going to kill us.

143
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
America can't even make aspirin anymore.

144
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:53,840
Yeah. And the list goes on. The list goes on and\h
sometimes too, it's not just the medicine itself,\h\h

145
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:01,920
it's the ingredients that go into it. I hope\h
that we haven't passed the point of no return,\h\h

146
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
but I think it's possible that we have. I don't\h
know if this is a problem that can be fixed. And\h\h

147
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,600
for a couple of decades, we have just\h
open the doors to Chinese manufacturing,\h\h

148
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
and we have shuttered our factories.\h
So I don't know. Can you go back,\h\h

149
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,160
that's a question for the\h
economists, I don't know.

150
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
So what's next for you and Prestige Ameritech?

151
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,600
Well, we're continuing to hammer on the\h
government. I'm telling them they need a plan.

152
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,160
Good.

153
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,600
Yeah. Any plan that they have to have a\h
secure mask supply that allows China to\h\h

154
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,160
sell masks at cheaper prices than Americans\h
will fail because hospitals will buy them.\h\h

155
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,880
They're more concerned about saving money than\h
they are about having a mask supply. And they\h\h

156
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,600
can rationalize buying foreign products. They\h
rationalize it by saying, we're cash strapped,\h\h

157
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,840
or we need to save money. Here's how we can save\h
money. But when you look at it and drill down,\h\h

158
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:05,520
they're not saving that much money. It's a 40,\h
$50 million problem, split across 6,000 hospitals.

159
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,880
So horrible. Thanks for joining us, Mike. This is\h
an important topic that people need to know about.

160
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,000
It is an important topic. That's\h
why thank you for interviewing me.\h\h

161
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,280
And that's why I say yes to anyone who\h
wants to, I try to get the word out.

162
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,360
Well, thank you. Thank you for trying\h
to fight this fight for 15 years. I wish\h\h

163
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,280
somebody had listened to you.

164
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,240
My pleasure. American, well\h
lives, human lives are important.\h\h

165
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,880
And this wasn't about me trying to\h
make money. What salesman tells a story\h\h

166
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,720
it doesn't work for 13 years? I did that. I did\h
that because it's the only story and it's true.

167
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,760
And you could have sold out to China yourself. You\h\h

168
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,960
could have moved your manufacturing\h
over to China, made a bunch of money.

169
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,680
We could have started out in China, or we\h
could have moved to Mexico. And no, we've\h\h

170
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,680
chosen to walk barefoot through a lot of broken\h
glass. And we have managed to survive. We're a\h\h

171
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:21,760
small family company, it gets a lot of publicity,\h
but we're just a small company and we're private\h\h

172
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,160
ownership. We don't have deep pockets. We're\h
just out trying to do the right thing and create\h\h

173
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,920
jobs. We put our plant in Texas, my business\h
partner, Dan Reese put our company in Texas,\h\h

174
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,040
the founder of the company because simply,\h
because he thought it was the thing to do.

175
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,880
Well. I think I can speak for everyone\h
when I say I really appreciate what you've\h\h

176
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
done and what you've been trying to do.

177
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Well, I appreciate you\h
helping me get the word out.\h\h

178
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
If you ever need to interview\h
me again, give me a call.

179
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,600
Hopefully it won't require\h
another horrible global pandemic.

180
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah, I agree.

181
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,360
Thanks Mike.

182
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,280
Thank you.

183
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
Believe me, we only just scratched the surface.\h\h

184
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,960
If you want to know how deep this rabbit\h
hole goes, be sure to check out the hour-long\h\h

185
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,320
interview we did with Mike Bowen on the\h
China Unscripted Podcast. Link is below.

186
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,840
Once again I’m Chris Chappell, see you next time.
