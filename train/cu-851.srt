00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,320
Cars in China

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,419
are being swallowed by giant sinkholes.

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,740
They’re also exploding.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:22,340
Welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:31,050
I’m Chris Chappell.

you should be protecting your identity whenever

you go online by using a VPN like Surfshark.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,590
China is opening up!

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,600
But not in the way we all hoped.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,950
Watch closely.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,820
In less than a second after a motorcyclist
crossed the road, a massive pit opened up.

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,850
And it swallowed up a car like it was a hot
dog eating competition.

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,100
Luckily, the driver was ok.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,239
That was on June 5th in China’s Jiangxi
province.

15
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,450
A similar incident happened two days earlier
in another Chinese province, Guangdong.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:14,250
On a calm evening, a massive sinkhole there
suddenly opened up and swallowed half a bus.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,140
And over in Qinghai province, this bus fell
into a 30-foot deep sinkhole that again appeared

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,120
out of nowhere.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,390
Then the bus exploded, killing 6 people.

20
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,080
In my previous episode about exploding manhole
covers , I talked about Tofu Dreg Construction.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,110
Basically, a lot of infrastructure in China
is made on the cheap—with low quality materials,

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,690
and poor safety standards.

23
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,450
Mostly, this is due to corruption that happens
during various phases of construction.

24
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,220
Things end up getting built, but they’re
not built to last.

25
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,700
Take for example the Hang-Shao-Tai Expressway
It’s a massive 100-mile expressway that

26
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,740
cost about 6 billion dollars to build.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,200
Last week, one of the bridges totally collapsed
before it was even completed.

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,950
The Expressway Bridge collapsed.

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:13,200
I was just cooking food, and I got f*cking
startled to death.

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,420
And the crazy part?

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,740
Other parts of that expressway have already
been opened for traffic!

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,140
Are those parts safe?

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,920
I guess we’ll find out eventually.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,420
Chinese officials are in such a rush to develop,
and increase GDP—that the look of a city

35
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,060
becomes more important than the lives of the
people living there.

36
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,760
And sinkholes are part of that problem.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,810
In December of 2019, a 120-foot deep sinkhole
suddenly appeared on a street in Guangzhou.

38
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,840
“2 cars and 3 people fell into the hole.

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,620
After arriving at the scene, the first action
was not to save people, but to fill it in...

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,570
The authorities did not rescue people at all.

41
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,480
One mother cried, ‘They just buried my husband
and son there alive!’”

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,820
And Chinese authorities don’t like taking
responsibility when things go wrong.

43
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,410
Because that would look bad.

44
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,970
Here’s another video that went viral last
week.

45
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,440
It shows a sudden explosion happening at the
gate of the Fuxin Government Office in Liaoning

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Province.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,730
“At around 2:20pm on May 24, near the east
side of People’s Square, a two-wheeled motor

48
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,560
vehicle was driving from east to west and
suddenly exploded...The cause of the explosion

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,800
is still under investigation.”

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,660
Yes, it’s still under investigation.

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,130
Meanwhile, officials have already decided
what happened.

52
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,790
It was a spontaneous explosion, with nothing
further to look into.

53
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,230
However, some Chinese netizens noticed a discrepancy
from the official report.

54
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,000
The clip obviously shows the explosion happening
in front of a government office, not the People’s

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,070
Square like the report said.

56
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,910
Plus, it was a sudden explosion.

57
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,410
Not a typical motorcycle explosion—because
when those batteries explode, they usually

58
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,349
start by emitting smoke.

59
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,900
A lot of smoke.

60
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,610
Whereas this explosion was sudden and clean,
with no smoke beforehand.

61
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,870
And that led to even more controversy over
whether this was actually someone setting

62
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,650
off a bomb to target government officials.

63
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,910
“Informed netizens disclosed that the biker
was strapped with explosives at the entrance

64
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,460
of the Fuxin City Government office, waiting
for the black car to go out.

65
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,740
When it arrived in front of the motorcycle,
it detonated homemade explosives and carried

66
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,240
out a suicide attack.

67
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,030
However, the officials did not announce the
results of the investigation.”

68
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,010
But Mao forbid the real story should come
out!

69
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,600
People might then start to question why anyone
would target the benevolent government!

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,660
—the government that’s always there to
make sure people are safe.

71
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,520
Except when they’re not.

72
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,710
The problem is, corruption is deeply rooted
in China.

73
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,850
It’s happening at all levels of government
and the Communist Party.

74
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,130
Perhaps some day, a gaping hole will reveal
itself, and officials won’t know how to

75
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,740
get out.

76
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,310
But until that day, maybe don’t drive in
China.

77
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,320
Or walk in China.

78
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,669
Or go to China.

79
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,920
And this episode is sponsored by Surfshark.

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,380
Because you definitely can’t access the
real internet in China.

81
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,790
But wherever you are in the world, when you
go online, you should be using a VPN like

82
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,210
Surfshark to protect your identity.

83
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,900
And if you’re doing, say, an investigation
into whether an official report is true, using

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,500
a VPN can help protect you from surveillance
and even arrest.

85
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,750
So I recommend you use Surfshark to protect
yourself online.

86
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,750
Plus, when you use Surfshark’s CleanWeb
mode, you’ll be protected from most trackers,

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,850
ads and malware.
