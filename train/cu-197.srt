00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,340
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,020
China takes aim at guns.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,879
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I’m your
host Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,600
And this is 18 year old Liu Dawei.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,910
He will be spending the rest of his life in
a Chinese prison.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,970
Why?

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,620
Because the judge let him off easy for being
a teenager.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,050
Even though he wanted to give Liu the death
penalty.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,180
Wow, so what heinous crime did this young
man commit?

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,180
Terrorism?

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,680
Multiple homicides?

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,050
Dressing up like a giant purple dinosaur

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,630
and making up his own theme song to the tune
of a beloved patriotic classic?

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,720
Nope.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,980
He ordered fake guns online.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,240
Not real guns, replicas.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,700
24 to be exact.

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,380
From a Taiwanese store.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,250
But that shipment never arrived

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,330
because it was intercepted by authorities.

21
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,960
According to state-run People’s Daily,

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,879
police “identified 20 out of the 24 ‘replica
guns’ as real guns.”

23
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,729
And so this 18 year old kid was sentenced
to life in prison for arms trafficking.

24
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:11,890
And get this:

25
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,039
Those 20 real guns aren’t actually...real
guns.

26
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,649
It’s just that China has such crazy strict
gun laws,

27
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:25,689
that they include things no other country
would consider to be guns.

28
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,869
That was actually the defense Liu’s lawyer
used in court.

29
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,340
According to China’s gun laws,

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,929
anything with a barrel that can shoot an object

31
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:39,069
with a force of 1.8 joules per centimeter
squared is a gun.

32
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:42,849
That’s less than one-tenth of what is classified
as a gun

33
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:44,789
in that bastion of anarchy,

34
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,560
Taiwan.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,520
Liu’s lawyer argued that’s pretty much
the same amount of force

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,320
he could produce throwing a “handful of
beans.”

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,310
After which he was promptly arrested for having...hand-guns.

38
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,310
“Please clap.”

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,219
Ok, that last part was a joke.

40
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,959
But it is true that in China,

41
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,369
an object that could shoot a projectile

42
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,780
with as much force as throwing a handful of
beans

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,760
is considered in the same league as a Magnum.

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,200
“Being that this is a .44 magnum,

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,180
the most powerful handgun in the world,

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,640
and will blow your head clean off,

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,290
you gotta ask yourself a question.

48
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,420
Do I feel lucky?”

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,380
Liu most definitely was not lucky.

50
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,610
And his plea to the judge to

51
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,410
“Shoot me dead with the guns I bought!

52
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,590
If I die, I'll admit I'm guilty,"

53
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,040
probably missed the mark.

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,140
Now, Liu was arrested in 2014.

55
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,160
His family has appealed the ruling,

56
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,020
and are awaiting a final verdict.

57
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,710
Their appeal was accepted for review by a
higher court earlier this month.

58
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,240
As I said, China has some of the toughest
gun control laws in the world.

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,060
Private gun ownership is banned.

60
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,710
And that includes rifles, pistols, and even
gun replicas.

61
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,210
Simply possessing a single gun can get you
a three-year prison sentence.

62
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,410
An actual gun crime typically means execution.

63
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,590
Of course, rule of law is a mercurial thing
in Communist China.

64
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,990
Liu got a life sentence for buying replica
guns.

65
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:21,690
But this guy only got 12 years for running
an entire online gun store.

66
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,560
Mao Zedong famously said “political power
grows out of the barrel of a gun.”

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,990
And so once they got political power,

68
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,740
the Chinese Communist Party made sure to take
those guns

69
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,840
out of the hands of the people.

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,900
But there’s one thing Mao couldn’t have
predicted:

71
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,090
a lot of Chinese people think guns are really
cool.

72
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,050
At least that’s if you go by the increasing
gun tourism industry

73
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,880
targeting Chinese travelers.

74
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,510
Umm, no pun intended.

75
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,960
For a change.

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,680
Chinese tourists flock to the United States

77
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,250
for a chance to shoot a live weapon at a gun
range.

78
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,370
Although according to state-run China Daily,

79
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,420
“some people have complained that Chinese
tourists at gun clubs

80
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,980
have not been careful,

81
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,600
taking pictures and pointing the guns at other
people.”

82
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,980
Well that's not very polite.

83
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,930
And although it’s super illegal to own a
gun in China,

84
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,370
it actually seems to be pretty easy to buy
one,

85
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,170
if you want to take that risk.

86
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,259
You can go to the dark web

87
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,150
and get guns shipped from overseas in pieces,

88
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,770
like this reporter found.

89
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,200
Or just Google it,

90
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,330
like this reporter did.

91
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,710
So how will the Communist Party handle the
increasing fascination with guns?

92
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,460
And what do you think of Liu Danwei’s sentence?

93
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,729
I know they smuggle bear paws into China as
medicine,

94
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,759
but should they have the right to bear arms?

95
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,069
Leave your comments below.

96
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,270
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

97
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,629
Once again I’m Chris Chappell.

98
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:45,700
See you next time.
