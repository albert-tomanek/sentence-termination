00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,830
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,020
Sierra Leone is the first country in Africa

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,149
to sidestep a debt trap set by China!

4
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:08,320
Will others follow?

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,740
Hi. Welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,410
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,410
Sierra Leone.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,040
A country in West Africa more or less

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,530
the size of South Carolina.

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,500
In fact, it’s kind of what South Carolina
sees

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,320
when it looks in the mirror.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,330
But unlike South Carolina,

13
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,030
where the average life expectancy is 77 years,

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,920
people in Sierra Leone live to an average
of just 52.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,839
Still, that’s a LOT better than in 1995,

16
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:39,920
when Sierra Leone was in the middle of a bloody
10-year civil war a

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,280
nd people barely made it to age 35.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,940
“We were coming through town,

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,530
searching for food,

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,260
when they got all of us. T

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,449
hey captured us in an ambush.

22
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,109
They captured all of us.

23
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,730
They assembled seven of us. Six were killed.”

24
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,739
Luckily that’s all in the past.

25
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,709
Still, to this day Sierra Leone remains

26
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,540
one of the poorest countries in Africa.

27
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,439
More than half the population lives below
the poverty line

28
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,939
of one dollar twenty five cents a day.

29
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,140
But recently, things seem to be looking up
for Sierra Leone.

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,180
“We are a successful modern, stable democracy.

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,840
One that has evolved and matured over 20 years

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,289
from chaos and lawlessness of civil conflict.”

33
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,780
That was the country’s new president,

34
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,039
Julius Maada Bio,

35
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,600
elected in April.

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Here he is in China…

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,189
...at the recent Forum on China-Africa Cooperation,

38
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,109
where Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged

39
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,299
$60 billion dollars of loans to Africa.

40
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,689
But President Bio made headlines last week

41
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,689
when he overturned a huge deal with China

42
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,159
hat his predecessor Ernest Bai Koroma…

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,500
...signed a few years back.

44
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,909
The plan was for a Chinese company

45
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,280
to build the Mamamah International Airport…

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,399
...with funding from a Chinese state-owned
bank

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,840
to the tune of 312 million dollars.

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,429
A third of that was to be from a loan that
Sierra Leone

49
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:04,369
would have to pay back.

50
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:07,350
Sierra Leone’s Minister of Transport and
Aviation

51
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,600
announced the project’s cancellation in
a letter,

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,610
part of which was published in the Daily Nation,

53
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,610
a Kenyan newspaper.

54
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,780
So instead of taking out a massive loan to
build

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,280
a brand new airport that it doesn’t need,

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,050
Sierra Leone is going to fix up the one it
already has.

57
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,840
That seems like a prudent choice,

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,340
given that a recent IMF mission to Sierra
Leone

59
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,990
found that “the economic environment remains
challenging”

60
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,620
and hailed the new government’s efforts
to

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,790
“stabilize public debt and reduce it to
sustainable levels,

62
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,800
and prioritize public investment aimed at

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,260
reducing social and infrastructure gaps.”

64
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,050
It also turns out that an earlier 200 million
loan from China

65
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,060
for the same proposed new airport was cancelled

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,030
when the IMF and World Bank

67
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,540
did a debt sustainability analysis of Sierra
Leone,

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,030
and expressed “strong concerns” about
the deal.

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,680
And when a formal organization like the IMF

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,290
says it has “strong concerns”,

71
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,260
in normal language that means “run!”

72
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,950
The risk of taking a loan from China is,

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,150
let’s say,

74
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,770
different from taking an IMF loan.

75
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,300
If you can’t afford to pay back an IMF loan,

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,810
they may impose some conditions

77
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,560
before bailing you out with another loan.

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,980
Those conditions might include

79
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,450
making you adopt free market reforms,

80
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,490
clamp down on corruption, or strengthen rule-of-law
institutions.

81
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,050
But those are generally things that make a
country better,

82
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,770
and can attract future investment.

83
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,200
But if you owe China money and can’t afford
to pay up,

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,570
well, they take their pound of flesh.

85
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,710
Like Djibouti.

86
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,820
The African country of Djibouti.

87
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,210
China recently set up a military base there—

88
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,870
likely through political pressure.

89
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,090
China is also helping finance the main seaport
in Djibouti.

90
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,330
But if it can’t pay off its debt—

91
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,590
and that seems likely—

92
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,200
it may be forced to hand over its port to
China.

93
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,930
And this means China would control

94
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,490
the key access point in and out of Djibouti.

95
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,890
The big fear is that as China hands out loans

96
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,680
for huge infrastructure projects around the
world

97
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,900
as part of its Belt and Road Initiative,

98
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,360
it will use the loans that countries can’t
afford t

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,060
o pay back as a way to take resources or territory.

100
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,930
But by bucking that trend, Sierra Leone

101
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,280
has just become the first African country
to sidestep

102
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,130
one of China’s potential debt traps.

103
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,510
Some experts even say that Sierra Leone may
be

104
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,000
the first of a series of dominos that are
about to fall.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
A professor at a college in North Carolina
says this cancellation

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,270
is a sign that African countries are are starting
to

107
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,660
wise up when it comes to the threat of Chinese
loans.

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,230
Now after the Mamamah airport deal was axed,

109
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,750
China was quick to say “nothing to see here,
folks.”

110
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,740
“I don’t think this particular project
should be overblown

111
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,820
as an indication of problems between

112
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,060
the Chinese and Sierra Leone governments,”

113
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,810
said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu
Kang...

114
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,670
...and then between the lines expressed hope

115
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,370
other African countries wouldn’t develop

116
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,030
any hangups about taking Chinese money.

117
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,960
“When cooperating with African countries

118
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,000
that include Sierra Leone,

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,610
China has always adhered to the principles

120
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,410
of equality-based consultations and win-win
cooperation.”

121
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,860
Of course when you see headlines like this
about Sri Lanka...

122
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,200
or this about Zambia...

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,260
...you wonder if the Chinese regime has

124
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,680
a slightly different definition of win-win.

125
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
I think it means,

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,710
if you repay the loan,

127
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,710
China wins.

128
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,380
If you can’t repay,

129
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,150
China also wins.

130
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Win-win.

131
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,680
So what do you think about Sierra Leone

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,430
canceling its loan from China?

133
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,340
Leave your comments below.

134
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,889
And before we go, it’s time to answer a
question

135
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,630
from a fan of China Uncensored

136
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,560
who contributes to us through the crowdfunding
website Patreon.

137
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,660
David Michael White asks:

138
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,130
“Chris, do you have a favorite creature
from Chinese mythology?”

139
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,139
Let’s see, I’m going to say a qilin.

140
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,450
It’s kind of like if you combined a dragon
head,

141
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,580
the body of an ox,

142
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,980
but with the skin of snake.

143
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,850
Sometimes they have two horns.

144
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,210
Other times one horn,

145
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,250
which has led some people to call it a Chinese
unicorn.

146
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,370
Please. Qilin are way more majestic than unicorns.

147
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,960
Oh, and sometimes they’re on fire. But not
always.

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,110
They may look fearsome, but they only punish
the wicked.

149
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,040
In Buddhist thought they’re vegetarian

150
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,250
and fly because they don’t want to step
on

151
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,919
even a single blade of grass.

152
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,580
If a qilin showed up,

153
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,870
it meant that there was a wise and benevolent
ruler.

154
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,790
So I’m sure you won’t be surprised to
learn that

155
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,430
a lot of Chinese emperors said

156
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,000
they showed up during their reign.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,950
But my favorite story about qilins involved
the Chinese.

158
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,570
He was the Chinese admiral in the Ming Dynasty

159
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,930
who sailed all the way to Africa

160
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,600
in his fleet of Chinese treasure ships.

161
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,210
For a guy who was a eunuch,

162
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,169
that took a lot of...guts.

163
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,670
Anyway, he brought back two giraffes to the
emperor,

164
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,570
who by the way was very benevolent,

165
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,230
and everyone was like, oh yeah,

166
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,120
those are qilin, totally qilin.

167
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,250
If you’d like to learn more about

168
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,540
Chinese mythological creatures,

169
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,060
I’d recommend a book called

170
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,770
the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

171
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,340
You won’t find a crazier collection

172
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,010
of strange beasts and monsters.

173
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,560
Unless you read a book about the Politburo.

174
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,550
Thanks for your question, David.

175
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,040
And remember, you too can have

176
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,220
