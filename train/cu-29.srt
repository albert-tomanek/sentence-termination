1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,159
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,339
does Xi Jinping have the soccer balls

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,200
to fight corruption?

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,679
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,509
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,610
Xi Jinping.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,500
Paramount leader of the Chinese Communist
Party.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,240
Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,359
And huge soccer fan!

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,900
And it’s not just Xi Jinping.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Soccer,

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,039
or football as some people erroneously call
it,

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,119
is pretty popular in China.

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,970
But for the country that invented the sport

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,550
2,000 years ago...

16
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,950
...it’s surprisingly bad

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,670
at producing soccer champions.

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,880
But that’s going to change.

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,960
Because Xi Jinping is a baller.

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,730
And he wants to maker soccer huge in China.

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,000
He’s said his “Biggest hope for Chinese
soccer

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,050
is that its teams become among the world’s
best.”

23
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,400
Because in Communist China,

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,230
the Party tells you what sport to like.

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,880
Xi Jinping has a nationwide soccer plan.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,739
Because to get people to truly love soccer,

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,979
you need the kind of top down,

28
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,710
centralized approach you can only get

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,340
under authoritarian regimes.

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,149
In fact, the State Council even released

31
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:16,979
a Chinese soccer reform and development directive.

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,200
Because when you want to promote a sport,

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,600
the first question is,

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,229
what kind of guiding communist ideology

35
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,670
do you need?

36
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,180
Like the theories of Deng Xiaoping,

37
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,009
or the Three Represents.

38
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,729
Or the Five Defensive Kicks.

39
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,750
The directive also states that 50,000 schools

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,289
need to specialize in soccer by 2025,

41
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,579
up from 5,000.

42
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,310
It also wants to more than sextuple

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,150
the number of soccer fields—

44
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,030
from 11,000 now to 70,000

45
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,210
by the end of 2020.

46
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,460
Ping pong diplomacy was so Cold War.

47
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,679
And guess what?

48
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,679
When the head honcho

49
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,750
says soccer is very important,

50
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,340
government officials and influential business
leaders

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,659
at all levels decide

52
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,639
they, too, love soccer!

53
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,109
And they’ve been going to crazy lengths

54
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,310
to outdo each other,

55
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,690
proving how much more they love the game

56
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,810
than the other jerk,

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,610
in hopes of hitting a homerun with Xi Jinping.

58
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,390
What’s that Shelley?

59
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,010
Oh sorry, wrong sport.

60
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,360
Make a slam dunk with Xi Jinping.

61
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,750
Thanks, Shelley.

62
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,350
Take for instance this 167-acre campus

63
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,490
containing 50 soccer fields

64
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,050
and a squad of soccer coaches from Spain.

65
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,780
It’s part of the world’s largest soccer
academy,

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,190
owned by the Evergrande Group,

67
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,860
run by Chinese property tycoon Xu Jiayin.

68
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,890
At the top of China’s soccer pyramid

69
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,480
is the Chinese Football Association Super
League,

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,750
also known as the Chinese Super Friends

71
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,140
League of Justice.

72
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,390
Since Chinese scientists have not yet perfected

73
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,260
soccer playing robots,

74
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
the Chinese Super League

75
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,030
is coughing up huge sums of money

76
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,460
to recruit players from around the world

77
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,470
to come to China

78
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,850
to play and teach.

79
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,160
They’re even outspending the English Premier
League

80
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,110
by more than 100 million dollars.

81
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,900
That's quite a full-court press.

82
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,820
They recently turned this Argentinian soccer
star

83
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,480
into the highest paid player in the world.

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,630
He has a $40 million dollar contract

85
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,320
with Shanghai Shenhua,

86
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,620
a Chinese soccer club I’d never even heard
of

87
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,450
until this week.

88
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,180
And it’s not just him.

89
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,010
China has 4 of the top 10 highest paid soccer
players

90
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,660
in the world.

91
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660


92
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,380
The number two guy gets paid over 25 million.

93
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,940
Next at number 5, over 20 million,

94
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,520
number 9, 16.5.

95
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,710
That’s sad.

96
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,800
Only 16.5 million dollars?!

97
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,180
What can you even buy with that?

98
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,220
Anyway, why is Xi Jinping so focused

99
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,740
on reforming Chinese soccer?

100
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,830
Well let's recap.

101
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,400
Soccer in China involves: Big Government,

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,640
Big Business,

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,790
and lots and lots of money.

104
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,370
Would you be surprised if I told you

105
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,150
soccer in China is riddled with corruption?

106
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,040
Yes it turns out soccer in China

107
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,980
is somehow even more corrupt than FIFA.

108
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,400
And it's been corrupt for years.

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,180
So corrupt, that in 2008 state-run CCTV

110
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,860
refused to broadcast soccer matches

111
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,970
for more than three years.

112
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,440
They cited Chinese soccer’s

113
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,349
“lack of professional ethics.”

114
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:32,199
Which is a pretty rich coming from CCTV.

115
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,479
It’s like Lindsay Lohan calling Miley Cyrus

116
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,870
not very professional.

117
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,939
So in China,

118
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:41,310
match-fixing and bribes are rampant.

119
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,270
China’s top referee, Lu Jun,

120
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,639
used to be called the “golden whistle.”

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,610
In retrospect, it was a good name,

122
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,610
because he was making

123
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,919
so much money in bribes.

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,379
But he finally got put in the penalty box

125
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,650
when he was sentenced to five and half years
in jail

126
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,960
for taking 128,000 dollars in bribes

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,210
to swing the outcome of 7 games in 2003.

128
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,919
And remember that giant soccer academy

129
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,569
built by Evergrande Group?

130
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:11,510
Well, it also owns one of the major soccer
clubs

131
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,550
in the Chinese Super League.

132
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,770
And one of its coaches was caught paying

133
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,360
almost 300,000 dollars to a rival coach

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,690
to ensure his team won.

135
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,949
Maybe it’s more like the League of Shadows.

136
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,449
Since gambling is mostly illegal in China,

137
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,460
a huge 600 billion dollar underground gambling
syndicate

138
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,010
sprung up to handle illegal sports betting.

139
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,660
By comparison, all of Macau,

140
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,520
the only place in China where gambling is
legal,

141
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,350
brought in only about 28 billion dollars in
2016.

142
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,090
But after Xi Jinping came to power in 2012,

143
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,770
he started applying his anti-corruption campaign

144
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,260
to soccer.

145
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,680
CCTV even started broadcasting the game again.

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,099
Maybe it was just so Xi Jinping

147
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:04,479
could have his photo op with David Beckham.

148
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,210
Or maybe it's because companies

149
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,870
were using soccer to launder money.

150
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,710
You see, there's one big issue

151
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,729
that Chinese authorities

152
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,150
have been struggling to control.

153
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,379
And that's the massive amounts of money

154
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,949
people are trying to move out of China.

155
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,060
It's almost like they don't think it's safe
there.

156
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,979
Coincidentally, Chinese companies

157
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,099
have been spending a lot of money

158
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,809
to buy foreign soccer teams.

159
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:29,809
According to Quartz,

160
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:32,779
Chinese buyers have invested over two billion
dollars

161
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:37,620
in 14 European soccer teams since 2015.

162
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,430
And not just bargain basement teams.

163
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,009
Big names like AC Milan.

164
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,930
But some of these deals might just be a way

165
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,979
for investors to get their money out of China.

166
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,499
In fact, China’s top Foreign Exchange regulator

167
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,180
“accused Chinese firms of moving assets
overseas

168
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,440
under the cover of deals

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,819
that don’t make good business sense.

170
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,819
In particular...

171
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,190
the acquisitions of foreign soccer teams.”

172
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,219
What a curveball.

173
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,860
So with all the spending—

174
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,650
and massive, massive corruption—

175
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,199
you’d at least think China would be

176
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,349
an up-and-coming soccer world power.

177
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:15,349
But according to the current

178
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,650
FIFA/Coca Cola World ranking,

179
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,860
China comes in at 86th,

180
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,030
which is below Montenegro.

181
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,090
I don’t even know where that is,

182
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,270
but I looked it up,

183
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,719
and apparently that entire country

184
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,990
has a smaller population than most

185
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,569
third-tier Chinese cities.

186
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,599
But it still has a better national soccer
team.

187
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,089
And without some kind of Hail Mary,

188
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,060
China's national team is less and less likely

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,650
to qualify for next year's World Cup.

190
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,240
It looks like the China soccer dream

191
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,559
still has a long way to go

192
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:51,380
before it can knock one out of the park.

193
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,189
So what do you think of Xi Jinping’s plan

194
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,889
to turn the world’s most corrupt soccer
league

195
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,039
into champions?

196
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,470
Now, that’s a movie idea if I ever heard
one.

Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored,

199
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,569
once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

200
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,880
see you next time.
