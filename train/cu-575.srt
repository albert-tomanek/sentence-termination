00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,730
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,390
Australia bans Huawei and ZTE from building
5G networks.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,429
Want to strike a deal with China?

4
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,530
Don’t be stupid.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,600
And finally, US-Taiwan relations are over
the moon!

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,760
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,360
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,189
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

9
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:26,189
On Thursday,

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,550
the Australian government put a ban on foreign
companies

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,900
building the next generation of wireless networks:
5G.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,900
Why the ban?

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,600
They don’t want companies “likely to be

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,699
subject to extrajudicial directions

15
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:41,760
from a foreign government that conflict with
Australian law”

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,010
to have control over Australia’s wireless
networks.

17
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,940
Now, in that announcement,

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,010
Australia didn’t mention which foreign government

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,360
they were concerned about.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,820
I guess that’s a mystery.

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,570
Incidentally, though, the ban will stop two
giant Chinese companies—

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,219
Huawei and ZTE—

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,460
that had expressed interest in installing
Australia’s 5G network.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,750
This is a huge blow to Huawei especially,

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,610
since they had made a huge push in Australia

26
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,759
after getting shut out of the US.

27
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,810
Speaking of mysteries...

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,200
We’ve just found out that my friend Megha
Rajagopalan,

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,070
who I was on a panel with at the Oslo Freedom
Forum

30
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,610
a couple months ago,

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,509
has been denied a renewal of her journalism
visa.

32
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,390
That effectively means she’s being kicked
out of China.

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,670
But Chinese authorities didn’t tell her
why.

34
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,810
Hmmm... another mystery!

35
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,340
This is going to be a tough case to crack.

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,110
She had been a journalist in Beijing for six
years.

37
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,360
And she was good, too.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,190
I can’t figure out what changed!

39
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,200
Why, earlier this year, she even won an award

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,060
for this piece she wrote on the Communist
Party’s

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,920
crackdown on minorities in Xinjiang.

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,689
Well, I don’t know why they kicked her out.

43
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:52,842
If any of you can figure out it out,

44
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,830
please let me know.

45
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,110
And if you think Chinese authorities

46
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,770
are getting good at fooling anyone, well,

47
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,060
they’re also trying their hand at sarcasm.

48
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,039
State-run China Global Television Network
created a, haha,

49
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,690
hilarious video called “Thanks Mr Trump,
you are GREAT!”

50
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,160
But get this, they’re not actually saying
he’s great.

51
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
They mean that sarcastically.

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,520
I would know.

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,260
I’m a sarcasm expert.

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,890
Their video is about how Trump’s trade war
has actually helped China.

55
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,310
Which they’re not being sarcastic about.

56
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,830
“Thank you for re-instilling in the Chinese
a sense of HUMILITY.

57
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,660
How can there be enough gratitude for highlighting

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,530
the foibles of overconfidence and self-congratulation,

59
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,980
never a virtue except in your case.”

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,190
You see, by taking that swipe at Trump,

61
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,410
they’ll distract viewers from remembering
how

62
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,520
Chinese authorities violated WTO rules

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,910
and stole trillions of dollars worth of US
intellectual property.

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,150
And then there’s this hilarious quip.

65
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,230
“On behalf of doctors, thank you for pointing
out the need to

66
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,120
wean off American goods like bourbon and bacon.”

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
Because the danger to Chinese people’s health

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,310
is not China’s rampant pollution,

69
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,560
or constant food scandals.

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,690
or bad vaccines.

71
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,870
No, no!

72
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,420
It’s bacon and alcohol from America that
are the danger.

73
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,840
The South China Morning Post describes CGTN

74
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,630
as “Part of a growing arm of state media
designed

75
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,360
to ‘tell China stories’ as it make a global
push to improve its soft power.”

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,650
In other words, it’s part of China’s information

77
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,730
or propaganda warfare against the West.

78
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,620
They’re banking on some Americans disliking
Trump so much,

79
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,450
that they’ll actually side with the Chinese
Communist Party.

80
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,260
But CGTN’s attempt at sarcasm is pretty
hard to watch.

81
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,700
Seriously, guys.

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,650
Leave sarcasm to the professionals.

83
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,250
Strangely, CGTN pulled this video from youtube

84
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,020
only a day after they put it up.

85
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,310
Maybe the fact that they released this video

86
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,280
just as US and Chinese officials

87
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,260
are meeting about the trade war

88
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,900
was seen as a little too sensitive.

89
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,350
Oops.

90
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,820
Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad

91
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,549
met with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang this week.

92
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,640
It was Mahathir’s first trip to China

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,019
since taking office earlier this year.

94
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,310
And there were a few pieces of Chinese etiquette

95
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,720
that Mahathir clearly didn’t know.

96
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,660
For instance, when dealing with Chinese officials,
typically,

97
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,800
they consider it very impolite to repeatedly

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,090
SLAM YOUR PREDECESSOR

99
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,240
FOR THEIR STUPIDITY IN DEALING WITH CHINA.

100
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,010
He was concerned about several major construction
projects

101
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,240
with Chinese companies,

102
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,860
although he was super vague about

103
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,350
whether they were cancelled or just deferred.

104
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,340
Mahathir is worried about these China deals
in Malaysia,

105
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,740
since the deals follow a pattern the Chinese
regime

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,320
has established with other countries:

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,940
Get them deeply into debt and then squeeze.

108
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,180
In other words, when his predecessor made
those deals,

109
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,030
well he was being stupid.

110
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,450
The Chinese Communist Party has been ramping
up

111
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,520
the pressure on Taiwan

112
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,610
and anyone who’s ever been nice to Taiwan

113
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,300
or even acknowledged its existence.

114
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,300
And now it seems that yet another country

115
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,140
has caved to the pressure—

116
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,280
El Salvador.

117
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,550
This is El Salvador,

118
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,650
which of course is Spanish for “the Salvador.”

119
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,850
It used to diplomatically recognize the Republic
of China,

120
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,750
a.k.a. the government of Taiwan,

121
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,300
as the one true government of China.

122
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,630
Not anymore.

123
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,610
That means, in the entire world,

124
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,910
there are only 17 countries left

125
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,560
that recognize the sovereignty of the Republic
of China.

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,400
And some of them are barely even real countries.

127
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,100
Like...

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,360
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

129
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,890
What’s that, Shelley?

130
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,490
Ok, apparently it’s really nice there.

131
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,520
But most of the 17 countries that are still
tight with Taiwan

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,570
are small island nations that,

133
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,570
let’s be honest,

134
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,300
don’t have much power in the world.

135
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,700
It’s like in high school gym class when
they’re picking teams,

136
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,710
only instead of you being the kid no one wants
on their team,

137
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,250
there are already two teams, and everyone’s
leaving

138
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,410
the small one that’s nice for the big one

139
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,690
that buys you fancy jerseys.

140
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,190
And infrastructure.

141
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,060
Other Latin American countries have also left
Taiwan for China.

142
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,540
Panama broke ties with Taiwan in 2017.

143
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,620
The Dominican Republic did it just this May.

144
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,740
And in exchange for their new loyalties,

145
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,160
the Chinese Communist Party will give these
countries big gifts...

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,930
that come with horrible debt traps

147
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,790
that future leaders will call stupid.

148
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,200
Meanwhile, in China, some genius on social
media asked

149
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,550
what law exactly says Taiwan can’t be called
a country.

150
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,670
To which the authorities said, obviously no
law says that,

151
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,480
we make up the laws as we go.

152
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,800
Here, we’ll demonstrate...by arresting you.

153
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,050
Police said he had “profaned the people’s
feelings”.

154
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,320
Hey, which law says you can’t profane the
people’s feelings?

155
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,420
Exactly.

156
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,570
You know, it’s a good thing China requires
people

157
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,500
to use their real name on social media.

158
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,030
They say the real name law is to help stop
terrorists.

159
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,990
Which I guess includes 18 year old kids

160
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,139
who ask too many questions.

161
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,980
However, the Trump administration seemingly

162
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,900
has taken on the mantle of using Taiwan to
troll China.

163
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,250
While the United States does recognize mainland
China

164
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,820
as the one true China,

165
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,670
the Trump administration has also been friendly
to Taiwan.

166
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:37,300
Like by giving the President of Taiwan a special
tour of NASA.

167
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,980
This was a first for a President of Taiwan.

168
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,310
Tsai Ing-wen was on her way back to Taiwan

169
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,750
from a recent trip she made to Paraguay and
Belize.

170
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,940
She apparently felt she needed to shore up
ties

171
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,290
with her allies in Latin America.

172
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,390
Now, the Chinese Communist Party was not happy

173
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,130
that Tsai even was making a stopover in the
US,

174
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,150
let alone getting a tour of NASA.

175
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,080
The reason this was such a troll,

176
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,840
though, is because the US would never allow

177
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,790
a scientist from mainland China to visit NASA.

178
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,030
Seriously.

179
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,030
In 2011,

180
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,389
Congress banned NASA from working with China

181
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,320
because of the risk of espionage.

182
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,949
“Two years later, a group of Chinese scientists
was excluded

183
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:21,260
from attending a conference on NASA’s

184
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,060
Kepler space telescope programme.”

185
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,510
Let’s just say, when Xi Jinping sees this
footage...

186
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,570
he won’t exactly be over the moon.

187
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,860
And before you go, did you know China Uncensored

188
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,700
is funded almost entirely by viewers like
you?

189
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,700
That’s why every episode,

190
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,290
I say thank you to what I call

191
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,680
the China Uncensored 50-Cent Army—

192
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,890
the folks who contribute to the show

193
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,230
on the crowdfunding website Patreon—

194
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,640
by answering their questions!

195
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,060
Bob buffalo asks,

196
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,240
“Is there a possibility for Hong Kong to
get its independence

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,460
like Singapore in a probable future?

198
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,860
Well, that would basically only happen in
one of those

199
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,440
bizarre, “what if” comic book storylines.

200
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,870
I mean, what if Wolverine was Lord of the
Vampires?

201
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,880
In 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia

202
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,200
voted unanimously to expel Singapore.

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,140
A few hours later, the Parliament of Singapore
passed

204
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,200
the Republic of Singapore Independence Act.

205
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,660
And Singapore became an independent and sovereign
republic.

206
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,430
But there is no way ever that China’s National
People’s Congress

207
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,130
will ever say, “Hong Kong, we don’t want
you.”

208
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,250
In fact, the Communist Party was ready to
invade Hong Kong in 1960

209
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,190
if the British ever tried to implement democracy
in Hong Kong.

210
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,930
So no matter how much the people of Hong Kong
want independence,

211
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,160
or even just a tiny bit more democracy,

212
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,440
they’ll never get it from the Chinese Communist
Party.

213
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,920
Thanks for you question, Bob.

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
