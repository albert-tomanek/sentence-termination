00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,949
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,720
how the Chinese Communist Party is infiltrating
Greece.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,580
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:13,160
I’m Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,219
What do you when you’re burdened by debt

6
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,740
and on the verge of bankruptcy?

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,820
You move back into your parents’ basement.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,300
Or if you’re a country, you ask China for
help.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,789
And that’s exactly what Greece is doing.

10
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,830
But when you’re feeling desperate,

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,170
do you really make the wisest choices?

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,640
Shelley Zhang reports from Athens.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,340
Thanks, Chris.

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,350
Greece.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,670
The cradle of Western civilization.

16
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,070
Home of gorgeous islands,

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,340
big fat weddings,

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,520
and a pantheon of gods

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,280
straight out of a daytime soap opera.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,890
And also the worst government debt crisis

21
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,790
in any developed country.

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,660
One that led to 13 rounds of spending cuts,

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,050
a new government,

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,940
and 30,000 euros of debt for every Greek citizen.

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,790
Greece needed a hero.

26
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,980
And an unlikely one emerged to save the day...

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,110
sort of:

28
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,890
the Chinese Communist Party.

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,890
For decades,

30
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,890
the Party has wanted to get

31
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,909
a political foothold in Europe.

32
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,240
But it’s been difficult because of

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,929
the European Union’s powerful influence.

34
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:14,450
But in late 2009,

35
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,520
Greek entered an era best described as

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,340
“Holy Zeus, we have no more money.”

37
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,070
It became clear the Greece might not be able
to pay back

38
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,420
those billions of dollars it had borrowed
from the rest of the EU.

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,999
“So it was basically a situation where,

40
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,000
after the Greek financial crisis,

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
nobody wanted to swipe right on Greece anymore.”

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,369
“Nobody wanted to lend money

43
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,149
to the Greek government anymore.”

44
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,590
John Psaropolous is an independent journalist

45
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,990
who has covered Greece for two decades.

46
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,150
He says that as the EU backed off from Greece,

47
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,229
China started to move in.

48
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:51,759
“Think of it as a friendship within the
generation of people

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,229
who go back at least 3,000 years.”

50
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,490
Mmmm. Yes. Let’s be friends,

51
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,969
because “We have so much in common, babe!”

52
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,689
Like we haven’t heard that one before,

53
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,810
am I right, ladies?

54
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,240
The CCP’s courtship started in about 2009.

55
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,690
But it got serious in 2015,

56
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,580
after the Greeks elected Alexis Tsipras as
Prime Minister.

57
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,320
At first the CCP was concerned,

58
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,820
because Tsipras’s party was radical leftist.

59
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,390
They were afraid Greece might not be

60
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,890
open to Chinese investment anymore.

61
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,530
And the CCP knows better than anyone:

62
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,690
never trust a communist.

63
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,820
But it turned out there was mutual affection.

64
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,060
Tsipras was very interested in Chinese investment.

65
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,920
Hey, Just because we’re both communist

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,910
doesn’t mean we can’t make a little profit,
right?

67
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,390
Prime Minister Tsipras immediately bent over
backwards

68
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,390
to be friends with China.

69
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,980
Just 24 days after taking office,

70
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,750
Tsipras welcomed a Chinese warship to the
Greek port of Piraeus.

71
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,680
He told Chinese officials that he wants Greece

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,560
to “serve as China’s gateway into Europe.”

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,870
Tsipras even flew to China twice.

74
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,200
Once in 2016,
and then again in 2017.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,630
I know it looks like the same trip.

76
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,700
But Tsipras only owns one nice outfit, ok?

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,410
Greece is short on cash.

78
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,150
Behind me is Piraeus Port,

79
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,150
just outside Athens.

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,950
It’s the largest port in Greece,

81
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,130
and one of the largest in the Mediterranean.

82
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,090
In 2016, the Greek government allowed

83
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,370
Chinese state-owned shipping giant COSCO

84
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,970
o buy a 51% stake here

85
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,770
for 330 million dollars.

86
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,010
Within 5 years, they will own 67%.

87
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,380
COSCO had already been renting part of the
port since 2008.

88
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,860
Now, they effectively own it.

89
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,820
The Chinese government is building Piraeus
into a key gateway

90
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,710
to move Chinese products into the rest of
Europe.

91
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,290
They call it a “dragon head”

92
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,600
for the One Belt, One Road Initiative,

93
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,780
the series of massive infrastructure projects

94
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,950
that aims to export Chinese goods around the
world.

95
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,850
I visited the dockworkers union,

96
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,350
and sat down with Giorgos Gogos.

97
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,350
“They took the management of a very profitable
organization

98
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,350
in a very strategic place in Mediterranean
Sea

99
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,580
for a very low price.”

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,750
Yes, Chinese people know a good deal when
they see one.

101
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,540
But Mr. Gogos is concerned that letting

102
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,260
a Chinese company take over the Greek port

103
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,519
was maybe not such a great idea.

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,650
Sure, things are a lot more efficient,

105
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,849
from COSCO’s perspective.

106
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,879
They’ve cut salaries dramatically,

107
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,350
and moved a lot of full-time workers

108
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,919
to being on-call.

109
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,430
But the work is more demanding,

110
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,090
with less job security.

111
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,439
“I think it’s a big mistake from European
Union

112
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,560
and the Americans that are leaving space

113
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,319
for Chinese companies to enter.

114
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,099
But we are too small to deal with these things.

115
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,229
Even Captain Fu Cheng Qiu—

116
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,320
the Chinese guy who runs the port—

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,620
admitted that selling Piraeus Port to COSCO

118
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,980
maybe wasn’t such a smart move on Greece’s
part.

119
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,800
“He said that in China,

120
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,349
we wouldn’t privatize such a port,

121
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,360
because it’s a big asset.

122
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,860
But Chinese investment doesn’t stop at the
port.

123
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,290
“COSCO has opened the door.

124
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,250
It’s a state owned company,

125
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,250
it has deep pockets,

126
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,000
it has a close relationship with the government.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,319
That signals to other Chinese companies

128
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,009
that if their investment does well,

129
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,190
Greece is ok to invest in.”

130
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,669
In December last year,

131
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,699
China bought a 24% stake

132
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,129
in Greece’s public power grid operator.

133
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:30,949
While Prime Minister Tsipras was in Beijing
in May 2017,

134
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,979
he signed an agreement with a Chinese firm

135
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,779
that will invest half a billion dollars over
seven years

136
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,340
to build a fiber optic telecommunications
network in Greece.

137
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340
And in September,

138
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
Greece honored China

139
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,669
at the Thessaloniki International Fair.

140
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,999
6,000 square feet of pavilion space

141
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,279
was dedicated to Chinese companies.

142
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,659
From an economic standpoint,

143
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,919
the relationship between Greece and China

144
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:55,979
over the last few years

145
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,380
has been mostly positive.

146
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,309
Who doesn’t love cheap handbags...

147
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,849
made in China?

148
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,800
And millenia of Greek history...

149
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,689
made in China?

150
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,069
Even Mr. Gogos’s union,

151
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,430
which has had issues with COSCO in the past,

152
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,030
is willing to work with the Chinese,

153
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,480
as long as they are willing to adapt.

154
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,000
“I think now if they want to have a better
face in Greek society

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,500
they have to respect certain things,

156
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,840
and among these things are labor relations,

157
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,150
environmental issues,

158
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,009
and national sovereignty of the country.”

159
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,930
So could this become a friendship

160
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,620
that’s mutually respectful and beneficial?

161
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,969
Well, like every friends with benefits relationship,

162
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:43,180
it eventually gets complicated.

163
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,540
“Well, the political ramifications

164
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,020
of China’s investments in Europe

165
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,939
remain to be seen.

166
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:53,499
At the moment it’s just business.

167
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,710
But business is never just business, forever,

168
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,949
particular when it is state-condoned.”

169
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,740
There’s growing concern in Europe

170
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,599
over Greece’s relationship with China.

171
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,809
It’s kind of like watching your best friend

172
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:07,219
start dating this guy.

173
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,689
Let’s just say,

174
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:11,530
the CCP might not be the best influence.

175
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,339
For example, in July 2016,

176
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,330
Greece was one of only two EU countries

177
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,680
that sided with the CCP

178
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,460
after a controversial South China Sea court
ruling.

179
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,229
And in June 2017,

180
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,180
Greece stopped the EU from condemning

181
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,839
the CCP’s human rights abuses,

182
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,069
and then opposed the EU doing tougher screenings

183
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,849
of Chinese investments in Europe.

184
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:37,199
“There is a European concern now about

185
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,069
what the pattern of Chinese investment is
going to be,

186
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,020
how much power Chinese investment will have
taken

187
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,289
as a whole, as a sum.

188
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,419
Ironically, it was the EU

189
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,889
that had forced Greece to privatize—

190
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,770
to sell off some of their state-owned assets

191
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,740
as part of their debt repayment.

192
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,289
But now that the buyer is the CCP,

193
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,360
the EU is having seller’s remorse.

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,520
China isn’t just investing in Greece,

195
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,979
but in many Eastern European countries as
well.

196
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,990
And that’s causing enough alarm for the
EU

197
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,979
to take a closer look at these deals.

198
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,500
Meanwhile Greece is still a little upset at
the EU, s

199
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,759
o they’re not exactly taking the EU’s
warnings seriously.

200
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,050
“I don’t think the Greeks are afraid of

201
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,960
too much Chinese influence at the moment...

202
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,259
They’re happy to have a country,

203
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,909
a major country,

204
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,960
an up-and-coming superpower in the world

205
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,760
that is interested in them

206
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:37,360
and sees Greece as a promising place.”

207
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,800
“Yeah. It’s always nice to be liked.”

208
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,200
“It’s always nice to be liked,

209
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,700
particularly when your old friends have dumped
you

210
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,280
or criticized you severely.

211
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,460
And the Chinese have seen that opportunity.

212
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,340
They’ve seen the changing psychology in
Greece

213
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,060
and that isn’t lost on them.”

214
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,140
Look, I understand;

215
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,860
it’s been a tough few years.

216
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,300
You’ve lost a lot of jobs.

217
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,860
You’re going through a big recession.

218
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,620
You’ve gained a few million extra pounds...
of debt.

219
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,160
And here comes this exciting new guy.

220
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,790
He definitely wants a strategic investment
partner

221
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,120
with benefits kind of relationship.

222
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,300
And you have a lot in common.

223
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,720
Like, you’re both ancient civilizations.

224
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,060
And everything’s going fine.

225
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,370
He doesn’t care about your bad reputation.

226
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,259
He’s showering you with investments.

227
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,820
And ok, your friends are trying to warn you

228
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
about this guy,

229
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,320
but they don’t know him like you do.

230
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,120
And no, he didn’t ask you to stop them

231
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,520
from pointing out his human rights problems.

232
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,240
That’s just what you do when you’re in
a relationship, right?

233
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,330
Look, I’m not telling you to break up with
him.

234
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,740
That’s your business.

235
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,660
I’m just saying, you’re like 3,000 years
old.

236
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,740
It’s time to pull yourself together.

237
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,839
You gotta figure out if this is

238
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,600
the kind of relationship you really want.

239
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,360
Just think about it, ok?

240
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,180
Or, not.

241
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,620
Thanks, Shelley for taking time out of your
vacation

242
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,160
to do this story.

243
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,800
Looks like you had a really marbleous time.

244
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,500
Haha, I just crack myself up.

245
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,020
So what do you think of Greece’s relationship
with China?

246
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,180
Friends with benefits?

247
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,660
Or something more?

248
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,250
Let me know in the comments below.

249
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,410

254
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,840
I mean, we could ask COSCO to fund this.

255
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,840
But then we've have to give them 51% of Chris.

256
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,020
So go to patreon.com/chinauncensored and contribute a dollar or more per episode
