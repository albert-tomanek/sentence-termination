1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,260
when terrorist become propaganda.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,060
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,700
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,080
If you’ve been watching this show,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,829
you’ve heard about Xinjiang in Western China.

7
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,900
It’s home to the Uighur ethnic minority.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,980
Where more than a million people—

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,720
and by some estimates 3 million people—

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,679
have been put into reeducation camps.

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,839
And forced to violate their religion.

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,140
And their children put into orphanages.

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
So to learn more,

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,830
I went down to Washington DC to speak with
Nury Turkel.

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,280
He’s a Uighur lawyer and human rights activist.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,280
Thank you very much for joining us today.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,370
Thank you so much for having us.

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,160
So what is life like for Uighurs in Xinjiang?

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,420
It must be pretty safe.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,250
I hear there's lots of Chinese police around.

21
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,230
It is very safe, probably the safest place
in entire China,

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,300
maybe entire world.

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,970
The Chinese government is pouring in

24
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,580
with the mindset of making Uighurs

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,750
feel safe to build lots of security apparatus.

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,940
The streets are full of cameras.

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,290
The Chinese government wants to make sure

28
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,530
that your phone is not hacked,

29
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,581
so they run it through data scan and they-

30
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:15,840
And they force you to do that, right?

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,780
Yeah, and they wanted to take your DNA samples

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,280
to make sure that you don't have any terminal
illness.

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,420
Yeah, what is up with that DNA sampling?

34
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,950
There are different theories.

35
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,920
There are different ways of explaining the
Chinese motive.

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:42,100
One is they wanted to establish a database
for this new system

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,190
that they're building up to monitor its citizens,

38
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,620
and the second possible reason is that they
wanted to engage in

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,140
some bioengineering in the future.

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,170
Like create a super Uighur?

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,299
Super Uighur, maybe a European-looking,

42
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,000
ethnically Chinese-looking Uighur who appreciates

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,779
this universally-accepted Chinese culture,

44
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:14,299
speak Chinese, talk like a Chinese, act like
a Chinese,

45
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:15,810
think like a Chinese.

46
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,810
Wait.

47
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,810
Seriously?

48
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,840
Is that something they can do with DNA?

49
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,680
I think that scientifically that's possible.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,409
That's absurd.

51
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,380
And Chinese are very capable when it comes
to

52
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,310
that kind of technological advantages.

53
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,170
Well, when you don't have a state that's answerable
to the people,

54
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,530
you can get a lot of science done.

55
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,810
The Chinese government have invested

56
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,689
a substantial of money in the recent development,

57
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:46,510
in addition to taking advantage of American
and European inventions

58
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,189
by forcing companies doing business to share
business intelligence

59
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:57,169
and the technological inventions.

60
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:02,510
The Chinese government has been using the
technological advantages a

61
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:11,140
nd resources that they have to increase their
state security apparatus,

62
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,810
eventually turning the country into a Orwellian
society on steroids.

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,129
And so a lot of this is technology that's
coming from the West.

64
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,290
Technology is supposed to be helping to make
our lives better,

65
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,189
but to the Chinese government's benefit it's
making

66
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:31,760
the Chinese government much more secure,

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,939
particularly the Chinese Communist Party and
Xi Jinping's China.

68
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,699
So would you call Xinjiang a surveillance
state?

69
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,699
It is a-

70
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,699
Trick question.

71
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:47,080
It's an autonomous region, not a state.

72
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,329
It's surveillance state in the way that the
Chinese

73
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,260
want to make sure that people are happy, smiling,
chanting,

74
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,370
and denouncing their ethnic identity, religious
belief,

75
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,669
and waking up to worship the Xi Jinping instead
of their God.

76
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:07,719
So by doing that, they wanted to surveil people's,

77
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,469
monitor people's private lives,

78
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:14,209
in addition to installing barcodes on the
doors-

79
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,910
Whoa.

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,129
And randomly checking your phones,

81
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,700
making you go through iris scans.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
In some instances,

83
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,940
the Chinese government is so concerned that
some Uighurs

84
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,659
may have a bad dream at night so they send
the Chinese cadres

85
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:36,620
to sleep in Uighur bedrooms to make sure that
they will not wake up

86
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,810
in the middle of the night afraid of the Xi
Jinping's regime.

87
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,310
Oh, I can't imagine that being abused in any
way.

88
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,400
So I want to ask about the political reeducation
camps in Xinjiang.

89
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,300
So at first, the Community Party denied that
they existed.

90
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,330
Now they're saying that local governments
can educate and transform

91
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,550
extremists in these vocational training centers.

92
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,300
That sounds very lovely.

93
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,800
Two thoughts.

94
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,050
One, the entire world, I would call civilized
world,

95
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,030
believe that the Chinese government will come
up at the UN

96
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,150
and apologize to the Uighur people

97
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,280
and bring justice to those officials

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,310
who committed this heinous crime.

99
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,800
I think the civilized world is very disappointed

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,590
that they haven't seen such a decency,

101
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,370
forgetting that authoritarian dictatorship,

102
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,870
the ones that in Beijing, are known for conflating,

103
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,939
denying, and confusing.

104
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,620
So people should not be surprised that

105
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,010
the Chinese government initially denied.

106
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,629
So what they're doing now is to say that in
order

107
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,479
to achieve their conversion programs,

108
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
basically converting the Uighurs from who
they are

109
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,669
to something that they're not and claiming
that they

110
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,909
are providing this vocational training programs,

111
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,400
as if that those Uighurs will be trained

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,229
and sent to coastal cities to work in foreign
assembly lines.

113
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,090
Maybe the Uighurs will be making your iPhones

114
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,599
after finishing these reeducation camps.

115
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,849
So what is life like in a reeducation camp?

116
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,949
The life in the reeducation camps is exactly
the way

117
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:30,750
how the Chinese design it and want it to be.

118
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,419
You spend half of your day with flag-raising
ceremony

119
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:42,099
singing Chinese Communist Party songs

120
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,010
and phrasing Xi Jinping's ruling

121
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:51,020
in a way that you worship spiritually,

122
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,300
and then you have very basic meal,

123
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,009
and then in the afternoon you watch anti-separatist
movies,

124
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:01,550
videos,

125
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,879
go through indoctrination programs.

126
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:13,449
So that's a typical daily routine based on
personal accounts

127
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,900
by those who were detained,

128
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,150
but the Chinese government calls it reeducation.

129
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,249
Reeducation means you get up in the morning,

130
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:28,860
you have nothing but to please your jailers,

131
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,720
the guys with the black uniform, machine guns,

132
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,419
and helmet walking around,

133
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:42,319
as you have seen on the pictures in barbwire
compounds.

134
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,370
And then the Chinese want you to despite your
age,

135
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,499
despite the environment that you grow up,

136
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:54,580
despite what you appreciate in life, you gradually

137
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,080
or by force accept the Chinese way of life.

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,360
The one problem that both government and some
people in China

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,360
have a problem with or have a difficulty to
grip with is

140
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,080
as if their preference in life culturally,

141
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,050
linguistically is something universal as such
the Uighurs

142
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,080
should accept and become one of them.

143
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:33,350
So us-against-them mentality has been in practice
in Chinese society,

144
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,100
quietly encouraged by the Chinese government-controlled
state media.

145
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,230
Well, I mean, that's sort of how

146
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,940
the Communist Party has ruled all of China,

147
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,030
always making certain groups the enemy class

148
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,810
that you do have to struggle against.

149
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,980
So why is the Communist Party targeting Uighurs?

150
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,831
There are three possible reasons for the Chinese
government

151
00:08:54,831 --> 00:09:05,500
to implement this Nazi Germany-like policies.

152
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,620
Some people think that we got to be careful
with the terminology,

153
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,820
but if you look at the legal definition of
cultural genocide,

154
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,120
what the Chinese government has been undertaking
purposefully,

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,750
systematically fits into the definition.

156
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,120
Reasonable people may disagree,

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,460
but there's no other way of seeing what they

158
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:36,620
have been doing as crimes against humanity
and cultural genocide.

159
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,270
Why are they doing it?

160
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,260
One, this is all about China's global ambition.

161
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,910
Xi Jinping announced this international project

162
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,030
called One Belt, One Road Initiative

163
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,810
that expands to more than 70 countries.

164
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,100
Of those 70 countries,

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,250
seven of them have borders with Uighurs'

166
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,930
ancestral homeland, East Turkestan.

167
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,010
So when you look at the map from the China
proper

168
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,520
all the way to Central Asia,

169
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,210
you got to go through this big landmass,

170
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,790
which is four times the size of California.

171
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,380
Of course, this is the unstated goal.

172
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,080
The Chinese never admit this is part of their
objectives,

173
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,970
but to some Chinese strategists or party leaders

174
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:31,110
or people who advises Xi Jinping,

175
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,960
the area must be fully controlled.

176
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,370
Otherwise, China's global ambition will be
hampered, number one.

177
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,510
Number two, this has a lot to do with

178
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,650
Xi Jinping's ability to keep China together.

179
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,880
So there's a thing called the domino effect.

180
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,430
The Chinese leader believed that if East Turkestan,

181
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,860
the Uighurs' homeland, gets out of hand,

182
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,230
it will affect negatively to other China-related
areas, s

183
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,080
uch as Tibet, Taiwan, Hong Kong.

184
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,670
So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that as
long as that region,

185
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,750
that people stays as they are,

186
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,630
will eventually will pose political threat.

187
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,950
Number three, the third reason

188
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,880
that some people are uncomfortable talking

189
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,610
has a lot to do with racism.

190
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,400
In Chinese society,

191
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,890
as well as the Chinese government's

192
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,370
way of conducting business

193
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,760
or implementing policies,

194
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,440
often time tell us that they have a lot of

195
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,210
racially-motivated policies being implemented.

196
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,010
This started with banning the Uighur language,

197
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,550
restricting female individuals,

198
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,290
children under age of 12,

199
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,230
students from entering mosque.

200
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,640
The human rights organizations,

201
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,750
various governments were complaining about
that,

202
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,410
and now the Chinese government under Xi Jinping's
leadership

203
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:18,800
believe that Uighurs' ethnic background is
a kind of tumor

204
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,820
and religious belief is mental disease.

205
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,230
So for fair-minded people,

206
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,700
I don't think this requires any explanation.

207
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,630
It's pretty evident.

208
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,280
If you flip through the history books,

209
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,570
you see a very similar mindset calling somebody's
ethnicity,

210
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,830
religion as something that need to be eradicated.

211
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,130
So it is inconceivable in the 21st century
in 2018,

212
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,990
we're having this conversation about China
that is systematically,

213
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,490
purposefully criminalizing the entire nation

214
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,520
because of their ethnicity and because of
their religious belief.

215
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,110
I might add the Uighurs have been practicing
Islam

216
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,260
as early as 12, 13th century,

217
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,510
so whoever is advising Xi Jinping

218
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,860
or it's unknown if it is his idea,

219
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,540
this policy will eventually fail.

220
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,640
It's not going to work.

221
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,620
It may work for a small group of people,

222
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,250
it may create a long-lasting emotional psychological
damages

223
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,800
to the Uighurs both inside and outside of
China,

224
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,140
but strategically this is not going to work.

225
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,540
This will create more resentment and strong
anti-colonial sentiment

226
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,440
among the Uighur people wherever you can find
them.

227
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,680
So after 9/11,

228
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,750
the Communist Party stopped calling Uighurs
separatists

229
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,830
and started using the term "terrorist.”

230
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,490
Why?

231
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,620
The Chinese government thought after 9/11
that the world

232
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,540
will be turned against Islam and there will
be a war

233
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,200
because this country was attacked.

234
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,990
To the Chinese government, it sounds like,

235
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,510
it seems like their long-awaited opportunity
just arriving,

236
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:29,700
because in the past the Chinese government
tried to justify

237
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,380
its harsh policies with respect to

238
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,360
Uighurs' cultural and religious freedom

239
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,100
by saying that they are extremists,

240
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,940
but Uighurs by nature are very moderate Muslim.

241
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,510
The word "terrorism" does not even exist in
the Uighur dictionary.

242
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,230
o the Chinese government were very effective

243
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,290
in its opportunistic approach.

244
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,410
About two weeks after 9/11,

245
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,350
Chinese Party secretary for the local government
came out, said,

246
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,680
"China is also a victim of terrorism."

247
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,740
At the same time in the central government
level

248
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,380
and in a diplomatic effort,

249
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,610
they find an opportunity to get on board on
intelligence

250
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,470
sharing purposes of War on Terrorism,

251
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,220
because if it's intimate relationship with
Pakistan

252
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,320
and Pakistan being one of the few countries

253
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,370
recognized Taliban regime,

254
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,220
along with Saudi Arabia and others,

255
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,480
were in the good position to obtain some valuable
intelligence

256
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,570
and share it with the United States.

257
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,900
So because of that opportunity,

258
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,050
United States were kind of willing to work
with the Chinese

259
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:51,660
because this country was not expected that
level of attack.

260
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,160
In 2009, there was a turning point in the
modern Uighur history.

261
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,820
Uighurs took to the streets to protest

262
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:05,010
and Chinese responded with its security,

263
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,150
resulting not only in ethnic class but death
and injuries.

264
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,410
That has been widely reported.

265
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,450
And then some people think that this was the
wake-up call

266
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:24,550
for the Chinese to implement even much more
aggressive policies.

267
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,790
If people would like to learn more about you
or the Uighur cause,

268
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,120
where can they go?

269
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,650
They should visit three main websites.

270
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,840
One is UHRB.org, it stands for Uighur Human
Rights Project,

271
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,010
and also UighurAmerican.org,

272
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,900
that is the website for Uighur American Association,

273
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,490
and also World Uighur Congress website, UighurCongress.org.

274
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,660
Those are the three Uighur organizational
websites,

275
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,410
but I also encourage people to read the reports

276
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,900
done by Human Rights Watch

277
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,730
and Congressional Executive Committee on China,

278
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,610
which just published a new report a couple
days ago.

279
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:16,420
So there are a wealth of information available
publicly,

280
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:24,280
so I might say that the narrative that are
supported

281
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,630
by evidentiary information is overwhelming.

282
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,540
Well, thank you again for joining us

283
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,210
and sharing the story of the Uighurs.

284
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,140
Thank you so much.

285
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,820
I hope you enjoyed this interview but there's actually much more

286
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,040
to learn about the situation Uyghurs are facing inside of China.

287
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,840
I had Nury on the China Unscripted podcast.

288
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,420
If you listen to the podcast, you will learn more about the Uyghur people

289
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,780
their concerns,

290
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,460
and difficult times they are going through

291
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,060
under the leadership of China's superman, Xi Jinping.

292
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,960
Ah, the superman... I put the link below so you can check it out. You won't regret it.
