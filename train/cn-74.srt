1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,440
If you prefer this show in audio form, then
head over to techdif.co.uk

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,810
where the old episodes are available as downloads
for your MP3 player

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,840
I'm sorry, I'm talking like I'm from the 90s,
aren't I?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,790
Is it available in a datablast at the end?

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,260
Oh my god, yes!

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,390
Oh no, no, wait, I'm confusing my enthusiasm
for that

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,910
with my enthusiasm for Violet Berlin.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,419
If you want to see the first season of how
we did this

9
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:24,609
but without our ugly mugs then you wouldn't
be seeing it

10
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,319
you'd be watching the newly recorded podcasts
or some s***

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,890
I'll try that again, you can see what I'm
driving at.

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,409
-- I'll have a go.

13
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:33,340
-- Actually, that probably covers it!

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,090
If you like to listen to these instead of
staring at us all the time,

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,829
these are available as podcasts

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,160
and they're available for your various MP3
devices

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,620
record players or wax gramophones at techdif.co.uk.

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,449
Do you want to watch this?

19
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:46,449
But without watching it?

20
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,540
On a bus in a tunnel?

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,120
Download it.

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
techdif.co.uk.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,500
-- That's it!

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
-- Audio-y!

25
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Right?

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Cut!

27
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,670
Print!
