1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,100
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,850
Would China fight for North Korea in a war?

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,880
I hope we’ll never find out.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,620
In China, coffee-lovers actually like Starbucks.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,680
What?!

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,940
And finally, it’s getting cold in here.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,820
So put on all your clothes.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,740
This is China Uncensored.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,760
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

10
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,970
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,320
If the US goes to war with North Korea,

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,279
which nation would China back?

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,350
Well, it’s not so clear.

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,070
The United States and South Korea

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,730
held annual air force drills

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,230
over the Korean Peninsula this week.

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,050
More than 200 planes were involved.

18
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,250
North Korea did not take that so well.

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,360
State media accused the US of

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,900
“reckless nuclear war mania.”

21
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,920
Right, the US.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,040
Not the country whose leader

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,480
poses in front of nuclear warheads.

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
And meanwhile,

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,000
China’s People’s Liberation Army

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,739
held its own air force drills

27
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,489
in new areas near the Korean Peninsula.

28
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,290
And according to a Beijing-based military
expert, Li Jie,

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,950
the PLA’s goal was to send a message to
the United States.

30
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,800
“The timing of this high-profile announcement
by the PLA

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,390
is also a warning to Washington and Seoul

32
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,960
not to provoke Pyongyang any further.”

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,920
So does this mean that China is warning the
US

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,549
that in the event of war with North Korea,

35
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,170
China will back North Korea?

36
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,979
Ok, they’re probably just posturing.

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,479
Let’s hope we never find out for sure.

38
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,920
But in the event of nuclear war,

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,729
the Chinese regime wants people in Northern
China

40
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,520
to be prepared.

41
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,030
In a Chinese province bordering North Korea,

42
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,200
state-run media ran a helpful cartoon

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,800
educating people on what to expect,

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,160
when you’re expecting...a nuclear holocaust.

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,159
For no reason in particular, really.

46
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,380
Just general knowledge that everyone should
know.

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,700
See, it’s called “General Knowledge

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,719
about Nuclear Weapons and Protection.”

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,719
For instance,

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,189
did you know that in the event of a nuclear
attack,

51
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,179
you should close your doors and windows

52
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,479
and hide under a table?

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,180
Be sure to scrub yourself thoroughly

54
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,430
to wash off that radiation!

55
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,800
And don’t forget to clean your ears.

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,760
You never want to forget to clean your ears.

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,750
It reminds me of the good old days of duck
and cover in the US.

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,390
Though you may laugh at some of the suggestions,

59
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,069
this is the first time ever the Chinese regime

60
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,620
has ever acknowledged that people in China

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,450
might actually be affected by nuclear conflict

62
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,760
on the Korean Peninsula.

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,090
Moving on to another region prone to conflict,

64
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,959
the Chinese regime has responded to US President
Trump

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel.

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,550
“We are concerned that the move

67
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,540
could sharpen regional conflicts.

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,180
The status of Jerusalem

69
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,970
is complicated and sensitive.”

70
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,490
Jerusalem is a bit of a thorny issue.

71
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,220
But China has made no secret of its ambitions

72
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,600
to be the one to solve the Israel-Palestine
issue.

73
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,709
Or at least to continue to play

74
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,530
both sides against the other

75
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,659
so it can do more business with Israel

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,380
while still supporting its old comrade in
arms,

77
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,690
the Palestinian Authority.

78
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,269
But depending on your point of view,

79
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,930
President Trump has just taken

80
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,550
one giant step to solving it,

81
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,550
or making it unsolvable.

82
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,550
Either way,

83
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,330
that’s the US showing it’s the global
power—

84
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,989
not China.

85
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,030
Speaking of things boiling over,

86
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,989
Starbucks has opened its first international
coffee roaster

87
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,280
and largest store in the world,

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,800
right here in Shanghai.

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,700
It’s 30,000 square feet big!

90
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,370
You know I never realized how creepy

91
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,480
the original Starbucks logo is.

92
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,180
Even Jack Ma showed up for the grand opening!

93
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,100
"I don’t like coffee,

94
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,660
but I like Starbucks."

95
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,680
Wow, Jack Ma and I have

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
the exact opposite opinion.

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,780
I have to say,

98
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,400
if ever there were a reason not to be jealous
of China’s rise,

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,870
it would be having the world’s biggest Starbucks.

100
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,379
In fact, I’d rather drink shredded jellyfish.

101
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,180
Which is actually the latest project

102
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,700
of China’s People’s Liberation Army.

103
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,220
The waters off China’s coast

104
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,030
are home to a lot of jellyfish.

105
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,250
Thanks to massive pollution.

106
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,500
And that’s a problem for the PLA Navy.

107
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,610
The jellyfish, not the pollution.

108
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,259
Swarms of jellyfish get sucked into ships
engines

109
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,580
and can bring them to a halt.

110
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,070
So PLA has developed a high tech new weapon

111
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,460
in the war against Poseidon,

112
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,890
called the jellyfish shredder.

113
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,400
It’s basically a big net with a bunch of
knives.

114
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,830
The only problem is...

115
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,400
it kind of shreds anything else that might
be in the water.

116
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,900
I think I know where China ripped off this

117
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,580
idea from...

118
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,700
I call it the Burns Omni Net!

119
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,120
It sweeps the seafloor clean.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
It’s wintertime in China,

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
so stay warm.

122
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,090
Unless you need to burn coal to stay warm,

123
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,389
in which case,

124
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,810
see you in the detention center.

125
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,020
No, I mean literally.

126
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,250
This propaganda slogan

127
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,639
has been popping up around China.

128
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,870
It says “If you burn coal,

129
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,389
see you in the detention center.”

130
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:28,190
Chinese authorities are clamping down

131
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,650
on coal burning,

132
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,910
hoping it will stop the annual airpocalypse

133
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,200
that plagues the country.

134
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,360
What that means, though,

135
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,900
is that millions of people

136
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,250
will have to face sub-zero temperatures

137
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,680
with nothing more than a coat.

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
Now that is cold.

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,960
Students are being forced to hold classes

140
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,740
outside in the winter sun

141
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,440
because the schools are too cold inside.

142
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,860
Local authorities were supposed to transition

143
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,150
everyone in the rural areas

144
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,360
over to natural gas before

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,750
the deadly cold winter hit.

146
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,700
But there were setbacks laying pipes,

147
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,260
and the sudden demand for natural gas

148
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,840
created huge shortages.

149
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,960
So it would sure be a shame if I don’t know,

150
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,630
a large number of people were suddenly forced

151
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,860
out onto the streets.

152
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,540
And we’ll have more on that after the break.

153
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,500
We may not have coal,

154
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:22,290
but we’re leaving a light on for you

155
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,630
over at ChinaUncensored.tv.

156
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,370
It’s our website,

157
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,690
where every Friday you can watch full half
hour episodes

158
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,669
you can’t see anywhere else.

159
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,830
It’s a laugh riot.

160
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,509
So bring the tear gas.
