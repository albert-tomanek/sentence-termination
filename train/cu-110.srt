1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,009
Chris Chappell has a Masters

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,429
from New York University,

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,230
and then moved into journalism focusing on
China,

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,920
and in the last six years

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
has produced China Uncensored--

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
a television program that appears on cable
TV

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,260
and online in the United States.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:26,119
And so the topic for tonight's talk

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,779
is "China's Growing Influence on the West

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,660
and Its Politics."

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,940
Chris Chappell, you're very welcome.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,649
Thank you.

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,539
Hi, welcome to the Sydney Institute,

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,870
I'm your speaker Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,870
Thank you.

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,179
For the last six years,

17
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,559
I've hosted an American TV show

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,649
called China Uncensored.

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,120
We use humor to talk about

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,069
what's happening in China,

21
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:52,239
and how that affects the world.

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,879
In that time we've talked about

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,879
enough China topics

24
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,489
to fill 1,000 episodes.

25
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,440
But since I only have half an hour tonight,

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,309
I've decided to cut it down

27
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,619
to just the terrifying highlights.

28
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,270
China's influence in the West is growing.

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,550
And the Chinese Communist Party,

30
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,900
which rules China with an iron fist,

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,640
is using Australia and New Zealand

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,260
to test out tactics they plan to use

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,140
around the world to influence politics,

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,800
and undermine democratic societies.

35
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,440
The New York Times says, quote,

36
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,350
"China has long treated Australia

37
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,560
as a laboratory for soft power experiments."

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,730
That's right:

39
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,750
China chose *you* to experiment on.

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,060
Congratulations.

41
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,060
And that's why I've made

42
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,730
the trip here from New York.

43
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,240
But what does all this mean?

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, tonight I'm going to give you a little
insight

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,170
into the Chinese Communist Party,

46
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,370
and I'll talk about how they wage what they
call

47
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,190
"unrestricted warfare" against Western countries,

48
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,020
including Australia.

49
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,170
All countries want influence.

50
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,249
But the Chinese Communist Party is different.

51
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,950
Both in methods and goals.

52
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,380
If we hope to understand this,

53
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,380
we need to understand

54
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,210
the nature of the Chinese Communist Party.

55
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,850
Because it operates in a fundamentally different
way

56
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,360
than any other government in the world.

57
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,560
Historically, China was an incredibly powerful,

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,040
influential country.

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Not just in Asia.

60
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
E

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,490
ven as far away as Ancient Rome.

62
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,830
Roman statesman Pliny the Elder,

63
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,200
in his book Natural History,

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,930
complained about the trade deficit

65
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,260
Rome had with China

66
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,049
because the Romans had an insatiable appetite

67
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,889
for Chinese silk.

68
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,999
So for 2000 years,

69
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,310
the West has been complaining about

70
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,099
the trade deficit with China--

71
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,129
from Pliny the Elder

72
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:38,709
to President Donald Trump.

73
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,409
It wasn't just trade.

74
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,239
People have always been inspired

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,290
by Chinese culture.

76
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,799
All you have to do is take a look at

77
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,049
European attempts to imitate Chinese art

78
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,469
in the 17th and 18th centuries.

79
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:53,409
Yeah, back in the day it was the West

80
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,680
making cheap knockoffs of Chinese products.

81
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,560
People would look at a vase and say,

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,889
"Made in France, ugh".

83
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,140
Of course in the modern era,

84
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,499
China's prestigious position in the world
changed--

85
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,220
after centuries of warfare,

86
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,349
economic turmoil,

87
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,959
and colonialism.

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
And then in 1949 the Communist Party

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,450
"liberated" China.

90
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,529
It liberated people from their land,

91
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:19,529
their wealth,

92
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,360
and in many cases their lives.

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,499
Mao Zedong launched a systematic campaign

94
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:26,090
to annihilate traditional Chinese culture

95
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,840
and replace it with the culture

96
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,419
of the Communist Party--

97
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,359
a culture of struggle.

98
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,489
Under Mao Zedong,

99
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,019
violent struggle became the cornerstone

100
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,480
of Chinese society.

101
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Children against parents,

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,250
wives against husbands,

103
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,250
students against teachers,

104
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,290
and of course,

105
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,989
Communism against the free world.

106
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,750
It's been a long time since Mao.

107
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,930
And on the surface,

108
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,110
it seems like China has changed.

109
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,790
There are no more Red Guards.

110
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,790
In Shanghai,

111
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,069
you can pay for your Big Mac on your iPhone

112
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,949
on the way to the next Avengers movie.

113
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,359
But behind it all,

114
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:02,940
the Communist Party is still there.

115
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,510
And it controls the government,

116
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,590
the courts,

117
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,299
and even businesses.

118
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,700
And unlike other bad parties,

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,780
this one--you can't leave.

120
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,309
And if you try,

121
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:14,120
things can get pretty unpleasant, pretty fast.

122
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
The Chinese Communist Party

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,430
has not fundamentally changed.

124
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,239
It's still an authoritarian state

125
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,320
that attempts to control

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,090
every aspect of society--

127
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,200
including the economy.

128
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,880
It maintains its philosophy of struggle.

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,510
And its war against the free world

130
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,540
has never ended.

131
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,140
That's not me saying that.

132
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,420
That is top Chinese military leaders

133
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,180
openly saying that.

134
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,700
In 1999,

135
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,790
two colonels from the People's Liberation
Army,

136
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,010
or PLA, coined the term "unrestricted warfare."

137
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,200
In fact, they wrote a book

138
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,750
called Unrestricted Warfare.

139
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,450
It describes how a country like China

140
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,540
could rival the West.

141
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,950
They said "The first rule of unrestricted
warfare

142
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,700
is that there are no rules,

143
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,600
with nothing forbidden."

144
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,520
Like after hours at a bar in Kings Cross.

145
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Unrestricted warfare is a war

146
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,060
without a single shot fired.

147
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,200
The PLA book says that

148
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,010
"the struggle for victory

149
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,690
will take place on a battlefield

150
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,100
beyond the battlefield."

151
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,920
But the goal is the same as any war.

152
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,780
'
The Chinese Communist Party wants to become

153
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,630
the world's primary superpower

154
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,950
and primary influence on other nations.

155
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,120
I hope you like Chinese food.

156
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,000
But seriously,

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,900
for a regime that's secretive about everything--

158
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,060
from pollution levels,

159
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,370
to state executions,

160
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,030
to even basic economic data--

161
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,780
they've been surprisingly transparent

162
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,670
about their goal to become a superpower.

163
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,670
Chinese leader Xi Jinping

164
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,790
has openly spoken about it.

165
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,300
Again, all countries want influence,

166
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,030
but remember, the Chinese Communist Party

167
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,460
is not a normal government.

168
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,560
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation--

169
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,180
ASIO--recently revealed they consider

170
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,520
the Chinese Communist Party an extreme threat,

171
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,710
and the level of espionage

172
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,800
and foreign interference in Australia

173
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
is worse now than at the height of the Cold
War.

174
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
Which, if you have forgotten,

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,520
was not a pleasant time.

176
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,680
The Chinese Communist Party's unrestricted
warfare

177
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,110
has several components.

178
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,610
Today I'm going to focus on how

179
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,610
unrestricted warfare uses propaganda

180
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,270
and censorship, economic interests,

181
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,270
and political and academic infiltration.

182
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,580
Let's start with propaganda.

183
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
As you may know,

184
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,190
the Chinese Communist Party is engaged

185
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,970
in a global propaganda campaign.

186
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,050
One goal is to promote

187
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,490
a positive view of China

188
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,370
and it's happy-go-lucky authoritarian regime.

189
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,170
If that doesn't work,

190
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,960
then their goal is censorship--

191
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
to marginalize and suppress critical voices.

192
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,110
Like mine.

193
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,860
And maybe yours.

194
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,210
The Chinese regime spends

195
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,640
10 billion dollars a year

196
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
on overseas propaganda.

197
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,170
That includes things like:

198
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,300
all-expenses paid,

199
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,190
red carpet trips to China

200
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,910
for Australian politicians and journalists.

201
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,380
I'm going to guess those tours

202
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,080
don't include labor camps.

203
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,770
Their propaganda budget also goes to

204
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,800
paying Western media companies,

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
like the New York Times and Fairfax,

206
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,660
to put articles from Chinese state-run media

207
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,690
in their own newspapers and on their websites.

208
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,890
Which apparently is legal.

209
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,640
The Party also buys up Chinese-language media

210
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,280
in Australia and around the world.

211
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,450
They want to make sure they report correctly

212
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,050
on the Party's benevolent rule.

213
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,240
But propaganda doesn't end with the media.

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,650
A key part of the Communist Party's influence
operations

215
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,400
is the United Front Work Department.

216
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,580
Remember that name,

217
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,780
because we'll be coming back to it.

218
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,420
The United Front is a top level branch

219
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,560
of the Communist Party.

220
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,980
Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called it

221
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,030
the Communist Party's magic weapon.

222
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,730
He's a big Lord of the Rings fan.

223
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,080
How magical is this weapon?

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,980
Here's one example.

225
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,050
There's a group linked to the United Front

226
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,150
called the China-United States Exchange Foundation.

227
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,090
They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
last year

228
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,090
lobbying Congress about US-China relations.

229
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,940
According to Foreign Policy magazine,

230
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,030
the group also cooperates on projects

231
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,310
with influential US think tanks,

232
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,750
like the Brookings Institution

233
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,050
and the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace.

234
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,340
These think tanks can have a big impact

235
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,870
on US policy making.

236
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,550
And a group linked to the Chinese Communist
Party

237
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,639
is working with them to shape how the West

238
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,710
views the Chinese Communist Party.

239
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,830
But if the all-expenses paid trips,

240
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,830
state-run articles,

241
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,710
and pro-Communist Party policy papers don't
work,

242
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,820
then there's the other side

243
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,730
of the propaganda coin--

244
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,880
censorship.

245
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
And in the West,

246
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,930
the Chinese Communist Party relies on

247
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,740
applying just enough pressure

248
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,980
to encourage self-censorship.

249
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
The Chinese Communist Party

250
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,090
has a list of topics they don't want discussed.

251
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,830
Among the most sensitive are Tibet,

252
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,200
Taiwan independence,

253
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,640
and the Falun Gong spiritual group.

254
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,130
So what happens if you touch China

255
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,980
in these sensitive zones?

256
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,120
Overseas Chinese journalists have had

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,029
their families back in China threatened.

258
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,990
Scholars have been denied research visas.

259
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,650
Western journalists have been kicked out of
China.

260
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,340
It doesn't always happen.

261
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,680
But it happens just enough to make people

262
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
hesitate to cover these topics.

263
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,710
I'm sure many of you have heard of

264
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,240
the book Silent Invasion,

265
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,300
by Professor Clive Hamilton.

266
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,800
It discusses in detail

267
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,271
the ways the Chinese Communist Party

268
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,990
has been infiltrating Australia.

269
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,770
But Hamilton's original publisher,

270
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,770
Allen & Unwin,

271
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,300
scrapped the book.

272
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,680
Censoring a book about Chinese censorship

273
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,570
was not the best idea.

274
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,100
Hamilton's book was eventually released

275
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,210
earlier this month by another publisher,

276
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,210
Hardie Grant --

277
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,280
showing that self-censorship

278
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,590
has its limits.

279
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,720
Besides propaganda,

280
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,520
the Communist Party's unrestricted warfare

281
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,380
is also carried out through exploiting

282
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,750
Western economic interests.

283
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,190
The United Front also plays a role here.

284
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,230
In January,

285
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,500
Clive Hamilton and researcher Alex Joske

286
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,560
wrote about the United Front Work Department's

287
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,590
influence in Australia.

288
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,470
They said "Many leading figures

289
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,300
in the Australian business community

290
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,130
now serve as megaphones

291
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,200
for Beijing's messaging

292
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,450
to the Australian government

293
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,100
and the wider public."

294
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,839
And that the business community

295
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,089
also fears "the risks of retaliation

296
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,440
when statements are made

297
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,930
that Beijing does not like."

298
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,170
Statements like "Taiwan is a country."

299
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,580
Or, "Pandas are fat."

300
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,190
One of the biggest problems

301
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,620
for companies entering China

302
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,840
is corporate espionage.

303
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,020
For years, Western companies

304
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,890
have been eager to get into the Chinese market.

305
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,310
What they don't realize is that

306
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,770
the Communist Party has a strategy:

307
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,570
Why innovate, when you can just steal

308
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,089
other people's ideas?

309
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:50,089
This is not something the Party

310
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,390
tries to hide.

311
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,390
Intellectual property theft

312
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,360
is literally written into

313
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,810
their national economic plan.

314
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,170
In 2007, they released a document

315
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,630
called the National Technology Transfer Promotion
Plan.

316
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,370
They might as well call it,

317
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,160
"How to Steal and Not Get Caught."

318
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,660
Here's how it works.

319
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,330
Chinese military hackers

320
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,110
steal a company's intellectual property--

321
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,089
and give it to a Technology Transfer Center.

322
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,550
They reverse engineer the technology,

323
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,790
and give it Chinese businesses.

324
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,910
Then those businesses make cheaper knockoffs

325
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,270
of those Western products.

326
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,410
That's what happened to the Australian company
Codan.

327
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,650
One of their major products is metal detectors.

328
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,210
ASIO discovered that a Codan employee's laptop

329
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,110
was hacked during a business trip in China.

330
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,279
Blueprints for the company's metal detectors

331
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,350
were stolen,

332
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,630
and cheap Chinese knockoffs

333
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,980
flooded the market--

334
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,740
still carrying the Codan logo.

335
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
But the Codan CEO

336
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,420
said the Australian government

337
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,000
was unwilling to help since,

338
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,300
at the time,

339
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,880
a free trade agreement with China

340
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,690
was on the line.

341
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,480
The company had to cut its prices in half.

342
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,530
In one year,

343
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,899
their net profits fell from 45 million dollars

344
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,800
to 9 million.

345
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,780
Apparently the free trade agreement is:

346
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,110
China takes your stuff, for free.

347
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,280
But don't worry.

348
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Last year,

349
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,180
Australia and China reached a deal:

350
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,220
no more cyber intellectual property theft.

351
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,210
And while they were shaking hands on it,

352
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,000
China stole Australia's watch.

353
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,090
How much do companies lose?

354
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,750
Trillions.

355
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,080
According to information security

356
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,150
company BLACKOPS Partners,

357
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,630
"U.S. companies and the U.S. economy

358
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,130
lose approximately $5 trillion each year,

359
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,680
or over 30 percent of the U.S. GDP ,"

360
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,870
to Chinese intellectual property theft.

361
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,820
In addition to corporate espionage,

362
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,279
the Party uses infrastructure investments.

363
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,960
Like the One Belt, One Road Initiative.

364
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
On the surface,

365
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,470
it's about building massive infrastructure
projects

366
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,470
around the world

367
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,080
with the goal of facilitating global trade.

368
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Last year,

369
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Chinese leader Xi Jinping

370
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,240
pledged to spend 124 billion dollars

371
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,839
on the plan.

372
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,839
In the West,

373
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,740
the Communist Party uses One Belt, One Road

374
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,810
for both economic gain and political leverage.

375
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,600
Take the case of Greece.

376
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,180
Chinese state investment in Greek infrastructure

377
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,980
has skyrocketed over the past several years--

378
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,880
power grids, major ports, telecommunications.

379
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,060
Actually, in similar areas as Australia.

380
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,260
Two years ago,

381
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,190
after a controversial court ruling

382
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,470
on the South China Sea,

383
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,100
Greece-- coincidentally--sided

384
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,140
with the Chinese Communist Party.

385
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,440
They were one of only two EU countries

386
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,899
to do so.

387
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,510
Well, two countries plus Sam Dastyari.

388
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,100
We'll get to him in a moment.

389
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Last June,

390
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
in another move that totally

391
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,380
had nothing to do with

392
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,220
the Chinese Communist Party's investments,

393
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,260
Greece stopped the EU from condemning

394
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,300
human rights abuses in China.

395
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,430
The Party's investments in Greece

396
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,180
and other European countries

397
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,750
have worried the EU--

398
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,740
enough that they now want to screen

399
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,870
Chinese investments that threaten

400
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,480
national security.

401
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,149
Things like, investing in power grids,

402
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,050
major ports, and telecommunications.

403
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,290
Using infrastructure investments

404
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,089
and corporate espionage,

405
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,760
the Chinese Communist Party's unrestricted
warfare

406
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,360
turns the West's economic interests

407
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,899
against itself.

408
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,250
Gaining political influence

409
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,640
is another important tactic

410
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,330
in China's Unrestricted Warfare.

411
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,770
As I've heard repeatedly since coming here,

412
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,470
Australia has the best politicians money can
buy.

413
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,000
ASIO has warned that "foreign interference...

414
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,010
on an unprecedented scale...

415
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,080
has the potential to cause serious harm

416
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,390
to [Australia's] sovereignty."

417
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,390
Since 2015,

418
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,780
ASIO has warned Australian politicians

419
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,400
to be wary of taking money

420
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,070
from Chinese donors with questionable links

421
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,370
to the Chinese Communist Party.

422
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,100
Thanks to some brilliant journalism

423
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,450
from Fairfax Media,

424
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,209
Four Corners, and others,

425
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:05,400
we know the Chinese Communist Party

426
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
has been very successfully

427
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,760
buying influence in Australia.

428
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,310
I also learned there are no laws

429
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,089
against foreign campaign contributions here.

430
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,089
Seriously?

431
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,220
Who thought that was a good idea?

432
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,730
I mean, besides the politicians.

433
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,240
Here's an example.

434
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,910
Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo

435
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,740
is linked to the United Front.

436
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,270
The Fairfax and Four Corners report

437
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,850
found that over 4 years,

438
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,420
he donated 2.7 million dollars

439
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,540
to Australia's three biggest political parties.

440
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
And he's had some pretty unusual dealings

441
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,760
with specific politicians.

442
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Like the Labor Party's Eric Roozendaal.

443
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,070
He resigned in 2013,

444
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,250
but took an executive job

445
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,850
at a property development company

446
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,750
owned by Huang.

447
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,080
What happened to Roozendaal's

448
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,410
vacant council seat?

449
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,220
Why, just three weeks later,

450
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,420
it was nabbed up by a friend of Huang's.

451
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,910
Of course, Huang Xiangmo's

452
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,620
most well known associate

453
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,310
is Sam Dastyari--

454
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,450
known by some as "Shanghai Sam".

455
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,529
Huang gave Dastyari thousands

456
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,650
in campaign contributions.

457
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,130
Dastyari also got almost a million dollars

458
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,459
for the Labor Party from Huang.

459
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,600
Now we can't say for sure

460
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,860
what Dastyari's motives were,

461
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,390
but after that,

462
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,710
Dastyari did some rather questionable things.

463
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,000
Like pressuring the Labor

464
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,700
foreign affairs spokeswoman

465
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,339
to not meet with a pro-democracy activist

466
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,750
that Beijing doesn't like.

467
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,529
And in a 2016 press conference

468
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,260
to Chinese media,

469
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,270
Dastyari contradicted his own party's

470
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,640
stance on the South China Sea ruling,

471
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,130
siding with the Chinese Communist Party instead.

472
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,769
Oh, and when Dastyari found out

473
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,670
Huang was being spied on

474
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,880
by Australian security agencies,

475
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,930
he personally went to Huang's mansion

476
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,810
and warned him his phone was being tapped.

477
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,350
Now that's real friendship.

478
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,800
There are many other examples

479
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,410
I could give of Australian politicians

480
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,080
being bought off by the Chinese Communist
Party,

481
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,660
but I think you get the point.

482
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,790
The book Unrestricted Warfare says,

483
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,250
"social spaces such as the military,

484
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,350
politics, economics, culture,

485
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,789
and the psyche are also battlefields."

486
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,959
And the Communist Party effectively uses

487
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,670
the social spaces of Western universities.

488
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,120
ASIO has warned the Australian government

489
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,090
that it needs to be "very conscious" of

490
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,150
foreign interference in Australian universities.

491
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,150
And much of this interference

492
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,290
comes again from the United Front,

493
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,760
which calls "overseas students

494
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,610
a focus of United Front work."

495
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,350
One example is the Chinese Students

496
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,970
and Scholars Association,

497
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,790
or CSSA.

498
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,520
Most universities with large numbers

499
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,480
of Chinese students have CSSAs.

500
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,800
They're typically linked with

501
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,480
the Chinese Embassy.

502
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,490
And their job is to make sure

503
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,140
Chinese students toe the Party line

504
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,380
and to intimidate students who don't.

505
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,660
Chinese students have found things

506
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,600
they said in class in Australia

507
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,360
were reported back to the Chinese police

508
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,660
by other Chinese students.

509
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,900
Which is why all of their term papers

510
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,340
were titled, "Don't free Tibet."

511
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,350
The former head of the United Front,

512
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,350
Liu Yandong,

513
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,780
created the Confucius Institute.

514
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,960
For free, they'll set up classrooms

515
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,330
to teach Chinese language

516
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,549
and culture in universities.

517
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:14,550
Since 2004,

518
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,920
500 Confucius Institutes have been set up

519
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,649
in 140 countries.

520
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,679
There are 14 Confucius Institutes

521
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,809
here in Australia.

522
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,880
The Communist Party's former Propaganda Chief

523
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,240
called the Confucius Institute,

524
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,480
"an important part of China's

525
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,210
overseas propaganda set-up."

526
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,059
So what exactly do they teach?

527
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,390
Well, let's just say a little less

528
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,670
Tiananmen Square Massacre,

529
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,980
and a little more

530
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,710
China's rapid economic development!

531
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,350
But more and more universities

532
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,640
have been waking up to the nature

533
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,630
of the Confucius Institute.

534
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,130
Some universities have kicked them out.

535
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,130
And currently,

536
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,679
the FBI is investigating them.

537
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:51,679
In Australia,

538
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,880
the Chinese Communist Party's influence in
universities

539
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,960
has also become a national security issue.

540
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,040
The Australian Research Council,

541
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,450
using taxpayer money,

542
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,580
has given millions of dollars in grants

543
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,750
to Chinese professors working in Australia.

544
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,850
The problem is,

545
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,080
in some cases,

546
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,230
those professors are doing research

547
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,260
with the Chinese military,

548
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,140
on advanced military technology

549
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,450
that could one day be used against the West.

550
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,510
ARC has also given grants

551
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,780
to universities for projects

552
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,270
that involved China's leading

553
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,890
military aircraft manufacturer,

554
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,130
and the telecommunications company Huawei,

555
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,720
which also has ties to the Chinese military.

556
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,830
And I thought allowing foreign campaign contributions

557
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,799
was a bad idea.

558
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,630
Is this a problem?

559
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,370
Not according to UNSW's

560
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,549
pro vice chancellor

561
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,000
Laurie Pearcey.

562
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,510
He also happens to be the head of

563
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,870
the school's Confucius Institute.

564
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,500
He wrote a recent editorial called

565
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,390
"Let's not isolate ourselves

566
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,790
from the benefits of China."

567
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,370
In it, he confidently states that

568
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,760
"Beijing respects the quality

569
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,700
and independence of [Australian] institutions."

570
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,190
Yes, Beijing respectfully undermines

571
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,440
Australian institutions.

572
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,870
The Chinese Communist Party's unrestricted
warfare

573
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,320
has had a major impact on the West.

574
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,460
The Party uses propaganda

575
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,929
to promote a glittering ideal of its rule,

576
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:13,309
and censorship to silence opposition to it.

577
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,571
It steals intellectual property

578
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,571
from Western companies

579
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:17,300
while using investment to get

580
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,010
Western countries on its side.

581
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,750
The Party buys political influence

582
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,970
wherever it can,

583
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,490
however it can.

584
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,900
It uses CSSAs and Confucius Institutes

585
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,160
to stifle academic freedom at Western universities

586
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,690
while taking advantage of research done there.

587
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,990
Thus far,

588
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,910
the West has been unprepared to counter

589
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,270
the Chinese Communist Party's unrestricted
warfare.

590
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,810
So, what can be done?

591
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,810
Nothing.

592
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,810
Thanks for coming folks.

593
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,830
Okay...there are a few things we could do.

594
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,860
First, we need to understand

595
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,330
the nature of the Chinese Communist Party.

596
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,941
It's an authoritarian system

597
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,910
that uses "struggle" to preserve

598
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,900
and strengthen its own rule.

599
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,210
This will not change,

600
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,710
no matter who's in charge,

601
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,530
no matter what reforms are promised,

602
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,550
no matter how open the economy appears to
be.

603
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,110
For those of us living in liberal democracies,

604
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,919
it can be hard to understand the lengths

605
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,800
the Communist Party will go to.

606
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,920
We're not used to dealing with

607
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,750
a government like this.

608
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,610
As historian Frank Dikotter said

609
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,090
in Silent Invasion,

610
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,640
it's like a Boy Scout dealing with Don Corleone.

611
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,610
So I recommend we all re-watch The Godfather.

612
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,500
Not that it will help us with the Party.

613
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,610
It's just a good movie.

614
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,890
Second, we need to expose the actions

615
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,679
of the Chinese Communist Party.

616
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,070
One of the biggest reasons the Party

617
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,240
has been able to carry out

618
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,760
this unrestricted warfare

619
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,800
is that people have remained silent,

620
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,470
through intimidation or self-interest.

621
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,470
That's one reason why

622
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,470
what's happening in Australia

623
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,580
now is so vitally important.

624
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,809
As I said earlier,

625
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,760
Australia is one of the proving grounds

626
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,070
for the Communist Party's tactics.

627
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,980
But now, those tactics are being exposed.

628
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,520
And people are openly talking about

629
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,370
how to respond.

630
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,299
The Communist Party is going to fight back.

631
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:57,720
After the Fairfax/Four Corners investigation,

632
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,870
the Chinese Embassy called it

633
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,670
"filled with Cold War mentality"

634
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:05,370
and "typical anti-China hysteria and paranoia."

635
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,360
The Party and those it has influenced

636
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,070
will continue to cry racism

637
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,530
and cold war mentality

638
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,179
to every legitimate concern.

639
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,530
That's why we need to be very clear

640
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,480
that these are the Chinese Communist Party's

641
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,420
infiltration operations.

642
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,020
It's not about racism against

643
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,310
ordinary Chinese Australians.

644
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,310
They're the ones who are

645
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,140
the first targets of the Party.

646
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,510
The Party wants us to believe that

647
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,920
they represent all Chinese people.

648
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,540
If you're against the Party,

649
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,309
you're against the Chinese people.

650
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:37,309
But don't fall for it

651
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:39,430
when people play the racism card.

652
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,820
We need to clearly distinguish

653
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,799
between the Party and Chinese people.

654
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,400
This way, we both avoid racist undertones,

655
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,750
and demolish a key part of the Communist Party's
propaganda.

656
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,340
Third, we need to stand up

657
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,030
to the Chinese Communist Party.

658
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,030
Like most bullies,

659
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,020
they tend to back down when confronted.

660
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
The foreign interference laws

661
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
being debated in Parliament

662
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,970
are a good start.

663
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,970
Australia could also lessen their

664
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,169
economic reliance on the Chinese Communist
Party

665
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:06,410
by strengthening ties with other countries.

666
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,580
Australia, the U.S.,

667
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,580
India, and Japan

668
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
are in talks now to establish

669
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,770
an alternative to China's One Belt One Road
Initiative.

670
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,280
Australia is not alone.

671
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,620
The US, the EU,

672
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,950
and other Western countries

673
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,510
are also beginning to wake up

674
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,650
to the Chinese Communist Party's unrestricted
warfare.

675
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,810
Yes, Australia is on the front lines.

676
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,490
But if these tactics can be defeated here,

677
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,020
it will send a message to the Communist Party:

678
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,679
the West is not for sale.

679
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,260
Thank you for your time.

680
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,360
I'll now take questions.
