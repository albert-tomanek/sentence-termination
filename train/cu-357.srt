00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,990
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,870
what, is this the Roman Empire or something?

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,340
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored. I'm your
host, Chris Chappell.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,550
Karl Marx, the creator of communism,

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,230
said religion is the "opiate of the masses."

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,800
And so the Chinese Communist Party set out
to prove

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,050
how much more rational and broadminded they
were than

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,540
people who partook in silly superstition

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,960
by going Hulk smash on it.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,420
Especially during China’s Cultural Revolution

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,329
a systematic campaign in the 60s and 70s

12
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,260
where they wiped out religion and traditional
culture.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,829
They destroyed China’s priceless cultural
and spiritual heritage

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,430
and even tortured Buddhist monks.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,489
Yeah! That'll…teach people…something.

16
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,149
Probably that when the Chinese Constitution
guarantees freedom of religion,

17
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,620
it's guaranteed in the same way as freedom
of the press.

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,110
“This is our own David McKenzie and his
team roughed up by police in Beijing.”

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,830
But!

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,740
"There’s been an awakening."

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,240
That's right, religion in China is on the
rise.

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,100
Not for Communist Party members, obviously.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,080
They’re required to be atheist.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,400
But Christianity in particular has seen a
massive resurgence.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,760
There are estimates at this very moment,

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,710
there could be 100 million Christians in China

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,840
that’s more than there are Communist Party
members!

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
Hmm, when was the last time I heard about

29
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,340
a 100 million-strong spiritual movement in China

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,740
Oh right! Falun Gong.

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,939
So you can guess how this is going to go for
Christians.

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,189
Actually, you don't have to guess!

33
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:54,700
There's been a 150% rise in the Chinese government’s
persecution of Christians in just one year

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,790
according to last year's annual report by
ChinaAid.

35
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,430
It's particularly bad in Zhejiang Province,

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,490
sometimes called the Chinese Jerusalem because
of how many Christians live there.

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,530
Pastors have been arrested

38
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,680
and congregations have been assaulted for
defending their churches from being demolished.

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Over a thousand crosses have been torn down
there since 2014.

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
Though to be fair,

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,540
the Party did give them the option of destroying
their own crosses first.

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,440
The persecution is most severe,

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,459
unsurprisingly, for "house" churches.

44
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,780
Those are illegal, unregistered Churches.

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,709
Because if you want to have a church,

46
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,050
it’s supposed to be registered with the
government,

47
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,170
so the atheist Communist Party can appoint
the priests and pastors.

48
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,160
That could be why a developer in Henan Province,

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,700
who was hired by authorities to demolish one
of these unregistered house churches,

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,870
felt he might have been authorized

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,060
to bury two people alive who tried to stop
it!

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,750
The house church leader, Li Jiangong, and
his wife, Ding Cuimei,

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,519
stepped in front of bulldozers to stop the
demolition.

54
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,620
According to ChinaAid, one of the crew said,

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,810
"Bury them alive for me. I will be responsible
for their lives."

56
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,480
So the bulldozer knocked them in and buried
them.

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,580
Li was able to dig himself out but Ding didn't
survive.

58
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,330
There’s video of this, but it’s pretty
disturbing.

59
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,190
You can watch it here if you want to feel
terrible and angry.

60
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,400
But look: If you think authorities

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,379
would tolerate this kind of outrageous behavior,

62
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:28,059
you’d be wrong.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,400
Authorities have already stepped in…

64
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,389
to pressure Li not to give details to the
media.

65
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,760
Because come on,

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,140
there's no need to make people feel bad about
the Communist Party as a whole!

67
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,819
Really, this is only the problem of one single
developer.

68
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,590
What’s that, Shelley?

69
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,250
It’s happened before?

70
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,300
Wow, I would’ve thought killing people with
bulldozers

71
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540
would have been a one-off thing.

72
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,840
But more importantly,

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,900
the Communist Party doesn’t want the media
to know

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,080
how widespread and common their persecution
of Christians has become.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,989
Anyway, two perpetrators from the demolition
crew

76
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,180
that killed Ding Cuimei last week are already
being criminally detained.

77
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,650
So come on, justice has been done right? Time
to move on.

78
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,159
Surely, that’ll be the last time Christians
are persecuted in China.

79
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,519
Oh.

80
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,459
So what do you think? What will the future
hold for Christians in China?
