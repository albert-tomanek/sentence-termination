00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:02,300
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,080
the Chinese Communist Party has developed

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,649
a whole bunch of warfare tactics to use against
the West,

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,680
in particular the United States.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,220
And they’ve been developing them in Taiwan.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,520
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,250
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,470
The Chinese Communist Party is engaged in
a campaign

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,640
of Unrestricted Warfare against the West.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,560
Unrestricted Warfare aims to achieve the same
goals of war,

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,950
without necessarily firing bullets.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,710
And Cyber Espionage is one of the most powerful
weapons.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,550
The Chinese regime is one of the world’s
biggest cyber aggressors.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,250
In 2015, the Chinese military was blamed for
the hack

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,900
on the US Office of Personnel Management,

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,370
which affected over 21 million Americans.

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,740
But you don’t test out your biggest weapons
on the US.

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,010
You try them out on a smaller target first,

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,160
to see if they work.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
And for the Chinese Communist Party,

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,190
that means Taiwan.

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,860
I sat down with cyber security expert Kitsch
Liao

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,370
in Taipei to learn more.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,370


25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,399
Thank you very much for joining us.

26
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,439
My pleasure.

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,509
So, the Chinese Communist Party is one of
the biggest

28
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,520
cyber aggressors in the world.

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,499
Is Taiwan a particular target?

30
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:18,119
I would say yes, because ultimately the goal
of cyber

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,450
espionage or even cyber attack is to advance
the political

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,249
aim of the Communist Party.

33
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,499
And, as you know, a lot of your

34
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:28,579
audience must know, Taiwan has been the particular
focus

35
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:31,859
for the Chinese Communist Party for the past
40, 50 years.

36
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,639
It's the entire reason for the existence of
the People's Liberation Army.

37
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,469
Mm-hmm-so, what's being targeted?

38
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:45,389
I would say basically when you're looking
at what the Chinese

39
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:46,599
actually are sort of targeting,

40
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:53,130
they are mostly government infrastructures
and military think tanks,

41
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,689
or research institutes, huge companies.

42
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,679
Basically, everything you can think of anywhere
from

43
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:02,759
the President's office down to the most basic
registry,

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,369
like population registration, the DMV.

45
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,369
Everything.

46
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,759
Mm-hmm -but since Taiwan is a part of China,

47
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,220
how do you hack yourself?

48
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,640
Well, the thing is, you know,

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,650
as much as the CCP likes to claim they're
part of,

50
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,640
we are part of China, we still have different
jurisdiction.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,780
We have our own army.

52
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,400
We have our own elected government.

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,720
We have popular legitimacy, and if you ask
most people,

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,870
they are like, well you know, I don't think
China's part of us.

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,870
You know?

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,090
I need passport to go there.

57
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,090
Good point.

58
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,150
So, I know in the U.S.,

59
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,349
I've heard there are only two types of companies.

60
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,610
Companies that have been hacked and companies
that

61
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,739
don't know they've been hacked.

62
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,390
Is that the situation in Taiwan?

63
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,440
Oh, yeah, of course, definitely.

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,120
Up until a few years ago, if one of the white-hat
hackers,

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,329
which means they're hackers and they turn
to fight for side of good,

66
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:59,690
if they were to basically bring a vulnerability,

67
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,260
a leak of a company with proof of concept,

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,909
Instead of fixing their vulnerabilities,

69
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:09,599
basically what they would do is they would
charge

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,359
the white-hat that bring them the problem.

71
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,579
So, it's just made the problem worse?

72
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,579
Yes.

73
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,269
Or at least didn't fix the problem.

74
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,269
It's getting better.

75
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,959
It's getting better in the past few years.

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,959
And-

77
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,959
What changed?

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,910
Basically, awareness, I would say.

79
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,450
And also several significant incidents in
the past few years.

80
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,790
Not the least of which was the hack on the
hack on the Far Eastern Bank

81
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,160
that resulted in a almost few million losses.

82
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,069
But, fortunately our law enforcement officials
were able

83
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,510
to capture them before they succeeded.

84
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,439
I'm curious, the Chinese Communist Party has
said

85
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,860
for decades that they are going to invade
Taiwan by force, if necessary.

86
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,109
Why do people not realize cyber espionage
from

87
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,909
the Communist Party is a threat?

88
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,549
Well, the thing is for most people

89
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:02,099
they just want to get on with their lives,

90
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,530
and the internet penetration rate in Taiwan
is one of

91
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,079
the highest known around the world.

92
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,910
But, also, because it's invisible.

93
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,810
You don't feel the effects.

94
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,870
Even if they stole everything from you,

95
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,200
all your personal information,

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,220
the effect is not going to be immediate unless
you've

97
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,580
got a credit card stolen.

98
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,230
I have one example that I would like to provide
that to

99
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,280
illustrate this kind of situation.

100
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,890
The Research Institute was acting on the government
contract.

101
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,820
They were researching on behalf of the government,

102
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,280
and we were called in to basically to conduct
a review of their system.

103
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,130
And, we found out, basically,

104
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,290
a lot of their computers are completely unprotected,
and basically-

105
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,290
Unprotected?

106
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,280
Unprotected and there's a lot of trojan in
it, and you know,

107
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,990
including ones that could be traced back to
China.

108
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,070
But, of course, their concern was less about
the security,

109
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,240
but more about the fact that

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,520
they needed to turn in their report on time.

111
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,970
I would say awareness is the first step, and
that gets the people

112
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,910
in charge to understand what kind of consequences
they are facing.

113
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,350
What created that awareness?

114
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,980
Was it that big hack?

115
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,390
What took?

116
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:29,600
It's a gradual process, but I would say, we've
talked about espionage.

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,410
There's also the other side of that.

118
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,710
Because, once you actually get into a computer
system,

119
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,740
there's a lot you can do.

120
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,880
The Chinese Communist Party,

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,310
in terms of the organization of the armed
forces,

122
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,650
they do not make distinct differentiation
between say,

123
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,910
cyber espionage and other kind of warfare.

124
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,760
That's according to The Science of Military
Strategy, basically.

125
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,750
That's what they're saying.

126
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,620
All of this integrating, including psychological
warfare,

127
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,430
intelligence, electronic warfare and of course,
cyber warfare.

128
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,560
So, really this is an aspect of war?

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,810
Yes, definitely.

130
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,770
They treat this as seriously as any warfare.

131
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,590
This is a prelude to warfare.

132
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,400
I would say that.

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,270
All this election-related, all this fake news,

134
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,640
disinformation that you saw, people are starting
to catch up,

135
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,990
because you saw some unfamiliar use of phrases,

136
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,430
people started thinking wait,

137
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,490
how much of this is actually coming from China.

138
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,210
When you say fake news,

139
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,060
are you talking about what happened in the
U.S. or here in Taiwan?

140
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,510
Here in Taiwan.

141
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,510
Really?

142
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,510
That was problem here, too?

143
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,510
Yeah.

144
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,810
And in fact, that's actually one of the most
serious concerns

145
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,000
of our National Security Establishment these
days.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,930
So, the Chinese Communist Party's trying to

147
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,830
interfere with elections in Taiwan?

148
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,390
When we say election interference we gotta
specify which part

149
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,640
we're actually talking about.

150
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,590
So, in terms of the actual voting process,

151
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,850
because Taiwan's voting process

152
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,520
is conducted by people, actual paper.

153
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,970
You have a paper ballot, and they put that
in the ballot boxes.

154
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,470
And then when it's time to actually count
the results-

155
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,470
The U.S. should try that.

156
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,470
Yes.

157
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,470
We result, we track all of that.

158
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,790
So, it's actually harder to hack that, so
to speak.

159
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,330
But, during the campaign there were stories.

160
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,970
There will be polls, actually.

161
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,970
There will be all sorts of information that
is open to

162
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,900
manipulation on the internet.

163
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,380
I hear what the Chinese Communist Party is
doing

164
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,720
in terms of interfering with the election
process

165
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,160
in Taiwan is sort of like a staging ground
for tactics

166
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,570
they are going to use around the world.

167
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,340
Can you speak to any of that?

168
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,340
In terms of staging ground,

169
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,900
it's less of an election thing, influence
operations.

170
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,480
It's more about cyber espionage.

171
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,890
So basically, that means the tools,

172
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,500
the malwares they would use in other countries.

173
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,980
And, a lot of the times,

174
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,320
this is actually according to American firms,

175
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
that they would test on Taiwan first.

176
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,890
They would use Taiwan as a testing ground
to see

177
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,980
whether we're onto them or not.

178
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,890
How good our detection are.

179
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,620
How good our protections are,

180
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,810
our security operation centers are.

181
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,580
Whether we are onto them or not before actually
moving on.

182
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,860
This is pretty common.

183
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,140
You want to use your best weapons on the hottest
opponent.

184
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,380
So, you want to test on Taiwan first before
say

185
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,660
going for more harder targets like America,
for example.

186
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,030
Mm-hmm -so Taiwan is really on the front lines

187
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,419
of the cyber warfare with China?

188
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,510
Oh, without a doubt.

189
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,030
And how do you tell if it's a Chinese State
actor,

190
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,680
or an individual actor within China?

191
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,420
That goes to how we actually hunt the cyber
actors.

192
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,410
So, one of the first thing when we receive,
for example,

193
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,170
an NSA report is that you know, most of the
time,

194
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,530
you know what they're after, what they're
targeting,

195
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,150
which institution, which companies they're
targeting.

196
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,900
And, then you are able ascertain, at least,

197
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,340
some sort of motive.

198
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,490
Why do they want this?

199
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,480
For example, if the hack was against

200
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,800
a military research institution,

201
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,160
then there's very little doubt that government
agencies,

202
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,460
or for example, mercenaries would be interested

203
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,000
in selling this information.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,180
Then you trace back to see what kind of tools
they're using,

205
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,950
what kind of procedures they're using.

206
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,690
Does this match any of the previous attacks
that we're familiar with?

207
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,210
And then when you see a pattern,

208
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,430
you start comparing the tools to see how much
this tool actually cost.

209
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,040
You can estimate how much this is going to
cost,

210
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,430
how much the entire operation is going to
cost,

211
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,280
and what kind of resources they have to devote
to this.

212
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,360
State-backed actors obviously have access
to more resources.

213
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Yes.

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Okay.

215
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,010
In terms of actual cyber attack you could
effectively

216
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,730
they have unlimited resources because it's
cheap.

217
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,960
Most of these attacks, unfortunately

218
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,150
Compared to like a tank?

219
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,150
Yes.

220
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,150
Okay.

221
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,150
I know the United States provides

222
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,340
a lot of military support to Taiwan.

223
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,600
Are they are also providing like cyber...

224
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,029
what's the term I'm looking for...

225
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,960
cyber equipment, cyber-

226
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Cooperation

227
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,360
Super-human samurai.

228
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh, yeah.

229
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Cyber-squads.

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Yeah.

231
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,140
Well, the thing is,

232
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,400
if we're talking about general cooperation,

233
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,870
because we have to clarify.

234
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,420
In terms of a cyber threat posed to people,

235
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,460
there are generally two kinds.

236
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,700
This is the most rough classification.

237
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,490
You have cyber espionage, and you have cyber
crime.

238
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,250
Basically they're doing the same thing, but
one is motivated

239
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,460
by financial gains.

240
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,520
The other is motivated by others.

241
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,600
State interest.

242
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
In terms of financial crime, cyber crime,

243
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,470
everybody's actually aware this is a huge
problem, right now.

244
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,050
Hell, even China is part of the cooperation
in this.

245
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,590
But, in terms of cyber crime cooperation,
our law enforcement

246
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,810
and intelligence community is actually very
active with our partners

247
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,720
in the States and as well as Europe.

248
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,470
And, they have regular conferences.

249
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,320
They have exchange of intelligence.

250
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,880
The case I just mentioned, the Far Eastern
case,

251
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,850
they actually enlisted the help of Interpol
as well.

252
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,560
But, in terms of the more serious State interest
concerns,

253
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,130
cyber espionage and cyber welfare, the thing
is,

254
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,080
even if there is cooperation that would stay
behind doors

255
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,040
because of the sensitive nature.

256
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Naturally.

257
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,310
And, what about the risk

258
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,350
from Chinese telecommunication company,

259
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,070
like Huawei or ZTE?

260
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,410
Is that something that Taiwan is on guard
about?

261
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,830
Oh yeah, definitely.

262
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,450
I would like to take this opportunity

263
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,760
to point out, we were actually one of the
first in the world

264
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,190
to point that out.

265
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,680
Back in 2013, we were the first ones to actually
prevent

266
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,140
any Chinese company from participating in
bids involving our core network,

267
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,340
you know, pay stations, servers within government
agencies.

268
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,839
And...that's, for the establishment of the
4G network.

269
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,440
And now, when it comes to 5G, the NCC,

270
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,360
the National Communication Commission,

271
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,070
which is in charge of all the telecommunication
equipment in Taiwan,

272
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,240
actually announced that the rules won't change
for the 5G.

273
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,100
So, Huawei and ZTE, they're still out.

274
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,020
But, in terms of personal equipment, you know
cell phones,

275
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,010
your internet card and everything.

276
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,290
Unfortunately, they're actually pretty prevalent
in Taiwan these days.

277
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,290
Really?

278
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,640
What about Chinese apps, like WeChat?

279
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,970
WeChat and QQ, I'm sure a lot of people have
heard they're dangerous,

280
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,400
you should not be using them.

281
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,770
But, people don't understand why they're dangerous.

282
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,630
Now, there are many, many, many reasons not
to use them.

283
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,589
Just purely from whether the product is secure
or not.

284
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:05,670
In terms, because this is a Chinese software,

285
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,270
so there's the added problem, issue,

286
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,380
of Chinese State censorship,

287
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,440
and also what they can do with these apps.

288
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,920
So, for example, there were reports during
the Hong Kong protest

289
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,230
that the Chinese of Industry of State Security
is actually

290
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,850
sending remote access trojans through WhatsApp
in order to basically,

291
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,130
you know, sneak a peak at what's going on
in your phone.

292
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,980
What these trojans allows a lot of times is
a complete access

293
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,400
and administrator access off your entire phone.

294
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,649
So, it doesn't matter what kind of encryption
you use

295
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,821
for your other messaging apps.

296
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:47,180
You could be using Signal, Telegram, whatever,

297
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,260
they will still have access to all of your
personal information,

298
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,940
if they wish to.

299
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,410
So apps like WeChat are basically providing
a backdoor

300
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,130
for the Chinese Communist Party to get into
your phone?

301
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,550
If they so wish, yes.

302
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,600
what can an individual do?

303
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,280
Ultimately speaking,

304
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,080
I know this is going to sound really old fashioned,

305
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,000
but everybody's responsible for,

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,670
not only their own security,

307
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,320
but everybody around them.

308
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,520
Because, if you don't care about what kind
of breach,

309
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,460
or what kind of access you're providing to
potential hackers,

310
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,120
potential actors, then you are just,

311
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,720
you are just a jumping board for attackers
to attack

312
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,360
everybody around you.

313
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,690
That means everybody around you have to defend
against you.

314
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,810
So, update your password every three month
or so.

315
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,470
Because even if you don't leak your password,

316
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,760
the people who has your password is going
to leak them.

317
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Yeah.

318
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,790
Use encryption and you know,

319
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,330
for every software you want to install,

320
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,580
I know there's End User Agreement,

321
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,560
and it's really exhausting to read through
all of them,

322
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,720
but they will usually require access to some
of your personal stuff.

323
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Personal information.

324
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,220
So, read through them,

325
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,270
and if it's not absolutely necessary,

326
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,440
do not agree to share your information.

327
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,400
That's the best that you can do on a daily
basis.

328
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Of course, for Gmail, because almost everybody
have Gmail,

329
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,990
activate your two-step verification.

330
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,350
Because, the goal of security is to make it
harder,

331
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,830
collectively, for the bad guys to do things.

332
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,320
Mm-hmm (affirmative)-what about,

333
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,790
I'm curious about Chinese mobile phone games.

334
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,280
Is that something people want to watch out
for?

335
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,500
Well, basically mobile games are just like
any other software.

336
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,470
They're prone to all sorts of malware inserts.

337
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,310
Now, basically, mobile games,

338
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,839
I would say like the larger concern these
days are data collection,

339
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,920
and also the censorship nature.

340
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,740
Because, there actually has been reports studying,

341
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,660
you know, kind of censorship going on in Chinese
mobile games.

342
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,250
So, that's another aspect that's unrelated
with this.

343
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,020
So, what is the Taiwanese Government doing
about any of this?

344
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,040
Basically, the Taiwanese Government has been
aware of this threat

345
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,589
for a long time and they've been gradually
building of this capacity

346
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:13,890
on a government level to encounter the cyber
threat posed by

347
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,529
all the threat actors.

348
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,589
But, specifically, China.

349
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,480
Now, in terms of securing our infrastructure,

350
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,360
what they do is much like what we have for
dealing with any natural disaster.

351
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,040
We identify the critical infrastructure.

352
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,750
But, in this case, it's called the critical
information infrastructure.

353
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,570
Basically, we have all these agencies reporting
what kind of

354
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,480
vulnerabilities they would encounter.

355
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,130
Whether they would be able to continue operation
if any one of them

356
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,600
was being paralyzed by any cyber attacks.

357
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,779
So, this kind of exercise has been going on
on an annual basis.

358
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,640
And, also like in any government agencies
and offices now,

359
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,750
we have security operation centers set up
with people on-site

360
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,720
to monitor the entire cyber security situation
of any given agency.

361
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,240
And, proper access rules, error gaps,

362
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,119
all three different firewalls...internal firewalls

363
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,010
that's all have been set up.

364
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,569
I would say, we have actually improved a lot.

365
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,189
Considering a disproportionate amount of threat
Taiwan's under,

366
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,069
we are actually doing a pretty good job.

367
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,069
Great.

368
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:30,559
One final question.

369
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,110
The Chinese Communist Party,

370
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,159
if you had to pick,

371
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,240
would be what Star Trek villain?

372
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,860
Wow.

373
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,480
That would be really hard.

374
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,440
Oh, of course, it's easy.

375
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,510
It's the Borg.

376
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,510
Yep.

377
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,510
Correct.

378
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,640
You win the interview.

379
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Congratulations.

380
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Thank you.

381
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Thanks for joining us, Kitsch.

382
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
It was wonderful to have you.

383
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,000
My pleasure.
