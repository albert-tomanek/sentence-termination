1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,860
Zombie companies in China.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,510
They’re bad for economic growth.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,070
and they’re eating up money like tasty brains.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,860
But there’s just no easy fix.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,460
for China’s coming zombie apocalypse.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,740
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,130
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,130
Zombies.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,810
They’re running amok in China.

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,090
And no, I’m not talking about World War
Z,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,090
the book version,

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,000
where the zombie apocalypse is triggered

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,480
by organ trafficking in China.

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,510
I’m talking about Chinese zombie companies.

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,760
And they’re not as easy to kill

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,059
as the Chinese Communist Party would like.

17
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,600
That’s according to a study called

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
“The mystery of zombie enterprises:

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,899
stiff but deathless.”

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,949
China’s zombie enterprises

21
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:52,340
are state-owned companies

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,610
that are consistently unprofitable—

23
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,840
companies that, in a free market,

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
would go bust.

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,550
But in China’s state-managed economy,

26
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,360
they’re artificially kept alive,

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,600
thanks to what the study’s authors call

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,380
repeated “blood transfusions.”

29
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,380
Which makes them seem

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,840
more like vampires than zombies.

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,850
Zampires?

32
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,860
Vombies?

33
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,729
These “blood transfusions”

34
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,370
are state-sponsored loans and subsidies.

35
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,119
They’re what make these failing zombie companies

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,189
“stiff but deathless.”

37
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,931
These zombie companies are a problem

38
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:29,439
for China’s economy as a whole—

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,970
because they’re unproductive,

40
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,130
they don’t innovate,

41
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,869
and they don’t contribute to economic growth.

42
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:36,390
Just like real zombies.

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,720
“The persistence of zombie enterprises

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,189
not only occupies precious resources,”

45
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,229
the study says,

46
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,550
“but also causes financing problems

47
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,350
for other enterprises

48
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,360
and lowers the production efficiency

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,920
of the whole industry.”

50
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,710
As this legion of the undead stumbles along

51
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,960
thanks to Chinese government subsidies,

52
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,130
it hurts productive companies...

53
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,520
by eating their brains.

54
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,270
Or at least by eating up resources

55
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,290
that productive companies would otherwise
get.

56
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,719
According to the European investment bank,
UBS,

57
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,220
China’s economy is becoming less and less
efficient—

58
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,730
partly as a result.

59
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,250
Compared to a decade ago,

60
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,470
it now takes twice as much capital

61
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,100
to create the same amount of GDP growth.

62
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,660
It’s hard to pin down

63
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,300
the true number zombie firms in China,

64
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,220
because, well, the Chinese Communist Party

65
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,940
is not real good at transparency.

66
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,500
In the same way that a brick wall

67
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,380
is not real good at being a window.

68
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,660
Official data from the State-owned

69
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,390
Assets Supervision and Administration Commission,
or SASAC,

70
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,020
says there are about 2,000 zombie companies

71
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,630
run by the central authorities.

72
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,340
But that’s just a fraction.

73
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,920
Add in all the zombie companies

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,030
overseen by local governments,

75
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,130
and you get at least 10,000.

76
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,240
But even that number is not easy to pinpoint.

77
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,450
Because officials aren’t really motivated

78
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,090
to do accurate reporting.

79
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,200
“This is a case where these local governments,

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,720
it seems, a number of them,

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,980
have drawn up list

82
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,900
of zombie companies in their jurisdictions,

83
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,670
but are holding back on revealing those to
the banks...

84
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,210
And it’s also the case, we’ve heard,

85
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,810
that banking regulators in some of these provinces

86
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,510
are also being kept in the dark.”

87
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,200
And that was back in 2016.

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
At the time,

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,050
there was a broad push to fix

90
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,590
broken parts of the Chinese economy.

91
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,010
And Premier Li Keqiang

92
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,010
launched an initiative for

93
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,680
the “active and safe disposal of zombie
enterprises”.

94
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,820
But fast forward three years,

95
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,940
and that still hasn’t happened.

96
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,170
Earlier this month,

97
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,940
the head of China’s biggest aluminum producer

98
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,690
warned that zombie enterprises are hampering

99
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,290
China's economic transformation.

100
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,490
The zombie apocalypse is so nigh,

101
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,310
that Xi Jinping himself recently vowed

102
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,020
to slay the zombie hordes once and for all.

103
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,970
He warned that China must be on guard

104
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,970
against ‘grey rhinos’—

105
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,530
which are highly obvious yet ignored threats.

106
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,530
Which is weird,

107
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,530
because in other countries,

108
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,850
people think of rhinos as endangered species

109
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,500
that should be protected.

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,810
Anyway, back in December,

111
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,889
11 top Chinese regulatory and policymaking
bodies

112
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,620
got together and pledged to

113
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,560
get rid of zombie companies by 2020.

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,150
Just like Premier Li Keqiang pledged to do

115
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,280
back in 2016.

116
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,870
But this time, it’s gonna be for real.

117
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,230
And these regulators promised

118
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,150
to publish a list of zombie companies within
three months.

119
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,460
So that was December.

120
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,760
Let’s see, January, February, March,

121
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,920
hey that’s three months and...no list.

122
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,660
Instead, we got only a statement on March
9

123
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,510
from Xiao Yaqing,

124
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,970
head of the state assets regulator.

125
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,130
And he was like,

126
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,770
“Everything’s fine.

127
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,770
State-owned enterprises

128
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,090
are totally independent market players.”

129
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,190
Although I’m not sure I trust a guy who—

130
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,510
judging by this photo—

131
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,760
is probably an actual zombie himself.

132
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,780
I know what you’re thinking,

133
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,410
“That’s just a joke,

134
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,220
that photo probably just had bad lighting”.

135
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,980
No, I’m serious.

136
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,900
I’ve looked through a lot of photos of Xiao
Yaqing

137
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,880
and I’m pretty sure he’s an actual zombie.

138
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,600
Either that or he’s personally giving

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,040
blood transfusions to the zombies.

140
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,250
Zampires.

141
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,470
Vombies.

142
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,660
Xiao said that anybody who claims

143
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
there’s a systematic arrangement

144
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,640
for state-owned companies to get subsidies

145
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,660
from the Chinese state is spreading fake news.

146
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,650
Because these companies “are self-operated,

147
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,090
self-financed, self-sustained,

148
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,390
self-disciplined and self-developed.”

149
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,820
Except...he’s lying.

150
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,090
And he probably want to eat your brains.

151
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,090
Remember that report,

152
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,140
“the mystery of zombie enterprises –

153
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,620
“stiff but deathless”’?

154
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,200
Turns out it’s not that big of a mystery
why

155
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,960
zombie companies—especially the biggest
ones—

156
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
continue their long march of the undead.

157
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,460
Brains.

158
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,320
Sorry, I meant jobs.

159
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,510
Zombie firms might pile

160
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,360
mountains of bad debt on the banking system

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,870
and hurt the economy in the long term

162
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,840
by being unproductive—

163
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,170
but in the short term,

164
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,790
they provide jobs.

165
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,090
And for the Chinese Communist Party,

166
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,630
jobs and economic prosperity

167
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,000
are the only reasons they’re still in power.

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,110
Just ask driver Wong Wei.

169
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,370
He blames his lost job in the coal industry

170
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,660
when the Chinese regime moved to lay off

171
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,230
1.8 million workers in several zombie industries.

172
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,120
“I borrowed more than I can afford

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,700
just to buy this truck”

174
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,070
says driver Wong Wei,

175
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,530
“now no work,

176
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,670
I’m angry with the government.”

177
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,371
So Wong Wei thinks that

178
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,690
the Chinese government is going the incorrect
direction.

179
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,860
I guess he should know.

180
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,600
Zombie companies operate on a simple formula.

181
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,570
They “exist as a direct result of the resources

182
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,690
and credit endorsements they receive

183
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,260
from the government.”

184
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,270
And “the companies that offer a greater
number of jobs

185
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,460
receive more government subsidies.”

186
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,490
And there are more poorly thought-out incentives.

187
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,480
Local officials get job promotions

188
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,540
if they meet employment targets in their regions.

189
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,330
So as long as a company provides jobs,

190
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,820
local officials try to protect it from getting
shut down.

191
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,330
And as a result,

192
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,330
local officials hide bad companies

193
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,770
from central regulators who might want to
put them

194
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,060
on lists of zombie companies to be eliminated.

195
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,380
Sometimes, local officials even help them

196
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,280
get more loans through hidden

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
off-balance sheet transactions.

198
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,090
“S&P credit analysts were using

199
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,180
some colorful language to describe

200
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,790
the risks around this,

201
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,830
saying that the debt they’re talking about
is,

202
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,830
the potential debt,

203
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,090
is like an iceberg with titanic credit risks.”

204
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,660
“Put that on top, by the way,

205
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,620
of what we know the official numbers

206
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,110
in terms of debt \hin China,

207
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,060
260% at the very least to GDP,

208
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,190
and it starts to add up to

209
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,600
some pretty frightening numbers.”

210
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,919
And for people who’ve been around the block
a few times,

211
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,470
like this retired businessman,

212
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,000
China’s plan to kill off or restructure

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,270
its horde of zombie companies is doomed to
fail.

214
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:16,560
“Even if they start to reform, it won’t
be deep because it’s related to the stability

215
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,100
of the Communist regime and it’s related
to the nature of the government.

216
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,340
The Communist government is established on
the state-owned economy.

217
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,360
If they carry out deep SOE reform, they have
to change themselves.”

218
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,960
And nobody wants to change themselves.

219
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,520
So what do you think about China’s zombie
company apocalypse?

220
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,539
Leave your comments below.

221
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,390
And now it’s time for me to answer a question

222
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,490
from a member of our 50-Cent Army

223
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,760
who supports China Uncensored

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,510
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

225
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,730
Sean Connelly asks:

226
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,480
“Does the fifty cent army pledge level

227
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,570
in any way refer to the Chinese company tencent?

228
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,410
And if yes, what is the deeper meaning behind
it?”

229
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,920
Good question, Sean.

230
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,330
The term 50-Cent Army doesn’t have

231
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,080
anything to do with Tencent.

232
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Or the rapper 50 Cent.

233
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,320
The original term refers to

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,260
how the Chinese Communist Party

235
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,300
pays online commenters to manipulate public
opinion

236
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,550
by posting things online that support the
Party line.

237
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,060
In Chinese, they’re called the Wu Mao Dang,

238
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,720
which means 50-Cent Party.

239
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,160
They’re sometimes also called the 50-Cent
Army.

240
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,370
Originally the name came about

241
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,150
because they were supposedly paid

242
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,510
the equivalent of half a Chinese dollar—

243
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,430
50 cents—per post.

244
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,210
When I first launched our Patreon site back
in 2015,

245
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,510
I decided it would be clever to create

246
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,150
our own group of supporters,

247
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,740
and call it the “China Uncensored 50-Cent
Army.”

248
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,430
I asked fans to contribute

249
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,060
50 cents or more per episode

250
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,220
to support the show.

251
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,760
A year later,

252
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,310
credit card companies made a new rule

253
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,070
that the minimum pledge had to be $1 dollar...

254
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,880
but I kept the name “50-Cent Army.”

255
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,029
Thanks for your question, Sean.

256
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,200
And thank you for joining the 50-Cent Army!

257
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,970
Possibly by accident.

258
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,940
And thanks to all my 50-Cent Army soldiers

259
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,400
who support China Uncensored.

260
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,310
It’s only because of your support

261
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,130
that we’ve been able to keep this show going

262
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,140
for so many years.

263
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,260
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

264
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,360
See you next time.
