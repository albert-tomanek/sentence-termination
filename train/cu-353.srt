1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,250
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,259
North Korea got us a gift package!

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,460
I can’t wait to see what’s inside.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,940
Welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,480
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,070
Good news everyone!

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,500
So I took a little break from the news

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,680
over the Labor Day weekend.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,170
I mean you need a little time off

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,570
every now and then.

11
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,570
And when I came back,

12
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,240
I was so happy to see that

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,529
the nuclear standoff with North Korea

14
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,990
had been peacefully resolved!

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,000
Apparently things have worked out so well,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,010
that North Korea is sending the US gift packages,

17
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,740
isn’t that nice?

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,960
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,400
You want me to watch this Fox News clip?

20
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Okay...

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,650
“Well, the US and it’s allies

22
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,250
contemplating the next move

23
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,390
after North Korea tests its 6th

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,220
and most powerful bomb to date.”

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,680
I’m not sure which is more disturbing.

26
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,230
The fact that North Korea considers

27
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,040
a nuclear bomb a gift package,

28
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,510
this Fox News graphic,

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,780
or the fact that Shelley

30
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,020
recommended I watch Fox News.

31
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,000
But before I freak out,

32
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,009
you know, again,

33
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:10,230
that was Fox News.

34
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,439
They exaggerate sometimes.

35
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,409
Let me see what the failing New York Times

36
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,610
has to say.

37
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,770
“The nuclear blast on Sunday

38
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,170
is roughly six times more powerful

39
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,479
than the North’s test of September 2016,

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,929
and eight times larger

41
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,689
than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima

42
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,220
in 1945.”

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,539
Everything’s fine.

44
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:37,270
No freaking out here.

45
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,969
The detonation caused multiple landslides…

46
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,180
and a 6.3 earthquake...

47
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,940
They said...it was a hydrogen bomb.

48
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,260
"The test of a hydrogen bomb

49
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,729
designed to be mounted on our

50
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,509
intercontinental ballistic missile

51
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:01,319
was a perfect success."

52
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,590
North Korea also released several pictures

53
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,549
of Kim Jong-un standing around

54
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,289
the alleged nuclear device.

55
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:08,550
Aww, look.

56
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,830
He’s doing a Napoleon impersonation.

57
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,570
Except Kim’s not a little man.

58
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,100
Well, the US is warning North Korea

59
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,250
not to try any more funny business,

60
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,370
or else it risks total annihilation.

61
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,180
Or, in language North Korea understands,

62
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,390
the US is going to give them

63
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,050
an unlimited Amazon gift card.

64
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,520
So what does this have to do with China?

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,690
Well, US President Donald Trump

66
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,870
is losing his patience with China

67
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,190
for not having stopped Kim Jong-Un already.

68
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,100
Even though Xi Jinping tried to explain to
him

69
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,161
his relationship status with North Korea

70
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,090
is complicated.

71
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,820
President Trump tweeted that the US

72
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,580
is considering stopping all trade

73
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,350
with any country doing business

74
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,870
with North Korea.

75
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,180
Yes, any country,

76
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,700
whichever one might be doing business with
North Korea.

77
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,290
Let’s see, who could that be?

78
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,970
It’s China, he’s talking about China.

79
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,690
Ok, and also Russia.

80
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,460
But this isn’t Russia Uncensored.

81
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,640
Sorry, guys.

82
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,430
Now the US has already put sanctions

83
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,020
on Chinese companies with ties to North Korea.

84
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,450
But that’s not enough.

85
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,650
Now Trump also wants an oil embargo

86
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,120
on North Korea.

87
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,200
Which is heartbreaking news

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,730
for the Chinese North Korea Friendship Pipeline

89
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,370
that runs under this river.

90
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,680
This year North Korea will receive

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,260
an estimated 850,000 tons of crude oil—

92
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,820
almost entirely from China.

93
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Without oil,

94
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,040
North Korea’s military will be like

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,010
Popeye without spinach.

96
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,210
And that could make North Korea

97
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,230
unstable enough to collapse.

98
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,250
That’s why,

99
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,780
other than a 3-day embargo in 2003,

100
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,680
the Chinese regime has never cut

101
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,100
oil supplies to North Korea.

102
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
My favorite Chinese state-run media

103
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,290
the Global Times said back in April,

104
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,380
that if North Korea tests a 6th nuclear weapon,

105
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,600
“the Chinese society will be willing to

106
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,060
adopt severe restrictive measures

107
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,100
that have never been seen before,

108
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,230
such as restricting oil imports to the North.”

109
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,100
Well, North Korea did test

110
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,470
its 6th nuclear weapon on Sunday.

111
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,480
Global Times,

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,540
any thoughts?

113
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,600
“[China] should avoid resorting

114
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,260
to rash and extreme means

115
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,709
by imposing a full embargo on North Korea.”

116
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,930
I really can’t say I’m surprised

117
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,459
that the Global Times changed its mind.

118
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,150
The Chinese regime prefers to keep

119
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,540
the status quo,

120
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,870
even if the status quo is kind of scary.

121
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,870
Because you know what China

122
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,930
finds even scarier?

123
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,669
North Korea collapsing,

124
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,849
followed by millions of refugees

125
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,729
across its border.

126
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,389
But things may be reaching a tipping point.

127
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,990
The Chinese regime is facing pressure

128
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,540
from the Chinese people who are freaked out

129
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,389
about radioactive fallout from these tests,

130
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,060
let alone a nuclear war.

131
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,270
Under pressure from the public,

132
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,740
they’ve even set up a bunch of

133
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,360
new radiation monitoring sites

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
near the border.

135
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
And a few days after

136
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,699
this latest nuclear test,

137
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:00,139
the People’s Liberation Army began practicing

138
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,349
for a surprise North Korea attack.

139
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:04,900
Between pressure from the United States

140
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,599
and its own citizens,

141
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:10,620
Napoleon here might be facing his Waterloo.

142
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
In fact,

143
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,900
President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping

144
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,400
spoke on the phone about North Korea,

145
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,520
and according to Trump,

146
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,719
it was a very frank

147
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,870
and very strong phone call,

148
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,889
and also Xi is with Trump 100%.

149
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,180
Well that makes me feel better.

150
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,969
And even if that doesn’t work,

151
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,280
there’s another man out there

152
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,800
who can fix this complicated mess.

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,110
A mature, experienced diplomat

154
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,310
who’s friends with both Kim Jong-Un

155
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,190
and Donald Trump.

156
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,699
Dennis Rodman has offered to step in

157
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,599
and “straighten things out.”

158
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,349
Yes, the fate of the world

159
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,320
could rest with this guy.

160
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,000
I’m sure it’s all going to turn out

161
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:48,279
just great.

162
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,500
No freaking out here.

163
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,100
What do you think?

164
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,520
Leave your comments below.

165
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,620
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

166
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,500
Once again, I'm your host Chris Chappell.

167
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,100
See you next time.

168
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Well it might not be

169
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,090
a North Korean mystery gift package,

170
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,559
but if you want a real treat,

171
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,569
head over to China uncensored.tv

172
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,249
to see full half hour episodes

173
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:14,000
of China Uncensored for free.

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,259
And even though there’s a chance

175
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:16,319
they may bomb,

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,610
they’ll never explode on you.

177
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,849
Radiation burns are possible.
