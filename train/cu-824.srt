1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,600
Hey, Chris, are you ready to do the episode
about [bleep]?

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,420
Yeah, I’m ready to talk about [bleep].

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Did you…

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,810
…hear that?

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,070
Sorry guys, it’s my new Chinese camera.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,620
I accidentally switched the

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,980
auto-censor sensor on.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,060
Auto-censor sensor?

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,040
I wonder what it automatically censors.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,800
Tibet.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,840
Tiananmen.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
[bleep]

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,500
It’s taboo…

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,580
Forbidden…

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,700
Unspeakable in Chinese society…

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,340
Alan, turn it off!

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,840
Anyways, as I was saying,

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Falun Gong.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
The Chinese Communist Party's

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,999
most taboo subject.

21
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:50,449
How taboo is it?

22
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:51,930
Let me put it this way.

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,319
Chinese Internet police even censored a town
in Sweden

24
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:58,179
that happened to be named Falun.

25
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,179
That is unbelievable!

26
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,420
You know, I've spent years exposing

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,539
the Chinese Communist Party for five years.

28
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,729
So how come the Party

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,409
has never censored Christopher, Illinois?!

30
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,409
What makes Falun Gong

31
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,450
so much scarier than me?

32
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,049
I'm gonna find out.

33
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,420
Back in 1999,

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,420
former Chinese leader

35
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,549
and already-squished frogger Jiang Zemin

36
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,380
vowed to "eradicate Falun Gong

37
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,890
in 3 months."

38
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,939
But for a group of people

39
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,640
who seem to largely sit quietly,

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
stand quietly,

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
or march quietly,

42
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,539
this traditional Chinese meditation practice

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,189
has been noticeably hard to eradicate.

44
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,580
In fact, more than ten thousand Falun Gong
practitioners

45
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,920
held a massive parade in New York City

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,619
to celebrate the 25th anniversary

47
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,220
of when the practice was introduced

48
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,520
to the public.

49
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,820
A parade sounds harmless enough, right?

50
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,820
Wrong!

51
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,869
Otherwise, why would the Communist Party

52
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,690
spend more than a million dollars

53
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,469
to try to stop a much smaller Falun Gong parade

54
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:57,880
in Hong Kong?

55
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,420
Clearly, I needed to take a closer look at
this parade.

56
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,060
Well, that was fun.

57
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,620
But I still don't know

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,280
the secret to their success

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,660
in riling up the Chinese Communist Party.

60
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,840
Maybe a more direct approach is in order.

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,660
Tell me the secret to your success

62
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,700
in riling up the Chinese Communist Party.

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,660
Well, I believe it’s actually the compassion.

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,980
Compassion is a really feisty thing.

65
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,250
So you guys believe in truth, compassion…

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,140
and plaid, correct?

67
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,620
Truth, compassion, and tolerance.

68
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
Okay.

69
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,150
I don’t know if I can tolerate that outfit.

70
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,840
What’s your secret to riling up the Chinese
Communist Party?

71
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,900
Oi, crickey!

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,340
I really like your hat!

73
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,660
Thanks, mate!

74
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,020
What’s with the outfit?

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,200
It’s a national outfit from Poland.

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,500
We want to show the traditional outfits

77
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,099
from each country.

78
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,019
Are you sure there’s no fashion police?

79
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:23,239
So what happens when you tell Chinese people

80
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
that you practice Falun Gong?

81
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Actually, they’re quite surprised.

82
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,689
I have a limited engagement with the Chinese
people

83
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:32,239
in the mountain town of Colorado.

84
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,939
But when I come to the city,

85
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,900
and they see a Westerner,

86
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,230
especially wearing a shirt like this,

87
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,290
to discuss Falun Gong…

88
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,989
You do have another shirt.

89
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,459
I have a couple of shirts.

90
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,480
What happens when you tell a Chinese person

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,099
that you practice Falun Gong?

92
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,480
A lot of times, they’re scared.

93
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,930
They think this is a bad thing.

94
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,250
Their reactions are very strange.

95
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,980
What happens when you tell a Chinese person

96
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,510
that you practice Falun Gong?

97
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,790
Well it depends.

98
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,790
Sometimes,

99
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,569
when I’m in my university,

100
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,750
they’ll take photos or be really curious that

101
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,489
even a Westerner is practicing it,

102
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:09,310
because it’s not allowed in China.

103
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,760
So when they see it’s in Australia…

104
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,580
We have a club in Australia…

105
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,580
You’re Australian?

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,380
I didn’t realize…

107
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,410
Well, these practitioners are playing their
cards

108
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,570
pretty close to their chest.

109
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,570
Maybe what I need

110
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,200
is an outside perspective.

111
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,210
So what do you think about the Falun Gong
parade?

112
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,800
I think it’s really pretty.

113
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
I didn’t know what it was,

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,510
and I’m just glad I’m here to enjoy it.

115
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,540
Do you think they look a little dangerous
or subversive?

116
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,210
They don’t look dangerous…

117
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,890
Not to me!

118
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,790
Do you think there’s something a little

119
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,440
subversive or dangerous about these people?

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Oh, no…

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,620
Something subversive or dangerous about these
people?

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Not these people.

123
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,200
But the Communist Party was violent.

124
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,920
Did they pay you to say that?

125
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
No…

126
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,380
What do you think of Falun Gong?

127
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,100
Is good!

128
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,220
Always, is good!

129
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,790
Since the beginning

130
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,480
of the Communist Party's crackdown,

131
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,140
Falun Gong practitioners have refused to be
silent.

132
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,460
Which is different from being quiet.

133
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,080
Which they are.

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
They've spoken out about the thousands

135
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,640
known to have been tortured to death

136
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,960
in labor camps and prisons.

137
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,190
About the likely hundreds of thousands more

138
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,150
who have been killed for their organs.

139
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,450
And about how a certain former frogger

140
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,660
--uh, leader--

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,880
is responsible for these crimes.

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
Since they apparently can't silence Falun Gong,

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,500
the Chinese Communist Party tries to silence

144
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,130
people who talk about it.

145
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,620
After Wall Street Journal reporter Ian Johnson

146
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,470
won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage

147
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,620
of the persecution of Falun Gong,

148
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,550
he was banned from China.

149
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,020
He had to write a Communist-style self criticism

150
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,770
before he was allowed back in.

151
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,090
Reader’s Digest pulled a thriller

152
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,020
written by an Australian author

153
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,560
because the mother of one of the supporting
characters

154
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,370
practiced Falun Gong.

155
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,491
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party

156
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,970
was worried about a fictional character

157
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,290
practicing Falun Gong in the backstory

158
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,580
of a thriller set in Antarctica,

159
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,980
that wasn't even going to be published in
China.

160
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,270
It was just being printed in China.

161
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,700
Even a David Bowie concert in Hong Kong

162
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,360
was threatened because his drummer

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,620
practiced Falun Gong.

164
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,980
As far as I'm concerned,

165
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,720
all this censorship is just more proof

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,170
that there must be something more subversive

167
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,860
going on with Falun Gong.

168
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,190
What is the most subversive thing you’ve
ever done?

169
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,880
What do you mean by subversive?

170
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,230
What is the most subversive thing you’ve
ever done,

171
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,800
besides wearing this shirt?

172
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,370
Uh, let’s see…

173
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,480
That’s a tough one.

174
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,050
You have to choose between a lot of things?

175
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,740
I’m going through the list now, mentally.

176
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,910
What is the most subversive thing you’ve
ever done?

177
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,220
Against the Chinese Communist Party?

178
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah, sure.

179
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,680
Like, giving leaflets and telling the truth…

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,490
You know I got kicked out of the Waldorf Astoria once

181
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,920
for trying to interview Xi Jinping.

182
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,940
What is the most subversive thing you’ve
ever done?

183
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,240
I got banned for life from the Waldorf Astoria

184
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,280
for trying to interview Xi Jinping.

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,210
I went to Tiananmen Square and held a banner,

186
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,050
and got thrown into an underground basement
cell in Beijing.

187
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,880
So what’s the most subversive thing you’ve
ever done?

188
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,160
I went to Tiananmen Square.

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,550
Does everyone go to Tiananmen Square?

190
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,550
Not everyone.

191
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,870
But a lot of people, especially if you’re
in China.

192
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,380
They twisted my arms and kicked me into…

193
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,300
Not actually like, “he twisted my arm…”

194
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,410
but, “he twisted my arm!”

195
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,160
Yes, yes.

196
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,820
Well, I got banned from the Waldorf Astoria

197
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,400
for trying to interview Xi Jinping…

198
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,850
I’m doing a lot!

199
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,850
From New York…

200
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,160
But I’m making a difference!

201
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
You are!

202
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,790
You’re pushing buttons and making people
laugh,

203
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,140
and that’s awesome.

204
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,140
Thank you.

205
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
So what can I do

206
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,530
to get more on Beijing’s radar?

207
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,220
From the safety of New York?

208
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,080
Not that I’m concerned about my safety,

209
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,890
just travel budget and all…

210
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,190
If I stayed in New York, what could I do?

211
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,500
Doing interviews inside the embassy

212
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,389
and outside the embassy?

213
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,300
So what involved not going outside New York,

214
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,400
and not going to the Chinese embassy or consulate?

215
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,610
Well, I guess it’s the internet.

216
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,800
The internet is a way.

217
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,389
You’re a force on there, keep it up.

218
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,060
Yes, you are right!

219
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,579
Well, Im at the end of the parade,

220
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,800
which happens to pass right in front of

221
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,520
the Chinese consulate.

222
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,000
I never found out what makes Falun Gong

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
so subversive .

224
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,110
But at least I know I'm doing something important

225
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,190
right here in New York.

226
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,370
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

227
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,420
Once again, I'm your host, [bleep].

228
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,840
What was that? [bleep]

229
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,980
AM I being auto-censored?

230
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,960
[bleep]l!

231
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,260
I am being auto-censored!

232
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,460
I'm sticking it to the Communist Party!

233
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,820
Hey, thanks for figuring out

234
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,019
how to manually add Chris's name

235
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:35,230
to the auto-censor sensor.

236
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,220
Yeah, sure.

237
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,220
I was kind of surprised how happy he was

238
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,220
about getting censored.

239
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,680
Celebrities are weird.
