1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,560
China is preparing for war

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,400
While Xi Jinping tells troops to fall in line.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:16,400
And Taiwan and the US should be prepared.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,560
Welcome to China Uncensored, I’m Chris Chappell.\h

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,000
Chinese leader Xi Jinping is telling the\h
People’s Liberation Army to prepare for war.\h

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,520
Last week, Xi Jinping visited the PLA\h
Marine Base in Guangdong Province.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,280
And he told the troops “to devote their “minds\h
and energy” to “preparing for war,” to “maintain\h\h

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,400
a state of high alert,” and to remain “absolutely\h
loyal, absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable.”

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,480
To be fair, Xi Jinping often\h
tells the PLA to prepare for war.\h

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,880
Like back in May this year.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,200
And in January 2019.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,440
And in October 2018.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
And in August 2017.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,920
You get the picture.\h

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,880
And it makes sense. Xi Jinping spent a lot of\h
time and effort reorganizing the PLA and purging\h\h

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,640
all his enemies there. He didn’t do all that\h
so the PLA could be *unprepared* to go to war.\h

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,360
So Xi Jinping just telling soldiers to be prepared\h
for war isn’t necessarily very alarming by itself.\h\h

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
But there are also other reasons that people are\h
getting worried about a possible PLA attack.\h

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
The same day as Xi’s speech,\h
in the nearby city of Shenzhen,

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,520
officials “ordered all residents to prepare\h
emergency supplies in 72 categories,\h\h

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,480
such as enough food and water\h
for 72 hours and a fire blanket.”

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,080
In fact, China’s Emergency Management Ministry\h\h

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,800
and several municipal governments, like Beijing\h
and Tianjin, issued similar orders last month.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,640
So, is China gearing up for\h
war? And if so, against whom?

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,920
The most obvious target is Taiwan.\h\h

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,520
The Chinese Communist Party has been threatening\h
military action against Taiwan this entire year.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,120
From flying warplanes over Taiwan airspace...

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,480
to releasing video of China’s military\h
launching a simulated invasion of Taiwan.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,120
“In its annual work report this year, the\h
Chinese government removed the word ‘peaceful’\h\h

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
from long-standing references\h
to ‘reunification’ with Taiwan.”

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
Now if you’ve watched or listened to the\h
interview we did with Taiwan expert Ian Easton\h\h

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
on the China Unscripted podcast,\hyou’ll remember\h\h

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,480
that because of weather constraints,\h
there are really only two times a year\h\h

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,000
China could launch an invasion across the Taiwan\h
Strait—in the spring and in the early fall.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
Both those windows have passed this year.\h\h

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,520
So we’re not going to get a Chinese invasion\h
of Taiwan on our 2020 disaster bingo. Oh darn.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,520
The next window for invasion is in March\h
2021. Does Xi Jinping’s military rhetoric,\h\h

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,080
and the emergency rationing, mean\h
the PLA will invade next March?

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,160
Not necessarily. According to Taiwan’s defense\h
ministry, “China’s military still apparently lacks\h\h

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,840
the landing craft and logistical support needed\h
to carry out a full-scale sea and air invasion.”

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
And as much as the Chinese Communist\h
Party wants to conquer Taiwan,\h\h

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,720
losing a fight would be devastating to the image\h
of the Party within China and around the world.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,880
More likely, this is an attempt\h
by the Party to demoralize Taiwan\h\h

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,880
into thinking a war would be too costly and\h
bloody, so it might as well just surrender now.\h

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,880
Well, I doubt Taiwan will surrender.\h\h

46
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,480
But there’s another target audience\h
for Xi’s speech: the United States.\h

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
And I’ll tell you why after this short break.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,200
Welcome back. Chinese leader Xi Jinping\h
is trying to convince the United States\h\h

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,800
that it would be too much hassle to defend\h
Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
Xi Jinping has also been\h
making speeches recently about\h\h

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,320
the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,440
You probably know it as the Korean War.\h\h

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,840
It’s the only time that US and Chinese forces\h
have actually fought with troops on the ground.

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,960
And the fact that Xi is suddenly bringing this\h
up, isn’t just because of the Korean boy band BTS.

55
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,040
This year is the 70th anniversary of the Korean\h
War. And Xi Jinping and the other members of the\h\h

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,120
Politburo Standing Committee recently visited a\h
military museum where Xi talked about the war.

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,560
He said, “The victory in the War to Resist\h
U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was a victory of\h\h

58
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,598
justice, a victory of peace and a victory\h
of the people.” And a victory for honey.

59
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:54,960
Wow, I’m amazed we can get all these\h
direct soundbites from Xi Jinping.

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,320
He called it a “historic decision” and an effort\h
to “safeguard peace and resist aggression”.

61
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,040
Yes, after Communist North Korea invaded the\h
South, and the UN, backed mostly by US troops,\h\h

62
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,240
stepped in, Chinese forces had to resist American\h
aggression against the North Korean heroes.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,680
Now that isn’t exactly a new way\h
for China to frame the Korean War.\h\h

64
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
So why is Xi Jinping bringing\h
it up now, seven decades later?\h\h

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,360
It’s a not very subtle metaphor. See, today,\h
China is also resisting aggression from the US,\h\h

66
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,280
which is trying to interfere in\h
internal Chinese affairs, aka Taiwan.

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,480
So the message to the US is\h
clear—we’ve fought you before,\h\h

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,320
we’ll fight you again and it won’t\h
be pretty. So don’t back Taiwan.\h

69
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,400
Also, don’t read up on your Korean War\h
history, because then you’d learn how\h\h

70
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,120
US involvement actually succeeded in *saving*\h
South Korea from invasion by communist forces.

71
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,600
Anyway, China has been threatening\h
retaliation over US weapon deals with Taiwan.

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,520
And Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman\h\h

73
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,200
Zhao Lijian recently told Washington\h
to “Cut all ‘US-Taiwan military ties.’”

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,840
But there was another message hidden\h
in Xi’s recent speech to the PLA.\h\h

75
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,600
One that I bet he was hoping the rest of the\h
world wouldn’t pick up on. Did you catch it?

76
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,640
Here it is again: He told the troops “to devote\h
their “minds and energy” to “preparing for war,”\h\h

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,040
to “maintain a state of high alert,”\h
and to remain “absolutely loyal,\h\h

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,600
absolutely pure, and absolutely reliable.”

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,160
Sure, Xi Jinping wants you to focus on\h
the readiness and willingness of the\h\h

80
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,440
PLA to fight a war, so maybe you think twice\h
about whether it's even worth fighting China.\h\h

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,760
But he doesn’t want you to think too\h
much about the part where he says\h\h

82
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,480
the military needs to remain\h
absolutely loyal, pure and reliable.

83
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Like I said earlier, Xi Jinping\h
spent years purging the PLA.\h\h

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
High ranking generals have been jailed for life,

85
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
and many have been “suicided,” as they say.

86
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,560
That is not good for morale. So it’s possible\h\h

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,880
Xi Jinping doesn’t quite feel as in\h
control of the military as he’d like.\h

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,840
But you know what would\h
boost morale? Another purge.

89
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,040
And now it’s time for me to\h
answer a question from one of you,\h\h

90
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
who supports China Uncensored through\h
the crowdfunding website Patreon.

91
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,320
Arnold Keen says, “If the economy in China\h
continues to go south don't be surprised\h\h

92
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,280
that the CCP decides they need to start\h
a war with Taiwan to distract the people\h\h

93
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,080
from their problems. It seems to work most of\h
the time. The fact they may be starting a war\h\h

94
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,000
with 4 or 5 other nations is probably the only\h
thing currently stopping them. But the saying\h\h

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,320
'desperate times leads to desperate\h
measures'\h is still meaningful today.

96
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,920
Arnold, what are you talking about?!\h
China’s economy is going south? No.\h\h

97
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,960
China’s economy is great! Just ask the media!

98
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,160
China’s economy is surging!

99
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,400
It’s the envy of the world!

100
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
Because it’s the world’s only major growth engine.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Which is why US investors are\h
all over China’s bond market!

102
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,200
Unless of course you for some reason question\h
the official numbers coming out of China.\h\h

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,000
Which the New York Times and Bloomberg\h
obviously don’t, so why should you?

104
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
But you're absolutely right the Chinese\h
Communist Party tries its best to distract\h\h

105
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,360
its citizens from economic woes. Usually\h
with things like anti-Japanese sentiment.

106
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,520
But the problem with using a war to\h
do that is that the Party could lose.\h\h

107
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,920
Plus there’s the economic cost of war itself,\h\h

108
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,160
and the risk of countries around the\h
world finally wising up to the Party.

109
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,360
But don’t you worry about\h
the Chinese Communist Party.\h\h

110
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,480
There’s a reason why it spends more on\h
internal security forces than on its military.\h\h

111
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
Because if people inside China get a\h
little too rowdy over economic woes—why\h\h

112
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,800
send the tanks to Taiwan? It’s much easier\h
to just use them to crush your own people.

113
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
Thanks for your comment Arnold.

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
