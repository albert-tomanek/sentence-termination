00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,619
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:03,150
what’s a Pope got to do

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,200
to get some respect in China?

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,090
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,540
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,480
In China, if you want to be Catholic,

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,970
you have two options:

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,520
Belong to the official

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,910
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association,

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,700
which is under the supervision

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,060
of the atheist Communist Party—

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,779
or worship at an underground church,

13
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,750
where priests and even worshippers

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,600
can be arrested and persecuted.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,350
The Communist Party has never recognized

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,440
the Vatican’s authority over Catholicism
in China,

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,030
and vice versa.

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,940
And China’s 10 million Catholics

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,691
are caught in the middle.

20
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,700
The Vatican has made attempts in the past

21
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,140
to work out some of these issues.

22
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,720
Like back in 2007,

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,829
Pope Benedict the sixteenth said that

24
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,670
loyal Catholics could worship

25
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,969
in the state-backed churches.

26
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,329
But now Pope Francis is looking to make a
deal

27
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:59,969
with Chinese leaders on the most hotly contested
issue:

28
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,310
Who gets to appoint Chinese bishops.

29
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,360
I went to Washington DC to sit down with

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,040
human rights activist Benedict Rogers.

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,780
He work for \hChristian Solidarity Worldwide,

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,200
which works for freedom of religion

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,830
and belief for everyone.

34
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,860
Mr. Rogers, thank you for

35
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,450
joining us again today.

36
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,530
My pleasure, very great to be with you.

37
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,270
So, I'd like to talk a little bit about

38
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,960
the situation for Catholics inside China.

39
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,060
Please tell me about it.

40
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,400
Well, historically, ever since 1949

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,229
the Church has been essentially

42
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,439
divided between underground Catholics

43
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,979
who have remained faithful to Rome,

44
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,950
to the Pope, to the Vatican—

45
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,020
and an official Catholic church

46
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,280
that is under the control

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,060
of the Communist Party...

48
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,080
Well recently,

49
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,329
Pope Francis has been trying to strike a deal

50
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:52,490
with the Chinese Communist Party

51
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,860
which ties into all this.

52
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,750
Can you tell us a bit about that?

53
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,259
His goal is to try to unify the church in
China

54
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,259
and have the whole church

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,659
in communion with Rome.

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,659
The compromises that I think are being made,

57
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,399
and we'll have to wait and see the details

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,230
of the exact deal that they end up with,

59
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,230
but so far,

60
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm extremely concerned about

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
the way things are going.

62
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,309
We've seen courageous underground bishops

63
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:19,030
being asked to step down in favor

64
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,419
of Communist Party approved bishops.

65
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:23,459
Well, I don't know.

66
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,459
The state approved bishops

67
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,620
don't sound too bad to me.

68
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,790
I mean, of the seven Pope Francis looked at,

69
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,299
only two had mistresses

70
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,920
and only one was ex-communicated.

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,859
Well, maybe looking at the Church worldwide,

72
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,739
statistically, perhaps that's not such a bad
rate,

73
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,159
but no, it's very concerning the way things
are going.

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,029
Well, tell us a bit about your work

75
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:53,129
with Christian rights in China.

76
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,709
Well it's important to say that my work

77
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,519
is not just on Christian rights.

78
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,819
I work for freedom of religion or belief

79
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,519
as set out in Article 18

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,909
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
for everybody.

81
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:07,989
I work very actively with people of other
faiths:

82
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,909
Uighur Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists,

83
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:13,879
Falun Gong, and others.

84
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,969
But in terms of Christians,

85
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,450
we've certainly seen a severe increase

86
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,120
in repression in recent months.

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,900
We've seen the destruction of churches,

88
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,120
the destruction of crosses,

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,540
new regulations just introduced

90
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,379
controlling religious practice,

91
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,729
and I think that's one of the troubling things

92
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:32,599
about the Vatican's—not just the substance

93
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,760
of what the Vatican is doing,

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,849
but the timing of it—

95
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,449
to be striking a deal at the time

96
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,139
when actually regulations and physical repression

97
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,069
are intensifying,

98
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,129
seems very wrong to me.

99
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:47,299
What might this Vatican-China deal

100
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,499
mean for Taiwan?

101
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:51,019
Well, that's incredibly serious.

102
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,909
I find it very hard to imagine that Beijing

103
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,349
would accept a deal that didn't involve

104
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,099
changing diplomatic recognition

105
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,159
from Taiwan to Beijing,

106
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,370
and I think that would be devastating.

107
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,060
So if you were the Pope,

108
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,129
what would you do about

109
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,260
the Catholic situation in China?

110
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,379
I would be insisting on an arrangement

111
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,589
that has the church outside

112
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,739
the control of the government,

113
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,159
has the appointment to bishops

114
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,699
coming from the Pope alone,

115
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,490
and an arrangement that does not in any way

116
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,139
affect relations with Taiwan.

117
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,110
So, China has many beliefs and religions.

118
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,820
If I lived in China,

119
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,680
what religion should I choose

120
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
to not be persecuted?

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,599
I think you'd have to be of no religion

122
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,691
because even if you choose a religion

123
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:48,490
that is within the official structures,

124
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,939
even they have come under pressure in recent
years.

125
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,750
Official Protestants and I think Catholic
as well,

126
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,600
but certainly Protestant churches

127
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,630
have had crosses torn down in recent years.

128
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,889
So, you'd be best off as an atheist.

129
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,060
So what religion should I definitely not choose?

130
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,710
Well, again I think all of the religions

131
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,060
face varying degrees of persecution,

132
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,009
but it's clear that the one belief system

133
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,659
that seems to be target of most hatred

134
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:23,760
is Falun Gong.

135
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,129
So, if you want to be sure of

136
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,500
condemnation and persecution,

137
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,449
that would be the belief system you practice.

138
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,050
But, really if you're an underground Christian,

139
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,849
if you're Uighur Muslim or Tibetan Buddhist,

140
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,560
you're in for a hard time as well.

141
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,169
Thank you very much for joining us today.

142
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,420

But I also know you get hungry for food.

147
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,900
Well now, you can take care of both.
