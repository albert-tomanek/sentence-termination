00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,580
China has a new high tech breakthrough

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,860
Robot wives!

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,290
Is this the future of technology?

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,640
Or another dystopian nightmare.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,540
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,640
I’m Chris Chappell.

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,039
each time we publish a new episode.

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,890
China is trying to lead the world in tech.

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,000
And apparently that includes building robot
wives.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,540
This report from Chinese media Sohu is called

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,090
“a robot wife has been created,

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,510
so you don’t need to marry a real wife in
the future.”

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,540
It says Chinese scientists have created

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,870
realistic looking female robots

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,920
that can even do chores.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
Of course, like some reports about

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,720
breakthroughs in Chinese technology,

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,970
this might be a little premature.

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,760
Those robot wives look like they can barely
move,

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,640
so I’m not sure how good they’re going
to be

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,780
at unloading the dishwasher.

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,780
Which is the true test of a successful marriage.

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,180
Also this report doesn’t exactly say which
institution

27
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:10,470
or tech company is building robot wives.

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,210
But that last robot is called Jia Jia.

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,130
She—or it—was created by a team of scientists

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,549
at the University of Science and Technology
in China.

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,560
They call her a robot goddess.

32
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,760
“Have you had dinner?

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,619
Eat whatever you like and treat yourself better.”

34
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,259
Eat whatever I want and feel good about myself?!

35
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:38,259
Wow, she is the perfect woman!

36
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,409
And guess what?

37
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,210
According to the Daily Mail,

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,960
they programmed her to call them ‘lord.’

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,860
“Hello”

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,060
“Hello my lord, how are you?”

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,179
Ok, to be fair, like some things in the Daily
Mail,

42
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,819
that’s a little bit inaccurate.

43
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,770
She’s actually calling him her owner.

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,279
Much better.

45
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,829
But still, it’s incredible.

46
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,149
Because they’ve successfully made

47
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,729
a three dimensional female robot

48
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,560
as one dimensional as possible.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,220
Now Jia Jia is capable of matching

50
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,120
lip movements to voice,

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,080
and can recreate micro-expressions

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
that are super uncanny valley.

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,320
Still better looking than this.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,620
Yeah, I’m actually glad

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,220
I ain’t never had a friend like him.

56
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,260
Or a friend like this guy.

57
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,400
“A 31 year old software engineer in China

58
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,680
was tired of feeling pressure to get married

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,990
so he built his own robot bride.”

60
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,280
Now marrying a robot is not legal in China.

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,740
At least not yet.

62
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,150
But there’s a reason why there could eventually
be

63
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,650
a push for robot wives in China.

64
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,610
Because of something called the One Child
Policy.

65
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,610
For decades,

66
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,800
the Communist Party only let Chinese people

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,330
have one child, with some minor exceptions.

68
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,050
Since boys were preferred,

69
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,870
girls were sometimes aborted,

70
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,600
or killed after birth, or abandoned.

71
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,070
What that means today is this:

72
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,680
“In absolute numbers,

73
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
there are 33 million more men

74
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,880
than women in China today.”

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Now you can imagine the kind of social problems

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,980
that can cause.

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,710
And in the grand scheme of things,

78
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,410
maybe robot brides are a slightly less-bad
idea than say...

79
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,450
forcing Uighur women to marry Han Chinese
men.

80
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,280
Or sex trafficking women from Southeast Asia.

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,460
And North Korea.

82
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,620
But robotic companions are going to create

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,290
a whole slew of other problems for every country,

84
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,430
not just the authoritarian ones.

85
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,410
For instance, celebrity copyright.

86
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,350
In Hong Kong, Ricky Ma,

87
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,680
despite having no background in robotics,

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,650
spend 50 thousand dollars

89
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,210
to build a Scarlett Johansson robot.

90
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,170
“Mark One, how do you feel about Ricky?

91
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,930
I really love you,

92
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,950
because you is my creator.”

93
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,230
That’s disgusting.

94
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,340
I hate bad grammar.

95
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,860
Oh yeah, and the fact that

96
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,250
this is literally objectifying women.

97
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,250
Not to mention—

98
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,930
how would the real Scarlett Johansson feel
about this?

99
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,640
Because at the end of the day,

100
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,240
we know what these robot wives will be used
for.

101
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,000
As Quartz so delicately puts it,

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,660
“Ricky built the Mark One to be anatomically
correct.”

103
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,380
Yup.

104
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,350
And so the real question is,

105
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,390
as the New York Times asks,

106
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,100
can robots give consent?

107
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,020
I hate everything.

108
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,700
But seriously, this isn’t happening just
in China.

109
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,560
This Frenchwoman said she was engaged

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,350
to a 3D printed robot she designed herself,

111
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,680
telling media, “I’m really and only attracted
by the robots.”

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I guess you could say the French woman...

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,560
surrendered to the pressures of dating?

114
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,800
And this Japanese man married a hologram.

115
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,720
Kondo's bride is a 16-year-old

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,780
with saucer eyes and aquaremine pigtails,

117
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,050
but Kondo considers himself an ordinary married
man.

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,430
He told the Japan Times he considers himself

119
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,520
a sexual minority facing discrimination,

120
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,260
“It’s simply not right.

121
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,930
It’s as if you were trying to talk a gay
man into dating a woman,

122
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,370
or a lesbian into a relationship with a man.”

123
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,730
According to the New York Times,

124
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,770
these, “pioneers of human-android romance

125
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,660
now have a name,

126
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,340
‘digisexuals.’”

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,820
I will never look at Digimon the same way
again.

128
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,980
And it might not be too far off

129
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,960
that people can actually marry robots.

130
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,200
But the point is,

131
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,470
someday soon,

132
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,960
there could be a global market for robot wives.

133
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,550
And like any other emerging tech market,

134
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,310
China wants to be at the forefront.

135
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,310
Because of all the potential

136
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,740
for espionage and blackmail!

137
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,620
Unfortunately, that’s not a joke.

138
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,340
Already, people are worried that

139
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,650
even a Chinese made Metro line

140
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,800
could spy on people.

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,870
Imagine what hackers could do to

142
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,199
a made-in-China robot wife

143
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,230
that lives in your home.

144
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,520
As one China expert told the Epoch Times,

145
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,530
“If further developments of this product

146
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,610
include espionage functions,

147
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,110
such as eavesdropping and taking videos,

148
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,830
the user will have a live monitor in the residence.”

149
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,830
And I thought Alexa was creepy.

150
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,870
So if you’re worried about

151
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,860
Chinese telecom company Huawei

152
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,390
building your 5G network…

153
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,340
...it might not be too long before

154
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,930
we start seeing countries like the US

155
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,050
banning Chinese made robot wives

156
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,600
over national security concerns.

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,320
Yes.

158
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,150
The future is here.

159
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,080
And it is stupid.

160
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,840
On the plus side, at least there’s no way
technology

161
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,600
could actually replace real women.

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,260
Wait, what’s that Shelley?

163
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,320
They have artificial wombs now?!

164
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,760
Well, what do you think about China’s robot
wives?

165
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,790
And before you go,

166
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,400
now is the time when I answer a question

167
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,492
from a member of my loyal 50-Cent Army—

168
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:54,492
fans who support the show

169
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,340
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

170
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,800
Zhou Rui asks,

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,660
“Am I the only one that thinks it's odd

172
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,960
that the CCP believes

173
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,260
it is OK to debt trap countries

174
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
into "99 year leases"

175
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,990
of part of their country?

176
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,660
Why is this OK?

177
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
In Chinese history

178
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,610
this was part of their "Century of humiliation".

179
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,360
So is it OK to humiliate debtor countries

180
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,390
in the same way?

181
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,090
That’s actually a pretty deep question.

182
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,690
So the Century of Humiliation

183
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,490
is a period in Chinese history

184
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,680
when Chinese people felt

185
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,910
they were losing their place in the world

186
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,190
to encroaching foreign powers.

187
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,990
Many of those were Western powers,

188
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,680
but also Japan.

189
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,530
Tens of millions of Chinese people died from
war,

190
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,580
or drugs, or famine.

191
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,479
Basically, China suffered a lot because of
imperialism.

192
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:43,630
But today, the Century of Humiliation

193
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,290
is mainly brought up as a propaganda tool

194
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,330
by the Communist Party.

195
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,770
The goal is to get Chinese people

196
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,699
to redirect their anger at literally anything
else,

197
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,760
as long as it’s not the Communist Party.

198
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,090
Remember, the Communist Party

199
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,290
wasn’t even in power

200
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,770
during the Century of Humiliation.

201
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,259
But the Party is perfectly happy

202
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,010
to learn from all the tactics

203
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,490
used against China back then,

204
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,900
and use them today—

205
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,360
in its dealings with other countries.

206
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,650
Although they pay lip service

207
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,050
to standing with other countries

208
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,160
who are “victims of Western imperialism,”

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
in the end,

210
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the Chinese Communist Party

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,449
is going to do everything it can

212
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,030
to stay in power,

213
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,880
even if that means taking advantage of

214
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,000
these other nations along the way.

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,080
Thanks for your question Zhou Rui.

216
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
And if you’d like to hear

217
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,090

It’s less than the cost of your daily cup
of coffee.

221
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,500
