00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,159
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,509
Southeast Asian nations are pretty upset

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,840
about all China’s dam projects.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,800
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,550
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,250
And boy have I got a good dam story for you.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,360
Because we’re going to talk about

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,740
one of China’s megaprojects:

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,120
reshaping the entire geopolitical-

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,020
environmental-economic landscape

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,840
of a large chuck of Southeast Asia.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,500
Using a bunch of dams.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,239
Plus strong-arm politics.

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,820
This is the Mekong River.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,090
It’s called the Lancang River in China.

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,230
It starts in Tibet,

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,170
and flows down through Myanmar,

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,059
Laos, Thailand, Cambodia,

19
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:45,610
and finally Vietnam,

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,610
where it empties out

21
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,559
into the South China Sea.

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,000
Which means both ends of the river

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,569
have been Chinese territory

24
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:53,870
since ancient times.

25
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,240
That last part is a joke.

26
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,820
Except...kind of not.

27
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,550
The Chinese Communist Party feels that

28
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,940
it has the strongest right to control the
river.

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,150
Partly because China is the most upstream
country,

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,660
which gives it the terrain advantage.

31
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,970
And partly because China

32
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,290
is bigger and stronger

33
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,570
than those other five little countries combined.

34
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,690
It could beat ’em up with

35
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,870
one river tied behind its back.

36
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,070
China has already built 7 hydropower dams

37
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,390
like this one along the upper Mekong River.

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,990
It has plans to build 21 more.

39
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,310
People living downstream are concerned,

40
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,310
because dams upstream mess up

41
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,370
the entire river’s natural cycles.

42
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,310
And that affects the whole ecosystem.

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,730
The Mekong River is a huge economic resource

44
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,780
for the region.

45
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,530
It’s home to one of the world’s

46
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,250
most diverse fisheries,

47
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,250
second only to Brazil’s Amazon River.

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,530
Over 60 million people

49
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,520
in the lower Mekong River basin

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,320
rely on the river for food,

51
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,480
water, and transportation.

52
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,180
And China’s dams are causing

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,880
some serious dam problems.

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
For example,

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,180
in the summer of 2016,

56
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,820
Southeast Asia faced the worst drought

57
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,710
in a hundred years.

58
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,989
It had the biggest impact in Vietnam,

59
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,310
where it directly affected

60
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,400
half a million households,

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
causing rather serious problems,

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,599
like “a lack of drinking water,

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,849
food shortages,

64
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,359
and forced internal migration

65
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,180
to urban areas.”

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,989
Is this because of China’s dams upstream?

67
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,349
Well, if you ask Chinese state-run media,

68
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,230
the droughts were actually caused by

69
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,090
the climate cycle known as El Niño.

70
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,900
Which in English translates as “The Niño.”

71
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,590
In other words, The Niño did it,

72
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,310
and it was totally not China’s fault.

73
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,730
In fact, we should thank China.

74
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,489
Because after desperate requests from Vietnam,

75
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,219
China released a little bit of water

76
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,139
to alleviate that drought—

77
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,460
which, again, was definitely “due to

78
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,780
the prolonged effects of El Niño.”

79
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,260
But if you ask, say, any scientist—

80
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,159
they would tell you that Chinese dams

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,420
are at least partly to blame.

82
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,749
“When China began damming the Mekong

83
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:10,790
and its upstream tributaries in the early
1990s,

84
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,819
scientists predicted the kinds of droughts

85
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,840
we’re seeing today.”

86
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,349
Scientists predicted it,

87
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,420
the CCP ignored the data,

88
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,010
and went ahead with its dam projects anyway.

89
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,150
This kind of intentionally ignoring science

90
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,900
doesn’t exactly bode well for the regime

91
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,650
that claims it wants to be a world leader

92
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,459
in tackling climate change.

93
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,459
But anyway,

94
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,639
even before China started building dams,

95
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,810
there was a need to collectively manage

96
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,310
issues related to the Mekong River,

97
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,769
since it’s shared by so many countries.

98
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,669
They’ve come together in various forums

99
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,709
over the past 60 years.

100
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,140
And in 1995,

101
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
four of them established

102
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,489
the Mekong River Commission.

103
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,610
The Mekong River Commission

104
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,939
has been helpful,

105
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,969
though not ideal.

106
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,999
Partly because China

107
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,680
refused to participate.

108
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,169
Hey, I totally understand.

109
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,279
These meetings do not look exciting.

110
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:07,139
Worst way to spend an afternoon ever!

111
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,120
Except maybe that time I watched Battlefield
Earth.

112
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,930
But “boring meetings” is not

113
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,129
the reason China opted out.

114
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,269
It’s actually because The Chinese regime

115
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,250
didn’t like the rules,

116
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,769
and preferred to set up its own

117
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,900
Mekong River group

118
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,550
with its own rules.

119
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,770
In November 2015,

120
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,870
China set up the awkwardly-titled

121
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,419
Lancang-Mekong Cooperation framework—

122
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,560
which sounds even more boring.

123
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,479
But it’s actually about power.

124
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,220
It allows Beijing to sidestep

125
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,660
the Mekong River Commission’s regulation

126
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,120
that dam proposals need to be discussed

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,949
by all the member nations

128
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:46,020
before they can be built.

129
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,860
Basically, the Chinese regime wanted to make
sure

130
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,349
the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation framework

131
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,919
didn’t require actual cooperation.

132
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,669
At least not between all the nations.

133
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,849
See, even though all six nations are members,

134
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,600
China emphasises “bilateral comprehensive

135
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,879
strategic partnerships.”

136
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,020
That is, one-on-one partnerships,

137
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,250
where China is one of the ones.

138
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,320
It’s a classic CCP “divide and conquer”
strategy.

139
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,479
“China has dealt with Mekong countries

140
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,659
bilaterally so that these countries

141
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,390
are not able to unite and stand up to China

142
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,669
as a regional grouping.”

143
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,169
As another expert puts it,

144
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,360
“If Beijing manages to achieve control

145
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,870
of the Mekong’s development

146
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,569
it would quickly become a crucial artery

147
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,490
for China’s rise and exportation of influence.”

148
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,750
This is not surprising.

149
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,870
Remember Xi Jinping’s three and an half
hour speech

150
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,699
that cured insomnia at

151
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,250
the 19th Party Congress last October?

152
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,830
How he rambled on about how China

153
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,629
should have more international influence?

154
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,030
Well, in just the past two years,

155
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,729
China has set aside billions of dollars

156
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,580
to support 45 Mekong River projects

157
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,270
in these countries.

158
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,289
For example,

159
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,900
China is helping fund a series

160
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,050
of at least three dams in Laos.

161
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,000
The first one “directly ignored the recommendations

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,620
of the Strategic Environmental Assessment”

163
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,160
but Laos went ahead with it anyway.

164
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,169
Because now that Laos has

165
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,790
financial support from China,

166
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,780
it can now flat out ignore the concerns

167
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,680
from Cambodia and Vietnam.

168
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,030
But if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.

169
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,419
Because Cambodia is building its own dams.

170
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,620
Which, unfortunately,

171
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,570
come with their own dam problems.

172
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,840
They’re also paid for with Chinese money.

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,580
So the Chinese regime has built

174
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,789
its own Southeast Asia cooperation group,

175
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,879
and it then works with each member country

176
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,360
one by one,

177
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,259
and promises each of them economic development.

178
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,770
Individually, each project is fairly limited.

179
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,729
But combined, they have a major impact

180
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:53,770
on an entire ecosystem—

181
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,330
which includes a tiny part of China,

182
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,889
and huge parts of Myanmar,

183
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,430
Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

184
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,620
But don’t worry,

185
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,980
nothing could possibly go wrong.

186
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,140
What?

187
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,120
That was a different dam

188
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,349
