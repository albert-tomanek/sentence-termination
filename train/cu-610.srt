1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,110
The World Health Organization

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,299
declares the Coronavirus a pandemic

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,680
And Chinese people create a new language

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,740
to get around censorship.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,840
This is China Uncensored.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,300
I’m Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,430
Hey, ever wonder what the coronavirus feels
like?

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, let’s find out from a man who got
it in Wuhan, China,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,780
where the outbreak began.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,870
“It felt like I could only use half my lung
capacity,

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,850
and every breath that I took wasn't enough

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,120
and I just couldn't get enough air.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,559
Also, it sounded like I was breathing through
a paper bag,

14
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,839
and it sounded like there was just stuff in
my lungs

15
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,039
that just wouldn't go away.”

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,920
Well, now you know.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Good thing too,

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,000
because the coronavirus has finally been labeled
a pandemic

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,940
by the horribly corrupt World Health Organization.

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,920
Wait what is going on in that picture?!

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,749
Apparently it’s a statue that was originally
set up

22
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,269
for an upcoming festival that is now canceled

23
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,970
because of the coronavirus.

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,680
And now it’s public health art!

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,650
The coronavirus is now also spreading within
the United States.

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,081
People who have not traveled overseas or been
exposed t

27
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,500
o people who did travel have contracted the
coronavirus.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,700
As of recording, the death toll in the US
has risen to 30,

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,120
and the National Guard has been sent to New
York.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,060
You know, I really loved Escape from New York,

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,500
but I’d rather not live it.

32
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,260
Meanwhile, the NBA.

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,330
Just last summer, the NBA had been

34
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,230
looking forward to expanding its China partnerships.

35
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,870
Until of course the brouhaha over

36
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,810
Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s

37
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,080
support for the Hong Kong protests.

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,370
That...didn’t go well.

39
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,190
And now, the NBA has the coronavirus.

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,450
OK, more specifically,

41
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,650
Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert has the coronavirus.

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,190
And as a precaution,

43
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,550
the NBA has suspended its season until further
notice.

44
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,410
Meanwhile, the Chinese Basketball Association

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,569
has told Americans who play for the CBA

46
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:14,409
that they have to return to China to finish
out the season.

47
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,780
If they don’t, they could be banned for
life.

48
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,370
Don’t worry, I’m sure it’s totally safe.

49
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,090
But if these American basketball players do
return to China,

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,010
they’ll be put in quarantine for two weeks.

51
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,230
That’s because China is now quarantining
*all* international arrivals.

52
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,590
Yes, the country where the coronavirus began,

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,109
that said it was absolutely ridiculous when
other countries

54
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,609
began instituting travel bans and quarantining
travelers from China,

55
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:49,870
is now quarantining anyone who arrives in
China.

56
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,430
Mmmmm….I love the smell of hypocrisy in
the morning.

57
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,060
But maybe it’s not hypocrisy if the coronavirus
didn’t come from China!

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,389
Last week I told you about how the Chinese
Communist Party

59
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:06,090
is trying to blame the US for the coronavirus.

60
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,069
Well, this week...they’re still doing it.

61
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,790
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying
tweeted that

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,730
because the director of the US Centers for
Disease Control

63
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,650
said that some coronavirus cases had been
misdiagnosed as the flu...

64
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,180
that means we shouldn’t call it the Chinese
coronavirus.

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,291
And in case the implication that the coronavirus

66
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,739
may have started in the US

67
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,379
was too subtle for you,

68
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,709
here’s the other Foreign Ministry spokesperson.

69
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:37,500
Yes, he’s accusing the US army of possibly
bringing the coronavirus

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,620
to Wuhan in the first place.

71
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,890
Who needs the NBA when we can watch this for
entertainment?

72
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,900
29 people have died after a Chinese hotel

73
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,219
that was used to quarantine coronavirus patients
collapsed.

74
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:51,640
Why did the hotel collapse?

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,360
I’m not saying they built it badly...but
they built it badly.

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,909
It was not originally built as a hotel,

77
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,840
but was converted to one.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,310
And state-run media have reported that there

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,019
were multiple rounds of illegal building renovations.

80
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:07,859
And adding to the tragedy,

81
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,909
no one in the hotel had tested positive

82
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,829
for the coronavirus in the first place.

83
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:15,590
Chinese internet users are desperately trying
to preserve

84
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,919
an early account of how the Chinese Communist
Party

85
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,049
tried to silence doctors speaking out about
the coronavirus.

86
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,180
Censors have been deleting the story every
time it crops up.

87
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,039
But internet users have come up with some
clever ways of keeping it up.

88
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,710
Some have translated the story using emojis,
braille,

89
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,870
even an invented Martian language.

90
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,410
It was a style of internet chatting

91
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,570
that came from Taiwan around 2004.

92
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,340
Basically their version of l33t.

93
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,590
“The characters randomly combine, split,

94
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,210
and rebuild traditional Chinese characters,

95
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,050
Japanese characters, pinyin,

96
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,160
and sometimes English and kaomoji,

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,150
a mixture of symbols that conveys an emotion.”

98
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,690
Like Happy.

99
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,830
Although if I were in charge,

100
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,490
“happy” would be illustrated with this.

101
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,289
The downside to using the Martian language

102
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,030
is that now the Chinese Communist Party

103
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,780
will claim that Mars has been a part of Chinese
territory

104
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,090
since ancient times.

105
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,240
One of the biggest problems the US faces

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,659
in battling the coronavirus

107
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,699
is the fact that so much of our stuff is made
in China.

108
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,680
Most US generic drugs and a lot of medical
equipment,

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,870
including the type of masks that filter out
the virus,

110
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,220
are made there.

111
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,780
So the Trump administration is removing tariffs

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,229
on certain medical supplies from China.

113
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:33,940
You’d think the Chinese Communist Party

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,389
would be happy that Trump is reducing some
of his dreaded tariffs.

115
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:39,819
That could be a boost to the Chinese economy,

116
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,880
at a time when they really need it.

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,889
But no.

118
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,599
“Beijing threatened that it can impose pharmaceutical
export controls

119
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,900
after which America will be ‘plunged into
the mighty sea of coronavirus.’”

120
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,930
So...they *don’t* want America to buy made-in-China?

121
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,470
Good. Let’s start making medical supplies
in the US again.

122
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,020
Remember this next time you hear someone

123
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,290
talking about how we should work more with
China.

124
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,240
16 lawmakers affiliated with the GOP

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,770
Doctors Caucus of the US House of Representatives

126
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,960
are calling on the World Health organization
to recognize Taiwan.

127
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,699
In this press release, they said,

128
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,610
“The ongoing exclusion of Taiwan from the
WHO

129
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,720
during this epidemic has put people

130
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,310
in Taiwan, the PRC, and around the world

131
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,150
at greater risk while harming both the integrity

132
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,340
of the WHO and the security of member states.”

133
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,940
Sadly, the higher levels of the WHO are suffering

134
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,599
from a condition in which they can’t hear
anything

135
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,570
because their ears are stuffed full of Chinese
money.

136
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,740
It’s unfortunately a widespread illness.

137
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,949
Hong Kong protesters held a vigil for a young
student

138
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,150
who fell to his death during a protest in
November.

139
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,150
Needless to say,

140
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,030
“There was a heavy riot police presence
nearby.”

141
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,111
Wait a minute!

142
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,530
I know why Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie
Lam

143
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,150
has been so deaf to the protesters’ demands.

144
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,629
She has the same condition as the WHO leadership!

145
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,939
Her ears are too stuffed with Chinese money.

146
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,660
I really think we need to find a cure for
that one.

147
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,569
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators drafted
this resolution...

148
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,460
that basically says, because of China’s
human rights abuses,

149
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,479
including organ harvesting from prisoners
of conscience,

150
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,360
China shouldn’t get to host the 2022 Olympics.

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,550
And speaking of the Olympics,

152
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,110
the Court of Arbitration for Sport has criticized

153
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,990
a Chinese swimmer for a lack of remorse.

154
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,060
Chinese swimmer Sun Yang got an 8-year ban
from the Olympics

155
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,490
for a drug testing violation.

156
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,449
In a statement, the CAS said,

157
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:52,960
“It was striking that, in the course of
his testimony,

158
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,150
at no point did the athlete express any regret
as to his actions,

159
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,490
or indicate that, with the benefit of hindsight,

160
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,000
it might have been preferable for him to have
acted differently.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,099
Rather, as the proceedings unfolded,

162
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,510
he dug his heels in and, eventually,

163
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,099
sought to blame others for the manifest failings
that occurred.”

164
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,099
Really?

165
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,889
I can’t believe this guy would do that!

166
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,320
“You loser. I win, yeah?”

167
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,610
Well...he certainly is a dope.

168
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,610
And coming up next,

169
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,180
I’ll answer a question from a fan

170
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,289
who supports China Uncensored on Patreon.

171
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,120
But first, did you know YouTube has been

172
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,610
secretly unsubscribing people from the show?

173
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,190
Take a moment to make sure you’re still
subscribed.

174
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,450
And if you haven’t subscribed,

175
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,110
what are you waiting for?

176
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,250
And now for the question

177
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,080
from China Uncensored 50-Cent Army Member,

178
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,180
Robert W Eischen

179
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,440
“The Hong Kong protests were initially about

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,200
extradition to the mainland, correct?

181
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,750
Couldn't Taiwan and Hong Kong

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,690
just make an extradition treaty agreement

183
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,550
between each other and cut the mainland out
totally?”

184
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,450
Well, that’s a really good question.

185
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,790
So the whole extradition bill thing began

186
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,899
when a Hong Kong man allegedly

187
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,740
murdered his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan.

188
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,160
It was...pretty gruesome.

189
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,331
The problem was that since Hong Kong

190
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:19,889
is part of the People’s Republic of China,

191
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,550
and the People’s Republic of China

192
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,000
likes to pretend Taiwan isn’t a country,

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,880
Hong Kong could not have an extradition treaty
with Taiwan—

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,170
since Taiwan is a province of China, not a
country.

195
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,950
So the Hong Kong government used this murder
case

196
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,660
to “propose legislation that would allow
the city

197
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,420
to transfer criminal suspects to Taiwan

198
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,050
and other places with which it lacks an extradition
treaty—

199
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,660
including mainland China.”

200
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,610
And Hong Kongers felt that was just a Trojan
Horse.

201
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,940
The extradition bill wasn’t about this murder
case.

202
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,700
It was about sending political dissidents
to Mainland China

203
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,990
for a taste of justice with Chinese characteristics.

204
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,339
And the rest is history.

205
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,940
Thanks for your question Robert.

206
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,320
And thank you for watching.

207
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,089
Remember, YouTube has been demonetizing almost
all of our videos.

208
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,600
They’d have run us out of business if it
weren’t for support

209
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,670
from fans like you who contribute on the crowdfunding
website Patreon.
