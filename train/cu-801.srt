1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,630
America Has Taken a Stand

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,540
Against the Chinese Communist Party

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,850
The Senate passed two new bills

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,870
supporting Hong Kong protesters

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,980
But Hong Kong’s freedoms are still under
siege

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:18,840
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:20,439
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,480
Before we begin, remember,

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,429
YouTube is soft censoring China Uncensored.

10
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,679
All our Hong Kong episodes are instantly demonetized

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,479
and there’s really not a lot we can do about
it.

12
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:34,070
Which is why we rely on your support.

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,090
If you can,

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,600
contribute to the show on the crowdfunding
website Patreon.

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,410
We’ll give you some cool stuff depending
on your level of support.

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,880
It’s patreon.com/chinauncensored and the
link is below.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,260
So with that out of the way, good news on
Hong Kong!

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,480
Finally!

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,970
Over the past few decades, US officials,

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,510
both Democrats and Republicans,

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,530
really dropped the ball on China.

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,020
But now, miraculously,

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,809
Democrats and Republicans are working together.

24
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,170
And in real life, not an episode of the West
Wing.

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,530
What inspired both sides to reach across the
aisle?

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,560
A scrappy little region halfway around the
world,

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,380
standing up for freedom and democracy,

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,530
looking to America to stand with them.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,340
Wait, maybe this *is* an episode of the West
Wing.

30
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,359
No, the West Wing has better music.

31
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,080
This week, the US Senate unanimously passed

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,429
both the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act

33
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:35,039
and the PROTECT Hong Kong Act.

34
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,009
And again, unanimously means that all the
Democrats

35
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,119
and all the Republicans agreed on something!

36
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,899
“The Senate has just sent a resounding message

37
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,969
to the Chinese Communist Party and President
Xi

38
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,619
that the United States stands with the democratic
protesters in Hong Kong.”

39
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,539
“The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act is important legislation.

40
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:03,119
It is bipartisan legislation.

41
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,119
[...]

42
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,630
The people of Hong Kong are engaged in an
existential battle for liberty.”

43
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,820
Hey, that’s Democrat Chuck Schumer...

44
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,590
agreeing with Republican Ted Cruz!

45
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,680
In fact 13 US Senators,

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,310
both Democrats and Republicans,

47
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,850
used this opportunity to speak

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,910
in support of the Hong Kong protesters.

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,790
They also trashed the Chinese Communist Party

50
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,290
for its human rights abuses,

51
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,510
including putting the Uyghurs in concentration
camps,

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,810
crushing democracy activists,

53
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,650
and harvesting organs from Falun Gong practitioners.

54
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,570
That’s right, US Senators called out the
Chinese regime

55
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,010
for killing political prisoners for their
organs.

56
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,811
That is the number one thing that the Chinese
Communist Party

57
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,480
does not want people to talk about.

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,600
What is this strange thing I’m feeling?

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,640
Am I...proud...of the US Congress?

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,660
While I come to grips with this strange new
reality,

61
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,920
here’s Republican Senator Marco Rubio

62
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,250
on what the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act does.

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,120
“Its most important element is it requires
the secretary of state to annually certify

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,320
whether Hong Kong warrants being treated differently
than China.

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,410
If Hong Kong is no longer autonomous—

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,600
and that's the rationale for different treatment—

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,410
then they should no longer receive that treatment.”

68
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,800
For instance, all the tariffs Trump has hit
China

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,730
with would also apply to Hong Kong.

70
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,320
This bill also gives the US government the
ability

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,110
to sanction individuals who violate human
rights in Hong Kong

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,410
and deny them entry to the US.

73
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,580
Meanwhile, the PROTECT Hong Kong Act bans
US companies

74
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,000
from selling crowd control tools to Hong Kong
police—

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,840
things like tear gas, rubber bullets,

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,370
pepper spray, and water cannons.

77
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,040
No more Remington shotguns for this guy.

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,270
But these bills aren’t a done deal yet.

79
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,360
Both bills have been approved by the US House
of Representatives.

80
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,180
But they still need to be signed into law
by President Trump.

81
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,210
Now, this may surprise you,

82
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,810
but the Chinese Communist Party is not happy
about this.

83
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,880
“The aim of this (act) is to support those
extreme forces

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,100
who are seeking to oppose China and cause
chaos,

85
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,870
damage Hong Kong's prosperity

86
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,020
and stability and use sinister smearing of
the Hong Kong issue

87
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,920
to obstruct China's development.”

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,540
Yes, the US sure is smearing the perfectly
innocent

89
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,030
Hong Kong and Chinese governments.

90
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,310
Meanwhile state-run CCTV’s national evening
news program included

91
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,120
11 different segments criticizing the US

92
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,920
for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act.

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,620
Tell us how you really feel.

94
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,060
So, remember that former UK Consulate employee

95
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,940
who was detained in China?

96
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,210
Simon Cheng.

97
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,120
Yeah, the Chinese secret police tortured him.

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,740
Apparently the Chinese police were so sure

99
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,040
the UK was behind the protests in Hong Kong,

100
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,350
that they tortured him to get answers.

101
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,970
And get this.

102
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,270
They abducted him inside Hong Kong.

103
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,919
Here, at the West Kowloon train station.

104
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,830
It’s the terminal for the high speed train

105
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,270
that links Hong Kong to Mainland China.

106
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,310
It’s in Hong Kong.

107
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,530
But last year, the Hong Kong government

108
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,380
ceded part of it to Mainland Chinese authority.

109
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,270
And so that’s why Chinese secret police

110
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,890
were able to abduct a Hong Kong citizen there,

111
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,790
and then bring him to mainland China for torture.

112
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,780
And the secret police didn’t just torture
Simon Cheng.

113
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,340
They tried to turn him into a spy for China,

114
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,250
and then monitored him even after he was released
back into Hong Kong.

115
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,040
He’s now fled to another country.

116
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,070
Cheng also says that while he was in the Chinese
detention center,

117
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,540
he saw other Hong Kong protesters there.

118
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,610
And that the secret police told him

119
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,980
they had captured batches of Hong Kong protesters

120
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,480
and brought them to mainland China.

121
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,520
Which is pretty much everything that people
in Hong Kong

122
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,870
were afraid of in the first place.

123
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,050
Yeah, clearly Hong Kong people have no reason
to protest...

124
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,850
because it’s all the doings of the UK.

125
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,620
You evil mastermind!

126
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,900
Now it may surprise you,

127
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,100
but China denies Simon Cheng’s torture claim.

128
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220
“During [Simon Cheng’s] detention,

129
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,790
public security unit guaranteed all of his
rights

130
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,639
and interests according to law.

131
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,919
Zheng Wenjie also made a full confession about
his illegal actions.”

132
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,240
By the way, here’s a photo

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,180
of Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng
Shuang

134
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,240
to use on the dart board at your local pub.

135
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,210
Extra points if you hit him in the heart.

136
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,350
Just kidding.

137
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,210
He doesn’t have one.

138
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,750
The Epoch Times is one of the few remaining

139
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,001
Chinese-language newspapers in Hong Kong

140
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,530
that refuses to bow to the Chinese regime’s
censorship.

141
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,180
It was founded by Chinese dissidents,

142
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,010
including Falun Gong practitioners.

143
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,010
And the paper has been supportive of the Hong
Kong protesters.

144
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,699
So it wasn’t all that surprising

145
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,280
when a group of masked thugs wielding police
batons

146
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,610
broke into the Epoch Times’ printing press
in Hong Kong.

147
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,560
And then they lit the place on fire.

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,730
So, freedom of the press is doing great in
Hong Kong.

149
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,430
Hong Kong protesters often wear face masks
to hide their identities,

150
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,419
because they’re afraid the government will
go after them.

151
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,760
But on October 4,

152
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,630
the Hong Kong government went after them anyway.

153
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,590
They used emergency powers to ban people

154
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,150
from wearing masks at protests.

155
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,830
Not that it actually stopped people from wearing
masks.

156
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,200
It just made all the protesters into criminals.

157
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,669
But good news!

158
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,380
This week, a Hong Kong court

159
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,400
ruled the mask ban is unconstitutional.

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,580
And the government said they would stop enforcing
it.

161
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,100
But then bad news:

162
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,389
China’s National People’s Congress

163
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,860
said Hong Kong courts don’t have the power

164
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,100
to rule about what is and what isn’t constitutional,

165
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,740
since Hong Kong is part of China.

166
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,990
Which is a hint that China can just upend

167
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,259
Hong Kong’s entire legal system.

168
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,130
China’s National People’s Congress is
clearly oblivious

169
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,270
as to why people began protesting in the first
place.

170
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,620
That National People’s Congress!

171
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,320
You guys really are NPC’s.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,690
But this gives me hope that maybe someday
soon,

173
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,430
everyone in Hong Kong might join together

174
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,099
and fight their real enemy,

175
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,479
the Chinese Communist Party.

176
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,570
And that’s the latest from us on Hong Kong.

177
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,570

And as I mentioned,

180
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,620
YouTube demonetizes episodes like this,

181
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,250
because it considers “Hong Kong” to be

182
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,290
too controversial a subject for advertisers.

183
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,790
So as a thank you to fans who support the
show on Patreon,

184
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,290
I answer their questions at the end of some
of my episodes.

185
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,450
This question comes from...

186
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,450
Larry Breyer

187
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,960
“I hear comparisons between Tiananmen Square
massacre

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,270
and what could happen to Hong Kong.

189
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,360
I would like to remind people of one big difference.

190
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,410
Beijing was only Chinese people.

191
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,430
Hong Kong is an international city.

192
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,820
As long as many people from all over the world
visit Hong Kong,

193
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,430
would CCP dare risk murdering foreigners in
order to put down rebellion?

194
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,980
I wonder if the people of the world could
protect Hong Kong

195
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,710
by standing beside the protesters?”

196
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,890
Good question, Larry.

197
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,120
The Chinese Communist Party does not want
to murder foreigners.

198
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,040
Well, ok, maybe they do.

199
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,550
But they don’t want to get in trouble over
it.

200
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,350
When I was in Hong Kong in June,

201
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,890
I felt like police were careful not to aggravate
foreign reporters like me.

202
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,230
But then in October,

203
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,640
police shoved us around like it didn’t matter

204
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,980
how obviously foreign we looked.

205
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,490
Police have also arrested some foreigners
and have searched foreign tourists.

206
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,520
This is a big change in mentality in the police.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,250
But still, the Chinese Communist Party would
rather solve this

208
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,230
without having to hurt foreigners.

209
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,490
Especially Americans.

210
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,950
Because there’s already enough pressure
on them.

211
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,540
And it could mess up the US-China trade deal.

212
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,830
So more foreigners on the ground observing

213
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,270
what’s happening can definitely help.

214
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,250
But as the police get more aggressive,

215
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,010
it’s probably not going to stop them from
hurting Hongkongers.

216
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,540
And keep in mind that those foreigners

217
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,850
are still taking a risk by just being there.

218
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,741
Especially now that the police have promised
to use deadly force.

219
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,350
Thanks for your question, Larry.
