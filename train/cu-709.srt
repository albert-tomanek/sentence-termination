1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,840
Wow, ruthless!

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,020
Tell me about it!

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,640
Using fear to keep people in line.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,590
Well, with such a huge military.

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,179
And let's not forget how much is spent on
just keeping an eye on people.

6
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,549
Yeah, always some storm trooper watching you.

7
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:14,549
Yeah.

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,589
Ha, storm trooper.

9
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:17,119
That's kinda true.

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,470
I wonder if Luke Skywalker is going to be
the new bad guy.

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,429
Wait, Luke Skywalker?

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,089
Ohhhhhh.

13
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,670
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

14
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,500
I'm your rebel leader, Chris Chappell.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,520
Star Wars the Force Awakens comes out later
this month,

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
and it got me thinking.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,960
There are actually a lot of similarities between
the Empire that rules the Galaxy and the Communist

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,800
Party that rules China.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,120
Don't believe me?

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,610
Well here are 5 ways the Chinese Communist
Party is like the Galactic Empire.

21
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,230
Number 5

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,730
Killing the Jedi

23
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,150
In Star Wars, the first thing Emperor Palpatine
does to solidify his power is kill all the

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,520
Jedi.

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,150
Well, that's how the Chinese Communist Party
did it too.

26
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,390
No, not killing Jedi.

27
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,020
When the Communist Party came to power,

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,270
the first thing it did was orchestrate a massive
purge of what they called,

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,230
"the landlord class."

30
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,300
Landowners were beaten, tortured, often killed.

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,200
After that, they did the same to intellectuals.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,870
Then anyone labeled as a rightist

33
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,420
which was basically anyone who didn't agree
with the Party.

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,420
They also purged religious minorities,

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,090
like when they killed more than a million
Tibetans and tried to destroy their spiritual

36
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,370
culture.

37
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,420
The point is,

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,450
mass killings might be a good way to start
an empire,

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,130
but like in Star Wars,

40
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,729
it might comes back to bite you in the end.

41
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,030
Number 4

42
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,890
Ruling Through Fear

43
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,730
Speaking of killing, it's one thing to keep
the people you rule in fear.

44
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,830
"Fear will keep the local star systems in
line.

45
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,030
Fear of this battle station."

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,489
But it also helps to keep people in the actual
government in constant fear of their own lives.

47
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:21,500
"You have failed me for the last time Admiral."

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,170
"I shall assume full responsibility for losing
them and apologize to Lord Vader."

49
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,560
"Apology accepted Admiral."

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,500
In China, there are 55 types of crimes for
which a court can sentence you to death, including

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,129
corruption.

52
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,269
You can also be persecuted simply for being
a citizen with a dissenting view:

53
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,090
Or if state-run hospitals want to harvest
your organs.

54
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,849
Number 3
Totalitarian Rule Based on "Laws" and "Stability"

55
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,770
"In order to ensure our security and continuing
stability,

56
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:06,670
the Republic will be reorganized into the
first Galactic Empire."

57
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,010
And there's totally no consequences to the
Communist Party's obsession with stability.

58
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,239
Number 2

59
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,930
Artificial Floating Military Bases

60
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,930
The Death Star!

61
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,510
The greatest weapon ever conceived by man-slash-evil-Sith-Emperor.

62
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,519
Sure, it might masquerade as a harmless natural
object in space.

63
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,519
But...

64
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,069
"That's no moon.

65
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:30,620
It's a space station!"

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,680
Now in China,

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,040
building a Death Star would be a tall order

68
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,950
since they've never even sent a person to
the real moon.

69
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,400
But China does have plans to build its own
Very Large Floating Structures

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,609
yes, that's what they're officially called

71
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,599
in the South China Sea.

72
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,939
But unlike the Empire,

73
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,849
the Chinese Communist Party is completely
committed to peaceful development.

74
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:56,499
That's why their proposed structures would
be for peaceful things only,

75
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:02,519
like shipping, electricity generation, and
also tourism...somehow.

76
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,519
I mean, yeah,

77
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,409
the airplane runways would be long enough
to land bomber planes,

78
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,689
but that's surely just a coincidence.

79
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,689
And Number 1

80
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,749
The Illusion of Democracy

81
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,650
In Star Wars, Senator Palpatine claims to
support democracy.

82
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,239
"I love democracy.

83
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,599
I love the Republic."

84
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,139
But his true feelings are eventually revealed.

85
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,009
"I am the Senate."

86
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:32,480
In China, Mao Zedong talked often about how
China is a democracy.

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,590
A "New Democracy."

88
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,810
And it's true!

89
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,280
China has the National People's Congress.

90
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,240
It's a multi-party legislature and it works
great!

91
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,639
It works great because the outcome of every
vote is controlled by the Communist Party.

92
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,479
Kind of like when Emperor Palpatine promised
that the Galactic Empire would still be ruled

93
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,479
by the Senate…

94
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,300
"The power you give me,

95
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,300
I will lay down when this crisis has abated."

96
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,550
"Power!

97
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,050
Unlimited power!"

98
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,310
See?

99
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,560
Democracy.

100
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,120
Just like in Star Wars.

101
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,639
Well, those are 5 ways the Chinese Communist
Party is like the Galactic Empire.

102
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,729
And check out our video on Off the Great Wall:

103

Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

106
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:34,960
Once again I'm 

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,250
your host…

108
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,370
Mia Wijaya!

109
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,419
Grr…
