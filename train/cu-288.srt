1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,590
Carrie Lam says

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,090
things are great in Hong Kong

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,050
Trump challenges the World Bank on China

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,929
And good news, book burning is back!

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,800
That and more on this week’s China Uncensored.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,680
This is China Uncensored.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,260
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,250
This week’s China news headlines!

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,000
The Chinese Communist Party has lost Hong
Kong.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,120
I know, it’s a shock.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,320
Who knew massively oppressing people

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,210
would make them hate you?

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,351
Apparently, this was news to Hong Kong

14
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:37,510
Chief Executive Carrie Lam.

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,829
According to the Epoch Times,

16
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:41,399
Carrie Lam thought pro-Beijing politicians

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,570
would “definitely win” the recent

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,879
local election in Hong Kong.

19
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,670
They did not.

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,500
But even though the pro-Democracy side won
big,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,269
that has not stopped the protests.

22
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,859
This was Hong Kong this past Sunday.

23
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,050
“A sea of black as vast crowds of protesters

24
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,159
took to the streets of Hong Kong's financial
district on Sunday

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,800
in the biggest rallies since local elections
last month.

26
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,540
It was the first time since August that the
Civil Human Rights Front -

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,160
organizer of million-strong marches earlier
in the year

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,300
that paralyzed the Asian finance center -

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,970
had received authorities' permission for a
rally.

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,640
It estimated turnout of 800,000.”

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,780
Wow, 800,000 people.

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,620
But Carrie Lam was quick to respond

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,340
with hurricane-force spin.

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,600
The massive protests, she says,

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,330
are a sign that everything is fine.

36
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,460
“This reflects the freedoms that Hong Kong
people are enjoying.

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,470
So I hope that this phenomenon will go also
to abroad,

38
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,730
to show that Hong Kong is upholding

39
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,520
all the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,270
So all those accusations from various quarters

41
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,890
that we are eroding people’s freedoms are
unsubstantiated.”

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,590
Right?

43
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,290
Right?

44
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,700
Six months of continuous protests show

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,769
there’s absolutely nothing wrong in Hong
Kong.

46
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,709
Here’s another bad sign.

47
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,780
One of the protesters’ five demands

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,959
is an independent investigation into police
brutality.

49
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,989
The Hong Kong government refused.

50
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,350
They said, we don’t need

51
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,069
an independent investigation into the police.

52
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,999
We already have an organization to watch the
police:

53
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,409
the Independent Police Complaints Council,

54
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:34,599
or IPCC.

55
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,599
See?

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,870
It says independent,

57
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,670
right there in the name!

58
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,560
The only problem is that it can’t do its
job.

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,970
It can’t call witnesses.

60
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,569
It can’t make the police give up evidence.

61
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,739
In fact, it can’t even take complaints against
the police.

62
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,310
People have to submit complaints against the
police

63
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,590
*to the police,*

64
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,409
who then definitely pass those complaints
on to the IPCC.

65
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,779
A group of foreign experts was recruited to
make sure

66
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:07,370
the IPCC’s police investigation was objective.

67
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,560
Well, they just resigned.

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,010
“You can see that the expert panel,

69
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,609
the members of international expert panel

70
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:22,529
all resigned from IPCC,

71
00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:25,779
before the publication of interim report.

72
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:29,620
This is a very crucial act and you can see
that it's like

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,400
a vote of non-confidence to this report.”

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,459
But the fact that people can freely criticize
the report

75
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:40,659
is a sign that freedoms are doing fine in
Hong Kong...

76
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,659
right?

77
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,879
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Police have been
going on a PR binge.

78
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,549
Accusing people of spreading fake news.

79
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,450
Photographing hard-working riot police eating
in full gear on the street.

80
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,999
And duct taping a tear gas canister to the
wall

81
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,940
just like that banana art installation.

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,859
They really need to fire their new PR guy.

83
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,389
A Hong Kong democracy protester says

84
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,269
he was ambushed by masked Chinese men in Australia.

85
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,859
If only Australia had the kind of freedoms
Hong Kong does!

86
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,579
Meanwhile, Taiwan’s top diplomat said Taiwan
will help

87
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,109
if the Chinese military cracks down in Hong
Kong.

88
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,120
Sadly he did not mean Taiwan’s president
Tsai Ing-wen

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,370
would go full Rambo.

90
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,490
He meant that if people start fleeing from
Hong Kong,

91
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,550
“Taiwan is going to work with the international
community

92
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,139
to provide necessary assistance to those

93
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,590
who are displaced by the violence there.”

94
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,229
Wow, I can see why he’s the top diplomat.

95
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,610
That was very...diplomatic.

96
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,229
And boring.

97
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,310
Especially considering the new claims that

98
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,340
the Chinese Communist Party is meddling

99
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,889
in Taiwan’s election—

100
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,240
the presidential election

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,389
coming up on January 11, 2020.

102
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,870
A Chinese defector said two Hong Kong executives

103
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,810
with close ties to the Chinese military

104
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,020
were involved in manipulating Taiwan’s elections.

105
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,889
That manipulation included “a multipronged
effort

106
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,830
to finance pro-Beijing candidates,

107
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,590
buy off voters and sow disinformation

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,360
on television channels and on the internet.”

109
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,270
Sorry, Putin, you’re no longer

110
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,370
the world’s best election meddler.

111
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,850
The World Bank is an organization

112
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,240
that lends money at low interest rates

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,330
to help developing countries.

114
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,599
Apparently, that somehow also includes China.

115
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,699
Yes, China,

116
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,159
the world’s 2nd biggest economy,

117
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:39,050
the country that has so much cash to spare

118
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,560
that it lends hundreds of billions of dollars
to other countries

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
through its Belt and Road Initiative.

120
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,159
Well, President Donald Trump has called out

121
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,360
the World Bank for lending to China.

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,060
This was after the World Bank said it would
lend China

123
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,430
1 to 1.5 billion dollars in low interest loans

124
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,889
through June 2025.

125
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,150
The US government had objected to that plan,

126
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,400
but the World Bank went through with it anyway.

127
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,090
But get this—

128
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,590
this is actually a decrease in lending to
China.

129
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,590
In 2017, the World Bank

130
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,189
lent China 2.4 billion dollars.

131
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,289
Maybe they wouldn’t need so many loans

132
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,970
if they used more money to help people in
China

133
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,699
instead of propping up dictators around the
world,

134
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,000
but what do I know?

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,009
And when I said use more money to help people
in China,

136
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,510
I did not mean finance more human rights violations.

137
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,900
Just wanted to clear that up,

138
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,099
because China apparently tried to get the
World Bank

139
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,069
to fund surveillance in Xinjiang.

140
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,960
Xinjiang is the region where China has locked
up

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,340
more than a million ethnic Uighurs

142
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,380
and other minorities in concentration camps.

143
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,050
Look, I get it.

144
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,750
The Chinese Communist Party needs the cash.

145
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,880
Ethnic cleansing isn’t cheap.

146
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,300
Meanwhile, China’s Foreign Minister says

147
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
China is big, but nonthreatening,

148
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,349
like a panda.

149
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:04,819
I actually agree.

150
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,790
They are just like a panda.

151
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,790
This panda.

152
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,880
The foreign minister added that

153
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,889
“paranoia toward China is a highly dangerous
disease.”

154
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,560
Don’t worry.

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
The Communist Party has a treatment center

156
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,389
where they can cure your disease.

157
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,360
Recently I did an episode about how China
is planning

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,139
to weaponize rare earth metals to fight the
US.

159
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,009
Well, now the US Army is going to develop

160
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,949
their own rare earth plant.

161
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,760
“The move would mark the first financial
investment

162
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,409
by the U.S. military

163
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,750
into commercial-scale rare earths production

164
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,430
since World War Two’s Manhattan Project

165
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,270
built the first atomic bomb.”

166
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,000
I really don’t think that’s the result
China was going for.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,320
Democrats and Republicans once again agree!

168
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,830
This time—on a new defense bill that would
ban

169
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,969
Chinese made buses and railcars.

170
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,680
The idea is instead of giving that money

171
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,900
to Chinese state-owned corporations,

172
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,849
give that money to American companies

173
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,319
to build America’s buses and subways.

174
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,069
Also, American companies are probably a bit
less likely

175
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,819
to build a subway car that will spy on us.

176
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,340
It’s been a year since two Canadian citizens

177
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,069
were put in Chinese jail.

178
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,490
Their crime?

179
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,849
Being citizens of a country that arrested

180
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:29,229
a rich Chinese person for breaking the law.

181
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,750
Justice—with Chinese characteristics.

182
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,969
Well, after a year in jail,

183
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,960
there’s some really good news for the two
men.

184
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,370
They might actually get a trial!

185
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,180
Nothing like being jailed for a year without
trial.

186
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,670
Did I mention they haven’t been allowed

187
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,980
to speak to a lawyer or to their families?

188
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,470
Something to think about the next time you
visit China.

189
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,470
On the bright side,

190
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,540
the Candians haven’t been alone.

191
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,410
A new report by the Committee to protect Journalists

192
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,139
says China just beat out Turkey

193
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,550
as the top jailer of journalists.

194
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,480
Man, Xi Jinping is really winning all the
awards.

195
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,470
Library officials in China’s Gansu province

196
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,300
have started burning books

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,110
that are not politically correct.

198
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,200
That happened back in October

199
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,410
after the Ministry of Education ordered libraries

200
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,460
to get rid of inappropriate books.

201
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,460
Burning books.

202
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,800
Yes, the Chinese Communist Party

203
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,110
is really getting back to its roots.

204
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,660
Although honestly,

205
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,630
this new campaign really needs to step it
up.

206
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,389
They did it so much more efficiently in Mao
Zedong’s time.

207
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:36,240
But this story took a weird twist

208
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
when the book burning librarians got in trouble.

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,260
That’s because this story went viral

210
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,779
on Chinese social media this week.

211
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,990
And sparked a huge backlash.

212
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,990
Yeah!

213
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,680
Burn the books, but not in public, geez.

214
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,500
For years, Big tech companies like Microsoft,

215
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,800
Google, and Apple have been desperately trying

216
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,350
to get into the China market—

217
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,040
even going so far as doing research

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,529
with Chinese military Universities.

219
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,040
Well, too bad for them,

220
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,230
because China is banning foreign tech

221
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,139
in government and public offices.

222
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,660
Gosh, I really feel bad for these tech companies.

223
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,850
More debt trap diplomacy.

224
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,100
These are the Faroe Islands.

225
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,779
They’re pretty much autonomous,

226
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,600
but they are part of Denmark.

227
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,399
The Chinese Commumunist Party has made it
clear,

228
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,839
if the Faroe Islands wants a trade deal,

229
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,889
they had better accept Chinese telecom giant
Huawei.

230
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,170
Now the United States has been encouraging
everyone

231
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,329
to avoid Huawei since it’s closely linked
to the Chinese military

232
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,450
and is a huge national security concern.

233
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,529
But for places like the Faroe Islands,

234
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:42,209
Chinese money is a heck of a lot more appealing

235
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,360
than no money.

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,450
And Chinese money comes with Chinese

237
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,420
state-backed companies like Huawei.

238
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,050
And finally, 11 Chinese migrants tried to

239
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,510
smuggle themselves into the US

240
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,000
by hiding inside furniture and appliances.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,190
That’s right,

242
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,290
to sneak into America,

243
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,300
people are doing this…

244
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,520
And this.

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,529
America:

246
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,529
So great,

247
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:07,139
it’s worth hiding in a washing machine.

248
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,209
And that does it for this week’s China News
headlines.

249
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,280
What do you think?

250
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,870
Leave your comments below.

251
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,320
And as I’ve mentioned before,

252
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,640
YouTube demonetizes episodes like this,

253
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,620
because they’re too controversial a subject
for advertisers.

254
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,300
We would have been run out of business years
ago,

255
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,130
if it weren’t for fan support

256
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,410
through the crowd funding website Patreon.

257
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,040
So as a thank you to these fans,

258
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,339
I answer their questions

259
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,600
at the end of some of my episodes.

260
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,130
This question comes from...

261
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,130
Joe King.

262
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,420
“Will "Joker" face tattoos gain popularity

263
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,320
as this technology becomes more widespread?

264
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,560
Will China Uncensored offer

265
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
semi-permanent versions in the merch shop?

266
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,680
Wide, super wide, and super extremely wide
smile editions

267
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,260
would make a fun holiday gift idea..

268
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,690
and, no more mistimed family photos!

269
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,930
Ah, that’s in reference to a recent episode

270
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,980
about emotion recognition technology China
is pushing.

271
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,360
The idea is Chinese facial recognition

272
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,120
AI can predict if someone will commit a crime

273
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,320
based on their facial expressions.

274
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,050
So, would it work to have everyone in China

275
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,630
dress up like the Joker?

276
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,940
Unfortunately, no,

277
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,810
that wouldn’t throw off the emotion recognition
technology.

278
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,510
That’s because the emotion recognition technology

279
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,590
doesn’t work very well in the first place.

280
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,590
In other words,

281
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,029
I’m pretty sure the Chinese Communist Party

282
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:26,720
will continue to arrest anyone they want

283
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,680
for whatever reason they want.

284
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,620
And that’s the killing joke.

285
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,150
Thanks for your question.

286
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,910
