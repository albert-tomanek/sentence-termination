00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,970
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,470
looting and polluting is not the way!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,080
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,619
I'm your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:12,719
The Amazon!

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,200
Home to some of the richest biodiversity on
the planet.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,100
One in ten species in the world make their
home here.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,730
Pristine waters, lush forests, and...

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,360
Oh right. That.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,880
Yeah that's a Chinese oil exploration
rig.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,610
You see, China has just bought a chunk of
the Amazon rainforest

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,380
in Ecuador the size of nearly two New York
Cities.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,210
The deal was announced at the end of January.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,710
For just 80 million dollars,

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,890
a consortium of two Chinese state owned oil
companies

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,130
will get to poke around for oil in the pristine,
untouched Amazon.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,399
"Our world is in peril!

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,210
Gaia, the spirit of the Earth,

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,630
can no longer stand the terrible destruction
plaguing our planet."

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,969
But when your best option for preserving the
environment

21
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,270
is a superhero whose only weakness is getting
dirty...

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,960
"How do you like my pollution pod, Captain Planet?"

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,780
"Weak. Feel weak..."

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,659
Well, I guess we don't really need the rainforest,
do we?

25
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,650
What's that, Shelley?

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,380
Oh, it's critical to sustaining life on earth.

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,590
Anyhow, there are apparently more concerns
than just environmental.

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,180
Indigenous tribes living in the region

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,479
are also going to be affected by the intrusion
of Chinese oil production.

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,659
But not to worry,

31
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,080
because according to Ecuador's constitution,

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,750
the government must consult with local groups

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,950
before approving any environmental projects
like this.

34
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,150
And they did!

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,490
In fact they met with 360 community representatives,

36
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,590
according to this local news report.

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,800
"They threatened the people, saying

38
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,960
'If all of you don't accept,

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,229
the government will come with police and military

40
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,020
and they will remove you from this territory.'"

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,120
See?

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,350
Successful consultation.

43
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,310
I guess Ecuadorian officials have been

44
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,100
learning negotiation tactics from China.

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,349
Anyhow, this oil deal was just part of $7.5 billion worth

46
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,569
of new financing agreements between the two
countries.

47
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,000
And Ecuador already owes China billions.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,959
Since 2009, China has invested $11 billion
in Ecuador.

49
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:26,530
See this beautiful waterfall along the Coca River?

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,900
Won't be there for long,

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,780
thanks to the $2.2 billion hydroelectric
dam China is building.

52
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,550
It will provide enough power to light more
than a third of Ecuador.

53
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,379
It's also, however, built in an area prone
to earthquakes,

54
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,660
and sits next to the base of a volcano that
erupted as recently as...

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,140
last year.

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,940
And this is the problem:

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,300
It's tempting for a developing country like
Ecuador

58
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,660
to take money from the Chinese Communist Party
and its state-owned companies,

59
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,950
but it carries a prices.

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,390
Often times, deals with China also bring along
China's,

61
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,200
shall we say,

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,860
longstanding respect for worker safety.

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,280
They also bring steep interest rates,

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,519
and you can basically kiss the rights to your
natural resources goodbye for years.

65
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,300
China will get up to 90% of Ecuador's oil
shipments.

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,340
And a lot of that will go towards paying off
those loans.

67
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,260
Ecuador is like the young, bright-eyed college
student.

68
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:28,209
And China, the student loan lender.

69
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,849
It seemed like a good deal at the time!

70
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,720
Now, wait, aren't US companies also doing
the same thing?

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,909
Well, yes, actually.

72
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,970
For example, in 2011,

73
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,530
an Ecuadorian court ordered Chevron to pay
damages for

74
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,769
polluting the rainforest.

75
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:47,840
And now big oil has to pay for its crimes.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
Oh, nevermind.

77
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,900
Of course, a key difference is that Chevron
is a private company,

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,440
not state-owned like the Chinese ones.

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,500
And the US government allowed Chevron to be
sued in a US court.

80
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,970
In China, no court would allow its state-owned
companies to be sued.

81
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,110
But regardless, there should be a lesson here for Ecuador.

82
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,320
Don't let foreign oil giants destroy your
rainforest,

83
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,720
because that's kind of what happens when you
let them in.

84
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,930
So why would Ecuador go for this deal?

85
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,830
Money.

86
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,509
It needs the money.

87
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,489
And why would they work with China over, say,
the United States?

88
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,860
Because the Chinese regime lends money to
governments

89
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:39,339
that can't or won't do business with the West.

90
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,159
Despite problems with some private companies,

91
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,229
in general loans from Western countries come
with demands

92
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,180
for government transparency, freedom of the
press,

93
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,289
and at least some degree of environmental
protection.

94
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,719
The Communist Party of China, on the other
hand, makes no such demands.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,380
"'Cause greedy human beings

96
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,020
will always lend a hand

97
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,980
with the destruction of

98
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,100
this worthless jungle land."

99
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,760
Part of the reason Ecuador's economy has turned
to toxic sludge

100
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,250
is thanks to its socialist president, Rafael
Correa.

101
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,639
President Correa's father was a cocaine smuggler
imprisoned by the US.

102
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,379
Some experts believe he blamed the US for
his father's eventual suicide.

103
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,969
That could be why one of the first things
he did as president

104
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:35,069
was expel a critical US military base of operations
for the War on Drugs.

105
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:39,659
Then, in 2008, he decided that the billions
of dollars in debt

106
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,430
Ecuador owed to Western countries was "immoral
and illegitimate,"

107
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,730
and decided to stop paying.

108
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,960
Ecuador went into default.

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,439
And since this was 2008 during the global
financial crisis,

110
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,069
oil prices collapsed,

111
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,749
and the developed world wouldn't do business
with him.

112
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,029
So Ecuador turned to the Chinese regime for
money.

113
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,529
But this kind of deal may backfire for China
too.

114
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,719
In the CCP's relentless push for greater international
power,

115
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,659
they're pegging the Chinese economy on corrupt,
unstable regimes.

116
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,270
Not just Ecuador.

117
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,159
They've also loaned money to such clear winners
as

118
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,599
Yemen, Zimbabwe, and Syria.

119
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,399
China might not ever get this money back,

120
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,979
and that's money taken out of the pockets
of your average Chinese citizen.

121
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,740
As for the fate of the Amazon, well...

122
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,540
"The power is yours!"

123
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,210
Or maybe China's.

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
“威力屬於你們！”

125
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,769
So what do you think?

126
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,259
Is Ecuador making the right decision?
