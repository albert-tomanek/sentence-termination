1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:02,010
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,420
pollution solutions that will blow your mind.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,120
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,920
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,289
China has some of the worst pollution in the
world.

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,400
According to independent research group,

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,550
Berkeley Earth,

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,140
4,000 people a day die in China because of
air pollution.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,079
That’s about 17% of all deaths.

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,019
Not including having your organs harvested.

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,600
“It’s as if every man, woman and child
smoked 1.5 cigarettes

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
each hour."

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,470
Doesn’t help that China has a smoking problem
either.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,000
But the worst kind of pollution is this:

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,469
PM 2.5 particles.

16
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,199
Tiny little particles,

17
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,570
smaller than even individual particles of
pollen.

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,820
And you thought allergies were bad.

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,090
These PM 2.5 particles are mainly coming from
coal.

20
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,070
China burns almost as much coal

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,300
as the rest of the world combined.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,589
Yeah, even more than

23
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:04,680
Uncle Nicky’s Coal emporium and Fun House.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,340
So what’s being done to solve the problem?

25
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,300
Well, there are a lot of...um, brilliant...ideas.

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,550
And here are 10 of my favorites.

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,830
Number 10

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,830
Banning Stuff

29
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,270
Sure, the deadly air pollution caused by unregulated
factories

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,910
and unrestrained coal burning is bad.

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,620
But factories and coal plants make money!

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,100
So the government banned outdoor barbecuing instead.

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,090
That was back in 2013.

34
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,900
And obviously it didn’t work.

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,120
But if at first you don’t succeed,

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,590
try, try again!

37
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,930
Number 9

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,430
Vacuum it up!

39
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,110
A Dutch artist has worked with China to design
this:

40
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,720
The Smog Free Tower.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,790
It’s essentially a giant vacuum that sucks
in pollution

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,570
and turns it into jewelry!

43
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,200
Here, honey, I got you this ring made of smog

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,490
to symbolize how I feel about you.

45
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,610
Number 8

46
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,610
A drone will work, right?

47
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,960
I know what I want

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,120
in one of the most repressive societies on
the planet—

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,359
drones everywhere!

50
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:11,769
Circling in the air,

51
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,650
spraying chemicals that will freeze pollution

52
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,019
and allow it to fall gently to the ground.

53
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,159
And onto the faces of an unsuspecting populace.

54
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,510
Brilliant.

55
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,510
Number 7

56
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,060
Let’s try shutting down more things.

57
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,989
Cars and factories are some of the biggest
sources of pollution.

58
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:32,900
But getting rid of them would be way too heavy-handed.

59
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,640
Except when you want to look good internationally!

60
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,680
Like during the 2008 Beijing Olympics!

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,840
Or the military parade in 2015.

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,379
Or this year’s G20 Summit.

63
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:46,540
But once the spotlight is off,

64
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,700
things can get back to normal.

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,500
It’s like how you really only clean the
house

66
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,380
before you have guests over.

67
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,299
Number 6

68
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:57,700
Cover it up!

69
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,549
Former CCTV anchor Chai Jing

70
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,019
was inspired to make a documentary about pollution

71
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,050
after her daughter was born with a tumor.

72
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,170
The documentary went viral.

73
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,170
A week later,

74
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,090
authorities solved the problem.

75
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,200
No, not by cleaning up the pollution.

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,560
By banning her documentary.

77
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,359
And the 200 million Chinese citizens

78
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,030
who had already watched it by then

79
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,470
surely forgot what they’d seen.

80
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,090
Problem solved!

81
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:26,409
Number 5

82
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,269
No, literally, cover it up.

83
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,300
When the world’s on your case for spewing
out so much pollution

84
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,180
that it even reaches the United States,

85
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,079
Whaddya gonna do?

86
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,019
Stuff cotton balls into your air monitoring
equipment.

87
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,499
Because then, how will anyone know there’s
pollution, mwhaha.

88
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh yeah.

89
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,959
They have eyes.

90
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,189
Number 4

91
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,800
Turn on the sprinklers

92
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,980
No, not just any sprinklers.

93
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,769
Giant, giant ones!

94
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,920
Put them on top of skyscrapers.

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
It’s like how you’d spray water on a baseball
diamond

96
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,560
to keep the dust down.

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,639
This idea comes from Shaocai Yu,

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,090
a geoengineering researcher from Zhejiang

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,820
and North Carolina State universities.

100
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:13,360
Wow, his Photoshopping is even worse than
Chinese officials’!

101
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,709
Number 3

102
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,570
Conversion—it’s not just for infidels
anymore

103
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,070
If coal is the problem,

104
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,260
then converting it to natural gas

105
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,570
must be the solution!

106
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,510
Natural gas burns cleaner with less emissions.

107
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,730
Wow, do we have an actual idea here?

108
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,310
Well, before you get too excited,

109
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,450
there are a few problems.

110
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,450
One,

111
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,670
even though it won’t produce the same kind
of air pollution as coal,

112
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:47,840
natural gas can “release 36-108% more greenhouse
gases than coal.”

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,640
It also takes loads of water to convert.

114
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,390
So where should we build these?

115
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,540
Obviously in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia,

116
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,660
where there’s almost no more water left.

117
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,700
But you know, that was almost a real idea.

118
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,450
Maybe the next one will be as well.

119
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,020
Number 2

120
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,970
Space Lasers.

121
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,250
To reduce its reliance on dirty coal power,

122
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,160
China has drawn up plans to build a gigantic

123
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,740
solar-powered spacecraft.

124
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,970
It would convert solar energy into microwave
energy

125
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,250
that would then be shot down to the Earth
like a giant laser beam,

126
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,610
and then converted to electricity.

127
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,740
What could go wrong with giant space lasers?

128
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,400
And Number 1

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,950
Change your thinking!

130
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,050
Why all this negative talk about pollution?

131
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,390
You can’t solve it.

132
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,690
So change your perspective!

133
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,190
Party mouthpiece CCTV did.

134
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,690
In an article that’s now been removed from
the Internet,

135
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,890
a CCTV editor argued that pollution has many
benefits.

136
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,780
Didn’t stop there.

137
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,640
My favorite state-run media Global Times pointed
out

138
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,010
that smog even has practical military applications.

139
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,530
I mean, your enemy can’t blow you up if
they can’t see you!

140
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,260
Well, those were all pretty crazy.

141
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,900
And that just scratches the surface.

142
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,740
I didn’t even have time to get to the giant
floating jellyfish.

143
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,130
That one will have to wait for next week,

144
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,540
when I release part 2,

145
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,660
yet another 10 insane pollution solutions.

146
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,180
So what do you think of these?

147
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,600
And what’s your guess about the jellyfish?

148
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,940
Leave your comments below.

149
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,180
Thanks for watching this episode of China
Uncensored.

150
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,950
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell.

151
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,230
See you next time.
