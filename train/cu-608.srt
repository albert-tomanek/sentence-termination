00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,130
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,710
I’m Chris Chappell.

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,810
Remember when laser weapons were the domain

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,179
of stormtroopers and Death Stars?

5
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,470
Well, the future of military-grade lasers
has arrived

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,650
and it’s...a little scary.

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,259
In a test,

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,510
this laser weapon developed for the US military

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,400
shot down five drones.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,559
And check out this one:

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,770
a Tactical High Energy Laser code named THEL.

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,879
It can track, lock onto, and fire a laser

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,989
at an incoming missile or artillery shell

14
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,920
and shoot it down mid-flight.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,610
In fact, some laser weapons are so dangerous

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,969
they’ve been banned.

17
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,780
Both the US and China signed

18
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,820
the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,000
It bans the use of lasers

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,329
that can cause permanent blindness.

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,200
But... it seems that the Chinese military

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,750
just used a laser weapon on American pilots.

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,580
I mean, it’s been 20 years

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,539
since China signed that treaty.

25
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,539
Maybe they forgot.

26
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:14,570
And to be fair,

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,700
that was a long time ago.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,170
I mean, back in 1998,

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,820
we were watching Young Hercules,

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,630
while playing Pokemon and listening to Britney
Spears

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,400
and...oh my God I’m so old.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,790
What’s that, Shelley?

33
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,180
Oh right, lasers.

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,350
There have been about ten recent incidents

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,200
where Chinese military personnel

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
allegedly pointed high-powered lasers at US
planes

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,229
flying near a US military base.

38
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,910
It’s been happening in the African nation
of Djibouti—

39
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,659
where both the US and China have military
bases

40
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,020
within a few miles of each other.

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,869
In...Djibouti.

42
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,890
A DOD spokesperson said that in a recent incident,

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,939
two American cargo plane pilots

44
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,430
were injured by the Chinese lasers.

45
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,280
They are very serious incidents.

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,910
There have been two minor injuries.

47
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:17,200
This activity poses a threat to our airmen.

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,989
We have formally demarched the Chinese

49
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,650
and we have requested the Chinese

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,650
investigate these incidents.

51
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,650
The Chinese Foreign Ministry—

52
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,650
surprise, surprise—

53
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,650
denies everything.

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,110
Their spokesperson also demanded that reporters

55
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,530
“remind relevant people in the US

56
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,180
to pay attention to facts.”

57
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,140
Well the fact is that last year China

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,310
opened its first ever foreign military base

59
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,049
about a mile away from the US base in Djibouti,

60
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,190
on the horn of Africa.

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,720
And, according to the American general

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,910
that oversees US operations in Africa,

63
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,430
there goes the neighborhood.

64
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,109
U.S. Marine Corps General Thomas Waldhauser

65
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,650
diplomatically said there’s a lot of “learning”
and “growing”

66
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,850
going on because this is the first time ever

67
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,470
a “peer competitor” opened up shop

68
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,860
so close to an American base.

69
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
And that this poses some

70
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,600
“very significant operational security concerns.”

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,680
But whoever’s tagging planes with lasers

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,820
on the Horn of Africa is also putting pilots
at risk.

73
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,510
The Federal Aviation Administration last month
published

74
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,880
a warning to pilots to use extreme caution
in the area.

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,729
They said, “There have been multiple lazing
events

76
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,270
involving a high-power laser in the vicinity.”

77
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,180
“Lazing events”?

78
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,639
I thought lazing events looked more like this.

79
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,640
But according to the South China Morning Post,

80
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,180
“Chinese military observers say the lasers

81
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,000
may have been used to scare away birds.”

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,340
Oh, yeah.

83
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,269
I can see how a C-130 Hercules cargo plane

84
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,650
that weighs 30 tons and has a wingspan of
120 feet

85
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,120
could be mistaken for a flock of seagulls.

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,470
And of course there’s no way the Chinese
military

87
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,859
could be getting freakishly possessive

88
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:58,859
about the air space

89
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,540
around their naval base in Djibouti.

90
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,030
At least until the Chinese government

91
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,050
issues a statement calling the airspace

92
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,209
around their naval base in Djibouti

93
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,650
part of Chinese territory since ancient times.

94
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,650
For now, though,

95
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,400
it seems the Pentagon is leaving open

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,120
the possibility that some overzealous Chinese
personnel

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,209
might have been acting on their own—

98
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:21,190
and that it’s not actually a top-level

99
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,310
policy-driven territorial dispute.

100
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,440
But just in case,

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,850
learning to deflect laser blasts

102
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,680
might not be a bad idea.

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
So what do you think about allegations

104
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,300
of Chinese personnel shooting lasers at US
planes?

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,820
Leave your comments below.

106
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,280
Once again, I’m Chris Chappell.

107
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,320
See you next time.

108
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,160
Stay where you are!

109
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:45,370
Because I’m going to answer another fan
question.

110
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,650
This one comes from David Michael White.

111
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,830
He asks:

112
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,220
“Chris, what is your favorite piece of literature
from China?”

113
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,380
I actually love Chinese literature, so I'm a bit torn on what answer to give.

114
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,320
I'd say my favorite of the Four Classics is Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,720
But if you'd like something a little more modern,

116
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,080
I'd say The Three-Body Problem trilogy by Liu Cixin.

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,660
Some of the best science fiction I've ever read.

118
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,900
It ranks right up there with Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.

119
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,460
Thanks for the question.

120
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,580
As I mentioned on Wednesday,

121
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,880
at the end of each episode

122
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,200
I’m going to answer a question from a member

123
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:24,379
of our China Uncensored 50-Cent Army.

124
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,979
