1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,540
China wants Malaysia to pay $20 billion

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,900
For a new rail line

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,900
But Malaysia is fighting back.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,860
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,270
I’m Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,270
Malaysia.

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,900
A country that's truly...what's the word for
it?

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,960
"The soul of Asia,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,540
the essence of Asia,

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:34,580
it's truly Asia…

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,600
That’s it, truly Asia.

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,250
Talk about a songwriter reaching for the low-hanging
fruit.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,420
Not so for Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,800
He’s reaching for the sky.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Now 93 years old,

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,290
Mahathir holds the Guinness World Record

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,040
for being the world’s oldest Prime Minister.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,219
And that’s a record he’s likely to hold
onto for a while.

19
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,559
At least until our planet

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,620
is run by an immortal artificial intelligence.

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,189
On the plus side, I’ll have also been upgraded
by then.

22
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,060
But the real reason to keep an eye on this
93-year-old

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,369
is that he’s just dodged a bullet...

24
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,549
at least when it comes to China’s Belt and
Road.

25
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,130
The Belt and Road Initiative is the massive
infrastructure plan

26
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,529
to build trade corridors between China and
the rest of the world.

27
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,680
It’s also known as One Belt,

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,299
One Reason to Not Go into Debt.

29
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,670
That’s because it has been a convenient
way

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,999
for the Chinese regime to saddle some small
countries

31
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,979
with debt they can't pay back.

32
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,380
So in exchange,

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,149
these countries have to sign over

34
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,880
valuable resources or assets to China.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,179
The poster child for this is of course, Sri
Lanka.

36
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,549
When you can go from sun-kissed

37
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,979
to mountain mists in only four hours,

38
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,819
that’s so Sri Lanka.

39
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,399
When dolphins and whales swim around you all
year,

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,989
so you can visit them at any time?

41
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,789
That’s so Sri Lanka.

42
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,779
And when you take a giant Chinese loan

43
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:05,579
to build a deep water port,

44
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,619
can’t pay the loan back,

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,220
and then have to give the port to China on
a 99-year lease,

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,610
that’s so Sri Lanka.

47
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,030
The list of countries at risk

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,180
of falling into China's debt trap is long.

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,800
It includes places like Djibouti

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Kenya

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Pakistan.

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,330
And it looked like Malaysia, too…

53
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,000
But then came Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,700
After taking office in 2018,

55
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,140
he right away suspended 22 billion dollars
worth of

56
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,810
China-backed infrastructure deals.

57
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,670
He also scrapped three China-backed pipeline
projects

58
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,280
worth 3 billion dollars.

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,260
And there was also a railway project

60
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,760
called the East Coast Rail Link.

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,940
It was supposed to be built by

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,210
China Communications Construction Company—

63
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,980
for a price tag of nearly 20 billion dollars.

64
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,520
He scrapped that, too.

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,960
But he still wanted some of the infrastructure.

66
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,780
Just not at that price.

67
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,940
So he re-negotiated the price of the East
Coast Rail Link—

68
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,130
from $20 billion to down to only about $11
billion.

69
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,320
Because the “economics of the original deal

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,900
did not make financial sense.”

71
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,310
As Mahathir's office said in a statement,

72
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,740
“This reduction will surely benefit Malaysia

73
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,910
and lighten the burden on the country’s
financial position.”

74
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,780
Yeah, it’s a *bit* lighter of a burden now.

75
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,240
Like $9 billion dollars lighter.

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,540
I wonder if the same negotiating strategy

77
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,800
can be used for student loans.

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,710
Anyway, given Malaysia’s crushing debt load,

79
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,300
any breathing space is a sigh of relief.

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,380
A year ago,

81
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,480
everyone thought that Malaysia was around

82
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,600
$170 billion in debt.

83
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,340
But when Mahathir took office last year,

84
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,970
he discovered, nope!,

85
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,110
Malaysia was actually $250 billion in debt.

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,890
How did this happen?

87
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,890
A few months ago,

88
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,280
I spoke with investigative journalist Clare
Rewcastle Brown—

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,910
who exposed the previous government’s

90
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,980
massive 1MDB corruption scandal.

91
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,739
She says the previous prime Minister, Najib
Razak,

92
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:20,319
needed money to cover his tracks,

93
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,330
after he’d allegedly stolen around 700 million
dollars.

94
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,240
And there’s not a lot of guys you can go

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,400
to help you fill a 700 million dollar hole.

96
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,740
Except China.

97
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,349
“What happened, because of Najib’s financial
difficulty,

98
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,979
he nearly dropped his rich and independent
country

99
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,340
like a ripe plum into the lap of China

100
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,749
because he needed someone to secretly

101
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:51,780
bail out his debts on 1MDB.”

102
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,340
The Chinese Communist Party:

103
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,919
The guy you call when you need to bury a body.

104
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,569
Or 700 million dollars.

105
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,969
Najib is now accused of wide-scale corruption

106
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:03,389
that includes skimming billions of dollars

107
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,550
off China-backed projects.

108
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,340
Najib went to trial last week in the first
of

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,050
what is expected to be multiple trials.

110
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,389
He faces four counts of corruption.

111
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,069
Each one could land him in jail for up to
20 years.

112
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,960
And if he lives to see the end of it,

113
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,719
he could win the Guiness World Record

114
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:25,400
for the world’s oldest former Prime Minister
in jail.

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,120
Anyway, after Mahathir Mohamad

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,219
won the election against Najib in 2018,

117
00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:32,889
one of his first tasks was to be to pull Malaysia

118
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,120
back from the brink of a Chinese debt trap.

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,259
"He’s made it clear that he intends to revise

120
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,430
some of these deals that were made to bail
out Najib.

121
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,370
And Malaysia has been looking

122
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,940
very critically and openly and frankly

123
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,949
at the corrupt nature of these deals

124
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,430
and challenging Chinato back off

125
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,949
given these deals were clearly laced with
corruption."

126
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,499
It turns out, Najib had made a deal with China

127
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:07,719
that Malaysia would overpay for the East Coast
Rail Link,

128
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:11,559
and then China would secretly top up the cash
Najib stole.

129
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,749
Um, allegedly.

130
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,439
So Mahathir has begun to resolve this issue

131
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,379
by renegotiating the price of the project
with China.

132
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:21,320
But Mahathir is doing more than that.

133
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,780
He’s also taking his

134
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,190
“beware of bad Chinese deals” show on
the road.

135
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,130
On a recent visit to the Philippines,

136
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,819
he warned President Rodrigo Duterte to beware
of China's debt trap—

137
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,159
saying “the Philippines should

138
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,029
‘regulate or limit influences from China.’”

139
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,499
But Mahathir is also making some people nervous.

140
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,199
That is, some people connected to the Chinese
Communist Party.

141
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,930
Wang Yiwei, a professor at Renmin University
of China in Beijing,

142
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,490
worries that "it sets a bad example for other
projects,

143
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,379
that China can just lower the costs."

144
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,589
He says it could encourage other countries

145
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,749
to push China to cut prices on debt trap projects.

146
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:05,460
That would be terrible!

147
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,169
It would completely defeat the purpose of
a debt trap.

148
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,250
And Malaysia’s new attitude is even pushing

149
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,070
the Chinese regime to re-evaluate its own
actions.

150
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,759
“With pressures mounting at home and abroad,

151
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,309
Beijing has started to adjust its approach

152
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,339
to the Belt and Road Initiative —

153
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,189
trimming spending on projects and toning down
what it says.”

154
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,529
So the Communist Party has really got to tone
it down.

155
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,530
Or at least seem like they’re toning it
down.

156
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,219
So what do you think?

157
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,809
Could this be the beginning of the end for

158
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,279
some of the more worst Belt and Road debt
traps?

159
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,129
Leave your comments below.

160
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,129
And before I go,

161
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,860
now’s the time for me to answer a question
from one of you—

162
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,309
who supports China Uncensored

163
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,619
through the crowdfunding website Patreon.

164
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,180
Steve Wilson asks,

165
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,590
“Chris, with your education in music composition,

166
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,930
do you have anything to do with the music

167
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,319
that's played with China Uncensored videos?”

168
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,949
Good question, Steve.

169
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:02,369
I do have a Masters degree from NYU

170
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,469
in Classical Music Composition.

171
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,419
But the main thing that’s done for me is...

172
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,610
get me to move to New York,

173
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,289
where I ended up having the opportunity

174
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,189
to create China Uncensored.

175
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,620
I didn’t personally create the awesome Chinese
music

176
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,539
that we use in the episodes.

177
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,129
They were created by a friend of mine,

178
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,649
who’s a professional music composer and
audio engineer.

179

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:26,479
that belong to China Uncensored.

so you can listen to them anytime.

186
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,781
So while I didn’t directly create

187
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,930
the music using my Masters Degree,

188
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,250
I do have the knowledge to appreciate

189
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,760
all the work that went into them.

190
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,140
