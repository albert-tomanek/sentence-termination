1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,680
Joining me in the studio today:
He reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,300
[Lapses into gibberish]

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,440
Good start.
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,800
Coherency!

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,320
And the bounciest man on the internet — Matt Gray!

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,880
Hello YouTube.

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,060
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it.

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,460
Every fact they get right gets a point and a ding [DING],

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,840
and the special prize for particularly good answers,
which is...

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,320
Today's article is:
the flitch of bacon custom.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,320
[Laughter]

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,340
Oh yeah! Good luck with this one, guys.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,840
Tell me that's not a person.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,820
Tell me that's not a ceremonial position
in the House — in Parliament.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,540
The Black Rod! The Flitch of Bacon Custom!

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,780
Oh, excuse me a second... got a flitch of bacon.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,620
The flitch of bacon...

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,620
Is it the custom of the flitch of bacon?

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,560
TOM: Yes it is.

21
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,180
Yeah. Is a flitch an amount, or cut, or volume of bacon?

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,180
Yes! Have a point. [DING]

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,480
A unit of bacon measure.

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,820
It's a fairly thick slab.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,740
Right...

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,100
It's basically what you cut up
to make thin rashers of bacon.

27
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,860
CHRIS: Right!

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,320
Okay. So we're actually talking
proper bacon, and a size of.

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,280
TOM: Yes.

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,900
Is this something like Fish Slapping Dance?

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,680
ALL: Ohh!

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,240
With a side o' bacon...

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,220
Bacon beating!

34
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,780
Brannan, if you'd care to mime with me...

35
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,620
GARY: Go on.

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,360
Comme ça?

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,640
Entire pig.
Boom! Into the Thames.

38
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,260
Well actually, an entire pig would go, 'OEEEK!'
as it comes through there.

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,940
'Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist —'

40
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,720
BOOM!

41
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,420
Pigs do fly!

42
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,460
They do if you stick a jet engine on the top of 'em.

43
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,480
Science!
[Laughter]

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,640
'An experiment was carried out,
attaching a small jet engine to —'

45
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,140
I think that oversteps the boundaries
from technical mirthery to animal cruelty.

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
CHRIS: Pig murder.

47
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,720
Where is the boundary there?

48
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,920
I think it's the bit where you
strapped a jet engine to a pig.

49
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,500
To be fair, we could use a dead pig.

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,900
Just to test the concept.

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
Wait, wait, wait.

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,020
Heat off jet engine — delicious, delicious bacon!

53
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm thinking, yeah, we wrap the outside of the pig

54
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,140
in some fuel that isn't as noxious as jet fuel,

55
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,520
so that when it inevitably crashes...

56
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,820
Boomf! Instant bacon.

57
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,640
Wait, crackling as well?

58
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,800
CHRIS: Instant barbecue, yeah.

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,640
GARY: The heat you get round the edge
of that'll sort the skin out!

60
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,120
GARY and MATT: Ohhh.

61
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,300
We just need to sneak onto a runway at Heathrow,

62
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,960
with, I assume, like, a garden fork with a pig on the end,

63
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
and we need a military jet with an afterburner.

64
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,640
I don't think we really need an afterburner...

65
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,280
We just need any kind of burner.

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,360
A jet engine probably produces
enough heat without an afterburner.

67
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,980
Eh, I'm going for spectacle, to be honest.

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,040
The flitch of bacon custom, gentlemen.

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, we're talking Ye Olde, aren't we.

70
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,860
Um... how Ye Olde?

71
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
Medieval?

72
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,460
14th, 15th century?

73
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,720
Yeah, I'll give you that. [DING]

74
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,600
It can be traced back to at least the 14th century,
survived until about the 18th. Have a point.

75
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,140
Is it in this country?

76
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,260
TOM: Yes. Very much so.

77
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm going to say it's one of the wackier parts
of this fine nation, am I right?

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,500
Yes.

79
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,260
Are we talking southern, the kind of place
where they throw cheese down a hill and chase it,

80
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,020
when, to be honest, you can go to
any old shop and find still cheese?

81
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,700
It's not quite that violent.

82
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,160
The thrill of the hunt, old man!
[Laughter]

83
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460
It's f***ing cheese!

84
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,540
Who wants an Edam that doesn't fight back?

85
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,320
I mean, there's someone out there,
bless you in Gloucestershire...

86
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,760
It is in Gloucestershire, isn't it?

87
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,060
It is in Gloucestershire, the cheese-rolling.

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,980
The cheese-rolling. Someone out there has
f***ed their ankle and goes into hospital,

89
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,440
and years later: 'How did you break your ankle, Daddy?'

90
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,820
'Well, I was chasing a giant Edam...' or whatever it is.

91
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,020
The Gloucestershire cheese-rolling,
for anyone who doesn't know,

92
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,760
is an event every spring in Gloucestershire

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,360
where they get a lot of people at the top
of a hill, chuck a roll of cheese down,

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,300
and then everyone just kind of rag-dolls after it.

95
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,000
They say you're meant to run down the hill,
after about ten seconds...

96
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,260
It's less of a run... it's more of a
windmill-cum-flailing, isn't it.

97
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,140
TOM: Yeah.

98
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,260
Who... who wants a placid, tasteless cheese,

99
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,840
when you can have one that's run wild
and free and developed true taste?

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,160
Do you do that all the time then?
Do you just go to a supermarket,

101
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,660
get a Müller Crunch Corner and whang it
down a hill because it tastes better?

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,080
It's how you mature them.

103
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,480
CHRIS: Absolutely!
[Laughter]

104
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,660
By the way, the cheese-rolling thing,
for the last few years...

105
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,440
can you tell me why it's not quite been
as safe as it might have been?

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,160
Er... the land mines.

107
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,020
Yeah, just rolling land mines down.

108
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,540
GARY: There was a mix-up.

109
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,820
CHRIS: Due to cheese shortages.

110
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,940
Chutney explosions.

111
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,420
[Explosion sounds]

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,700
Was it still in the cow?

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,200
The answer is that it was official until about 2010.

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,520
Then it got banned on grounds for health and safety,
so people just turn up and do it anyway.

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,380
CHRIS: Wahey!

116
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,700
...only without as much medical support.

117
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,900
Oh s***!

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Good on ya, Gloucestershians!

119
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,380
A long time ago, you asked whether it was down south.

120
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,020
And... well, sort of.

121
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,440
Is it bottom left? Bottom right?

122
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,540
There's references to it in Essex...

123
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,280
But there's also references to it
in Staffordshire, up near Burton-on-Trent.

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,100
So it's all in the South.

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,400
Thank you, Yorkshireman. Okay, yes.
By Yorkshire standards, it's in the South.

126
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,740
The South... where they drink beer wrong
and the tea tastes funny.

127
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,140
Is it that certain local yeomen of certain standing

128
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,100
must donate X much to the local lord

129
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,640
from the first cut of bacon of the year or...

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,100
That's what I was going to go with.

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,920
No, it's bacon that is given to someone.

132
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,820
And to be honest, there's only one person at this table
who would be eligible for it right now.

133
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,780
Married man?

134
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,480
Married man and his partner, yes.

135
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,580
Hello!

136
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,780
TOM: Have a point. [DING]

137
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,020
He did say you've got to be virtuous as well, mate.

138
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,360
[Laughter]
Hey, hey, hey, now...

139
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,140
It's given a year and a day after the wedding...

140
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,020
GARY: Cool.

141
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,220
To a man and his wife, because this is
ancient times and it was a man and *his* wife...

142
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,960
GARY: Indeed, yes, yes...

143
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,920
...who can attest to something, after a year and a day.

144
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,560
That they've not 'done it'.

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,660
That they've done it every day!

146
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,800
That's grounds for annulment, not a celebration, Gary.

147
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,200
TOM: You're closer...

148
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,520
Without going over.

149
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,980
MATT: They will produce children.

150
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,820
It's something to do with the marriage.
It's not to do with anything else.

151
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,800
It's something they feel about the marriage.

152
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,340
Divorce?

153
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,060
No, quite the opposite.

154
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,680
You get your marriage upgraded to a supermarriage.

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
That's all I can think of!

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,740
It kind of already is, at this point.

157
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,500
You would do it again.
You would recommend it to a friend.

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,120
You redo your vows!

159
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to give Gary the point. [DING]

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
That you don't regret it. That you have
never regretted it in that year and a day.

161
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,540
If you can testify that you —
I'm not going to ask you that question, Gary...

162
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,420
but if you can testify that you have never —

163
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,860
Well, put it this way:
I am due me some bacon!

164
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,700
[Laughter]

165
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,200
And the other thing is, it's going to get to day 364:

166
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,460
'Yeah, it's been pretty poor, but we want
this bacon, don't we love?'  'Yeah.'

167
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,400
'But there is a bit of bacon on the way,
so how about we just...'

168
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,160
I think we can land the second year
on the back of the bacon.

169
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,120
GARY: Yeah.

170
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,360
The flitch of bacon was actually referred to
in a very famous book.

171
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,200
Chaucer.

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,020
Yeah, absolutely right. Referred to in Chaucer. [DING]

173
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,020
'...in a way that makes clear the reference
would already be well known to the reader.'

174
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,900
CHRIS: Ah, okay.
TOM: So this is pretty widespread.

175
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,880
Did he do a look down the camera and go,
'Y'know what I mean?'

176
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,700
It's in the Wife of Bath's prologue.

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,180
GARY: Is that the one where the nun farts on them?

178
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,140
Oh blimey, right. So he probably did
look down the camera and go,

179
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,480
'If you know what I mean!'

180
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,680
'The bacon was nat fet for hem, I trowe,
That som men han in Essex at Dunmowe.'

181
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,020
Which is the place that...

182
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,380
TOM: I'm mispronouncing that,
obviously, because Chaucer.

183
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,240
Good effort, old boy. Good effort.

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,760
You probably did better than we did.

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,420
I'd like to point out that I know nothing about Chaucer.

186
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,280
I just know, that's an old book,
and whenever I say 'Chaucer' I get it right.

187
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,020
[Laughter]
Yeah. Point, by the way.

188
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,700
CHRIS: Chaucer — point!

189
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,760
'And thannen he gaven to him a pointe!'

190
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,140
'And thereof pronounced a ding.'

191
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,340
Ding!

192
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,020
'A ding from table woode!'

193
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,300
[Laughter]

194
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,400
'And Biscuits of Mysterie, for foode.'

195
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,500
We got that.

196
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,860
Right. Flitch trials, as they were called —

197
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,300
'Welcome to the 7 O'Clock News. I'm Flitch Trials.'

198
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,240
Is that like a witch trial?

199
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,900
'I accuse you of being bacon and
I'm going to have to burn you.'

200
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
The best thing is, he's pointing
at a pig when he says that.

201
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,700
CHRIS: [Oinks]

202
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,180
CHRIS: That was the worst pig...
GARY: [Oinks more realistically]

203
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,980
Thank you. My pig impression was terrible.

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
TOM: Hold on! Gary Brannan impressions: Pig.
GARY: [Oinks]

205
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,380
TOM: Goose.
GARY: [Honks]

206
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,760
TOM: Train.
GARY: [Two-tone horn]

207
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,980
Goose on a train?

208
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,940
[Horn and roaring engine]

209
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,320
Thank you.

210
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,040
That's not getting old, for some reason.

211
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,700
I love the way that the goose is never just
sat on the train, it always ends up...

212
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,460
...on the train.
[Laughter]

213
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,860
Well, you said 'on'. You didn't say in what state.

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
There's a lovely old thing in linguistics,

215
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,120
about mass and count nouns,
the difference between them.

216
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,480
'There was A goose on the train'
versus 'There was goose on the train'.

217
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,560
Yes.

218
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,480
The worst thing is, he's talking about
the copilot from Top Gun.

219
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,140
What are you required to bring along
to a flitch trial to prove that —

220
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,700
Applesauce.

221
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,940
Fair point.

222
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,700
Better question: *Who* are you required to produce?

223
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,640
Vicar.

224
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,420
TOM: Not quite.

225
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,400
Your mum.

226
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,580
Oh yeah. Your best man, or something like that.

227
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,520
MATT: Your wife.
CHRIS: Witnesses of some species.

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,440
Yup.

229
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,540
GARY: Neighbours.

230
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,380
Point. [DING] Two of your neighbours
to prove that the oath is true.

231
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,040
Yeah, prove that they haven't had any rows. Yeah.

232
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,160
That't probably work quite well, actually.

233
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,900
Well, in a lot of these kind of cases,

234
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,500
working as I do with these kind of things to do with —

235
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,340
Gonna say, can we get an archivist shout here?

236
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,460
Yeah, in a lot of these kind of
non-consummation cases or adultery,

237
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,540
a lot of the evidence comes from neighbours,

238
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,900
who have obviously been peeping out the back window
and going, 'Ooh, that's not the missus.'

239
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,060
So assuming you win the flitch of bacon...

240
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,160
What happens? You get the bacon, and then...?

241
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,720
Feast for friends and family!

242
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,220
A grand ceremony. [DING]

243
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,240
With 'trompets, tabourets,
and other manoir of mynstralcie'.

244
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,580
That's what you'd expect, I'd imagine,
for that kind of size of thing?

245
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,620
But you'd be doing that a lot.

246
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,780
I was going to say, there's a lot of
weddings we're talking about here.

247
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,700
Have we just got pigs and pigs and pigs,
and minstrels knackered from playing every day?

248
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,620
Well, this is the thing. It doesn't seem
to have been claimed all that often.

249
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,120
Oh, it's one of these things that's on the books
but you've got to ask for it, right?

250
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,220
TOM: Yup.
CHRIS: Yeah.

251
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,760
How many times is the famous flitch at Dunmow
known to have been claimed?

252
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,740
I'm going to say really low,
like four or five or something like that.

253
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,680
MATT: Fifteen.

254
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm going to split the difference and say nine.

255
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm going to give Gary the point. Six.

256
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,020
Really.

257
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,940
Six that we know about. [DING]

258
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,200
When was it repealed?

259
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,040
Um, it sort of fell apart in the 15th, 16th century
dissolution of the monasteries around then.

260
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,560
GARY: Okay, yeah.

261
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,080
But it was revived in Victorian times, of course.

262
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,640
Natch. In their quest for anything Ye Olde
to legitimize everything.

263
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
TOM and CHRIS: Yup.

264
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,900
Can you still do it now?

265
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm going to say...

266
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,140
Probably.

267
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,660
I don't know, maybe if you pay for the bacon
or something like that, I can see.

268
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,720
I could just go to the butcher's and pay for bacon.

269
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,220
No, but you know what I mean.

270
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,700
You can have the ceremony,
but you must purchase a flitch of bacon.

271
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
CHRIS: Yeah.

272
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,160
You can actually go every four years.

273
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,760
Once every four years, every leap year in Dunmow,

274
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,320
there is the Dunmow Flitch Trials Committee...

275
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,380
Like it.

276
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,920
TOM: Complete with jury.

277
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,900
Next one's in 2016.

278
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,020
If it was me, I would be trying to plan my wedding then,
so I could claim the bacon.

279
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,120
To land it on...

280
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,960
I've now looked up the official one here...

281
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,580
The next one will be on the 9th of July, 2016,

282
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,500
because there is a website, of course,
for the Dunmow Flitch Trials.

283
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,620
GARY: Natch.
CHRIS: Yeah.

284
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,120
There is a list of the successful claimants
going all the way back to 1445...

285
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,400
Good work.

286
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,840
And they've also awarded flitches to a couple of couples.
Who might that be?

287
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,240
Charles and Diana.

288
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,800
Point. [DING] In fact...

289
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,600
Charles and Diana got the flitch...

290
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,300
Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson
just got a copy of the Flitch Oath.

291
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,160
What's the Flitch Oath?

292
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,820
'I pledge allegiance to this bacon
what you have given me. Ta.'

293
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,340
'In a twelve months time and a day /
Repented not in thought in any way'.

294
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,420
Ohhh.

295
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,440
Which is actually a fairly strong oath to take.

296
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,600
GARY: Yeah, that is, yeah.

297
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,760
You've never, ever wandered at any point
during that year and a day.

298
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,860
Don't forget the medieval fear of Hell and Church
and damnation and everything else there, yeah.

299
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,640
Yes. That's actually a serious oath to take.

300
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,160
So you can still do it, if any one of us
got married at some point in 2015...

301
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,260
And that is about all there is to it.

302
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,500
So it does continue.
They have patrons who are providing the bacon,

303
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,040
and making sure it continues,
and is one of these ridiculous —

304
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,700
Bacon patrons!

305
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,960
We salute you, butchers!

306
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,220
...ridiculous British traditions
that continues on to this day.

307
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,340
Good!

308
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,280
At the end of the show,
congratulations Gary, you win...

309
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,640
YES!

310
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,720
You win a gift certificate for the shop
owned by a Treasure Hunt skyrunner,

311
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,440
which sells small rodents, pests that live in hair,
and adult magazines.

312
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,960
It's Mice, Lice and Vice by Anneka Rice.

313
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,800
So enjoy that gift certificate.

314
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm starting to run out of these jokes,
do suggest some more...

315
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,520
That one was good! It just built and built and built.

316
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,780
So no, no. Respect.

317
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,920
TOM: In the meantime, thank you to Chris Joel...

318
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,400
TOM: To Gary Brannan...

319
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,160
TOM: To Matt Gray...
MATT: Bye!

320
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,000
I've been Tom Scott.
We'll see you next time.

321
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,840
Today's show is sponsored by
the new STI board game...

322
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,780
Hungry Hungry Herpes.

323
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,440
...It's the tune that Blur did
that landed on Mars with Beagle 2.

324
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,440
It didn't land — well, it did land!

325
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,360
It landed!

326
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,380
It landed at high velocity! Downwards.

327
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,160
I know there's a thin line
between 'landing' and 'impact', but...

328
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,340
I tell that to the wife all the time.

329
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,120
The one thing I do know about Wolverhampton,
they've got battered chips.

330
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,820
Oooh.

331
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,980
Eh?

332
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,380
Two very different reactions there.

333
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,560
I went,
[Disappointed] 'Ohh.'

334
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,240
Matt went, 'Yep, yep, I'll have that.'

335
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
Yeah. I'm with Matt on this.
