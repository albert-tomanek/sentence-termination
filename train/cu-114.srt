00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,480
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,340
Venezuela is a socialist paradise!

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,340
Not for its citizens,

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,280
but for the Chinese Communist Party.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,960
Hi, welcome back to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,640
I’m your host, Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,650
Venezuela.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,300
A country in Latin America currently ruled
by hungry,

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,100
hungry dictator, Nicolás Maduro.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,579
It’s funny because he’s eating an empanada

11
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,410
on national television...

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,800
while his people are suffering from malnutrition

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,380
caused by his economic mismanagement.

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,770
“Fernando Contrera says he's lost 40 pounds

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,730
since the troubles started.”

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,100
And this is common throughout Venezuela.

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,200
“We're hungry.

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,520
There's hunger.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,040
I stand in line all day long,

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,980
but I don't get anything.”

21
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,660
“I haven't bought milk for months.

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,720
Meat and chicken are extremely expensive,

23
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,320
if you can even find them.”

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,700
“These are the cuts of fish that people
are eating, they're fish heads, look.

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,600
Pieces that were only eaten by dogs before.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,120
No offense to dogs.”

27
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,180
I mean, c’mon.

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,440
Dogs aren’t offended when you eat their
food.

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,160
They’re offended when you’re so hungry,

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,300
you eat them.

31
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
And if that’s not bad enough, the Venezuelan
currency,

32
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,539
the bolívar, has been a bit unstable lately.

33
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,689
The International Monetary Fund projected

34
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,009
one million percent inflation this year alone.

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,939
Wow, that’s wildly unstable.

36
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,950
It’s like the Lindsay Lohan of currencies.

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,119
You know, everything seemed fine in like 2004,

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,310
but eventually everything just fell apart.

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,659
“The currency is so devalued,

40
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,540
some shopkeepers weigh the money,

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,740
rather than waste time counting.”

42
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,170
Although it’s inspired at least one entrepreneur

43
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,090
put the cash to good use—

44
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,259
by making stuff like this handbag that can
be sold

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,700
for more than the cash itself is worth.

46
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,409
And Venezuela’s instability has also garnered
interest

47
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,259
from a much bigger entrepreneur: China.

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,289
In fact, empanada aficionado and brutal dictator
Nicolás Maduro

49
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,950
just got back from China.

50
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,990
...where he asked Xi Jinping

51
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,400
if he could please borrow a cup of sugar...

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,159
and like 5 billion dollars.

53
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,560
China has already loaned Venezuela about

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,420
70 billion dollars in the past ten years,

55
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,360
and apparently tens of billions haven’t
been paid off yet.

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,730
And even though Maduro is obviously a sub-sub-sub
prime borrower,

57
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,750
with the most worthless currency since Zimbabwe

58
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,450
had to issue those one-hundred-trillion dollar
notes,

59
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,340
...China isn’t worried.

60
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,310
Because Venezuela has the world’s biggest
oil reserves.

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,989
And that makes for some pretty sweet collateral.

62
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,689
Venezuela will sell 9.9 percent of shares

63
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:49,730
in an oil joint venture called Sinovensa

64
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,900
to the Chinese state-owned oil company

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,350
China National Petroleum Corporation, or CNPC,

66
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,280
for an undisclosed amount of cash.

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,140
China will own 49 percent of Sinovensa after
the sale.

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,020
And China will also be put in charge of

69
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,770
some of the drilling and oil extraction.

70
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,070
Maduro said the Sinovensa sale formed part
of

71
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,299
the plan to invest $5 billion over the next
year

72
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,150
in Chinese projects to double oil production

73
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,740
and send a million barrels per day to China.

74
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,180
“I calculate approximately five billion
dollars.

75
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,600
We will invest, together with China,

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,000
some five billion dollars in the course of
the year.”

77
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,799
And this is important, because even though
Venezuela

78
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,540
has the world’s biggest oil reserves,

79
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,030
it’s extremely bad at actually getting the
oil out.

80
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,530
That wasn’t always the case.

81
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,879
Venezuela used to be a wealthy nation,

82
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,219
thanks largely to its oil exports.

83
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,680
But in 1998,

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,430
Venezuelans elected socialist visionary Hugo
Chavez.

85
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,400
A few years later,

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,319
after anti-Chavez protests

87
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,830
at the big state-owned oil company PDVSA,

88
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,709
Chavez decided that the workers there

89
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,010
were not politically reliable.

90
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,569
So he fired 40% of the workforce,

91
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,819
including some of the best executives,

92
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,290
and put his own supporters in charge.

93
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,290
And now...

94
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,199
“With three times the quantity of people,

95
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,790
we produce one third the oil.”

96
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,990
Hey, at least he created jobs, right?

97
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,270
Even if they don’t accomplish much.

98
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,720
Anyway, China is incentivized to help by injecting

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,460
its own know-how and skilled labor into the
industry.

100
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,580
Because China wants the oil,

101
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,930
and definitely doesn’t want to be repaid
in Venezuelan currency.

102
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,360
So the China deal gives Maduro some breathing
room

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,840
to continue the Venezuelan socialist experiment

104
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,419
without having to actually reform

105
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,580
its corrupt and stupid economic policies.

106
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,759
Meanwhile, China gets its hands on

107
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,180
Venezuela’s natural resources,

108
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,500
and also grows its ability

109
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,740
to project influence in Latin America.

110
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,440
To quote Chinese state-run media,

111
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,440
it’s “mutual trust and win-win cooperation.”

112
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,889
Yes, Chinese state-run media Xinhua included

113
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,500
plenty of win-win rhetoric in its report

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,610
on the meeting between Xi and Maduro,

115
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,830
saying Sino-Venezuelan ties were taken “to
a higher level.”

116
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,090
Though I wonder how much it has to do with
helping Venezuela,

117
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,699
as opposed to helping the Chinese Communist
Party

118
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,449
become a dominant world power.

119
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,620
State-run Xinhua News quoted Xi Jinping as
saying

120
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,330
that Venezuela and China “should strengthen

121
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,900
multilateral coordination and cooperation,

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,580
and continue to intensify communication

123
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,340
within the United Nations.”

124
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,280
This could mean that in exchange for helping
Maduro stay in power,

125
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,259
the Chinese regime hopes that Venezuela will
vote in line with

126
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,680
China’s interests in bodies like the United
Nations,

127
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,110
as well as the China-CELAC Forum,

128
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,850
CELAC being the Community of Latin American
and Caribbean States.

129
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,740
And China is helping Maduro stay in power.

130
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,940
Not just through extending billions of dollars
in credit,

131
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,710
but also through actions like selling him
weapons

132
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,260
that Venezuelan riot police can use

133
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,560
to deal with those pesky protesters.

134
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,870
As for Venezuela’s part,

135
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,629
Xinhua News reported that Maduro

136
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,150
“highly agrees with Xi's concept of advocating

137
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,280
to build a community with a shared future
for humanity.”

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,900
I wonder what kind of shared future they have
in mind?

139
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,280
"According to official figures from the public
ministry,

140
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,840
between 2005 and June 2017,

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,980
there were 8,292 extrajudicial executions
in Venezuela.

142
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
This is a very high figure.

143
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,040
We are talking about approximately

144
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,940
22 percent of the homicides in the country

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,640
are carried out by the state.”

146
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,920
Or maybe this?

147
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,860
“Everyone in the world needs to know this—

148
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,760
we Venezuelans are dying of hunger.

149
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,720
We are living in a dictatorship in disguise.

150
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,600
Everyone is a witness to this.

151
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,660
There are many people that are afraid

152
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,500
and can’t speak out because they have us
gagged.

153
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,640
If you speak out they send the militias to
harm you or kill you.”

154
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,150
Or maybe it’s the future in which the socialist
leader of Venezuela

155
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,090
feasts on steak, while the rest of his country
eats fish heads.

156
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,030
No seriously, this video is from Maduro’s
trip back from China,

157
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,580
where stopped in Turkey and ate some delicious
steak

158
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,629
at a restaurant run by celebrity chef “Salt
Bae”.

159
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:31,699
Which was then followed by this unintentionally
hilarious Tweet

160
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,980
from US Senator Marco Rubio, saying:

161
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,629
“I don’t know who this weirdo Saltbae
is,

162
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,330
but the guy he is so proud to host

163
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,750
is not the President of Venezuela,

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,780
He is actually the overweight dictator of
a nation

165
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,889
where 30% of the people eat only once a day

166
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,240
and infants are suffering from malnutrition.”

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,840
I guess it’s a good thing that Senator Rubio

168
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,569
does not know who Salt Bae is.

169
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:56,789
And before we go,

170
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,460
it’s time when I answer a question

171
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,689
from one of our supporters

172
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,110
on the crowdfunding website Patreon.

173
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,580
Maxxxxxxx asks:

174
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,770
“dinner with either president xi or trump?

175
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,000
And why?”

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,100
Why not both?

177
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,120
I hear Mar-a-Lago has the best chocolate cake.

178
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,199
