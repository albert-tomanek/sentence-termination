00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,120
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,360
B.Y.O.T.P.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,260
Bring your own...TP.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,600
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored,

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,469
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,090
The Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,570
Built in 1420,

8
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,169
it was the sight where emperors performed
sacred rituals

9
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,800
to ensure the blessings of heaven.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,990
Today, tourists can learn from these ancient
traditions

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,789
and deepen their understanding of

12
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,380
China’s ancient culture.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,590
But now, park authorities are facing a huge problem:

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,000
How to make sure that tourists who need to
use the restrooms

15
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,800
have exactly the right amount of toilet paper.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,510
You see, locals, usually the elderly,

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,949
have been coming into the park’s restrooms

18
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:51,239
and stealing toilet paper.

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,620
Was this the hoarding instinct people had
ingrained in them

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,800
during the wonderful days of Mao’s collectivism?

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Or were they simply planning to TP Tiananmen
Square?

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,390
So how did park authorities stop

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,120
the toilet paper pilfering?

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,790
Well, in China,

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,260
the only logical solution is obviously...

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,290
to hook up the toilet paper dispensers

27
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,230
to facial recognition software.

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,480
Take a moment to imagine this.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,580
Before you do your business,

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,070
you need to go to the central toilet paper
dispensary.

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,500
Where one of these things scans your face.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,460
30 seconds later,

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,580
it will spit out 2 feet of toilet paper.

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,580
If you want more,

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,400
you have to wait 9 minutes.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,720
That’s how long it takes for the machine

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,670
to delete your stored image.

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,060
Hey, whatever happened to

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,210
each according to need?

40
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,940
And if ever there were a basic human need,

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,240
it’s toilet paper.

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,710
You can check out the process on the New York Times’s

43
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,690
lamest gif ever.

44
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,680
Don’t worry.

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,890
According to a park spokesman,

46
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,520
"If we encounter guests who have diarrhea

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,780
or any other situation in which they

48
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,680
urgently require toilet paper,

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,030
then our staff on the ground

50
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,890
will directly provide the toilet paper.”

51
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,110
I'm not sure how you're supposed to contact

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,729
the staff on the ground.

53
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,590
But at least with the extra toilet paper they
bring,

54
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,430
you can bury your face in shame.

55
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,430
The best part is,

56
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,659
in order to save money on all the toilet paper,

57
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:21,010
the park spent over 4,000 dollars

58
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,550
on the facial recognition machines.

59
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,870
How much toilet paper

60
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,909
The Temple of Heaven is unique though.

61
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,099
No, not because of the facial recognition
software.

62
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,650
They have that all over China.

63
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,239
No, I mean because there was toilet paper
available.

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,689
Most bathrooms in China do not have toilet
paper.

65
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,060
You have to bring your own.

66
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,800
There’s a reason why it’s called

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,290
the Temple of Heaven.

68
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,959
It’s been providing toilet paper for patrons

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,359
for the past 10 years.

70
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,450
Wait a minute,

71
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,209
this place was built in 1420,

72
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,670
and there was toilet paper in the bathroom

73
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,370
for only ten of those years?

74
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,251
Strange when you consider that China invented
toilet paper

75
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,489
in the sixth century.

76
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,109
In the 14th century they were literally

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,480
mass manufacturing the stuff.

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,469
Man, ancient China really had its act together.

79
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,879
But in more recent years,

80
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,849
toilet paper became something of an

81
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,110
endangered species in China.

82
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,220
No, not that stuff, that's way too nice.

83
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,950
I'm talking about the toilet paper

84
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,840
that's brown and kind of stretchy,

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,319
with the pleasant texture of crepe paper

86
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,269
made from playground wood chips and cardboard.

87
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,069
You can use it as toilet paper,

88
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,900
or to decorate the saddest birthday party
ever.

89
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,200
And in modern times,

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,909
bathrooms in China do not exactly

91
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,109
have a sparkling reputation, either.

92
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,330
“Most toilets have no toilet paper.

93
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,930
Many lack running water.

94
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,569
Everywhere, flushing seems optional.”

95
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:51,760
But that was 2005!

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
Times have changed!

97
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,870
In December, China’s National Tourism Administration

98
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,640
announced a “toilet revolution.”

99
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,439
Wait, the Chinese government is going to spend

100
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,779
a quarter of a trillion dollars on toilets?

101
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,709
That’s more than the GDP

102
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,430
of most medium-size countries.

103
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,579
Because clearly, toilets are something that
need

104
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:17,390
an authoritarian, top-down solution.

105
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,160
Over the next four years,

106
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,870
100,000 toilets across China will be renovated

107
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,350
and new ones built.

108
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,070
There’s also a nationwide campaign

109
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,460
dedicated to educating people about

110
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,600
proper bathroom use.

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
And if you don’t behave,

112
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,040
you’ll be blacklisted from using them.

113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,220
You know I think this episode better sums
up

114
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,190
what it’s like in China under the Chinese
Communist Party

115
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,670
than any other of the 600 videos on this channel.

116
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,000
But I don't think that facial recognition
software

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,220
really goes far enough to prevent

118
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,100
toilet paper theft.

119
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
What if people start bringing

120
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,370
masks into the bathroom?

121
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,751
Maybe instead they should tag rolls of toilet
paper

122
00:04:56,751 --> 00:05:00,130
with those anti-shoplifting devices.

123
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,280
Or force people to answer complicated math
questions

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,970
before dispensing toilet paper.

125
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,310
Or just use a different brand of toilet paper.

126
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,600
Because with Charmin Ultra,

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,310
less is more.

128
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,590
Well, if anyone from China’s National Tourism
Administration

129
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,590
is watching,

130
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,750
I have plenty of great ideas like these.

131
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,000
Including my exclusive line

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,590
of China Uncensored Toilets.

133
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,290
So what do you think of Beijing authorities

134
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,620
using facial recognition software

135
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,390
to provide access to toilet paper?

136
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,840
Leave your comments below.

137
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,500
Thanks for watching this episode of China Uncensored.

138
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,840
Once again I’m your host Chris Chappell,

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
see you next time.
