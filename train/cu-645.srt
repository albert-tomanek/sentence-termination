00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,879
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,000
China Wants to Tell You About the South China
Sea.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,980
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,780
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,549
An international United Nations Tribunal

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,730
may have ruled against China's claims to the
South China Sea,

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,850
but the Chinese Communist Party has something
the UN doesn't have

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,140
billions of dollars to spend on propaganda.

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,630
The Chinese regime has invested

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,800
8.9 billion dollars in what they call “external
publicity work.”

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
That is, spreading its propaganda message
to the West.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,140
They've bought newspapers, television networks,

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,270
they even created an English language version
of state-run CCTV

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,079
and put its headquarters seven blocks from
the White House.

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,100
And hey, newspapers around the world are struggling
financially.

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,640
Why not just pay them to put propaganda side
by side with actual journalism?

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,680
They call it China Watch.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,140
Here it is in the Wall Street Journal,

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,600
The Daily Telegraph,

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,690
and the New York Times.

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,299
And then there's this.

22
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,680
If you haven't noticed the giant ad

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,490
for Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua in the
center of Times Square,

24
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,039
you're probably playing too much Pokémon
Go.

25
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,590
Oh, but it's been there.

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,509
Broadcasting Chinese propaganda 24/7, 365
days a year since 2011.

27
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,259
Yes, for five years.

28
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:27,259
At that time,

29
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,159
this prime piece of ad space

30
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,630
was estimated to cost at least three hundred
thousand dollars

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,619
a month.

32
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,700
And the Communist Party is putting it to good
use now.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,920
Check this out!

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,840
Okay, so you can't actually hear the sound
in Times Square.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,700
But it’s a video explaining why the South
China Sea

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,939
clearly belongs to the Communist Party

37
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,049
and why the Hague ruling is illegitimate.

38
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,799
The newest one has been playing 120 times
a day since July 23.

39
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,549
And its last day is August 3,

40
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:04,479
so hurry to Times Square before it's too late!

41
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,009
I'm kidding of course.

42
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,009
As a New Yorker,

43
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,979
I recommend you avoid Times Square like the
plague.

44
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,200
Fortunately, the video can also be seen online.

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,200
It’s one among many propaganda videos on
the South China Sea

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,989
you can enjoy from China’s state-run media.

47
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,180
Here’s a fun animation of a grandpa telling
his granddaughter

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,380
about why the South China Sea belongs to China.

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,989
Well, I think those countries should really
take a look at history.

50
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,780
Then they'll see that China was the first
to settle there,

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:40,360
the first to trade there, and the first to
make the area secure.

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
You can believe it,

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
because Grandpa has a British accent.

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,349
Then there’s this one from China Daily.

55
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,529
It shows foreigners trashing the tribunal.

56
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:51,529
"China has a position

57
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,529
a long standing position,

58
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:56,600
and it's not budging."

59
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,740
That’s weird.

60
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,900
No, not that those quotes sound like they
could be

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,920
merely describing China’s position not supporting
it

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,969
but that China Daily used the same hip hop
baseline

63
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:14,080
as this song about about tricking people and
then stabbing them to death.

64
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Just saying.

65
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,319
Anyway, are you shocked that the Chinese Communist
Party’s propaganda

66
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,590
can be played in New York's Times Square?

67
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,250
Well, I'll tell you who was shocked.

68
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,810
Catherine West.

69
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,999
She's a member of the UK Parliament.

70
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,050
Here's what she said in the video about the
South China Sea.

71
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,850
That's why we have to be careful,

72
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,850
that yes, we need to resolve something very locally,

73
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,220
and have a grown up approach to dialogue."

74
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,300
Well that's just what China is always saying
about the South China Sea!

75
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,829
She gave that interview at the 5th China-Europe
High-level Political Parties Forum in Beijing

76
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,450
held in May 2016.

77
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,930
Except when Quartz reached out to her for
comment,

78
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,109
it turned out grown-up dialogue is still lacking.

79
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,030
Not only did nobody tell her they were going
to use her interview for this,

80
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,040
they completely quoted her out of context.

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,540
What she was actually saying is that China
has been militarizing the region

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,349
and it needs to stop doing that

83
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,700
and start using dialogue, like grown-ups.

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,000
Not exactly the same message,

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,510
but you wouldn't know that if you're watching
in Times Square.

86
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,580
So how do you feel about the Chinese regime
broadcasting its message in Times Square?

87
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,160
Want to support an alternative?
