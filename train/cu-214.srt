00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,290
On this episode of China Uncensored:

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,020
Taiwan, China...

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,540
what's the difference?

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,640
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,440
I'm your host, Chris Chappell.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,650
I’ve never been to Kenya,

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,920
and I certainly haven’t been arrested there.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,920
But I hear their jails are great!

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,560
Or at least, I presume they must be.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,250
That would explain why these 15 Taiwanese
citizens

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,410
in Nairobi, Kenya attempted to barricade themselves
in a jail cell.

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,000
Unfortunately, their delightful detainment
wasn’t to last.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,460
A few moments later,

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,320
Kenyan police busted the door down,

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,670
grabbed them, and put them on an airplane.

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,430
And deported them to China.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,140
This China, not this China.

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,800
Even though they’re from this China.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,560
And if you’re not familiar with the “One
China” policy

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,430
that says that both of these regions are China,
watch this video.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,770
And if you are familiar with the “One China”
policy,

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,780
you know why this awkward

23
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,070
sending-Taiwanese-citizens-to-mainland-China
thing

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,000
is such a big deal.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,840
Here’s what happened:

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,040
These 15 people are part of a group of 45
Taiwan citizens

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,860
who faced charges in Kenya for telecom fraud.

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,860
They had been accused of defrauding people
in mainland China

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,310
of more than $93 million dollars in a series
of scams.

30
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,920
I can only assume they pretended to be African
princes

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
seeking to "transfer funds" to unsuspecting
victims.

32
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,140
Anyway, I'm not saying they didn't commit
fraud.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,270
But they were acquitted by the Kenyan court.

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,729
That is, not guilty.

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,350
Yet the government of mainland China insisted

36
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,610
that Kenya send these Taiwanese to mainland
China for “investigation.”

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,040
As Kenya's Interior Ministry spokesperson
put it,

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,649
"They came from China and we took them to
China.”

39
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,439
Now it’s not that Kenyan officials are too
dumb to realize

40
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,869
that being from China and being from Taiwan
are not the same thing.

41
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,680
They just want to respect the "One China”
policy,

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,459
where Kenya only recognizes the CCP, and not
the Taiwan government,

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,239
as the legitimate rulers of all China.

44
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,679
As a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson
put it,

45
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,780
"Countries which follow the 'One China' principle
are worthy of approval."

46
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:28,099
But while Kenya may get a gold star from the
CCP,

47
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,329
they're actually violating their own policy.

48
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:36,189
Because the Kenyan court issued an order to
not deport these people.

49
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,409
So why would they do it? Could it possibly
have to do with...

50
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,189
money?

51
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,680
Now I'm not saying these Taiwanese citizens
didn't commit fraud.

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,920
You may be innocent unless proven guilty in
America.

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,000
And in Kenya.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,221
And in Taiwan.

55
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,980
But in mainland China, you're only innocent

56
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,569
until you're forced to confess on state-run
television.

57
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,709
Because that’s actually what happened.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,959
And if this case is any indication,

59
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,139
now it could potentially happen to any Taiwanese
citizen

60
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,479
accused of a crime overseas—

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,260
even if they’re found not guilty.

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
So what do you think?

63
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,569

Once again, I'm Chris Chappell. See you next time.

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,100
OK, so what do you need?

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,740
Suits. Lots of suits.

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,140
Wait...

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,160
Who is this?

70
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,860
Mania.
