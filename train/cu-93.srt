00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,780
30 Years ago

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,300
The Tanks rolled into Beijing

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,700
To this day, the Chinese Communist Party

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,250
Pretends like the whole thing never happened

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,020
And let’s just say, you don’t want to
disagree

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,980
Welcome back to China Uncensored.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,260
I’m Chris Chappell.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,220
30 years ago, on June 4 1989,

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,609
the Chinese Communist Party made it very clear

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,230
it wasn’t going to evolve into a liberal
democracy.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,849
I know, shocking right?

12
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:34,620
In the West, we call it the Tiananmen Square
Massacre,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,870
where thousands of unarmed people were killed.

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,239
But the Chinese Communist Party simply refers
to it

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,149
as the “June 4 Incident”.

16
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,140
And as they put it, it’s when armed,

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,170
violent students attacked poor defenseless
soldiers

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,609
who had to fight back to save the country.

19
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:56,829
But that lovely piece of propaganda only comes
out as a last resort.

20
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,299
The Communist Party much prefers making people

21
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,739
forget the whole thing ever happened.

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,460
The mothers of students who were killed have
been silenced.

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,530
And most mentions of the June 4th Incident

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,320
on the Chinese internet get blocked.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,430
Even including some pretty clever workarounds
by Chinese netizens,

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,799
who started calling it May 35th.

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,180
It’s gotten to the point that today,

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,939
many young people have never even heard of

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,299
the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

30
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,400
And it doesn’t help when Western institutions,

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,710
like the Encyclopedia Britannica,

32
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,189
decide to no longer call it a massacre.

33
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,090
With the survivors of Tiananmen now entering
their 50’s,

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,710
the very real possibility confronts us that

35
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,299
there could come a day when the Tiananmen
Square Massacre

36
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,439
is erased from history.

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,810
So the survivors look to new ways to preserve
the story

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,630
for future generations.

39
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,920
I sat down with one of the student leaders,
Zhou Fengsuo,

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,400
to find out how to keep the memory of Tiananmen
alive.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,140
Thanks for joining me today.

42
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,639
Thank you for having me.

43
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,639
Absolutely.

44
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,920
So you were one of the student leaders

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,799
in the Tiananmen protests of 1989.

46
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,450
How does it feel to have been number five

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,479
on the Chinese Communist Party's most wanted
list?

48
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,560
t was an honor and also a shock to me when
I saw my name

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,920
on the most wanted list.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,660
Immediately I was so immensely proud of what
I had been doing

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:32,650
but on the other hand I was shocked because
I never saw myself

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,760
being a top leader.

53
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,790
I was just doing what I was supposed to do

54
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,629
as an ordinary student out of my duty as a
citizen.

55
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,360
So when you went to the protests,

56
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,060
you didn't have in mind that you were doing

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,140
something against the government?

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,159
I think we knew all along we were against

59
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,590
in some parts of the government,

60
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:06,950
but it was not against the whole system at
that time.

61
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,220
We were hoping that the system could change
for better of course

62
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,980
but we were just protesting and basically
petitioning,

63
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,720
not really trying to overthrow the government
in the beginning.

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,580
Of course, after the massacre things changed.

65
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Okay.

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
This is kind of related.

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,980
The communist party likes to portray what
happened in Tiananmen

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,049
as a violent student uprising.

69
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:34,220
What actually happened?

70
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,870
Why were you there?

71
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,230
It was the most peaceful protest in history,

72
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,970
I mean, looking back the last 30 years from
what I know,

73
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,420
this was the most peaceful protest in the
world,

74
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,629
and of course in China millions of people
in Beijing

75
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:03,760
are protesting but it was so peaceful,

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,980
so orderly that even people are talking,

77
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,629
even criminals, even thieves stop stealing.

78
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not a joke.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,680
Five years ago when I went back to China to
protest Tiananmen,

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,140
they send me back, but the police who sent
me back basically

81
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,820
told me he still remembered 25 years ago

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:40,940
it was the most peaceful time in his memory

83
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,910
and he had never seen so many people on the
street at the same time,

84
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,070
so that's what's amazing.

85
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,150
I’m amazed you tried to go back to China
considering you were,

86
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,260
at one point, on the top five most wanted
list.

87
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,700
For me, as a survivor,

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:04,970
it's my duty to remember and to remind the
world of what happened

89
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,380
and to pay tribute to these people who died
in particular.

90
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,390
Tiananmen, when I left, we were driven out
by tanks.

91
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,010
It's always my wish to commemorate on Tiananmen.

92
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,790
Even with all the surveillance everything's

93
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,340
so closely watched, monitored, guarded.

94
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,910
I realized there might be an opening if I
just try,

95
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,980
so that's how I was able to get here

96
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,350
using the transit visa on the ground.

97
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,001
Well, so you were there when the tanks rolled
in.

98
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,130
How bad was it?

99
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,130
It was like a war zone but on the one hand

100
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,370
there were these peaceful students with no
weapons,

101
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,270
and on the other hand,

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,300
there are the fully armed troops and most
elite troops

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:11,690
of the communist government with tanks, machine
guns, everything,

104
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,390
so it was like a war.

105
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,120
I feel powerless.

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:24,050
I also feel invincible in a way that I would
never surrender

107
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,980
to such brutal senseless violence.

108
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,780
Where does that feeling of invincibility come
from?

109
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,890
I mean, if I were facing down things,

110
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,140
I don't know if I would feel that way.

111
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,650
I mean, just from the belief of what we were
doing.

112
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,510
We were doing something right and we were
ready to sacrifice for it

113
00:06:49,510 --> 00:07:00,340
and just the moral force just so their fear
of this regime

114
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:10,960
that's completely... and to me, so I was just
really hardened

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,510
when I left Tiananmen, said, "We will come
back."

116
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,220
This kind of brutality wouldn't conquer us.

117
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,800
What were some of the things you were protesting
for?

118
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,790
I know you were saying you weren't there to
overthrow the government,

119
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,610
but what did the protesters want?

120
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,190
So from the beginning, very early on on April
18th

121
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,870
there was a petition from Peking University

122
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,850
and there was seven demands,

123
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,460
and out of the seven demands two are the most
important

124
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,300
and one is for press freedom,

125
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:56,470
the other one is for more transparency and
the wealth,

126
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,100
the family wealth of government officials,

127
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,390
so we are calling for disclosure

128
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,710
of the family wealth of top officials.

129
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,770
These two are the most important ones.

130
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:16,460
Of course, immediately they were widely applauded
by the public

131
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,620
and that's why it raised so much fear among
the communist regime

132
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:32,070
because the fear that freedom of speech and
more transparency

133
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:40,750
will just stop their corruption the their
legitimacy of-

134
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,159
Even though those are the things guaranteed
in China's constitution.

135
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,889
Right, it was completely legal even under
the communist law.

136
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,680
But they answered your demands with tanks.

137
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Right.

138
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Eventually that was the answer.

139
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,189
And actually then, made up its mind to kill
very early.

140
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:03,899
In April he said he was going to kill

141
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:13,290
if the students wouldn't stop protests,

142
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,199
he said he's going to kill.

143
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:18,080
And so were the people in Beijing

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,399
supportive of the students and the protestors?

145
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,139
Of course they were because it was so peaceful

146
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:31,750
and the demands was so widely shared by the
general public.

147
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,879
It was so supported.

148
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,139
It was just overwhelming.

149
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:45,319
People would bring food and they would take
their kids on the shoulder

150
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:49,970
to block the troops just to show them this
is a family event.

151
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,640
There's nothing out of order in Beijing.

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,370
You should get out.

153
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:02,300
It was a very touching moment in China where
all the people

154
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,420
could unify for one dream.

155
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,510
So as I understand it,

156
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,129
initially the military that was there were
from the local area

157
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,930
and they were unwilling to crack down on the
students

158
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,769
so the party got military forces from further
away.

159
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,180
Is that accurate?

160
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,160
I think, yeah, it's true the full process

161
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,209
we don't really know from what we know today
the local troop,

162
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:38,189
the most elite one called 38th Army Troop,

163
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:47,249
so its commander was court marshalled for
disobeying the Marshall Law

164
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:54,249
and so that's a very clear sign of how the
soldiers themselves

165
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,269
were not willing to kill.

166
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,029
But in the end, the same troop,

167
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:03,759
after its commander was removed was the one

168
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,060
that committed most killing because they were
forced to do so

169
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,379
and they were surrounded by many other troops.

170
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:23,529
That was the escape of just to put a deep
confrontation

171
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,889
between the soldiers and the protestors.

172
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:35,350
That, to me, explains why there are just so
many killings.

173
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,009
So obviously having the tanks roll into the
nation's capital,

174
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,490
that's not an easy thing to cover up.

175
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,490
People must still remember,

176
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,410
like you talked about the guard you met when
you went back to China

177
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,420
who said he remembered.

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:59,559
How is the communist party able to cover this
up?

179
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:05,670
For the last 30 years there has been a continuous
campaign

180
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:12,050
against truth and a memory to erase it completely,

181
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,050
so there's so much fear even in the Chinese
community here

182
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,059
just to talk about it.

183
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:25,050
For example, our event next Tuesday at St.
John the Divine Cathedral,

184
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,660
I talked to friends who were supportive of
us said,

185
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,240
"Would you come because you support us?"

186
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,339
He said, "You know, I'm looking for people
to join me

187
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,529
but nobody willing and afraid to."

188
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,720
That's the kind of situation now

189
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,750
so there's a pervasive fear of the public
to talk about.

190
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,129
Even 30 years later, Chinese people-

191
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:55,130
In United States.

192
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,089
In the United States are afraid.

193
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:58,089
Yes.

194
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,749
So that's how paranoid the communists were

195
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:10,380
and how much effort they had put here to keep
people's' mouths shut.

196
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:17,879
In a way, the general public in China and
the Chinese community

197
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:22,449
are becoming part of the collusion

198
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:25,069
because most family wouldn't tell their kids,

199
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,879
they would stop their kids from participating,

200
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:31,339
even today in United States at universities

201
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,949
at any events related to Tiananmen.

202
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:40,959
And here, even institutions here we talk to,

203
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,269
most of them shows some kind of fear

204
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:49,290
just for being associated with us.

205
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,820
Well, I guess when the communist party in
1989

206
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,070
showed that they're willing to kill peoples'
children,

207
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,709
people want to protect their children

208
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,589
so they don't want them to be in a situation

209
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,050
where they are at risk from the government.

210
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,170
Yes.

211
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,990
Unfortunately that's the wrong,

212
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,220
the communist forced people,

213
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,759
but for last 30 years that is the way it is
now,

214
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,660
but of course, the facts,

215
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,660
the truth itself has its own power.

216
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,670
Whenever I'm able to talk to younger generations

217
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,540
they are normally very positively receptive,

218
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,899
but if I meet someone at other occasions,

219
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,749
if I bring this up they will try to stay away,

220
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,910
it's a natural reaction.

221
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,839
Do the young people, do they know what happened?

222
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,870
Have they heard anything about it?

223
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,019
If they're interested they can know the history,

224
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,009
I mean, even today, in China, if they try
hard they will,

225
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:09,829
but because it's 30 years, it's a long time,

226
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:13,010
even the kids who were born after the massacre

227
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:19,519
they're in almost 30s now so that's a long
time.

228
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,749
So I think for many young people this is a
remote topic.

229
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:37,929
On the other hand, it's so intensive, so intense
I mean, so dramatic,

230
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,490
the passion in there so strong just even the
vision, for example,

231
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:48,619
the tanks come in, the guardians of democracy
and there's a protest,

232
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,920
that was people were shown the picture, normally,
I mean,

233
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:00,179
they would show natural inclination into was
embracing the protestors.

234
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,009
Is it easy for them to accept

235
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:06,899
when they see the footage of "Tank Man" for
instance,

236
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:07,899
can they accept it?

237
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,890
"Oh, this is something my government did to
the people."

238
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,379
Of course it takes time because today's young
students,

239
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,279
they all grow up under the shadow of the fire
wall.

240
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:28,560
Most of them are so indoctrinated with communist
brainwashing.

241
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,579
It's really hard for them to overcome, but
slowly.

242
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:38,089
Just yesterday I saw this.

243
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:43,889
It documented 300 cases of how people realize

244
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,490
what happened at Tiananmen.

245
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,569
Normally it's a slow process

246
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,809
but if they're interested they will know the
facts

247
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:59,170
and eventually they wouldn't be on the side
of the government

248
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,560
if they know the facts.

249
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,150
What was life like for you after the Tiananmen
Square massacre?

250
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,460
For me, I never imagined I was a student leader.

251
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,920
I was doing my, on my call as a citizen for
my-

252
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,080
You thought you were talking about free press.

253
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,820
Right, yeah, exactly, but I became a political
prisoner.

254
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,900
I spent a year in prison, another year in
a reeducation program,

255
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,750
you know, very poor place under surveillance

256
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,430
and I came to United States in '95.

257
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:45,090
So for me, Tiananmen was just a beginning
of the last 30 years.

258
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:52,240
For me, it always has been my passion just
to know more,

259
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,240
to help more of the victims,

260
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,830
so every year the story,

261
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,740
new facts came to me and the story is still
unfolding.

262
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,910
The depths of the sacrifice, the passion,

263
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,050
the perseverance after 30 years,

264
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,380
it's so strong for me,

265
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:28,700
so I think this is still the most important
issue for me.

266
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,340
Yeah, I know recent research has even suggested

267
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,270
that there were up to ten thousand civilians

268
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,160
killed in the Tiananmen Square massacre.

269
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,140
Right, we don't really know,

270
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,080
so that's why they were successful 30 years
ago

271
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,240
in keeping silence because even for the protestors,

272
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,070
most of them don't know the full scope of
the massacre.

273
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:02,049
I didn't witness the tank killing until later.

274
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:05,920
I knew this later when I met Fang Zheng himself,

275
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,590
so that's why when I started Humanitarian
China

276
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,750
we brought his family here to United States.

277
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,840
And he lost his legs to the tank.

278
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Yes.

279
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,900
So at the moment of life and the tanks,

280
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:25,840
when he realized the tanks were charging at
them,

281
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,870
he choose to push the girl over the fence.

282
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,910
There was a fence separating the street from
the pedestrians.

283
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:47,700
At that moment he was squashed and later the
girl never saw him again.

284
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,620
The lady he saved.

285
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,740
I believe he told me she even denied knowing
before of pressure.

286
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,850
Because of fear, because of fear of being
implicated as a protestor.

287
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,260
But he is so protective of her.

288
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,780
Of course he knows her identity now.

289
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,060
He never showed any hatred of-

290
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,990
It's incredible.

291
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,990
Of course, he should be proud of himself and
I'm just proud of him.

292
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:33,290
This was a spirit when the brutal violence
was happening

293
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,360
and you see the other side of human character,

294
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,320
their true nature just shines through.

295
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,240
There are people who are waiting to sacrifice

296
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,130
to save others and these kind of stories,

297
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:57,550
there are just so many in that whole process
over the last 30 years.

298
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,320
So this China, this is a rarity,

299
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,740
you just couldn't see it to understand,

300
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,570
but these people,

301
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,710
you see the beauty of human nature and that's
what China needs.

302
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,880
So what are you and all the other Tiananmen
survivors doing

303
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,030
to carry on the message or spread awareness?

304
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:35,790
There are many faults of this project from
Tiananmen what we are doing.

305
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:44,660
We have been very active in keeping the truth
and knowing the facts,

306
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,150
what happened in 1989.

307
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,510
We are also very active in helping the families
for example,

308
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:01,040
the Tiananmen Mothers and the Beijing citizens
who are helping students,

309
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,210
most of them were sentenced to very long years
in prison,

310
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:13,730
also the people who are imprisoned are killed
outside of Beijing.

311
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:24,030
There were maybe tens of thousands of them
and people we know

312
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,460
a fuller picture of what happened in 1989.

313
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,260
Here in the United States I'm trying to reach
out

314
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,310
to any people who interested in knowing this

315
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,790
and on my social media and everywhere I post
this.

316
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,080
Because of this I was censored on LinkedIn.

317
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,310
On LinkedIn?

318
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,540
On LinkedIn.

319
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,160
On the American job website.

320
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Right.

321
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,650
By the American... backed down after it was-

322
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,570
So what did they do?

323
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,320
Did they block your website everywhere

324
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,740
or just being seen in China?

325
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,950
I actually never tested it.

326
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,760
It's probably blocked in China as a result,

327
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,420
but they just send me a message saying

328
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:19,480
we have to block you for this and that.

329
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Incredible.

330
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,200
Then later they blame it as technical error
of some kind.

331
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:38,960
So it is a fight, a continuous fight against
the enforced amnesia.

332
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,370
That's what we are, we are fighting.

333
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,670
This year, 30 years anniversary,

334
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:55,350
is different in the way that we all realize
we are all over 50.

335
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:01,830
We have to think if our generation has to
pass on this duty

336
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,310
to next generation what do we show them,

337
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:14,630
so we're building a few sculptures and we
want to build a museum.

338
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,540
These are in Liberty Sculpture Park near Los
Angeles and-

339
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,660
So a museum dedicated to Tiananmen or history
of communism?

340
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,610
Yeah, it will be called Tiananmen or June
4th Museum

341
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,760
but it will cover the history of China's fight
against communism

342
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,960
and also other countries too.

343
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,200
We hope we can build this in the next five
years.

344
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,880
If this is done after that we want to build

345
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:58,030
a giant statue of liberty called The Goddess
of Democracy.

346
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,260
Like the statue they had-

347
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Right.

348
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,590
In the center of Tiananmen back then.

349
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,770
Yeah, that was crushed 30 years ago.

350
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:12,420
We want to erect it here at full length of
64 meters tall.

351
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Wow.

352
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,090
So if we can get all the resources,

353
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:23,730
this will be our testimony for the future
generations.

354
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,560
So what lesson do you think people today

355
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
should take away from the Tiananmen protests

356
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,600
and the Tiananmen Square massacre?

357
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,070
We have to overcome the fear,

358
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:44,390
so most people on this topic are still living
in the fear

359
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,020
enforced by the communist government and you
have to choose sides.

360
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,960
If you choose to stay with the government
you

361
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,120
are part of the collusion against truth and
justice

362
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,960
for the participants and for the, in particular,

363
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,620
for the whole for better China.

364
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,401
And also we must remember this was a brief
period in China

365
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:23,350
where the freedom and democracy for China
unified everyone.

366
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:29,320
It was resonating across the globe for a better
China.

367
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,080
That's the first probably only time.

368
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,890
For all of us who was there,

369
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:42,320
this was a test of freedom and we must remember
that.

370
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,900
Great.

371
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,920
Thank you so much for joining me today.

372
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,570
Good luck with the 30th anniversary making
sure people

373
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,350
still stay aware about what happened.

374
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,840
Sure.

375
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,400
Thank you.
