00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,139
On this episode of China Uncensored,

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:03,790
when getting away from it all means,

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,510
Run!

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,870
Run for your life!

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,380
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored.

6
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,830
I’m your host Chris Chappell.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,830
You know,

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,619
I don’t talk often enough about

9
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,770
the natural beauty of China.

10
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,330
That’s partly because it’s hard to see...

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,740
...when it covered in thick blankets of air
pollution.

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,740
In December,

13
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,000
China saw some of the worst smog ever.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,820
That's because the smog was pretty much

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,050
the only thing you could see.

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,770
It was so bad that hundreds of flights across
the country

17
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,050
were delayed or canceled.

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,050
In Chengdu,

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,110
a group of activists held a protest and did
this:

20
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,530
The local authorities had a good laugh.

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,190
Followed by a long cough.

22
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,060
And then they sent in the riot police.

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,300
That last part’s not a joke.

24
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Although in this case,

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,600
it's not entirely the riot police's fault.

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,720
Apparently they thought the statues were those
street artists

27
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,510
who cover themselves in spray paint

28
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,210
and haunt tourist sites around the world.

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,219
Luckily,

30
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,559
there was no such confusion in Xi'an,

31
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,670
where pollution masks appeared on stone lions.

32
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,620
800 of them.

33
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,170
Well, at least statues can protest pollution.

34
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,170
Fortunately,

35
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,700
China’s Meteorological Administration

36
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,420
eventually solved the problem.

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,780
They notified local bureaus

38
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,600
to immediately stop issuing smog alerts,

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,729
and start calling it, “fog.”

40
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,390
They’ve also punished windows

41
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,060
for spreading false rumors about pollution.

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,790
Smog—or “fog”—

43
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,000
is not by any means a new problem in China.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,720
The country routinely has crippling outbreaks.

45
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,170
And the worst kind of smog is PM 2.5 particles.

46
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,770
These are the tiny particles that get into
your lungs

47
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,200
and can cause cancer.

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,570
China measures this type of pollution

49
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,750
on a scale of zero to 500.

50
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,630
In 2013, in the northeastern city of Harbin,

51
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,040
it reached 1,000.

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,820
The World Health Organization’s recommended
safe standard

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,880
is 25.

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,829
They should have just filmed this Stephen
King movie there

55
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:06,420
and saved on their special effects budget.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,140
Fortunately, the great and glorious Communist
Party

57
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,739
is taking steps to ensure these red alert
pollution situations

58
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,830
don’t keep happening—

59
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,099
by raising the threshold

60
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,840
for what constitutes a red alert.

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,450
And also ordering air quality monitoring apps

62
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,390
to not display readings past the official
government cutoff point.

63
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,740
I mean, Chinese citizens don't really want
to know

64
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,670
what they're breathing, right?

65
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,260
And now, Beijing’s latest move:

66
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,350
Creating a new environmental police force!

67
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,220
Yes, Chinese police:

68
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,420
Not just for beating up dissidents anymore!

69
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,060
So amidst all this smoggy mist,

70
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,350
wealthy Chinese citizens—

71
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,610
and the companies that want to sell stuff
to them—

72
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,110
have come up with a brilliant idea:

73
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,480
“lung cleansing trips.”

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Yes, this is really a thing.

75
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
And they’re even traveling as far as Antarctica.

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,110
I remember when I took a trip to Antarctica.

77
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,170
It can get pretty boring,

78
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,520
so I’d recommend bringing

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,240
a chess-playing computer.

80
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,990
Also a flamethrower.

81
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,990
But seriously,

82
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,990
Antarctica makes sense

83
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,629
as a Chinese tourist destination.

84
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,760
Ok, there's no Gucci - yet,

85
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,060
but it’s one of the least-polluted places
on earth.

86
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,800
At least until the Communist Party

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,580
decides to claim it for themselves

88
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,700
so they can tap its pristine oil and coal
reserves.

89
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,330
According to a report called “Smog Escape
Travel Ranking,”

90
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,050
Chinese travel service, Ctrip,

91
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,180
says online searches in China for “smog
escape,”

92
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,350
“lung cleansing” and “forests”

93
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,739
have tripled during the latest pollution nightmare.

94
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,430
But for many Chinese,

95
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,989
this is a matter of life and death.

96
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,239
A recent study found that more than 4,000
people

97
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,480
die every day in China because of air pollution.

98
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
But hey,

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,190
a little “fog” never hurt anyone.

100
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,900
Although, if nothing else,

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,860
won't the government please think of the pandas?!

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,110
So what do you think?

103
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,110
And where would you travel

104
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,560
for your next lung cleansing vacation?
